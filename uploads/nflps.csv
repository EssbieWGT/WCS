If Jennings is not activated from IR, then the Patriots could elevate Johnson from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against the Texans.","FOXBORO — Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez was present for the start of Wednesday’s practice in a non-contact jersey and participated in initial drills, indicating he is already in the fourth phase of the NFL’s five-phase concussion protocol.

Gonzalez was officially listed as limited in Wednesday’s injury report.

With two practices and four days left before Sunday’s divisional-round playoff game against Houston, Gonzalez needs only to be cleared for full practice participation before he can then be cleared for game action. Gonzalez was diagnosed with a concussion in the second half of last Sunday’s Wild Card playoff win over the Chargers.

His return would significantly boost a Patriots defense preparing for a Texans offense that may be without No. 1 receiver Nico Collins, who sustained his own concussion last Monday versus Pittsburgh.

Defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga returned to practice in a limited capacity for the first time since hurting his foot at Baltimore on Dec. 21. He returned next to injured backup running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), whose 21-day window has been opened for a potential activation off injured reserve later this year. Jennings also donned a non-contact jersey and was listed as limited.

Relatedly, the Pats released running back D’Ernest Johnson from their active roster earlier this week and re-signed him to the practice squad.

Patriots right tackle Morgan Moses, tight end Hunter Henry, outside linebacker Anfernee Jennings and backup offensive lineman Thayer Munford Jr. were all absent for the start of practice. Moses (knee) and Munford (knee) did not participate in practice. Henry (knee) and Jennings (knee) arrived at practice late and were listed as limited. Outside linebacker Harold Landry (knee) was also limited in Wednesday’s session.

Gonzalez was named to his first Pro Bowl this season after being named a second-team All-Pro last year. He missed the first three weeks of the season with a hamstring injury but has started every game since, registering 69 tackles, 10 pass breakups and one tackle for loss.

Playing opposite fellow starting cornerback Carlton Davis, Gonzalez allowed 35 catches on 80 targets for 357 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions this season, including Sunday’s wild-card round win over the Chargers.

Gonzalez was one of the Patriots’ best players in that game, holding Chargers receivers catchless on four targets with two pass breakups. It was the second consecutive game and the third this season that Gonzalez did not allow a reception.

“Gonzo continues to play at a high level,” head coach Mike Vrabel said Monday. “Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him. … We appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. It’s not quite as easy as — we’ve been through this, but different coverages, locations, motions and things like that. So, he’s handled that all really well. Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

Gonzalez, Davis and Marcus Jones, who primarily plays in the slot, are the Patriots’ starting cornerbacks. The team also has Charles Woods and Kobee Minor to serve as depth on the 53-man roster. Alex Austin, who continued to practice Wednesday, is eligible to be activated from injured reserve. Miles Battle also provides depth on the practice squad.

If Gonzalez were to shadow anyone on the Texans in coverage, it would be Collins, who wasn’t spotted at the beginning of Wednesday’s practice. The Texans are deep at wide receiver with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel and veterans Christian Kirk and Xavier Hutchinson ready to take on bigger roles. Collins is clearly the Texans’ best pass catcher, however, with three consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons.

The Patriots have an open spot on their 53-man roster, which could be filled by Terrell Jennings or Austin. The team has just two running backs on their 53-man roster, after releasing Johnson, in Rhamondre Stevenson and rookie TreVeyon Henderson. They’ve gone into every game this season with three active running backs. If Jennings is not activated from IR, then the Patriots could elevate Johnson from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against the Texans.

The Patriots can elevate up to two players from the practice squad. They can elevate players in the playoffs an unlimited number of times.

They elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and wide receiver Jeremiah Webb last week. Webb wound up being inactive, however, since Kayshon Boutte, who was questionable with a hamstring injury, suited up and played. The Patriots might not need Taylor this week if Tonga returns to action. Taylor has been effective, however, so the team could still elect to elevate him and play him over rookie Eric Gregory.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsnl43.jpg?w=1024&h=764,N,,2026-01-15 13:02:11.462748

Kirk's career-high 144 receiving yards helped fuel the Texans' 30-6 win and set a franchise postseason record, eclipsing Collins' mark from last year's wild-card win over the Los Angeles Chargers.

""I was really happy for Christian knowing the type of guy that he is,"" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. ""He's one of the best guys in our locker room and he works extremely hard throughout the week. He's been grinding all season to be an impact player for us. I'm happy it worked out for him in one of our biggest games of the year.""

Quarterback C.J. Stroud leaned on Kirk as he grinded through an uncharacteristic night in which he threw an interception and lost two fumbles. The three turnovers were his most in a game since his rookie season.

But Stroud and Kirk were still able to execute on pivotal third downs, with the Pro Bowl quarterback targeting Kirk nine times for 126 yards and a touchdown. Kirk especially came up big after Collins and Justin Watson entered the concussion protocol and were ruled out in the second half.

""I think he's one of the best in the league,"" Stroud said of Kirk. ""We've tried to find ways to get him the ball. ... I told him it's not easy being in the year he's in [and] not having the production, stats-wise. For him to keep going week in and week out, prepping the right way, to see it pay oﬀ was really dope. Super proud of him.""

The regular season was up and down for Kirk, whom Houston traded a 2025 seventh-round pick to acquire from the Jacksonville Jaguars in the offseason. Kirk, in his eighth year, finished with a career-low 239 receiving yards in the regular season, where he missed four games with hamstring injuries. His 64 receiving yards in Week 5 against the Baltimore Ravens was his high in the regular season.

As for Collins' availability for Sunday's divisional round game against the New England Patriots on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC), Ryans said, ""We'll see how the week goes."" The Pro Bowl wideout didn't practice Wednesday, and the last time he suffered a concussion -- in Week 7 against the Seattle Seahawks -- he didn't play the following week.

""We're one unit, and any of us at any moment can step up and be able to fill the void, and make plays when they are needed,"" Kirk said. ""My number was called, and I'm glad I was able to step up in those moments.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0114%2Fr1600626_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 12:02:30.499015

Just over three months after he suffered a devastating ankle injury, linebacker Fred Warner returned to practice on Tuesday. And, shockingly, he is not ruling out availability for Saturday's divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks.

Such a speedy recovery is a remarkable feat for Warner, who was initially deemed out for the season when he broke and dislocated his ankle in Week 6 against the Bucs. Warner underwent surgery after teammate Ji'Ayir Brown rolled up on his leg and twisted his ankle at an awkward angle.

""We're taking it day by day,"" Warner said Wednesday when asked if he anticipated playing this weekend. ""I think they said last week they weren't going to open my [practice] window, and then my window is now open. So we're just taking it day by day.""

Warner was part of the wave of injuries that devastated the 49ers early in the year. Defensive end Nick Bosa was lost for the season due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3, and key contributors including quarterback Brock Purdy and Ricky Pearsall also missed time. Star tight end George Kittle saw his campaign come to a close in the Wild Card round when he tore an Achilles tendon.

Despite the poor injury luck, San Francisco stands just two wins away from the Super Bowl.

If Warner returns to the lineup this weekend, he would bolster a defense that seems to be rounding back into prime form. The 49ers surrendered a modest 19 points to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round and gave up just 13 points to the Seahawks in the season finale. But things have not always been so bright in Warner's absence.

""I feel amazing,"" Warner said. ""Just so grateful, blessed to be back. I think, obviously, when all this happened, I didn't really think about the possibility of returning in-season. But the way things progressed and being able to have this opportunity to be back with my teammates, have a chance at helping them win this week and so on and so forth, that's my only goal moving forward.""

While the injury dashed his chances of securing first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth consecutive year and fifth time in six seasons, Warner has a chance to rewrite an otherwise lost season. He is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and would contribute immense amounts of leadership and playmaking ability to the middle of the defense if he suits up before the postseason run is over.

""Fred's the ultimate energy-giver, so just having him out there is awesome,"" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. ""Yesterday was a little bit more tempo down, but today obviously with higher tempo it'll be fun to get him out there, see him running around.""

Warner had not missed a game in his career prior to the injury.

FOXBOROUGH — Patriots star cornerback Christian Gonzalez is on the right track as he navigates through the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Despite suffering a concussion during last Sunday’s victory over the Chargers in the wild-card round of the playoffs, the defensive back was back on the practice field Wednesday as the Patriots prepared for Sunday’s divisional-round bout against the Texans at Gillette Stadium.

According to New England’s injury report, Gonzalez was a limited participant during Wednesday’s practice, meaning that he’s officially reached Stage 4 of the league’s five-step “return to participation” protocol.

The final step is “full football activity,” meaning that Gonzalez still has a few more practices to be cleared for full contact and get the green light to play on Sunday against Houston.

A healthy Gonzalez would be a welcome sight for a Patriots defense that dominated earlier this week against the Chargers. According to Next Gen Stats, Gonzalez did not allow any catches on five targets within 26 coverage snaps in that win over Los Angeles.

Speaking on Monday, Mike Vrabel did not lay out an official timeline for Gonzalez’s availability.

“Gonzo continues to play at a high level,” Vrabel said. “Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him, and yeah, I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don’t know, but when you don’t return to the game, when they won’t let you go back in the game, that would put him in the protocol.

“So, wherever that goes, that goes, but we appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. It’s not quite as easy as — we’ve been through this, but different coverages, locations, motions, and things like that. So, he’s handled that all really well. Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

If cleared for Sunday, Gonzalez would likely be matched up against Houston’s top wide receiver, be it Nico Collins (whose status could be in doubt after suffering a concussion on Monday vs. Pittsburgh), Christian Kirk, or rookies Jayden Higgins or Jaylin Noel.

In his third season in the NFL, Gonzalez has allowed 35 catches on 80 targets for 357 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions.

New England Patriots: Pass protection Like the 49ers and Bears, the Patriots’ defense does not create a ton of pressure on defense.
Late in the season, New England discovered their run game.","Buffalo Bills: Run defense

Defending the run has long been a sore spot for the Bills – they finished the season 25th in defensive rush success rate. Inside, they lack mass, and are too easily pushed around by teams committed to a smashmouth approach. Outside, they struggle with discipline and technique. Against Jacksonville last weekend, both fell apart. The Jaguars rushed for 154 yards, with 119 of those yards coming on outside runs. It was the Jags’ highest total on outside runs this season. This weekend, against a Broncos offense that is happy to punch anyone in the mouth, that could put the Bills in a lot of trouble.

But Sean McDermott is a defensive mastermind. And his answer to the run game woes has been, effectively, to give up. McDermott has stopped trying to load the box or reinforce the front. He is happy, it seems, to concede steady yards on the ground if the Bills do not cough up an explosive run (10-plus yards). And by not adding extra bodies to the box, he’s been able to maintain schematic flexibility in the secondary. McDermott has now centered his defense around disguises on the back-end secondary, betting that, eventually, opposing offenses will want to throw the ball even on run-obvious downs. Blurring the coverage, without superstar talent, is the best way for a coach to induce mistakes.

McDermott put on a clinic against the Jaguars, baiting Trevor Lawrence into errant throws that forced Jacksonville off the field. Sticking with that plan moving forward is the Bills’ best way out of the mess.

Chicago Bears: Creating pressure

The Bears are living a charmed life on offense. They have a water-tight scheme. They hammer people with the run. And with Caleb Williams, they have a quarterback capable of creating something out of nothing.

Defensively, however, they are more limited. They have lived on turnovers this season, leading the league in takeaways. In the playoffs, that doesn’t cut it. You’re facing the best of the best – and they’re the best precisely because they don’t turn the ball over. All season long, Chicago have worked around their lack of a pass rush. They finished last in the league in the regular season in pressure rate with a four-man rush (a necessity in the playoffs) and in time to pressure from those four-man looks. Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, a true warlock of a coach, has counteracted that by going hog-wild with blitzes. He has pressured creatively and relentlessly. But coaching can only cover up so much. Even the Bears’ blitz package has been ineffective, generating pressure at the lowest rate among the remaining playoff field.

Some coaches blitz selectively, and that’s key in the playoffs when the best quarterbacks can pick apart defenses that send extra rushers. No quarterback has been as potent against the blitz this year as the Rams Matthew Stafford, who the Bears faces this weekend. Allen hasn’t been able to be selective. He needs to fire extra bodies into the line of scrimmage to make the quarterback uncomfortable. Against the Rams, he’ll likely roll the dice again, hoping that enough pressure gets home that Stafford panics or is moved off his spot, where he is less effective. From there, the Bears will have a chance to snag the turnovers that have kept their head above water all season. It will be a gamble, but it’s Allen’s only path forward.

Denver Broncos: Bo Nix

Nix is the great unanswered question of the playoffs. Is he a needle mover at quarterback? Or is he surviving in a solid scheme, supported by an outstanding defense?

Everything else is in place for the Broncos. They have the best offensive line in the postseason, the top pass-rush and a future Hall of Fame coach. They also have enough firepower at wide receiver to go toe-to-toe with anyone in the AFC, from the reliable Courtland Sutton to the explosive threats of Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant and Marvin Mims. Even with that cast, at some point Nix will need to make big throws on third-and-long.

Nix has already debunked many ideas about his game. He isn’t a game manager; he takes risks down the field. He isn’t a point guard; he can scramble around and extend plays. According to PFF, he ranked behind only Stafford and Dak Prescott in big-time throws this season. Where Nix has struggled is taking the easy openings and moving on with the game. But he has been able to offset some poor decision-making by avoiding sacks and turnovers. The Broncos won’t ask him to be anything else during the playoffs. And if he can hit those difficult third-and-longs, he could put together the kind of playoff hot streak we’ve seen from Joe Flacco and Nick Foles.

Houston Texans: Passing game

The Texans’ performance against the Steelers on Monday was an outlier. They were able to run the ball and sustain a long drive. For much of the season, they’ve been reliant on a brittle passing game and the odd explosive play to launch them down the field. Even when in scoring position, their performance in the redzone has been brutal.

It was Houston’s defense that kept them alive against Pittsburgh. Without a dominant performance, it would have been a game characterized by CJ Stroud’s unusual mid-game meltdown. The Texans cannot afford a repeat performance from their quarterback. Given the lack of talent along the offensive line, they’re unlikely to repeat their success on the ground. It will need to be Stroud who puts them over the top. He has the talent – and he’s done it in the postseason before. The problem, however, is that the passing game has been inconsistent. The Texans have to work hard for their yards. There are few easy buckets. It’s a system reliant on receivers making tough, contested catches or Stroud creating out of structure. That’s a thin tightrope to walk, especially when the team’s No 1 receiver, Nico Collins, is out with a concussion.

Los Angeles Rams: Special teams

The Rams having a punt blocked against the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs was no anomaly. They’ve had a special teams blunder in three of their five losses this season.

It’s not just a season-long issue, either. It’s institutional. Over the last five years, the Rams rank 32nd in special teams EPA, and there is a chasm between the Rams and the second-worst team over that spell. In successive postseasons, they’ve flirted with disaster, only to be bailed out by their offense and defense. This year’s errors led Sean McVay to a first: firing a coach during the season. But the change in coordinator hasn’t had the desired effect. The Rams have become more effective at limiting kick returns, which has helped their starting field position on defense. But they remain just as prone to bone-headed lapses when they’re kicking the ball themselves.

As they move into the final eight, there is no margin for error. The Rams have all the ingredients of a championship team: they can win in any way on offense, their defense creates havoc in the pocket and they have the quarterback. But they have ignored the third phase of the game for too long. So far, they’ve been able to outrun it. But if they fall apart between now and the Super Bowl, it will probably come down to another untimely kicking mistake.

New England Patriots: Pass protection

Like the 49ers and Bears, the Patriots’ defense does not create a ton of pressure on defense. But they do have a pair of one-on-one winners – Milton Williams and Harold Landry – who could flip a game on their own. The concern is with their own protection.

Late in the season, New England discovered their run game. After struggling for much of the year to move the ball on the ground, the Patriots have a 46% rushing success rate since week 12. That’s helped support a bombs away passing attack that has been the bedrock of the league’s leading offense. But even with the return of first-round left tackle Will Campbell, they allow too much pressure on quarterback Drake Maye. They finished the regular season with a 38.7% pressure rate conceded, which puts them 28th in the league. And the Patriots don’t just concede pressure; they give it up quickly and often unblocked. It makes what Maye has done this season more of a minor miracle.

Maye, for all his brilliance, is prone to taking drive-killing sacks. But against the Texans this weekend, the Pats line could be in big trouble. They struggle with power-based pass-rushers, and Houston have the best duo in the league: Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Squeak past the Texans, and the Broncos could be on deck, a team who pressure and sack quarterbacks at the highest rate in the league.

The Patriots need to be able to run the ball to mitigate the risk, and then hope Maye can deliver some flashes of brilliance under duress.

San Francisco 49ers: Pass rush

Robert Saleh deserves credit for dragging the Niners’ defense this far. He has been able to keep a no-name defense competitive throughout the year, despite a battery of injuries and a lack of a pass-rush.

Against the Eagles on Sunday, Saleh loaded the box to stop the run and dared Jalen Hurts and Philly to throw. Against a high-school caliber offense, it was effective. Against tougher opposition, though, it will be tough to make up for.

Saleh, for all his brilliance, runs a fairly simple scheme. He doesn’t disguise coverages. The Niners led the league this season in their use of zone coverage, and those coverages fall into just three buckets. He’s not a blitzer, either, relying on four players to detonate the pocket and attack opposing quarterbacks. It’s difficult to navigate through the playoffs with such a static, predictable scheme without unrelenting pressure. Across the season, the Niners finished with a 22% pressure rate with a four-man pass-rush, 31st in the league and almost half the typical threshold for Super Bowl winners. Against the Eagles’ offense, with all its faults, that figure fell to 11%. That won’t cut it against the Rams, Seahawks or whoever comes out of the AFC, unless Saleh has a late-season curveball he can throw.

Seattle Seahawks: Sam Darnold

Darnold put together a magical first half of the season. He was a front-runner for MVP, driving the ball to all areas of the field, creating plays with his legs and adding newfound refinement to his game. He was hitting difficult, tight-window throws deep down the field at a historic clip. But much of that has dried up in the second half of the year. As Seattle’s defense has risen to match the league’s best and the team’s run-game has come alive, Darnold’s game has soured – at least by his early-season standards.

Since Week 11, Darnold ranks 22nd in the league among eligible starters in the RBSDM composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for the value. That’s the lowest of any remaining quarterback in the playoffs. His turnovers are up, and the deep ball has withered.

The rest of Seattle’s roster is good enough to cover up for Darnold. Facing the Niners in the divisional round could also prove to be a get-right game, given San Francisco’s defensive frailties. But Darnold has never been to the final eight before, and the Seahawks offense isn’t playing with great rhythm. No single player serves as a bigger pivot point of the postseason. If Darnold limits turnovers, the Seahawks are the front-runners. If he can tap back into his early-season form, they will be the runaway favorites. But if he has a repeat performance of last season’s playoff outing for Minnesota, the Seahawks will be heading home early.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4b40d9d21ab5933de69c9b01deffdff3c1596a/266_0_2645_2117/master/2645.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e6dfd7962e6489b745fb332dde50d21",N,,2026-01-15 11:04:45.935300

Wideout Jordyn Tyson has the chance to end that five-year drought.

Tyson made a name for himself during the 2024 season with 75 receptions for 1,101 yards and 10 touchdowns to help the Sun Devils reach the Big 12 Championship and College Football Playoff before missing the postseason due to a collarbone injury.

He returned for his redshirt junior campaign, where he recorded 628 yards and eight touchdowns on 57 catches over the first seven games before a nagging hamstring issue caused him to sit out three of the team’s five final contests.

The two-time First Team All-Big 12 wideout declared for the draft on Dec. 10, and is projected as one of the top receiver prospects available.

Although he enters a stacked class featuring USC’s Makai Lemon and Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Tyson’s explosiveness and play-making ability have draft experts roundly expecting him to go early in the first round.

Here’s where a collection of mock drafts have Tyson landing on April 23 now that the 2025 NFL regular season has concluded.

Where is ASU’s Jordyn Tyson being taken in 2026 NFL Draft mocks?

Pro Football Focus

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

The Browns have the second-worst team receiving grade in the NFL this season and didn’t have a single wide receiver place higher than 100th in PFF grade. Tyson would immediately become the top weapon for whoever’s playing quarterback for Cleveland and has an 89.5 PFF receiving grade over the last two seasons.

CBS Sports

No. 24 overall, Cleveland Browns

Tyson is an explosive receiver with the size, speed and catch radius to win at all three levels. A smooth hands-catcher, he consistently makes contested and high-point grabs look effortless while creating surprising separation at the top of his routes for his size. Tyson can hit top-end speed in just a few steps and shows the type of short-area quickness reserved for smaller, shiftier WRs. He’s also an asset in the screen game, making him a dynamic threat both outside and from the slot.

The Athletic

No. 7 overall, Washington Commanders

When healthy, Tyson is the most complete receiver in this class. The only holes in his game are on his career injury report. He blocks, adjusts to poor throws, runs crisp routes and wins in the air. He’s everything Jayden Daniels needs to take the next step in his development.

Bleacher Report

No. 11 overall, Miami Dolphins

The Miami Dolphins offense underwent a massive evolution since Mike McDaniel became the head coach, but it still needs another significant threat at wide receiver.

…

Whoever takes over will need another weapon on the outside to complement Jaylen Waddle, with Tyreek Hill likely on his way out as well. Jordyn Tyson adds a different dynamic.

ESPN

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

Unless they want to package their two-first round picks to move up, the Browns won’t be able to pick a quarterback. But they do need pass catchers to join breakout rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and veteran wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. Tyson is a creative route runner who can make catches outside the strike zone with his strong hands at the catch point. He’s also capable of making big plays after the catch.

Yahoo! Sports

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

The future is bright, but Seahawks need to capitalize now

Cross’ knee injury calls into question his status for Saturday night’s NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to Wednesday’s practice report, he appeared on track to make his first start since Week 15.

If Cross’ availability is in question, that could be a major problem for Seattle. Backup offensive tackle Josh Jones, who started the past three games at left tackle in place of Cross, hasn’t practiced this week due to a knee injury.

Meanwhile, cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) was limited for a second straight day and linebacker Ernest Jones IV (illness) sat out practice Wednesday.

On a more positive note, five-time Pro Bowl defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (Achilles) was upgraded to a full participant on Wednesday after being limited on Tuesday. Head coach Mike Macdonald said earlier Wednesday afternoon that he expects Lawrence to play on Saturday night.

Safety Coby Bryant (knee) and rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee), who are both returning from injuries, were full participants for a second straight day.

In addition, backup linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) was upgraded to a limited participant on Wednesday. Key special teams player Chazz Surratt (ankle), who spent the past six weeks on injured reserve, was upgraded to a full participant.

""Feeling great man,"" Dotson said Wednesday.
""It's one of those things that's day-by-day, but it's feeling great every day.
His physicality, his ability to go out there and play is great, but also just the energy he brings.
""Even the last game really, it was like, it hurt me to not be out there with my guys,"" Dotson said.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. – Rams offensive lineman Kevin Dotson was estimated as a limited participant in Wednesday's practice, marking his first step toward a possible, but anticipated, return from his ankle injury this Sunday against the Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs.

""Feeling great man,"" Dotson said Wednesday. ""It's one of those things that's day-by-day, but it's feeling great every day. It's feeling way, way better compared to what it was at the beginning, so I'm ready to try it out at least.""

Given Los Angeles only conducted a walkthrough Wednesday afternoon, head coach Sean McVay said Thursday's practice will give the team a real gauge of how Dotson's ankle is feeling, ""but he's got a good look in his eye"" and that ""his intentions are to be able to go play and go do his thing"" on Sunday.

""We take it day-to-day, and we have a lot of tests that we have to go through first before we can truly assess it,"" Dotson said.

Dotson has been sidelined by that ankle injury since Week 17, sustaining it the prior week in the Rams' Thursday Night Football loss to the Seahawks in Seattle. Dotson said he felt like he was initially hurt from getting run into, and wasn't aware he had been stepped on by Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall until two days later. Hall's actions drew a one-game suspension without pay from the NFL.

""Because I gave him the benefit of the doubt,"" Dotson said. ""Because my teammates were like – I'm thinking he accidentally stepped on me, and I'm not going to make nothing out of it. And then I'd seen after the play, my dawg (center) Coleman (Shelton) fought for me, pushed for me, then he told me like what really happened and stuff like that. So I was like, okay, and if I would have knew that, I probably would have stood up. I didn't know somebody stepped on me and did all that until I had seen the film and stuff. But I would've knew that. ... I'm past it, I'm not going to hold nothing against him until I can see him (and) get my get-back. Not gonna step on nobody (though), I'll get it between the plays. But I'm fine, I'm fine.""

If the rest of the week goes according to plan and brings McVay's optimism to fruition, Dotson's return would give back to the Rams offensive line the guard with the third-highest run blocking grade in the 2025 regular season (89.3), according to Pro Football Focus. His 86.4 offensive grade also ranked third overall among qualified guards by PFF.

""I mean, he's a mountain of a man,"" quarterback Matthew Stafford said. ""He's a beast. When he was playing this year, I thought he was one of the best guards, if not the best guard in the league. So if we can get him back, obviously that would be a huge boost. His physicality, his ability to go out there and play is great, but also just the energy he brings. I know if you guys see him celebrating sometimes when we do good stuff. So he's a great guy to have out there and be around. But if not, I thought (Justin) Dedich played really well last week, and we'll roll with him again.""

Dotson will do everything in his power to be on the field Sunday.

""Even the last game really, it was like, it hurt me to not be out there with my guys,"" Dotson said. ""Even just to get our get back, I want to be there for that, and couldn't be there for it. So hopefully I can be here for this game, and I want to be able to make an impact.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/rams/yhbn1qwagauhdjn6bh5t,N,,2026-01-15 02:58:50.059363

The Bears also announced that linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga and defensive lineman Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who also missed the Packers game with concussions, would also have been full participants Wednesday.

Wide receivers DJ Moore (knee) and Rome Odunze (foot) were classified as limited on the hypothetical report, as was linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin, who’s dealing with a back issue.

The only Bears player who would not have practiced on Wednesday was defensive back Nick McCloud, who’s dealing with a groin injury.

Offensive lineman Braxton Jones, who was activated from injured reserve by the Bears on Tuesday, would have been a full participant in the workout.

The Bears will release their final injury report of the week on Friday, giving updates on which players will be available for the NFC Divisional Round showdown.

(WKRC, Provided, Covington PD)

The crash happened around 3 a.m. on November 15 in the 400 block of Scott Street in Covington. Video from a neighborhood security camera that Covington police provided to Local 12 News shows a vehicle running a red light at an intersection and slamming into a parked car. The impact caused a black Jeep to flip over, landing on its roof just out of the camera’s frame.

Police records show the Jeep involved in the crash is registered to Taylor-Britt.

The following day, November 16, Taylor-Britt played in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, during which he suffered an injury that ended his season.

According to the official crash report, Taylor-Britt is listed as the backseat passenger. Covington police say no one was arrested or charged in connection with the crash.

However, body camera video obtained by Local 12 shows confusion at the scene, with officers and those involved going back and forth over who was actually behind the wheel. Police say Taylor-Britt and others left the scene before officers could determine responsibility.

The black Jeep had crossed over the Roebling Bridge and into Kentucky moments before it slammed into a red Chevy Cruze parked on Scott Street.

The first officers at the scene encountered two vehicles badly mangled after the collision, but no one was inside or around them. One officer can be heard on body camera saying, “No one is in there, no one is in there they all fled, I guess.”

A short time later, a man walks up to officers and identifies himself as Jafabian Booker, saying he is Cam Taylor-Britt’s brother. During an exchange captured on police body camera, Booker tells an officer the vehicle belongs to Taylor-Britt and claims a woman was driving at the time of the crash.

“This is my brother’s car,” Booker says in the video. When an officer asks where Taylor-Britt is, Booker responds, “He wasn’t in here. I had a female in here. She was drunk driving and this happened.” When the officer asks where she went, Booker replies, “She ran off.”

Officers walk around looking at the aftermath, and body camera video captures their remarks.

“I smell weed reeks of weed.” “Girl supposed to be 5’4 driving the car with the seat all the way back — ain’t no way. Football player was driving, yeah he was driving.”

Police tracked Taylor-Britt to his home, where officers found him outside, mid-conversation on his phone. This is his exchange with an officer.

“It is what it is.” Taylor-Britt then offers to go back to the scene. “I can go back there, but there ain’t nothing to it. I wasn’t driving.”

The officer asks, “Who was driving?”

Taylor-Britt says, “He’s there. He’s there, he’s there right now.”

The officer responds, “No one was there. What was the name of the guy that was driving?”

Taylor-Britt says, “Jafabian (Booker).”

Covington police then redact the body camera footage, allowing only the audio to be heard. The exchange stretches on for nearly 20 minutes, involving Taylor-Britt, officers at the scene, and his brother, Jafabian Booker, who is on the phone.

OFFICER – Sir, were you the one who was driving the car?

BOOKER – No, sir. No, sir. I already gave the description to the other officer of the woman that it was. I was letting her drive.

TAYLOR-BRITT – So Fabian

BOOKER – Yeah.

TAYLOR-BRITT – Keep it gangster, brother, ’cause now it sounds like we got a bunch of what do you call it going on.

Around one minute later, one officer tells another, “Jafabian is saying he’s driving now.”

The police report states that Jafabian Booker initially denied driving but later admitted he was behind the wheel. The report lists the date and time as 11/15 at 3:21 a.m.

In another exchange that was also audio-only, an officer is heard asking Taylor-Britt about his injuries. In the video, his white shirt appears torn at the left shoulder, with what looks like blood visible.

OFFICER – You hurt or anything, man? You look like you got a little blood on you.

TAYLOR-BRITT – No, nah. I’m good.

OFFICER – You aren’t hurt?

TAYLOR-BRITT – Nah, I’m good. I’m really pissed off.

The next day, November 16, Cam Taylor-Britt took the field against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He suffered a foot injury during the game that ended his season.

On January 6, Taylor-Britt appeared in court using crutches while still recovering from that injury and faced a Hamilton County judge.

The 26-year-old pleaded guilty to reckless driving and driving with a restricted license. Cincinnati police cited him twice in 2025 — once in June and again in September.

In court, Taylor-Britt’s attorney told the judge he has no intention of driving anytime soon and said he has relied on others for transportation for several months.

A police officer described the reckless driving incident in detail: “There’s lots of traffic. Lots of pedestrians. Mr. Britt went over the yellow lines, did a burnout, and drove on the wrong side of the road at a high rate of speed up Joe Nuxhall Way.”

Taylor-Britt apologized to the court, acknowledging the seriousness of his actions.

“I just want to apologize for my actions. I plan already to knock out those things that got me into this place, because it is not me, and I don’t want to be here,” Taylor-Britt said.

Judge Bernie Bouchard questioned Taylor-Britt about the danger posed by his actions.

“You’re putting yourself and everybody else in danger on the street. Why?” the judge asked. “No reason at all,” Britt replied.

He was then taken to the Hamilton County Jail to serve his five-day sentence.

One of the charges he just went to jail for was driving under a suspended license. When Covington police asked to see a license after this November accident, Taylor-Britt said he would have to talk to his attorney because at the time he did not have one.

When asked why so much of the body camera video was redacted, Captain Justin Bradbury said, “The entire screen was blacked out on those videos because they were recorded at Mr. Taylor-Britt’s home address. Given his prominence, we felt it necessary to redact the video of the interaction. No matter where the officers turned their camera, it either picked up his numerical address on the building or showed the surrounding area, making it easy for his address to be identified. This was done solely to protect Mr. Taylor-Britt’s privacy.”

Captain Bradbury added, “This case was not turned over to any prosecutor’s office because no one committed a crime.”

Local 12 also reached out to Taylor-Britt’s attorney, Joseph Tekulve, for comment and did not receive a response.",https://local12.com/resources/media2/16x9/830/1320/8x0/90/7cd8e5dd-daee-4cde-9af8-2298c8264c3e-GMCCAMTAYLORBRITTcrash.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 02:59:03.751274

Gonzalez suffered a head injury in the Patriots' wild-card playoff game against the Los Angeles Chargers. He was targeted in coverage on Chargers' wide receiver Quentin Johnston, who ended up falling on Gonzalez's head during the play.

At first glance, the blow didn't appear all that significant, but an eye test never tells the full story when it comes to head injuries. Gonzalez was ultimately pulled from the game early and never returned, as the Patriots went on to knock off the Chargers in a 16-3 victory.

The fact that Gonzalez is returning to practice this early is a great sign for his chances of playing in Sunday's divisional matchup against the Houston Texans. His presence in the defensive backfield is game-changing for the team. He was targeted five times by the Chargers and didn't allow a single reception.

Offensive tackles Morgan Moses and Thayer Munford Jr. stayed sidelined during Wednesday’s preparations for the Houston Texans due to knee ailments. But there were returnees in Foxborough.

Running back Terrell Jennings, nose tackle Khyiris Tonga, cornerback Christian Gonzalez were all back on hand in a partial capacity for the No. 2 seed.

Here’s the first injury report leading up to Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

Moses stayed in for all 64 offensive snaps during Sunday’s 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. The starting right tackle went into the wild card at Gillette Stadium without a game designation after missing the first practice of the playoffs because of an illness. But a knee injury did see Munford finish last week as a non-participant for consecutive sessions on the way to being listed as questionable. The latter has served an extension of the offensive line since circling back to the organization as a member of the 53-man roster in November.

On the other side of the divisional round, a team captain and back-to-back Pro Bowl wide receiver was among the sidelined for the No. 5 seed. Collins had been carted to the locker room after suffering a concussion on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He finished with north of 1,000 receiving yards for the third regular season in a row.

Wednesday saw Tonga practice for the first time since sustaining a foot injury that resulted in three games missed. The limited participants in Foxborough also included a pair working through the NFL’s concussion protocol.

In the secondary, Gonzalez was present in a red non-contact jersey after being ruled out late last weekend. And in the backfield, so was Jennings as his 21-day window to be activated from injured reserve officially opened. The 2024 undrafted arrival out of Florida A&M had not practiced since the calendar turned to December.

After spending the past two weeks as a limited participant, Austin graduated to full participation for the Patriots on Wednesday. The corner returned to practice on New Year’s Eve and still awaits a return to the 53-man roster following a wrist procedure.

A trio also went in full for the Texans.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2255814332.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C4.9793839856932%2C100%2C78.523935767461&w=1200,N,,2026-01-14 19:59:26.825838

""But still the way this team fought and battled and made it as far as it did, with completely unforeseen things like that, I love this team,"" Slater added.
""Not being out there was really tough and there's a fire to be back out there,"" Alt added.
And the return of Slater and Alt could do wonders as the Bolts look for more success in Year 3 under Jim Harbaugh.
""Just try to make a game out of it because it's tough being out,"" Alt added.","Each player missed a significant amount of the 2025 season, with Slater not playing a single snap since he sustained a torn patellar tendon during an August 3 practice.

The 26-year-old, who signed a multi-year contract extension less than two weeks before the injury, gave an update Monday on his recovery process.

""It's been tough. Feel good, the rehab's been going very well. Just doing everything I can to make sure that I'm 100 percent next year,"" Slater said. ""Obviously, a huge disappointment not being able to contribute this year. Just controlling what I can control and get ready for next year.""

Slater noted that he's gotten positive reports during his rehab, which he said is a nine-to-12 month process.

""It's been smooth. All reports have been that it's been going extremely well. I'd say ahead of schedule pretty much the whole time, but just chipping away at it. It's a long rehab, but everything's going smooth,"" Slater said.

He was later asked about being ready for training camp.

""Just the way things have been going and the way I'm working at it, I have full intent obviously to do that,"" Slater said. ""But of course, everything's going to prioritize just making sure it's 100 percent first. But that's definitely the goal and the plan.""

Alt, meanwhile, suffered an ankle injury in Week 4 against the Giants but returned in Week 9 against the Vikings. His presence lasted only two games as he further injured the ankle in Week 9.

The second injury knocked him out for the remainder of the 2025 season.

""It was pretty much what you guys saw. I [messed] my ankle up pretty good in all facets. It was a tough blow but we bounced back,"" Alt said.

He later added: ""It was everything you could do to an ankle … I did it, pretty much.""

Alt was superb in the six games he started, ranking sixth among all tackles with a pass-blocking grade of 82.3. The Chargers went 5-1 in games where Alt started, with the lone loss coming in Week 4 when he was injured after playing just 10 snaps.

Those six stellar games were enough to earn him his first Pro Bowl nod.

""Extremely grateful,"" Alt said. ""Thankful to everyone who voted for me. It was definitely a surprise at the time … for me it's just gratitude and wanting to get healthy.""

Alt said his rehab ""has been going really well"" and that he is confident it won't affect his offseason training.

""Every day has been getting better and better. Out of the boot now, so close to where I want to be,"" Alt said.

The hope, of course, is that Alt and Slater both return to full strength and bookend a Chargers offensive line that will look for more consistency in 2026.

Slater said Monday that he already has high expectations for the unit.

""We've got a good group, you know? We do. We really do,"" Slater said. ""Me and [Joe] going down, it hurt.

""But still the way this team fought and battled and made it as far as it did, with completely unforeseen things like that, I love this team,"" Slater added. ""We've got a team full of warriors, a team full of competitors. I'm excited. I'm very excited.""

Alt also echoed that sentiment in the locker room, saying there's already a fire burning inside him to help the Chargers offense next season.

""I'm guessing he does. And I know I do,"" Alt said. ""You want to be on the field. That's my favorite part of this.

""Not being out there was really tough and there's a fire to be back out there,"" Alt added.

The Chargers will have a new offensive coordinator next season.

But the nucleus of the offense, led by Pro Bowl quarterback Justin Herbert, remains on the roster.

First-round running back Omarion Hampton showed plenty of promise as a rookie before an ankle injury set him back while fellow rookies Tre' Harris and Oronde Gadsden each flashed a rapport with Herbert.

Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston have each flashed big-play ability early in their careers, too.

And the return of Slater and Alt could do wonders as the Bolts look for more success in Year 3 under Jim Harbaugh.

""It was obviously tough on both of us,"" Alt said. ""Being able to go through that together and have each other to lean on, we've made it our own competition in the recovery room.

""Just try to make a game out of it because it's tough being out,"" Alt added. ""Being able to battle with each other and battle back has been a lot of fun.""

Slater said: ""I love ball. This is like what I do every single day. I don't really go on vacation much. I kind of just work out all the time and think about playing football, so it wasn't fun. It wasn't easy, but I'm just excited for the future. I can't really control what happened, just doing everything I can to make sure that next year is better.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/k0wodkkyb1rcrfx7kdpj,N,,2026-01-14 21:59:35.185957

The league is coming off a wild Wild Card Weekend, where a bulk of the games came down to the final moments. That's shaping these playoffs into one of the most memorable runs to the Super Bowl in recent memory, so this upcoming divisional round has a lot to live up to.

As much as we'd like to focus solely on the games themselves and the individual matchups that'll help determine who advances and who goes home, we also have to keep an eye on injuries. For as entertaining as Wild Card Weekend was, there were several notable injuries. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the year due to a torn Achilles, while Texans receiver Nico Collins and Patriots corner Christian Gonzalez each departed their matchups with concussions.

With teams getting back onto the practice field this week to gear up for the upcoming playoff slate, we'll take the temperature of those injuries and more by dissecting the injury reports.

Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos

Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)

Bills: After conducting a walkthrough practice on Tuesday that saw Josh Allen listed as a limited participant, Buffalo's Wednesday injury report saw the quarterback improve to a full participant. Allen is listed with foot, knee and right finger injuries.

Meanwhile, three Bills players were missing on Wednesday: cornerback Maxwell Hairston (ankle), safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) and receiver Tyrell Shavers (knee). Shavers is out for the year with a torn ACL. Linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf), defensive end A.J. Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf), linebacker Matt Milano (ankle), defensive tackle Ed Oliver (biceps), defensive end Greg Rousseau (back) and linebacker Shaq Thompson (neck) were limited.

Broncos: Denver's injury report on Wednesday mirrored its initial report of the week. Linebackers Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) and Drew Sanders (ankle), along with tight end Lucas Krull (foot), were limited. Defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers was listed with a hip injury but practiced fully.

San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks

Saturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)

49ers: One of the more fascinating developments for the 49ers is the looming return of linebacker Fred Warner. He returned to practice last week as he works his way back from an ankle injury he suffered in October. San Francisco listed Warner as a limited participant for the second day in a row, so it does seem like a return this week is in play. Joining Warner as a limited participant were defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), guard Dominick Puni (ankle), defensive end Keion White (groin, hamstring), and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle). Safety Ji'Ayir Brown (hamstring) and linebacker Luke Gifford (quad) did not practice.

Seahawks: Seattle offensive tackle Charles Cross (hamstring, knee) was downgraded from a full participant on Tuesday to limited on Wednesday, so his status will be worth monitoring the rest of the week. Along with Cross, linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and corner Tariq Woolen (oblique) were limited. Linebacker Ernest Jones did not practice on Wednesday due to an illness.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots

Sunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN, ABC | Fubo, try for free)

Texans: Houston did not have standout receiver Nico Collins to begin the week of practice on Wednesday. He left Monday's win over the Steelers with a concussion.

The Texans also listed defensive end Denico Autry (knee), offensive tackle Trent Brown (ankle) and receiver Justin Watson (concussion) as nonparticipants. Linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair (knee), offensive lineman Tytus Howard (ankle), guard Ed Ingram (ankle), running back Jawhar Jordan (ankle), corner Kamari Lassiter (ankle, knee) and defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins (elbow) were limited.

Patriots: Christian Gonzalez left New England's wild card victory over the Chargers with a concussion, but the star corner was out at practice on Wednesday, albeit on a limited basis.

Along with Gonzalez, tight end Hunter Henry (knee), linebacker Anfernee Jennings (knee), running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and defensive lineman Khyiris Tonga (foot) were limited. Offensive tackles Morgan Moses (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) were held out of the week's opening session.

Then, in his sixth game as a pro, the Titans rookie edge rusher suffered a fractured leg in the team's game at Las Vegas.
It was a setback for Oladejo, who moved from an off-the-ball linebacker at UCLA to the edge position during his senior year.
""Now I have to keep growing and progress my craft and take things day by day, developing all aspects of my body, flexibility, mobility, and things of that nature.

Then, in his sixth game as a pro, the Titans rookie edge rusher suffered a fractured leg in the team's game at Las Vegas.

Oladejo was placed on Injured Reserve, and he spent the rest of the season recovering, rehabbing, and learning, while thinking about what's next.

At times, it wasn't easy.

""Just keeping my faith in God, staying prayed up, reading my Bible, staying in touch with my family,"" Oladejo said. ""And being around my teammates as well, that helped a lot.""

""(My teammates) told me to keep my head up, things happen. Everyone's journey is different, and you just have to take it day by day and not let the present get too ahead of the future.""

A second-round pick of the Titans in the 2025 NFL Draft, the 6-foot-3-inch, 259-pound Oladejo tallied 13 tackles, six quarterback pressures and two tackles for a loss in while playing in six games for the Titans. Before being injured on his 23rd snap in the team's October 12 game against the Raiders, Oladejo had already recorded three tackles, two tackles for a loss, and a quarterback hit. It was arguably his best showing during his brief rookie campaign.

It was a setback for Oladejo, who moved from an off-the-ball linebacker at UCLA to the edge position during his senior year. In his eyes, the more reps, the better.

And while Oladejo wasn't able to play another snap in 2025 after the injury, he did practice with the team the final few weeks of the year while remaining on Injured Reserve.

The year was a learning experience for Oladejo.

""I have a lot of developing to do,"" he said. ""Now I have to keep growing and progress my craft and take things day by day, developing all aspects of my body, flexibility, mobility, and things of that nature. But I know the potential is there.""

Oladejo said he plans to work on his body this offseason, whether it's doing Pilates, hot yoga, or boxing, while working on pass rush on the field in an effort to be more explosive.

He has big plans for his second NFL season.

""(I want to be) a playmaker, an impact player who makes plays, gets the ball back, and helps the team win in any situation,"" he said. ""100 percent (I feel I can do it).

They did so without the services of star receiver Nico Collins throughout most of the second half. He was injured in the win and entered the NFL's concussion protocol after landing hard on his head trying to haul in a pass from C.J. Stroud over the middle of the field.

Collins exited the wild-card game with three catches for 21 yards and a team-high seven targets at the time.

Houston will travel to Foxborough to play the Patriots in the divisional round on Sunday afternoon. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will be available as the Texans hope to upset the No. 2 seed on the road.

The Patriots stifled the Los Angeles Chargers, 16-3, and their defense would benefit if Collins can't play this week.

Here's the latest on Collins.

Nico Collins injury update

Collins remains in the NFL's concussion protocol as of Wednesday, Jan. 14. It is unclear how much time he might miss, if any.

Collins was quickly ruled out with a concussion after hitting his head on the ground in the Texans' wild-card round game in Pittsburgh on Monday night.

As of Wednesday, the team has not yet provided an update on Collins.

Collins will have two more chances to practice fully this week before the Texans likely tag him with a designation ahead of Sunday's game against the Patriots.

Collins has one fewer day to complete concussion protocol because the Texans played on Monday. He appears to be trending towards missing this weekend's game against New England.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player must complete before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom-limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football-specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia, and more, in addition to a history of concussions, other signs/symptoms, and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.

Texans WR depth chart

Here's a look at the Texans' WR depth chart:

Nico Collins (injured)

Xavier Hutchinson

Christian Kirk

Jayden Higgins

Jaylin Noel

Justin Watson

Braxton Berrios

Houston played one game this season without Collins after he suffered a concussion in Week 7; Higgins led the team with eight targets.

Higgins and Noel, two rookies from Iowa State, have seen increased opportunities in the absence of Collins and Kirk throughout their first season. Higgins is an X-type receiver (6-4, 215 pounds) like Collins on the outside, while the smaller Noel is similar to the veteran Kirk.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/14/USAT/88182618007-usatsi-27826590.jpg?crop=4875,2744,x0,y4&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-14 17:00:36.876528

Blood tests to monitor evolving brain injury in ischemic stroke could be a cost-effective and fast alternative to currently used noninvasive approaches such as MRI. Here, Vlegels et al. used a single-molecule detection assay on blood samples and found that brain-derived tau abundance was associated with the severity of brain injury in three cohorts of patients with ischemic stroke. Brain-derived tau in blood tracked the trajectory of brain injury (including treatment effects of recanalization and the neuroprotectant nerinetide) and could predict functional outcomes for up to 36 months. These findings suggest that brain-derived tau in blood could be used to monitor brain injury and treatment effects in patients with ischemic stroke. —Daniela Neuhofer

Abstract

A specific and accurate blood test for acute brain injury could help monitor infarct growth in ischemic stroke and serve as a surrogate end point in clinical trials. Using a single-molecule detection assay, we assessed plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau), a marker selectively quantifying tau protein from the central nervous system, in a prospective cohort of 502 patients with acute ischemic stroke with serial blood sampling from admission to day 7. Higher BD-tau concentrations at admission were associated with more extensive early brain injury on computed tomography and predicted larger final infarct volumes. BD-tau increases from admission to day 2 were related to infarct growth. BD-tau concentrations rose until day 7 and were higher in patients with secondary events, including recurrent stroke. After thrombectomy, the rise of BD-tau was smaller in patients with complete versus incomplete recanalization. BD-tau outperformed other blood markers and imaging metrics in predicting 90-day functional outcome across infarct size strata and time points. In an independent multicenter prospective cohort (N = 519), BD-tau showed higher performance than magnetic resonance imaging–derived final infarct volume in predicting functional outcomes at 3, 12, and 36 months. In the biomarker substudy of a phase 3 trial assessing nerinetide in patients with ischemic stroke (N = 193), BD-tau showed predictive performance comparable to the other cohorts, mediated the relationship between recanalization and functional outcome, and showed a 49% smaller increase in the nerinetide group versus placebo. Overall, plasma BD-tau tracked ischemic brain injury over time, outperformed other biomarkers in predicting functional outcomes, and identified possible treatment responses.

“Thank you for loving G and carrying some of this pain for us.” Kittle and Claire have been married since 2019.","Claire Kittle painted a heartbreaking picture of “disbelief and stillness” in the aftermath of husband George Kittle’s Achilles injury, reflecting on the harrowing moment Tuesday in an emotional Instagram post.

“Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again,” Claire began. “He always gets up. He’s George — he can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it.

“I love this man with everything I have in me. He is a unicorn in this world, and he will be back stronger and better than ever before.”

Kittle, the Niners’ beloved tight end, popped his Achilles in the first half of Sunday’s 23-19 wild-card win over the Eagles in Philadelphia.

Claire and 49ers owner Jed York headed to the locker room in the wake of the crushing injury.

When York asked Kittle if there was anything he needed, the seven-time Pro Bowler requested a bottle of tequila and was swiftly provided with a bottle of Patrón, according to reports.

Kittle, who has played his entire career with the Niners beginning in 2017, broke his silence Monday.

“Football sucks sometimes,” Kittle wrote on Instagram. “But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place.”

With a trip to Seattle on deck for the divisional round, Kittle and his forever teammate will be supporting the team as they push toward a Super Bowl berth — a game that will be played at their home Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara next month.

“The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one. He is unf–kwithable, as is this entire team,” Claire added Tuesday. “I’m proud of these guys and the rally-together grit they fight with each week. It’s a special year, you can feel that and we’re not done yet.

“Thank you for loving G and carrying some of this pain for us.”

Kittle and Claire have been married since 2019.

Wearing a red non-contact jersey, starting cornerback Christian Gonzalez was present during the short media window at the start of the session. While his participation status has yet to be determined, his presence on the practice field is itself a positive sign: it suggests that he already is in the fourth of five stages of the NFL concussion protocol.

Gonzalez, 23, left the Patriots’ victory over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday night following a pass breakup in the early fourth quarter. The Pro Bowler hit his head in the process and after staying on the field for an ensuing third down incompletion headed into the blue medical tent on the sidelines.

Shortly thereafter, Gonzalez exited for the locker room. He was initially announced as questionable to return to the game with a head injury before ultimately being ruled out late in the contest.

On Monday, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel announced that Gonzalez had been placed in the concussion protocol.

The 17th overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, Gonzalez is one of the best cornerbacks in football and a core member of the Patriots’ defense. A Pro Bowl selection this season, he started all 14 regular season games he appeared in and played 771 defensive snaps, fourth most on the team. He registered 69 tackles and broke up nine passes along the way, and was one of the best players on the field versus the Chargers.

The last time the Bills and Broncos met was at Highmark Stadium in the 2024-25 Wild Card Round.
Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""
Overcoming injuries isn't new to Buffalo, but McDermott emphasized that there's no other choice but to have the next man up mentality.
""It's a great team, No.","The Buffalo Bills advanced to the AFC Divisional Round with a win over the Jaguars on Sunday. Buffalo heads to Denver, the No. 1 seed in the AFC, for its next postseason stop. The last time the Bills and Broncos met was at Highmark Stadium in the 2024-25 Wild Card Round. Buffalo advanced, winning 31-7 in that game.

""He embodies what we're all about,"" McDermott said of Shavers. ""I believe [the injury] happened somewhere in the second quarter when we went out there to look at him, and for him to then come back into the game – and then for it to turn out to be what it was – is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""

""What we need to focus on is what's in front of us … and that's handling the things that we can handle and control,"" McDermott said. ""It's next man up. That's pretty stone cold what it is and what has to happen here for us.""

The Bills' wide receiver room slimmed down after Wild Card week with Shavers and Davis tearing their ACL. Overcoming injuries isn't new to Buffalo, but McDermott emphasized that there's no other choice but to have the next man up mentality. He said on Tuesday that he's confident in his wide receivers to do just that.

""Another guy's got to step up. That's point blank what it means. And I don't mean to be short, it's just right now it's full confidence in the guys in that room,"" McDermott said.

From that room, Khalil Shakir had a huge game in the first round of the playoffs. He had 12 receptions, not dropping a single pass that went his way, and also acted as an extension of the run game in some regard. While others had explosive, chunk plays, Shakir was a player Allen and offensive coordinator Joe Brady relied on when the run game slowed.

After an up-and-down season on and off the field, McDermott expressed his confidence in Keon Coleman. Coleman had one reception for 36 yards on Sunday. Throughout the season, Coleman popped in and out of the lineup. Slowly, he worked his way back on his coaches' radars in terms of maturity and consistency.

""He, along with others, need to step up and [I'm] confident he will,"" McDermott said of the second-year wide receiver. ""He's moving in the right direction. You saw the production he had last week, the big play down the sideline. He continues to work on the other areas of the game as well that matter just as much as catching balls. So, his growth is going to be important for us down the stretch here.""

""We're going to need everyone. I mean, that's the short answer and is the simple truth. We're going to need everyone,"" McDermott said. ""It's a great team, No. 1 seed in the AFC and they've earned that [and] we're at their place. It's that type of game and you've got to be able to do your 1/11th at a very high level. If we don't make the adjustments this week and the improvements we need to make, it's going to be really hard – awfully hard for us to get a win out there.""

""They've got great players, interior and their edge guys. It's just a great defense, great scheme,"" offensive lineman David Edwards said. ""We're going to look at that film just to identify what they're doing versus combinations and maybe blitzes or whatever, just to get an idea. But it could be a scheme different, different game. So, we'll have to see when we're out there.""

""They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously, they rush the passer extremely well,"" Allen said. ""Interior there, some big, stout guys that can really push the pocket, and they can stop the run in the backend too … Understand the game plan, get to the right checks, get to the right calls, execute and play for each other because we can't give [Denver] any help. That's a good team over there, and anytime you're facing a really good defense and you got to go out there and do your part.""

The Bills are third in the league in red zone efficiency at 66.2 percent. Despite being one of the best in the NFL, though, they face the No. 1 red zone defense (allows 42.6 percent).

""The space, obviously, shortens down there. But when you've got speed and pass rushers, that's a pretty good combination,"" McDermott said. ""Those pass rushes are longer type of guys and twitchy at the same time. Their roster speaks for itself, and the way that they play also is extremely impressive.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/r0a3plochhmk6wfddsw1,N,,2026-01-14 17:00:55.043361

Claire's heartfelt caption accompanied a slideshow of photos, featuring intimate moments with George with a swollen right ankle upon sustaining his injury and sweet PDA-filled pics with him on the sideline before the game.

In an Instagram post of his own, George — who reportedly requested for a bottle of tequila in the locker room after the injury — candidly opened up about his injury one day after the game.

“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it,"" the 49ers tight end began in his caption. Kittle included some photos of himself on the field and a picture of his wife kissing him in the locker room.

“I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out,” he added. “I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet!”

""We still expect him to play on both sides of the ball,"" Gladstone said. ""... The steps that he was taking by the midpoint of the season really made us feel good about what the back half of the year was going to be on both sides of the ball and what that impact was going to look like being a feature point on offense and an impact player on defense.

""It [the injury] was just disappointing timing but nonetheless feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.""

Hunter underwent season-ending surgery on November 11 and the Jaguars had previously said that he was expected to return to ""full football activities"" within six months, but head coach Liam Coen was non-committal on whether that would mean taking on both offensive and defensive roles when asked about the situation at the time.

“I understand there’s a lot of questions about if he’ll remain a two-way player and all those kind of things,” Coen said told reporters on November 12 via the New York Post. “All of that is very premature, and at the end of the day like every player on this roster he’ll be evaluated at the end of the season and we’ll be able to give him his three better, three best and the things that we need to continue to improve upon and the things we need to build on.”

“Very fair to say that his rehab process is going as expected. He’s hitting it hard,” Gladstone said. “Obviously, the joy he brings to the everyday operation is still something that permeates throughout the space that he enters. … We still expect him to play on both sides of the ball.”

Gladstone said Hunter could see more of an emphasis at cornerback, given that the Jags have several players at that position whose contracts expired after the 2025 season, including Montaric Brown, Greg Newsome and Keith Taylor.

The Jags traded up to select Hunter in the 2025 draft, a bold move that showed belief in Hunter’s abilities as both a wide receiver and cornerback. He appeared in seven games as a rookie, recording 28 catches on 45 targets for 298 yards and one touchdown. As a cornerback, Hunter recorded 15 tackles, three pass breakups and a fumble recovery.

Hunter sustained an LCL injury in his right knee during practice on Oct. 30 and underwent season-ending surgery on Nov. 11. At the time, Hunter was expected to resume “full football activities” within six months.

“The steps that he was taking by the midpoint of the season really made us feel good about what the back half of the year was going to look like on both sides of the ball, being a feature piece on offense and an impact player on defense,” Gladstone said. “It was just disappointing timing, but feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.”

The Jags traded for receiver Jakobi Meyers in November, in part due to injuries in the wide receiver room. The Jaguars won five of Meyers’ first six games in Jacksonville, helping pave the way to the team’s first playoff appearance since 2022, and the team signed Meyers to a three-year contract extension in December.

Coach Liam Coen wouldn’t specify where Hunter would land on the offensive depth chart upon his return, instead saying, “It’s all part of the evaluation process.”

“For (Hunter) right now it’s about getting his rehab right and diving in mentally because of some of the limitations we’ll have throughout the offseason program,” Coen said. “I’m really excited about getting back to work with Travis and continuing that evolution.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/09/10192545/GettyImages-2234223630-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 15:00:53.143663

In Round 1 alone, the Packers' kicker cost them seven points. The Patriots won with a dominant defense, not Drake Maye heroics. Chicago lost the turnover battle but won anyway. The Eagles won the turnover battle but lost anyway.

Those moments are reminders of how thin the margins can be when obvious advantages are canceled out and the game tilts on hyper-specific matchups, miscues under pressure, and the ability to exploit the tiniest of weaknesses.

Here are the potential pressure points remaining for each of the eight teams left competing for the Super Bowl:

Seattle Seahawks: Nick Emmanwori’s Versatility

Emmanwori’s physical profile isn’t one you can easily typecast into a role on a traditional NFL defense. He was seen as too big and too vulnerable in deep coverage areas to truly be a safety, but too small to serve as an every-down linebacker. The Seahawks took a chance on him early in the second round anyway and immediately found ways to maximize his impact as a true disrupter on the field. The 6-foot-3 220-pounder has found a home at safety, where he frequently blitzes, fitting the run and covering tight ends out of the backfield. Given that Seattle has a rubber match lined up with San Francisco on Saturday night, Emmanwori will be featured often as the 49ers try to involve Christian McCaffrey in their offense as much as possible.

Emmanwori is not likely to win Defensive Rookie of the Year—Browns linebacker Carson Schwesinger is a heavy favorite for that award—but he’s certainly had an impact in turning Seattle into a top-tier defense. And that defense is the reason the Seahawks broke the franchise record for regular-season wins and why the NFC playoffs run through Lumen Field.

Emmanwori still has flaws in coverage and can be exposed for his overaggressive nature at times. He relies heavily on his instincts and his athleticism, which Kyle Shanahan will be sure to try to exploit on Saturday. But his ability to make game-changing plays is rare for a rookie, and he's the perfect Kyle Hamilton–esque piece for Mike Macdonald to play with.

San Francisco 49ers: Jake Tonges Replacing George Kittle

Kittle’s torn Achilles leaves San Francisco dangerously understaffed on reliable and healthy skill position players. Without Kittle, Brandon Aiyuk, and probably Ricky Pearsall, Kyle Shanahan will have to plunge even further into the depth chart. The Niners pulled off the upset in Philly on Sunday thanks to a Jauan Jennings passing touchdown and 111 yards on six catches from journeyman DeMarcus Robinson. If the Niners are going to knock off another top NFC contender on the road, Tonges could be the difference maker. The Seahawks don’t have a lot of weaknesses defensively, but they do allow the sixth-most yards per game to opposing tight ends.

Tonges caught the game-winning touchdown in Week 1 in Seattle and grew into a bigger role when Kittle was sidelined by injury earlier this season. In the last three games that Kittle hasn’t played, Tonges has seen his production skyrocket.

Week 5 vs. Rams: seven receptions, 41 yards, one TD

Week 6 vs. Buccaneers: six receptions, 58 yards

Week 17 vs. Bears: seven receptions, 60 yards, one TD

In some ways, it’s very fitting that an offense led by a seventh-round draft pick quarterback is now turning to an undrafted tight end to help fill in the gaps.

Chicago Bears: Colston Loveland’s Late-Season Emergence

When rookie tight end Tyler Warren was filling up the stat sheet for Indianapolis early in the season, it was fair to wonder whether the Bears had made the wrong choice by selecting fellow tight end Loveland four spots earlier in the 2025 draft.

Loveland wasn’t necessarily absent from the Bears’ passing game, but for much of the year, he was far from a focal point. He didn’t record a single game with more than seven targets over the first 16 weeks of the season, operating more as a complementary piece than a featured option. But as Chicago’s offense has matured, Loveland’s role has expanded within it.

Caleb Williams has targeted Loveland at least 10 times in each of the past three games, culminating in a breakout performance in the wild-card round. Loveland finished with a career-high 137 yards on eight catches and 15 targets in the Bears’ comeback win over Green Bay.

Chicago still wants to be a run-first team at heart, but defensive issues have forced it into shoot-outs. To keep pace with the high-powered offenses remaining in the NFC playoffs, the Bears will need to score—and score often—which makes Loveland’s emergence even more critical.

What stood out most in his wild-card performance was the versatility of his route running. Chicago moved Loveland all over the formation, and he consistently won both over the middle and outside the numbers. His late-season breakout is a major reason the Bears are still alive, and if this improbable run of comebacks and late-game heroics is going to continue, Loveland will need to remain a focal point of the offense.

Los Angeles Rams: The Entire Special Teams Operation

Special teams are the monster hiding under the bed in football. You never know when they’re going to show up and ruin your night. It’s never going to lead the game preview discussions in the television studio, and it’s likely only going to lead the postgame show when something goes terribly wrong.

For the Rams, special teams woes have been the underlying dread in an otherwise awesome season. Miscues cost the Rams the division and home-field advantage. On Saturday, a blocked punt by the Panthers nearly bounced L.A. out of the playoffs. Multiple blocked kicks cost it a win against the Eagles in Week 4. The Rams then fired special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn in December after Rashid Shaheed’s punt return touchdown led to a blown fourth-quarter lead against Seattle in an instant-classic Thursday night thriller.

The errors have eliminated the Rams’ margin for error and turned up the difficulty sliders to the highest setting, considering they’ll likely need to win three consecutive road games to reach the Super Bowl.

The Rams finished the regular season 31st in EPA from special teams. And it’s not a problem specific to this season. Since 2021, only the Packers are worse in EPA lost from special teams than the Rams. The gap between those two teams and everyone else is significant, and it's pretty ominous given how Green Bay’s season just ended.

Houston Texans: The Non–Nico Collins Wide Receivers

After Collins was carted off the field with a concussion on Monday night, it seems highly unlikely that he’ll play on Sunday in New England. The Texans’ passing offense has been extremely dependent on Collins: He had more than double the receiving yards of every other wide receiver on the roster in the regular season.

If you were expecting a big playoff breakout from a Houston receiver not named Collins, you probably would have picked Jayden Higgins. If not him, maybe Xavier Hutchinson. Or maybe even rookie Jaylin Noel, who has made the occasional downfield splash at various points this season. The point is that you’d have picked just about any of the young receiving options on this roster and not veteran journeyman Christian Kirk. The 29-year-old, now on his third team, was barely a factor for the Texans this season, yet he turned in a career-high 144 yards on Monday night to help propel Houston into the divisional round.

Houston’s offense isn’t consistent or reliable from down to down, but it really doesn’t have to be to win football games. The Texans, bolstered by an immense defense, just need someone to step up and produce a handful of explosive plays. With the Patriots’ top corner Christian Gonzalez also in concussion protocol, opportunity is lurking.

New England Patriots: Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson as Pass Catchers

Houston’s defense is built to hunt the football. It’s one of the league’s most aggressive and physical units, constantly moving downhill both in coverage and in the pass rush.

Drake Maye has been as successful as any quarterback in the league pushing the ball downfield this season, but that may not be where this game is decided. The clearest path to neutralizing an elite Houston defense may be using its aggression against it—forcing linebackers and safeties to step forward before slipping the ball underneath.

If Houston stays in attack mode, the Patriots’ running backs in the passing game become less of a checkdown and more of a pressure point. And if New England can consistently flip that aggression into manageable gains, it can keep Houston from fully dictating the terms of the game. The Steelers and Aaron Rodgers failed to do that on Monday night, but Maye is better equipped at this stage of his career to navigate the pocket, buy time, and create with his legs when plays break down.

Stevenson’s 48-yard catch-and-run out of the backfield on Monday directly led to a Patriots field goal. Henderson hasn’t always been reliable snap to snap, but he’s the type of home-run hitter who has found success generating explosive plays from time to time. With the Patriots potentially needing to beat two elite defenses on the road to Santa Clara, Stevenson and Henderson in the passing game may be less a luxury and more a necessity—an extension of an inconsistent running game and a way to keep Houston from playing downhill all night.

Denver Broncos: The Enigmatic Riley Moss

Whatever your opinion of Moss as a corner, you can find a statistic to prove you’re right. He finished the season with the most passes defended in the NFL. Is that a positive because he was constantly in position to make plays on the ball? Or is it a negative because opposing offenses felt comfortable throwing at him over and over?

There might not be a single CB2 who inspires more words, film breakdowns, and debate than the corner playing opposite Patrick Surtain II on one of the NFL’s best defenses. Denver ranks eighth worst in DVOA against no. 2 wide receivers, yet the Broncos also finished top eight in open coverage rate, per FTN—a combination that perfectly captures the ambiguity of Moss’s season.

Evaluating Moss is one of the most complicated exercises in the NFL right now, and it’s a puzzle Denver’s playoff opponents will have to solve when putting together their game plan. And if you’re Denver, would you have Surtain shadow the Bills top receiving option, when it’s almost certainly tight end Dalton Kincaid?

Buffalo Bills: The Safety Playing Next to Cole Bishop

Buffalo’s safety depth was already thin. After the wild-card round, it’s a glaring potential liability. Jordan Poyer left the game with an aggravated hamstring injury, leaving the Bills without a clear option to play next to Bishop. Taylor Rapp is out for the year. Damar Hamlin hasn’t played since Week 6. There isn’t an established replacement waiting behind them.

The back seven of the Bills defense has struggled all season to get off blocks. It’s an undersized group to begin with, and those limitations have left them as vulnerable as any Bills defense in the Josh Allen era.

The safety issue shows up in the numbers, too. Buffalo finished the regular season bottom-eight in explosive play rate allowed and bottom-eight in big runs allowed. Bishop stepped up with a crucial interception to seal the win against the Jaguars in the wild-card round, but Sean McDermott will need to get creative schematically to deal with a Denver offense that is constantly hunting and chasing explosive plays to make up for their down-to-down inconsistency.",https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cropped-PlayoffXFactors_Getty-Ringer-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:00:57.581873

George Kittle and Cooper DeJean

San Francisco’s been a great story all year. Decimated by injuries and an amazing fringe theory on why, they somehow made it to 12-5 and even had a shot at the 1-seed in Week 18 but lost to Seattle. That meant a drop to 6th in the NFC and a road game at the defending champion Eagles.

But the one story that matters here is that of George Krieger Kittle, and it’s an awful one. I won’t post the video of the injury. I saw it live, then saw a couple of replays from Fox. That was enough for me. Kittle caught 1 pass for 6 yards in San Francisco’s shock 23-19 win, and on that reception planted with his right foot as he came down with the ball. You saw that odd wiggle in the calf when his foot planted. He went down in a heap along the sideline and it was later confirmed he tore his Achilles. That is a 9-12 month recovery time so perhaps we see Kittle in late 2026. What a terrible moment for Kittle, who’s had an excellent career but has also been ravaged by injuries. Just hope he can get through this one and be back late next season.

On the other sideline, Cooper DeJean’s incredible season - one that saw him earn first-team all-Pro honors - comes to an end after 2 tackles and 2 passes defended. Philly - weird team. Do they all like each other? Seems like a firm no.

San Francisco and their insane list of injuries head to the Divisional Round and a date in Seattle Saturday night.

Lukas Van Ness, Nick Niemann, and Tory Taylor

Now that we’re done mourning, we move onto the rest of the weekend. Saturday and most of the Sunday games were fun! We’ll start in the Windy City as the Bears managed a remarkable comeback to upend Green Bay, 31-27. Tory Taylor didn’t punt a single time. I was surprised when I looked at the box score but there it is - No Chicago Punting.

On the other sideline, Lukas Van Ness logged 3 tackles and a sack, while Nick Niemann picked up 1 tackle. I don’t know how the heck Green Bay lost this game. I’m just happy this rivalry is back in our lives. The teams don’t like one another, the coaches don’t like one another, the fans don’t like one another…YES. Welcome back, Chicago-Green Bay rivalry! The league is better having you back. We got three fantastic games from them this year. Keep that going for the next decade, please!

Chicago hosts the Los Angeles Rams Sunday.

AJ Epenesa

Really quick on AJE. The defensive end had 1 tackle as the Bills won late over Jacksonville, 27-24. Not much to report here, other than Buffalo advanced Sunday afternoon. They head to Denver for a date with our man Riley Moss Saturday afternoon. Buffalo’s injury situation is pretty close to that of San Francisco’s, and especially in their wide receiver room where only three receivers remain from the active roster.

Yahya Black and Kaleb Johnson

Good and bad here. Yahya Black had a nice game, collecting 2 tackles and recovering a fumble. That’s the good! The rest is really bad. Kaleb Johnson was a healthy scratch for the fourth-straight game, capping a disastrous rookie year in which he had just 28 carries. Oh and of course, the Steelers were shot into outer space by Houston, 30-6, Mike Tomlin fired himself on Tuesday, and they don’t know if Aaron Rodgers is coming back or not.

Tom lauded Walker for his durability and hopes the former seventh-round pick may be back next year.
""Anytime you have injuries at any position, it's difficult to develop that chemistry but especially on the O-line,"" Tom said.","GREEN BAY – Zach Tom strained as hard as he could and exhausted every available option to get on the field Saturday night for the Packers' NFC Wild Card playoff game in Chicago.

Until finally Green Bay's starting right tackle came to terms with the fact his injured knee wasn't going to fully cooperate.

""It was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in my life,"" Tom said. ""Obviously you want to be out there in the playoffs because that's when everything's at stake. I just don't think I was in a position where I could go out there and help the team.""

Tom knew what he was up against as soon as he suffered a partially torn patellar tendon during Green Bay's Week 14 matchup with the Denver Broncos. It's a risky injury with dire consequences if it tears completely.

The 6-foot-4, 304-pound tackle underwent a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection with the hope it would hasten his recovery and possibly get him back for the playoffs.

But the knee didn't improve as much as Tom or the training staff hoped and the fourth-year veteran was forced to watch from the sidelines as the Packers' season ended in a 31-27 loss to the Bears.

""I feel like I could do a lot of what I need to do (but) I was never really comfortable in pass protection,"" Tom said. ""If somebody's truly trying to run through my chest, I don't think I would've been able to be competitive.""

It was a bitter ending to a season that started with so much promise for Tom, who was rewarded for years of stability on the offensive line with a long-term contract extension this past July.

A 2022 fourth-round pick out of Wake Forest, Tom started 37 straight games (including playoffs) for Green Bay and looked like he was picking up where he left off before suffering an oblique injury in the Packers' regular-season opener against Detroit.

Tom played just one snap over the next three games and was listed with a back injury for the remainder of the year even after returning. He was doing as well as an offensive lineman could be doing in December when the knee injury struck in Denver, and it proved to be the last straw to his frustrating 2025 campaign.

Tom said he's ""leaning towards"" surgery to fix the patellar tendon, which would require a six-month recovery. Beyond just the knee issue, though, Tom wants to dig deeper into the sports science to uncover why he battled as many injuries as he did.

""It's tough. You can feel sorry for yourself, or you can use the offseason to figure out if it's something I'm doing,"" Tom said. ""Maybe I need to put on some weight. … Maybe I need to get in better shape. Obviously, we need to figure something out because I keep tearing (stuff).""

When healthy-ish, Tom remained one of the best at his position and still received the fourth-most votes among right tackles in AP All-Pro balloting despite missing five games.

In addition to Tom, the Packers also lost All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to a season-ending ACL injury in Denver. Green Bay didn't win a game the rest of the season.

""I think it's just the execution,"" Tom said. ""There were some things that we did up front there in the game that (you) just can't make those mistakes in a playoff game. Part of that falls on me, that's something where I need to improve. I need to be a better leader. I need to take control.""

This will be an interesting offseason for the Packers' offensive line, which also lost Elgton Jenkins to a season-ending ankle injury in Week 10. Tom's 2022 draft classmates – left tackle Rasheed Walker and center Sean Rhyan – are both set to become unrestricted free agents in March.

Rhyan told reporters on Monday that he avoided a significant knee injury in the waning moments of the Bears game, suffering only a bone bruise that shouldn't threaten his offseason training.

Tom lauded Walker for his durability and hopes the former seventh-round pick may be back next year. Walker has played in 55 consecutive games, including 48 starts, since the 2023 regular-season opener.

""Coming in, getting drafted in the seventh round, and then turning into a starting left tackle in the NFL is just a blessing from God,"" Walker said. ""Really enjoyed my time here, took pride in protecting Jordan Love or whoever was in the backfield playing quarterback, made a lot of great relationships with a lot of guys. It's just been a good time for me, and I'm just ready for whatever's happening next.""

Tom is ready to put the 2025 season behind him. He's excited to work alongside rookie second-round pick Anthony Belton, who took over at right guard for the stretch run, and hopes better health and continuity lead to improvement in 2026.

""Anytime you have injuries at any position, it's difficult to develop that chemistry but especially on the O-line,"" Tom said. ""Obviously you want to be out there. You want to be able to build that chemistry, especially because they moved Belton next to me and you want to be able to get as many reps with him as you can. It just didn't work out like that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/xa0zlkatygqqmd6wznh5,N,,2026-01-14 16:01:59.560994

After San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle suffered a serious injury during a playoff game, his wife shared raw emotions on social media.

George Kittle was carted off the field during the second quarter of the 49ers’ 23-19 Wild Card win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The victory pushed San Francisco forward in the playoffs, but it came at a painful cost. It was later confirmed that the 32-year-old tight end tore his Achilles tendon, an injury that ended his season and began a long road to recovery.

Claire Kittle posted photos from the locker room, showing quiet moments with her husband after the injury. Her caption revealed how helpless and stunned she felt in the moment everything changed.

“Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again,” Claire Kittle wrote. “He always gets up. He’s George — he can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it.”

Claire Kittle Shares Heartfelt Message After George Kittle Injury

Claire Kittle's message did more than describe the injury itself. It showed the emotional weight carried by families who live every snap alongside the players. She called her husband “a unicorn in this world” and said she believes he will return “stronger and better than ever before.”

She also praised the mindset that has defined George Kittle throughout his career.

“The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one,” she wrote, adding that he and the team remain “unf—withable.”

Claire Kittle made it clear that despite the pain, she still believes this season holds meaning for the 49ers.

“It’s a special year, you can feel that and we’re not done yet,” she added, before thanking fans for supporting George Kittle and helping carry some of the pain.

The 49ers star responded directly to his wife in the comments, keeping his reply short and full of love.

“You’re the best teammate for this journey ❤️,” he wrote.

George Kittle’s Achilles Injury

The injury happened when George Kittle made a six-yard catch with about six minutes left before halftime. After being tackled near the sideline, he was slow to get up and clearly in pain. Trainers quickly attended to him, and he was eventually carted off the field.

Despite losing one of their leaders early, the 49ers rallied to finish the game. Christian McCaffrey scored the go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter, sealing the win. Still, the locker room knew the moment was bittersweet.

The day after the game, George Kittle addressed the injury himself on Instagram.

“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it,” he wrote, sharing photos from the field and a moment of Claire kissing him in the locker room. He admitted feeling heartbroken but grateful for the support he received from teammates, fans and the organization.

He also noted that 49ers owner Jed York was the first person to meet him in the locker room, a moment that reminded him he is “in a special place.” George Kittle ended his message with optimism, writing, “I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet!”

For Claire Kittle, the injury was another reminder of how fragile the game can be, even for someone as strong and fearless as George Kittle.

As George Kittle prepares for surgery and recovery, the 49ers move forward in the playoffs with his presence still felt and with the unwavering support of the teammate who knows him best.

Hunter underwent surgery in November to repair his LCL, and the initial timeline for his return to football activities was six months. The two-way standout could be ready for OTAs in May if he remains on schedule.

Hunter sustained the non-contact injury in practice and landed on injured reserve on Oct. 31. While there was no initial indication that Hunter would miss the rest of the season, his surgery two weeks later marked the end of what was quickly becoming a strong rookie campaign.

""Very fair to say that his rehab process is going as expected,"" Gladstone said. ""He's hitting it hard. Obviously the joy that he brings to the everyday operation is still something that permeates throughout the space that he enters.""

When Hunter returns to full strength, the expectation is that he will reprise his role as a contributor at both wide receiver and cornerback. He played over 100 snaps at both spots as a rookie with slightly more time spent on offense.

Pete Prisco

That positional flexibility could evolve throughout Hunter's career. Gladstone hinted at an expanded role on defense in 2026 given the state of the Jaguars' roster on the heels of an AFC South title and first-round playoff exit.

""We still expect him to play on both sides of the ball,"" Gladstone said. ""Obviously you can take a peek at expiring contracts on our roster and which side of the ball has more. Obviously at this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. So by default, you can expect there to be a higher emphasis on his placement.""

The Jaguars made an effort to involve Hunter in the offense to a greater extent in the weeks leading up to his injury, and it resulted in an uptick in production. His final game of the year was his most stellar outing to date, as he racked up a season-high 14 targets and turned them into eight receptions for 101 yards and his first touchdown.

For the season, Hunter posted 28 catches, 298 yards and a touchdown on offense with 15 tackles and three passes defended on defense.

""The steps that he was taking by the midpoint of the season really made us feel good about what the back half of the year was going to be on both sides of the ball and what that impact was going to look like, being a featured point on offense and an impact player on defense,"" Gladstone said. ""It was just disappointing timing, but nonetheless feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/14/de70548d-d3cd-4502-ba06-21e00342593b/thumbnail/1200x675/52c80d4239f011fd4d333937589dc04c/gettyimages-2241245544-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 13:01:01.821046

He amassed 26 punt returns this past season for 291 yards, including a 54-yarder and an 11.2 average per punt return.","Position Group: Wide Receivers

Players: Mike Evans, Chris Godwin Jr., Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan, Sterling Shepard, Kameron Johnson, Tez Johnson, Garrett Greene (practice squad), Dennis Houston (practice squad)

2025 Evaluation: Future Hall of Famer Mike Evans missed six games due to a broken collarbone and was placed on injured reserve on October 22. He had missed three games earlier in the year with a hamstring injury and had appeared in four contests prior to the second sustained ailment. Evans returned for the Week 15 Thursday Night Football matchup with the Atlanta Falcons and quickly returned to peak form, finishing the 2025 campaign with 30 catches for 368 yards and three scores. He is the Bucs' all-time leader in nearly every receiving metric, and in 2025 he led the Bucs with 74 receptions for 1,004 yards and 11 touchdowns, tying Jerry Rice's record by eclipsing the 1,000-yard marker for the 11th consecutive season. Evans played 357 offensive snaps in 2025 and is the club's Bona fide deep threat. The A&M product consistently commands double teams and is nearly unstoppable at executing back-shoulder catches off the fade or winning on go routes. He uses his length to climb the ladder with ease and has a feel for coverage, utilizing trademark routes to set up opportunities – baiting cornerbacks by appearing to work outside for the fade then cutting inside for the slant in the red zone. He has the ability to power through the jam and once again stunned with captivating play in 2025 when he was on the field.

Chris Godwin Jr. missed five games in 2025 due to a fibula injury and played 428 snaps. Two games into his return from the significant ankle injury he suffered last November, Godwin sustained the aforementioned leg injury in Week Five at Seattle. He was leading all NFL players in receptions at the time of his injury in 2024 and had already scored five touchdowns in seven games. This past season, Godwin resumed his role in the slot and showcased his physicality at the catch point and willingness as a crack blocker to spur rushers. Godwin makes contested catches look routine and plays with a fiery demeanor. The RAC threat helped bolster the Bucs' aerial attack when on the field to move the chains.

Emeka Egbuka became an integral cog in the Bucs' 3-1 start, emerging as the team's leading receiver during a month in which Evans, Godwin and Jalen McMillan missed time. He concluded the month of September with 18 receptions for 282 yards (15.7 average) and four touchdowns, including a game-winner with 59 seconds left in the team's Week One victory over the Falcons. Egbuka became just the second player since the 1970 merger to record a game-winning touchdown reception in the final minute of regulation in his first career game. In Weeks One-Four, Egbuka was one of four NFC wide receivers, and the only rookie, with 75-plus yards from scrimmage in three-or-more games in September alongside Justin Jefferson, Puka Nacua and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Per NextGen Stats, Egbuka led all rookies and ranked second behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown in passer rating when targeted (128.0) among all players with 25-or-more targets in 2025, while also leading his class in receiving EPA with 11.2. Since 2000, Egbuka is one of four players with 15-plus receptions, 250-plus receiving yards and four-plus touchdown receptions through four career games joining Ja'Marr Chase, Calvin Ridely and Roy Williams. He played the most snaps of any Bucs receiver this past season at 886 and lined up at all three receiver spots along the formation. His production hit a lull in the latter half of the year due to a variety of factors, but overall, Egbuka showed the route-running acumen and detailed subtleties that made him a first-round selection out of Ohio State.

Jalen McMillan suffered a serious neck injury in a preseason contest with the Steelers that landed him on injured reserve and kept him in a constrictive brace for several months. He made his highly-anticipated return against the Falcons in Week 15 and quickly made his presence felt between the hashes. McMillan played 138 snaps in 2025, including his first 100-yard receiving game against the Dolphins. He hauled in seven catches for 114 yards, including a 33-yarder off a Baker Mayfield pump fake in the clash. McMillan, a long-strider, has an innate feel for how to generate separation mid-route with leverage and fakes. He plays with effective acceleration and elite body control and can manipulate defensive backs with an expansive release package. McMillan has impressive control of speed on routes, with the capability of making sudden stops.

Both Sterling Shepard and Tez Johnson recorded 495 snaps in 2025 and helped boost the receiver room, particularly when it was thinned by injuries. Shepard played with a competitive disposition, reliable hands and quick cuts. The smooth route runner can hit the gas pedal out of his breaks and once again created a rapport with his former Oklahoma Sooners' teammate, Mayfield. Johnson, the Bucs' seventh-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Oregon, displayed his explosiveness and prowess before and after the catch. He is hard to bring down by open-field pursuit and is adept off screens, jet sweeps, verticals and short-to-intermediate routes with speed to blow past defenders.

Kameron Johnson tallied 105 snaps in 2025 but made most of his impact on special teams as a kick/punt returner. In Tampa Bay's season-opener against the Atlanta Falcons, Johnson sparked a pivotal go-ahead, second-half touchdown drive with a 54-yard punt return in the third quarter. It marked the Buccaneers' longest punt return since Bobby Rainey took one 58 yards on Oct. 11, 2015 vs. Jacksonville. In addition to his contributions as a returner, Johnson also served as a gunner on Tampa Bay's punt team, which ranked seventh in the NFL, and third in the NFC, in Week One in net yards per punt (44.0). Johnson was responsible for one of two punts downed inside the 20-yard line by the Buccaneers in that game – tied for the second-most among any NFL team in Week One. Since joining the Bucs as an undrafted free agent out of Barton College in 2024, Johnson has solidified Tampa Bay's return game. In 2025, Johnson averaged 25.4 yards per kick return and totaled 685 yards on 27 kick returns, with his longest being a 44-yarder. He amassed 26 punt returns this past season for 291 yards, including a 54-yarder and an 11.2 average per punt return.

2026 Outlook: Mike Evans and Sterling Shepard are impending unrestricted free agents in March and the Buccaneers will have some decisions to make regarding the room. Evans will take time to reflect and make his resolution regarding the future, similar to that of teammate, Lavonte David.

""We both had long talks today, individually, separately, and we had our private conversations,"" said Head Coach Todd Bowles on discussions with Evans and David following the conclusion of the season. ""I think they've earned that right to make that decision when the time comes. They're both [the] heart and souls [of] the Buccaneers and it's just a matter of once they get over the pain and the wound and see how they feel and think clearly, then we'll kind of go from there. But, we've allowed them to make that decision so we'll wait and see.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/cjjpzmblnnrgxvzfyudj,N,,2026-01-14 16:02:08.295294

With a short week ahead and familiar opponent on deck, Shanahan addressed the injury report, workload management, and the unique challenges of facing a division rival for the second time in three weeks.

Here are the top takeaways from Shanahan as postseason preparation continued:

Injury Report, Warner and Kittle Updates

Shanahan opened with updates from Sunday's playoff victory, outlining the injury report as the team navigates a condensed week.

Linebacker Luke Gifford (quad) and safety Ji'Ayir Brown (hamstring) did not practice for the team's first workout of the week. Offensive lineman Dominick Puni (ankle), defensive lineman Keion White (groin/hamstring), wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), and tackle Trent Williams (hamstring/veteran day) were all listed as limited.

Shanahan added that linebacker Nick Martin remains in protocol and will not be activated yet, while linebacker Fred Warner's practice window has officially opened.

""We're opening his window so he can do some stuff,"" Shanahan said. ""But again, we're not doing much, so he'll walk-through out there with us today and things like that. But, hoping he can be ready for next week.""

Also, Shanahan announced that tight end George Kittle will undergo season-ending surgery Wednesday. The surgery comes three days after tearing his right Achilles tendon in the second quarter of the Wild Card contest.

Managing a Short Week

With the Divisional Round matchup set for Saturday night in Seattle, Shanahan said the coaching staff adjusted the team's schedule to prioritize recovery.

The 49ers shortened Tuesday's workday to roughly three-and-a-half hours, holding only walk-throughs and avoiding any full-speed reps.

""We usually bring them in for about seven hours today. They're only in for about three-and-a-half. We'll do all walk-through, nothing full speed. We won't go against each other at all. And then we'll see how it goes.""

Shanahan noted the approach differs from Week 18, when San Francisco played its third game in 13 days.

""That week we didn't do one thing full speed,"" Shanahan said. ""We'll see how guys feel and decide what we want to do tomorrow.""

Familiar Foe Means Simplified Preparation

Facing the Seahawks for the second time in two weeks presents a unique postseason challenge, but Shanahan shared that familiarity works both ways.

""We know each other very well. We've played against each other a ton. The schemes even the last time we played didn't change much on both sides as opposed to Week 1. So, I think both teams got an idea of exactly what to expect.""

While wrinkles and situational adjustments remain, Shanahan said the postseason naturally simplifies preparation.

""You definitely can't overthink it,"" Shanahan said. ""Playoffs as a whole are kind of that way too.""

Confidence in Next-Man-Up Performances

Shanahan praised several defenders who stepped into expanded roles against Philadelphia, including linebackers Garret Wallow and Eric Kendricks and safety Marques Sigle.

Wallow led the team with 11 tackles in his first career postseason start, while Kendricks added 10 tackles and Keion White recorded the first postseason sack of his career.

""Sigle showed us early in the year, and we see him at practice every day. We never knew when his (opportunity) would come and right when Tig (S JiAyir Brown) went down, he was ready and he did play as good as it felt live. Kendricks was another story, just coming off the street, being at home.

""All those guys played at such a high level, and that's what we need. We've had a lot of guys injured, so guys have to come in and step it up.""

Shanahan said their performances provided confidence heading into another physical playoff matchup.

Building Drives

Looking back at the Wild Card win, Shanahan emphasized the importance of sustaining drives, particularly when the opposing offense controls time of possession.

""When another team holds the ball for a while… you have to be on point. Whether that's doing better on first and second down so you avoid as many third downs as we did. But, if you don't do that, you've got to do good on third down.""

Shanahan credited quarterback Brock Purdy's ability to layer throws, pointing to the 45-yard completion down the middle of the field to wide receiver Jauan Jennings.

""I'm not going to say anyone's better than Brock at it. That's probably one of Brock's best things. He can really drop it in a bucket. The guys can be deep and if there's a way to get it over that guy and bring it down before you sail it over a receiver, he's going to do that and he doesn't miss it very much.""

The team got an injury scare after Sunday’s 27-24 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars when star quarterback Josh Allen was seen limping around the locker room.

However, it seems the Bills and Allen avoided a worst-case scenario. Though he’s “sore,” Allen, the reigning MVP doesn’t seem to be in jeopardy of missing Saturday’s matchup against the top-seeded Denver Broncos.

But unfortunately for Buffalo, it will be without a few key offensive contributors as the team got some bad injury news on Monday, and followed it up with even more crushing injury news on Tuesday.

Bills’ WR Corps Takes Another Hit

The team announced on Monday that wide receiver Gabe Davis had torn his ACL, knocking him out for the rest of the postseason.

Davis, 26, caught 2 passes on 3 targets for 14 yards before exiting the wild-card matchup in the first half.

If that weren’t bad enough, head coach Sean McDermott announced 24 hours later that fellow wide receiver Tyrell Shavers had also torn his ACL and would also miss the rest of the playoffs.

Remarkably, Shavers suffered the injury on a punt return in the second quarter and came back out and finished the game. He didn’t know the severity of his injury until after he was evaluated following the game.

“[Shavers] embodies what we’re all about,” McDermott told reporters. “… For him to then come back into the game, and then for it to turn out to be what it was is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.”

With Davis and Shavers both out, and Joshua Palmer on injured reserve, the Bills wide receiver room has taken blow after blow over the last few weeks.

Buffalo heads into Saturday’s matchup against the Broncos with Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, and Keon Coleman plus a few practice squad options in Mecole Hardman, Stephen Gosnell, and Kristian Wilkerson.

“Another guy’s got to step up,” McDermott added. “That’s point-blank what it means. And I don’t mean to be short. It’s just right now, it’s full confidence in the guys in that room, and we brought back Kristian Wilkerson, and he’ll be a good addition back to us on the practice squad, and we go from there.”

There is Some Positive Injury News

While the Bills are down three wide receivers, they could be getting some reinforcements in that department.

Receiver Curtis Samuel practiced with the team on Monday. The 29-year-old hasn’t played since Nov. 16 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His return could be a big boost for a banged-up Bills wide receiver corps.

In addition to Samuel, Buffalo could also get a boost on defense as well.

Star defensive tackle Ed Oliver also returned to practice on Monday. He missed 14 games after tearing his pectoral against the Carolina Panthers back on Oct. 26.

Before his injury, Oliver was a force on the defensive line. He recorded 12 tackles, 11 pressures, 6 hurries, 5 run stuffs, 3 sacks, 2 QB hits, and a forced fumble, according to Pro Football Focus.

Oliver also finished tied for the third-most tackles for loss (7) on the team despite playing in less than 1/4 of the season.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2166481231.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-14 13:01:06.153877

The shocking loss, in which the NFL’s most expensive defense forced three turnovers against Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud but ultimately fell by a 24-point margin, preceded the announcement that Mike Tomlin would be stepping down as Pittsburgh’s head coach after 19 seasons. The team made it official with a statement from team president Art Rooney II on Tuesday afternoon.

In addition to plenty of shakeups in the league’s coaching carousel — currently sitting with nine head coaching vacancies — it was a record-setting wild-card round. This round marked the first time in NFL history that four-plus games were decided by four or fewer points in a single postseason round, per Opta Stats; it’s also the first time there have been six-plus fourth-quarter lead changes in a single playoff round in NFL history, Dante Koplowitz-Fleming of NFL research noted.

The Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers opened things up with a surprising thriller; after LA entered the week as historic road favorites, its 34-31 win over Carolina came down to the wire as MVP favorite Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard, go-ahead touchdown to tight end Colby Parkinson in the final minute of the game. The Panthers got bad news on top of the loss, as starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu reportedly suffered a ruptured patellar tendon, which could affect his availability next season.

That was followed by another Saturday thriller, as Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears mounted yet another comeback win — this time, over their NFC North rival, the Green Bay Packers — to advance to the divisional round. The Packers were off to a 21-3 lead in the first half before the Bears dropped 25 points in the fourth quarter to take the win.

On Sunday, the magic continued with the Josh Allen-led Buffalo Bills defeating Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars, ending Liam Coen’s Cinderella-esque first season as a head coach. After Allen managed a rushing touchdown after the two-minute warning (right after the best tush push ever, perhaps?), a perfectly timed interception from Bills safety Cole Bishop put Allen in position to kneel it out and snag the team’s first road playoff win in 33 years.

The San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles followed that up with another game that came down to the wire, as the Niners dethroned Philly with a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive (and some trickery from wideout Jauan Jennings). Despite the thrilling win, the Niners will have to deal with yet another brutal blow on the injury front, as All-Pro tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles injury, ending his season.

Despite holding Drake Maye to just one touchdown, the Los Angeles Chargers couldn’t muster up enough offense to take down the New England Patriots. Los Angeles failed to score a touchdown during the contest, losing 16-3 and inviting questions over whether the Chargers’ coaching staff needs to be shaken up over the offseason.

The NFL just wrapped up what might be the craziest playoff week we’ve witnessed in quite some time. The 2025 NFL Wild Card round was a treat to watch for fans, as nearly all of the games went down to the wire. It was an awesome week for football fans. However, the injury bug does not take time off, and it took some important people down last week.

49ers tight end George Kittle – torn Achilles tendon

Perhaps the most notable player to get injured last week is San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle. Against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round, Kittle came down with what seemed to be a lower leg injury after making a catch early in the game. The replays showed a worrying sight: a ripple through his calf, usually indicative of a torn Achilles tendon.

The tests unfortunately confirmed that Kittle suffered a torn Achilles tendon. As a result, Kittle will miss the rest of the 49ers’ playoff run, as well as a good part of the 2026 season. It’s a brutal injury to one of the best players in the NFL at his position.

Texans wide receiver Nico Collins – concussion

Another key player to get injured this week is Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins. The star wide receiver was slow to get up after attempting to catch a pass during their game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins hit his head on the ground pretty hard during the play, leading to him getting ruled out of the game with a head injury.

It was later announced that Collins had entered the concussion protocol after suffering the head injury. His status for the Texans’ Divisional Round game remains uncertain, as it will depend on the wide receiver’s status throughout the week. Should Collins miss the game, it will another blow to a Texans offense that’s already struggled even with the star wide receiver.

Bills wide receivers Tyrell Shaverss, Gabriel Davis – torn ACL

The Bills suffered two massive blows to their already thin wide receiver room. Gabriel Davis, a late-season pickup by the Bills, exited the game with a lower leg injury and never returned. Sophomore wide receiver Tyrell Shavers also suffered a lower body injury in the first half, but he was able to finish the game.

Afterwards, it was announced that both Davis and Shavers suffered torn ACLs during their game against the Jaguars. It’s impressive that Shavers was able to play through a torn ACL, but the injury still is a big hit to the Buffalo offense. The good news for them is that WR Curtis Samuel might be returning soon, but losing two core wide receivers in the same game is a tough pill to swallow.

Bears linebacker TJ Edwards – fractured fibula

The Bears’ already depleted defense lost another man on Sunday night. Linebacker TJ Edwards came down hard after trying to make a play. Edwards was carted off the field, never returning to the game. Chicago has already placed the injured linebacker on IR due to a fractured fibula, ending Edwards’ season.

Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzales – concussion

One of the cornerstones of the New England Patriots’ stout defense might miss their upcoming game against the Texans. Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzales suffered a head injury against the Los Angeles Chargers and did not return to the game. Gonzales is now on the concussion protocol, leaving his status against the Texans in doubt.

Other notable injuries this week were Bills QB Josh Allen (listed with foot, finger, and knee injuries this week), Rams QB Matthew Stafford (finger) andBears left tackle Ozzy Trapilo (torn patellar tendon).

Since becoming a referee in 2018, Smith has called eight New England games. They are 4-4 in those contests, with the most recent of them being a 33-15 win over the New York Giants in Week 13. That day, the Patriots were flagged four times in front of their home crowd, with the three penalties that were accepted costing them 30 yards of field position. The Giants were penalized on five occasions losing 30 yards as well on four accepted calls.

Overall in 2025, Smith has officiated 16 games with 194 accepted penalties among 229 total flags thrown. His most-called infractions this season are false start (34+0), offensive holding (29+5) and defensive pass interference (20+3).

Bland played 12 games for the Cowboys in 2025 before being placed on injured reserve for the final three games of the year. He also missed Weeks 2 and 3 of the season with a right foot injury that he suffered in practice.

The newest surgery marks the second straight year that Bland has had a procedure done on his left foot. In training camp leading into the 2024 season, Bland suffered a fracture in his left foot, which led to the first surgery. He would go on to return and play seven games that season for Dallas.

Evidently, back-to-back seasons ending in surgery on the same foot is not what Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones or anyone wanted for Bland.

""I'm not a doctor... but I don't like that at all,"" Jones said. ""I don't like the sound of that. You have to watch feet, relative to the future.""

In August, the Cowboys signed Bland to a four-year, $92 million extension, two years removed from an All-Pro season where Bland set the NFL record for most pick-sixes in a season with five in 2023.

Despite two straight years of disappointing injury circumstances cutting Bland's seasons short, Jones and the Cowboys do not regret signing Bland to his extension that keeps him in Dallas long term.

""He has been everything you could ask for relative to his rehab, relative to his competes,"" Jones said in December. ""He's done the best that he's had to work with as it turns out with his injury. He's thumb's up.""

Now, the hope is that Bland is able to recover over the course of the offseason and get rid of the nagging foot issues with a full offseason ahead before he retakes the field for the Cowboys in 2026.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/uplznkoh3qo1my3qowjv,N,,2026-01-14 14:03:39.990635

""He has been a tremendous partner to the Bears helping us start high school girls flag football in the Rockford area in 2022 and launch a middle school girls flag football league in 2025.
We are so grateful to Commissioner Goodell for recognizing Lamont.""
His work in spreading the sport across northern Illinois helped girls flag football become sanctioned by the Illinois High School Association in 2024.","The longtime Rockford Park District general manager, who has dedicated much of the last 20 years to providing access to flag football for both boys and girls, stood along the Bears sideline before Saturday's wild card game against the Packers, where he met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Jones was not only attending the game to cheer on his hometown team, but also to watch two 14U boys flag football teams and two middle school girls flag football teams, all from the Rockford area, that would be competing during halftime later that evening.

While Jones thought his longtime friend, Bears director of football development Gustavo Silva, was simply connecting him with Goodell, he and the Commissioner had an alternative plan. After speaking with Jones about the power of the work he's done for years, Goodell surprised him with two tickets to Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, Calif.

""We always want to honor our fans, but Lamont is much more than a fan,"" Goodell said. ""He's making a difference in our communities, and what he's doing in flag football by giving kids that opportunity to play and giving them a future is incredible. We're proud to honor him.""

""I can't even fathom it,"" Jones said, ""and I don't even know if I'm gonna call my wife until I get back on the bus, but, I was already planning for the Super Bowl, 'Are we gonna have some friends over? Let's watch the game on TV,' and things like that. But now we're actually gonna be going to the Super Bowl. And the only thing that can make this even more special is if my favorite team can go along with me.""

Having worked with NFL Flag since 2003, Jones and the Bears have been connected for decades. The team recently donated turf from the Walter Payton Center as part of the $7.6 million construction upgrade of Rockford's Clarence Hicks Sports Complex.

""Lamont has been empowering kids through flag football for over two decades,"" Silva said. ""He has been a tremendous partner to the Bears helping us start high school girls flag football in the Rockford area in 2022 and launch a middle school girls flag football league in 2025. I can't think of a more deserving recipient. We are so grateful to Commissioner Goodell for recognizing Lamont.""

While the Bears first launched the high school girls flag football program in 2022 with Chicago Public Schools, Rockford was the second league created, thanks to Jones' support. His work in spreading the sport across northern Illinois helped girls flag football become sanctioned by the Illinois High School Association in 2024.

For leaders like Goodell, watching flag football grow across Illinois and the world, especially ahead of the sport's debut in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, is always rewarding, especially given the league's dedication to providing access to football at all levels.

""It's fantastic,"" Goodell said. ""I think for young boys and girls to be able to play our game and participate in an Olympic sport, I just think it's a great opportunity for all of them. It's awesome to see.""

Between seeing those kids soak up the moment of playing on the same field as the Bears at a playoff game, receiving such a special honor from the NFL Commissioner and of course, watching his favorite team mount the biggest postseason comeback in franchise history, Saturday night felt like a dream to Jones.

""I've been involved and had a relationship with Chicago Bears for over 24 years now, and I never wanted anything back in return other than support for my kids,"" Jones said. ""And as you can see, we have 45 of them here today.

""It's creating a memory for them that keeps me going. So what I've done over these last 24 years would not be possible without the relationships that I've had with the Chicago Bears, and it's just been a ride that I'm not ready to get off of yet.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/clfuf3pw6bsdz5qncn8p,N,,2026-01-14 14:03:46.912131

One of the youngest rosters in the league is poised to get even younger.

What can't be overlooked is how important the seven players taken in the first draft overseen by GM Darren Mougey and HC Aaron Glenn were to the team in the 2025 season. Though several had to deal with injuries (TE Mason Taylor, CB Azareye'h Thomas, LB Kiko Mauigoa and DL Tyler Baron) young men like S Malachi Moore and RT Armand Membou played -- and played well -- in all 17 games.

Moore Grabbing an Opportunity and Holding On

When opportunity knocked during his rookie season with the Jets, S Malachi Moore opened the door to what has the making of a long and productive career in the NFL.

Moore (5-11, 197) was the second of the Jets' two fourth-round selections in the 2025 NFL Draft after GM Darren Mougey completed a trade, swapping a fifth- and a sixth-round pick with the Eagles to move up 15 spots for the four-year starter and two-time captain at Alabama.

He got his first start of the season at Tampa Bay in Week 3 and then saw time at slot corner, his original position with the Crimson Tide before former coach Nick Saban suggested he move to safety. He got a chance to show his promise at safety when Andre Cisco (torn pectoral), who signed with the Green & White, sustained a season-ending injury in Week 8 at Cincinnati -- the team's first win of the Aaron Glenn era. Moore teamed with Tony Adams until Adams sustained a groin injury in Week 15 that ended his season. Moore stepped in at safety and never left the rest of the season.

""I feel like that's the best way to learn is to get thrown into the fire, because nothing is like a real game,"" Moore told team reporter Caroline Hendershot. ""And so when you finally get out there, I feel like the more reps I got, the more comfortable I became out there and just being comfortable with myself around the teammates on the field we were playing. I just think with more reps comes more experience and more confidence.""

Moore led all rookie defensive backs with 95 total tackles, 3 TFL, a forced fumble and 3 PDs. In the process he became the first Jets rookie DB with 90-plus tackles in a season in the last 20 years. Moore earned praise and guidance from a guy who wasn't a bad DB himself -- Glenn.

""AG, I love him,"" Moore said. ""I love playing for him, he's tough on all of us, but that's because he expects a lot out of us. You don't want anything else from a player. AG, he looks at us and he sees what we could be down in the future and not where we are right now. So that's how he coaches us. And you have nothing but respect and I've had fun playing for Coach AG. He brings energy to the program, to this organization. He wants us to play an old school style of football, fast, physical and violent, and that's what we try to do this year. And next year we'll try to do the same thing.""

Mauigoa Always in the Moment

Though he won't be suiting up for Miami in the National Championship game on Jan. 19, LB Francisco (Kiko) Mauigoa played a critical role for the Hurricanes during his two seasons there. After being taken in Round 5 last year, Mauigoa played well in 12 games before sustaining a season-ending neck injury against the Miami Dolphins in Week 14.

""The biggest takeaway from this year is just being able to enjoy every single moment, not taking any moment for granted,"" Mauigoa (6-2, 233) said. ""Because although I didn't finish the way I wanted to finish, they go out like that, just like that. So I'm taking every single moment in and soaking all the information in so that I'll be ready for Year 2. So I feel like that's the biggest thing is being able to learn from the vets, the guys that have been here and just be able to take it step by step and prepare for what's ahead.""

Over those 12 games, he was credited with 45 total tackles while taking 43% of the snaps on defense and contributing on special teams taking 60% of the snaps. He's bullish on his fellow draftees from last year and sees good things ahead.

""It's why they bought us here, right?"" he said. ""You got fresh bodies from college and guys that are here to make an impact. And I feel like every single one of us came in with the mindset that we're going to be able to contribute to this team and be able to make an impact.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/ygervpbtibacgdggqvb8,N,,2026-01-14 12:03:00.577901

Beal, who played for the New York Giants, was last seen near Virginia Beach in Virginia on July 12, 2025. He was 28 years old at the time he was reported missing but would now be 29.

According to details provided by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, which is a federal system for tracking people who have disappeared in the U.S., Beal's girlfriend was the last person to see him.

Beal's girlfriend reported that he borrowed her car and was supposed to head to work. Instead, she got a call from him a day later, with Beal reportedly saying that he was in Virginia Beach, but was headed home.

""Samuel has not been heard from or seen since the phone call,"" the NMUPS alert for him said.

Federal officials said they don't believe he brought anything with him to Virginia Beach other than the clothes he was wearing, some extra shoes and a wallet containing his credit card and driver's license.

When the vehicle was recovered in Virginia Beach by one of the girlfriend's family members, officials say, the family member found Beal's shoes and socks on the floor of the car along with some sand.

Virginia Beach is an oceanfront city in Virginia just north of the North Carolina border. It's unclear how far Beal drove to get to Virginia Beach, or how far it was from his work.

Beal's sister, Essence Zhane, shared a post on Facebook on Jan. 12 that included additional details about the case, urging anybody with info about the NFL player's disappearance to come forward.

In her post, Zhane included photos of a paid parking ticket for a beachfront lot in Virginia Beach with a timestamp from just before 6 p.m. on July 13.

""Tomorrow makes it 7 months since we’ve last heard from or seen my brother,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""We’ve done everything we could on our end to piece things together and at this point we’re in desperate need of support on all ends.""

Beal was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2018 supplemental draft, and appeared in six games as a cornerback for the team.

His career with the NFL was cut short in the 2020 season when he opted out of playing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to court documents, Beal was arrested in July 2020 during a traffic stop in Ohio, where he was charged with improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of marijuana. He was indicted a month later on the two weapons charges and initially entered a plea of not guilty. Beal eventually changed his plea to guilty in June 2021 and was placed on probation for a year.

Davis met with his doctor on Tuesday to be evaluated for the ligament damage he suffered late in Thursday’s game against the Utah Jazz when his left hand got scrunched up against Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen’s body while defending a drive to the basket. Davis had his left arm wrapped in a sling Saturday when the Mavericks faced the Chicago Bulls in the final game of their road trip.

Earlier Tuesday, Davis pushed back on reports that he had played his final game this regular season. On the social media platform X, Davis wrote “Lies!” in response to a since-deleted message stating he was set to undergo season-ending surgery on his left hand.

ESPN reported earlier Tuesday that Davis was “likely to undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his left hand and miss several months.”

On Monday, Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said Davis would be meeting with a hand specialist this week, and that it was too early to know if Davis would need surgery.

“I think that’s sometime this week that he’ll talk to the doctors, but there is no schedule or timetable on when he’s going to make that announcement,” Kidd said.

The Athletic reported Friday that Davis was expected to miss several weeks, even if he didn’t need surgery. In the weeks before he went down with his latest injury, the Mavericks were exploring his trade market. The Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors were two of the teams that registered interest, multiple league sources told The Athletic.

The Mavericks acquired Davis in a trade for Luka Dončić in February, but injuries have marred Davis’ time in Dallas. He suffered a left adductor strain in his first game with the Mavericks in February and missed close to six weeks. He was then sidelined for 14 consecutive games this season with a left calf strain.

The Mavericks have a 10-10 record when Davis plays this season and are 5-15 when he sits. In his 11-month Dallas tenure, Davis has played in 31 games and missed 44.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13130919/USATSI_27964831-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 12:03:08.967304

From the 2025 season's group, players like Emeka Egbuka, Carson Schwesinger and Tetairoa McMillan met those expectations. But it's not always that simple. Some rookies will get injured, not get enough playing time or struggle once they do get on the field.

Below, we're taking a look at all 32 rookie classes in the NFL and ranking the value of their contributions in 2025. We want to emphasize that this list is based only on how much production teams got out of their rookies in their first season -- it's not predictive. There might be great future contributions from rookies such as Travis Hunter(knee) and Cam Skattebo(ankle), but those players missed much of the 2025 campaign because of injury.

To rank the rookie classes, I started with Sports Info Solutions' total points metric. Based on game charting, total points takes every element of a play and uses that data to evaluate each player on a scale that allows us to compare between positions: How many points do we estimate that this player either earned for his offense or saved for his defense?Then I adjusted some teams up or down based on the importance of certain positions or how well players did in ESPN tracking metrics and the FTN Network DVOA ratings. (Postseason performance is not included.)

There's a significant gap this year between our top four teams and the rest of the league. Yet unlike in other recent seasons, this year's strongest rookie performances did not necessarily translate into immediate team turnarounds. Our top three teams had losing records.

1. New Orleans Saints

The Saints' rookie class is headlined by second-round quarterback Tyler Shough, who ranked 21st with a 49.2 QBR in nine starts. That's not quite ""the Saints are set for years"" territory, but Shough has certainly earned the right to come back and try to improve as the starter. (Just remember that he's already 26 years old.)

Shough's blind side was protected by first-round left tackle Kelvin Banks Jr.,who started all 17 games. He ranked above average in run block win rate (75.6%), although he was below average in pass block win rate (87.7%).

Then we go to the defensive side of the ball, where the Saints improved to a surprising 13th in defensive DVOA this season. In Ben Solak's All-Rookie team, he highlighted third-round pick Jonas Sanker as a premier communicator and coverage player who made plays from sideline to sideline. Fourth-rounderQuincy Riley, the team's third cornerback,was above average in my coverage DVOA metric and started five games. Another fourth-round pick, linebacker Danny Stutsman, didn't start any games but had 53 combined tackles. Next season, the Saints will also get back third-round defensive tackle Vernon Broughton, who suffered a season-ending hip injury in Week 2.

2. Cleveland Browns

Usually, the teams that lead in total points by rookies are going to be led by a quarterback. That's not the case here. Rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders both came out with negative total points and terrible QBRs (31.3 for Gabriel, 19.0 for Sanders). Those would have been the bottom two ratings in the league if Gabriel and Sanders had enough pass attempts to qualify.

The star in Cleveland was a linebacker. Second-round pickCarson Schwesingeris the clear favorite for Defensive Rookie of the Year and was second in total points among all rookies. Schwesinger's 156 combined tackles led all rookies by more than 50. He was joined on the defense by first-round defensive tackle Mason Graham, who started the entire season and improved significantly in November and December. Undrafted defensive tackle Adin Huntington also made an impact.

Meanwhile, the offensive skill positions for the Browns were filled with rookies. Tight end Harold Fannin Jr. was probably the best, with 72 receptions for 731 yards and six touchdowns. The Browns also had wide receiver Isaiah Bond and running backs Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson.

3. New York Giants

The Giants' rookie class was about quality rather than quantity. First-round quarterback Jaxson Dart led all rookies in total points and ranked 18th with a 57.8 QBR, thanks partly to the value of his run plays. No. 3 pick Abdul Carter had only four sacks, but his 56 pressures led all rookie edge rushers. Third-round defensive tackle Darius Alexander had 3.5 sacks as a rotational lineman. And fourth-round running backCam Skatteboenergized the team in five starts, with 410 rushing yards, 207 receiving yards and seven touchdowns before an ankle injury ended his season.

Seventh-round cornerback Korie Black and fifth-round offensive tackle Marcus Mbow also started games but didn't perform particularly well.

4. New England Patriots

Let's start with the left side of the offensive line. The Patriots got 13 starts out of left tackle Will Campbell (first round) and left guard Jared Wilson (third round) before they were injured in the final few games of the season. Campbell was below average in pass block win rate (88.3%), and Wilson (93%) was close to average for guards. Both were below average in run block win rate. Nonetheless, Campbell and Wilson were significant upgrades at their positions for the Patriots.

New England's other rookie who got a lot of attention was second-round running back TreVeyon Henderson. He had 180 carries for 911 yards and nine touchdowns. Four of his carries were touchdowns of 50 or more yards. But the player that total points registers as the most valuable is fourth-round safety Craig Woodson. He started 15 games and made 79 combined tackles with three passes defensed and two fumble recoveries.

Other rookies included third-round wide receiver Kyle Williams, fourth-round tackle Joshua Farmer, sixth-round kickerAndy Borregalesand two undrafted free agents in edge rusher Elijah Ponder and wide receiver Efton Chism III.

5. Carolina Panthers

The Panthers were the only team other than the Saints to have five rookies with 10 or more total points. But there was one real star: wide receiverTetairoa McMillan, the favorite to win Offensive Rookie of the Year. He finished the season with 70 catches for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns.

The Panthers used their second- and third-round picks on edge rushers, Nic Scourtonand Princely Umanmielen. Scourton finished the season with 5.0 sacks, and Umanmielen had 1.5 sacks. Fourth-round safety Lathan Ransom was also an important part of the Carolina defense, starting six games with 51 combined tackles, plus an interception, a sack and a forced fumble.

Other top rookies on offense included fifth-round tight end Mitchell Evans, fourth-round running back Trevor Etienneand sixth-round wide receiver Jimmy Horn Jr. Undrafted kicker Ryan Fitzgeraldfinished 24-of-29 on field goals and ranked third in my gross kickoff values.

6. Atlanta Falcons

The headline for Atlanta's rookie class was itstrade upto be able to select bothJalon Walker andJames Pearce Jr. at edge rusher in Round 1. Pearce had 10.5 sacks and 30 pressures, and Walker had 5.5 sacks and 23 pressures. However, the most important Falcons rookie turned out to be third-round safety Xavier Watts, who had five interceptions and 55 combined tackles. Watts finished fourth among rookies in total points, as the leading safety in a very good season for rookies at the position.

Fourth-round safetyBilly Bowman Jr. was another impactful rookie, with one interception and 1.5 sacks in six games before anAchilles injury in late November. Atlanta's rookie class was top-heavy rather than deep, as no other rookies had much playing time.

7. Chicago Bears

Let's start on offense. First-round tight end Colston Loveland (58 catches for 713 yards and six touchdowns) and second-round wide receiver Luther Burden III (47 catches for 652 yards and two touchdowns) had big seasons. Another one of Chicago's impact second-round picks was left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, who started seven games after an injury to veteran Braxton Jones. Seventh-round running back Kyle Monangai far outplayed his draft position with 169 carries for 783 yards and five touchdowns. And undrafted wideoutJahdae Walker'scatchin Week 16against the Packers sent the game into overtime.

The Bears got less out of rookies on defense, however. The third second-round pick, defensive tackle Shemar Turner, played only five games as a reserve before a torn ACL ended his season, and fourth-round linebackerRuben Hyppolite IIplayed in only seven games.

8. Los Angeles Chargers

The Chargers' rookie impact came primarily from skill players on offense, led by fifth-round tight endOronde Gadsden. He ended the season with 49 catches for 664 yards and three touchdowns. First-round running backOmarion Hamptonmissed games because of a fractured ankle but ended up with 124 carries for 545 yards and four touchdowns in nine games. Second-round wide receiverTre' Harriswas less productive than expected but had 30 catches for 324 yards and a touchdown.

On defense, the most impactful rookie was sixth-round safetyRJ Mickens. He started five games and had 29 combined tackles with two interceptions as part of a three-safety package with Derwin James Jr. and Elijah Molden. Third-round defensive tackle Jamaree Caldwell had five starts and 31 combined tackles with a forced fumble.

Other impact players included undrafted cornerback Nikko Reed and fifth-round wide receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith.

9. Baltimore Ravens

The Ravens' top rookies were almost entirely on defense. First-rounderMalaki Starks was a valuable rookie safety, starting 15 games with 84 combined tackles and two interceptions. Fourth-rounder Teddye Buchanan started 13 games at inside linebacker before tearing an ACL to end his season. He ended 2025 with 93 combined tackles. First-round edge rusher Mike Green had 3.5 sacks, and undrafted cornerback Keyon Martin had 23 combined tackles and a sack.

The one significant non-defensive contributor was sixth-round kicker Tyler Loop, who went 30-for-34 on field goals.

10. New York Jets

The Jets had yet another excellent rookie safety inMalachi Moore. He was a fourth-round selection but started 14 games and finished the season with 101 combined tackles. Third-round cornerback Azareye'h Thomas started five games with 22 combined tackles and seven passes defensed. The Jets also got value from fifth-round linebackerKiko Mauigoa.

On offense, the big name was Armand Membou. The seventh overall selection slid right into the right tackle spot and ranked ninth out of all tackles with a 79.1% run block win rate. Second-round tight end Mason Taylor had 44 catches for 369 yards and a touchdown. Fourth-round receiver Arian Smith played a little but had just 52 receiving yards. We can't really give the Jets credit for undrafted quarterback Brady Cook. He was forced to start four games because of injuries and had an 11.6 QBR.

11. Tennessee Titans

No. 1 pick Cam Ward was not good from a statistical perspective, with a 33.1 QBR. Ward took a league-high 55 sacks and completed less than 60% of his passes. These stats are a part of why the Titans are down here at No. 11 despite starting a rookie quarterback all season. However, most film watchers strongly believe that Ward played well despite those stats and was victimized by a poor supporting cast.

Of course, a lot of that supporting cast was also made up of rookies. Fourth-round wide receivers Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike had a combined 89 catches for 938 yards and eight touchdowns. Dike was also one of the top return men in the league with two punt return touchdowns. Tight end Gunnar Helm, taken in the fourth round between Dike and Ayomanor, had 44 catches for 357 yards and two touchdowns.

On defense, the top performer was third-round safety Kevin Winston Jr., who started six games with 34 combined tackles. Sixth-round cornerback Marcus Harrisstarted five games with 28 combined tackles and five passes defensed.

12. Dallas Cowboys

The Cowboys' first two picks were their top two rookies. Tyler Booker was above average among guards with a 93.1% pass block win rate and 75.1% run block win rate. Edge rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku had only two sacks but 23 pressures and 40 combined tackles.

At cornerback, Trikweze Bridges was actually a seventh-round pick of the Chargers, but the Cowboys picked him up after Los Angeles cut him, and he played 16 games with two starts, 23 combined tackles and an interception. Third-round pick Shavon Revel Jr. was injured for the first part of the season but came back to start five games with 35 combined tackles. And fifth-round linebacker Shemar James started six games and had 91 combined tackles, 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble.

13. Miami Dolphins

The Dolphins had a lot of rookie impact players who didn't necessarily have outstanding numbers. For example, first-round defensive tackle Kenneth Grant played in all 17 games but had just 33 combined tackles with two sacks. Left guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a second-round pick, started the entire season but finished near the bottom of the league with an 87.2% pass block win rate and a 65.8% run block win rate. Fifth-round safety Dante Trader Jr. had 54 combined tackles but just one pass defensed. Fifth-round cornerback Jason Marshall Jr. played in 12 games and had 23 combined tackles, four passes defensed and an interception.

At the bottom of the board, sixth-round running back Ollie Gordon II had 70 carries for 199 yards and three touchdowns. Seventh-round defensive tackle Zeek Biggers played nine games with 20 combined tackles and 1.5 sacks. And seventh-round quarterback Quinn Ewers eventually took over when Tua Tagovailoa was benched, starting three games with a 31.3 QBR.

14. Arizona Cardinals

The Cardinals' draft class was led by two cornerbacks. The real surprise was fifth-round pick Denzel Burke, who ranked 35th out of 98 qualifying corners in my coverage DVOA metric, starting eight games with 11 passes defensed and three interceptions. The success of second-round pick Will Johnson was more expected; he started 10 games with 10 passes defensed and was 57th in my cornerback coverage DVOA metric.

Fourth-round linebacker Cody Simon started nine games with 76 combined tackles, undrafted left tackle Josh Fryar started five games after Paris Johnson Jr. was injured, and seventh-round safety Kitan Crawford played 15 games with 20 combined tackles.

Arizona might have ranked higher if first-round defensive tackle Walter Nolen III had been able to play more than six games. He was actually the Cardinals' leader in total points, despite missing much of the season, and had two sacks, two passes defensed and a fumble recovery for a touchdown.

15. Buffalo Bills

Buffalo's rookie leader in total points was fourth-round defensive tackle Deone Walker. He started 16 games in the middle, with 39 combined tackles and a sack. Second-round defensive tackleT.J. Sandersstarted two games and had 16 combined tackles and a sack. The Bills also got help from two cornerbacks. First-rounder Maxwell Hairston missed the first month and a half of the season because of alateral collateral ligament sprain but came back to play 11 games with three starts. He had five passes defensed and two picks. Sixth-rounder Dorian Strong played four games in September with a major role before suffering a neck injury.

On offense, fifth-round pick Jackson Hawes had 16 catches for 187 yards and three touchdowns at tight end, while also providing outstanding blocking in the run game.

16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Let's start with first-round wide receiverEmeka Egbuka. His production slowed down in the second half of the season, but that's in part because Baker Mayfield was throwing him fewer catchable passes. For the entire season, Egbuka had 63 catches for 938 yards and six touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Tez Johnson, a seventh-round pick, had 27 catches for 322 yards and five touchdowns.

Meanwhile at cornerback, the Bucs were getting production out of second-round pick Benjamin Morrison and third-round pick Jacob Parrish. Parrish became the regular slot cornerback and finished with 76 combined tackles, seven passes defensed, two picks and two sacks. Morrison played in 10 games and had 26 combined tackles with four passes defensed. The Bucs also got help from defensive linemen, fifth-rounder Elijah Roberts and the undrafted Elijah Simmons.

17. Denver Broncos

The top Broncos rookie was second-round running back RJ Harvey, who led all rookie backs in receiving value, according to my DYAR metrics. His standard stats included 146 carries for 540 yards and seven touchdowns, plus 47 catches for 356 yards and five touchdowns. Also on offense, third-round wide receiver Pat Bryant finished with 31 catches for 378 yards and a touchdown in 15 games.

On defense, the top rookie was first-round cornerback Jahdae Barron. He played in all 17 games, starting five, with 35 combined tackles, five passes defensed and one interception. Fourth-round edge rusher Que Robinson played in only six games, garnering 12 combined tackles with a half-sack.

Sixth-round punter Jeremy Crawshaw was around league average in gross punt value once adjusting for the altitude in Denver.

18. Philadelphia Eagles

Much of Philadelphia's impact came from two defensive players, first-round linebacker Jihaad Campbell and second-round safety Andrew Mukuba. Campbell played in all 17 games, with 10 starts, and had 80 combined tackles with an interception. Mukuba played 11 games, also starting 10, and had 46 combined tackles with two interceptions. Campbell and Mukuba each ranked among the top-13 defensive rookies in total points.

But there wasn't much after that. Fifth-round center Drew Kendallstarted one game and played in seven. Fourth-round defensive tackle Ty Robinson played in 11 games, and fifth-round linebackerSmael Mondon Jr. played in all 17, primarily on special teams, with 11 combined tackles.

19. Seattle Seahawks

First-rounderGrey Zabel started all 17 games at left guard. He led all guards with an 83.0% run block win rate when no other guard was above 80%, but he had a below-average pass block win rate of 89.9%. The other major addition for the Seahawks was second-round pick Nick Emmanwori. Nominally a safety, Emmanwori actually bounced between linebacker and slot cornerback. His ability to play the run allowed the Seahawks to constantly stay in nickel personnel, even on clear run downs. Emmanwori finished the season with 81 combined tackles, 11 passes defensed and 2.5 sacks.

None of the other Seattle rookies played more than 13 games. Tight end Elijah Arroyo, another second-round selection, finished the season with just 15 catches for 179 yards and a touchdown. Fifth-round wide receiver Tory Horton had 13 catches for 161 yards and a surprising five touchdowns in just eight games. Fifth-round fullback Robbie Ouzts was an important part of the run game but didn't catch a pass.

20. Houston Texans

Let's start with second-round left tackle Aireontae Ersery, who started most of the season. He had a low pass block win rate of 88.2% but was closer to average with a 73.6% run block win rate. At running back, Ersery was often blocking for fourth-round pick Woody Marks, who finished the regular season with 196 carries for 703 yards and two touchdowns (plus three receiving touchdowns). The Texans' offense also featured two rookie receivers from Iowa State:Jayden Higgins(41 catches for 525 yards and six touchdowns) andJaylin Noel(26 catches for 292 yards and two touchdowns).

On defense, the Texans got smaller contributions from sixth-round safety Jaylen Reed (seven games) and third-round cornerback Jaylin Smith (four games).

21. Kansas City Chiefs

First-round pick Josh Simmonsmanaged to start only eight games as the Chiefs' top rookie. He was above average with a 91.6% pass block win rate but below average with a 71.6% run block win rate. Undrafted Esa Pole started four games when Simmons was out late in the season with a wrist injury.

On defense, third-round cornerback Nohl Williams had five starts and 48 combined tackles with five passes defensed. Another cornerback, undrafted free agentKevin Knowles, pitched in on special teams and also had two passes defensed late in the season. Third-round edge rusher Ashton Gillotte had 38 combined tackles and 1.5 sacks. Second-round defensive tackle Omarr Norman-Lottplayed only five games before a torn ACL.

The Chiefs also had seventh-round running back Brashard Smith, who was particularly good as a receiver. He had 44 carries for 151 yards and 25 catches for 172 yards and a touchdown.

22. Detroit Lions

Second-rounderTate Ratledge started all 17 games at right guard, although he was below average in both pass block (87.4%) and run block (69.9%) win rates. First-round defensive tackle Tyleik Williams started 10 games and played in all 17, with 18 combined tackles and a sack. Third-round wide receiver Isaac TeSlaa had 16 catches for 239 yards, but six of those receptions were touchdowns, mostly of the highlight film variety.

The only other Lions draft picks to even play were fifth-round guard Miles Frazier (five games, no starts) and seventh-round receiver Dominic Lovett (12 games, mostly on special teams).

23. Cincinnati Bengals

The top Bengals rookie was second-round linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. He had 14 starts and racked up 106 combined tackles with three sacks and two interceptions. Fourth-round linebacker Barrett Carter got 12 starts next to Knight and also had 106 combined tackles. Elsewhere on defense, first-round edge rusher Shemar Stewartplayed only eight games because of injuries and had just a single sack and eight pressures.

On offense, third-round left guard Dylan Fairchildstarted 15 games but was below average in both pass block (90.3%) and run block (70.2%) win rates. Across from Fairchild, fifth-round lineman Jalen Rivers started seven games at right guard in the middle of the season.

24. Indianapolis Colts

How much do you value one player on a list like this? The Colts got a fantastic showing from first-round tight end Tyler Warren, who had 76 catches for 817 yards and four touchdowns. He also scored a touchdown on the ground. But after Warren, there's a significant falloff in production from the Colts rookies, most of whom played limited seasons.

Quarterback Riley Leonard, a sixth-round pick, had a good game in his Week 17 start but didn't play much otherwise, as the Colts chose to sign veteran Philip Rivers because of worries about a knee sprain for Leonard. Fourth-round pick Jalen Travis started four games at right tackle. Second-round edge JT Tuimoloau played in 13 games but had just 17 combined tackles without a sack. Undrafted cornerback Johnathan Edwards started five games, and undrafted safety Reuben Lowery III started one.

25. Washington Commanders

Here's another team led by a rookie offensive tackle, this time first-round pick Josh Conerly Jr. He started all 17 games on the right side but was below average in both pass block (88.8%) and run block (71.2%) win rates. Seventh-round running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt took over as the Commanders' starter for much of the season and had 175 carries for 805 yards and eight touchdowns. Fourth-round wide receiver Jaylin Lane (16 catches for 225 yards) also made an impact.

On defense, the most impactful rookie was second-round cornerback Trey Amos, who played in 10 games and started eight before a broken leg ended his season.

26. Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders finished the season with one of the 10 worst run offenses of the past 45 years, according to DVOA, but it wasn't running backAshton Jeanty's fault. The No. 6 pick was near the top of the league in missed tackle rate; there's only so far you can get without good blocking. Speaking of the blockers, third-round pick Caleb Rogers started six games at right guard, and another third-round pick, Charles Grant, started one at left tackle.

The Raiders had two rookie wide receivers, but they didn't get on the field too much until the last month of the year. Second-rounder Jack Bech finished with 20 catches for 224 yards, and fourth-rounderDont'e Thornton Jr.had 10 catches for 135 yards.

The Raiders got defensive contributions from undrafted free agent cornerbackGreedy Vance(who played six games at the end of the season) and two defensive tackles who each appeared in nine games, fourth-rounder Tonka Hemingway and seventh-rounder JJ Pegues.

27. San Francisco 49ers

The top rookiefor San Francisco was third-round nickel cornerback Upton Stout. He was, shall we say, stout against the run but came out near the bottom of the league in my coverage DVOA metric after adjusting for an easier-than-average set of coverage assignments. Fifth-round safety Marques Sigle also got seven starts in the secondary and had 52 combined tackles.

Up front, the 49ers got value out of second-round defensive tackleAlfred Collins(one sack, 17 tackles) and fourth-round defensive tackleC.J. West(one sack, 21 tackles). First-round edge rusher Mykel Williams had one sack and 20 tackles before a season-ending ACL tear. Seventh-round guard Connor Colby started six games.

28. Pittsburgh Steelers

The surprise for the Steelers is that they didn't get more out of first-round defensive tackle Derrick Harmon, who missed six games with various knee injuries. He ended the regular season with 27 combined tackles and three sacks but should be more of a force in future seasons.

Instead, the most valuable Steelers rookies were elsewhere on the defense. Fourth-round outside linebacker Jack Sawyerhad 34 tackles, a sack and two interceptions. Fifth-round defensive end Yahya Black had 28 combined tackles and two forced fumbles. Third-round running back Kaleb Johnson had just 28 carries for 69 yards and infamously forgot to field a kickoff, which led to a Seahawks touchdown in Week 2.

29. Green Bay Packers

Aaron Nagler of Cheesehead TV warned me before the season not to get too excited about first-round pick Matthew Goldenbecause the Packers don't like to feature rookies at the wide receiver position. He was right. Golden caught only 29 passes for 361 yards and a touchdown in 2025. Look for him to play a bigger role in the offense in future years. We'll also see how Savion Williams develops; the third-round gadget receiver had 11 carries for 37 yards and 10 catches for 78 yards and a touchdown.

The Packers also got seven starts from second-round offensive lineman Anthony Belton and contributions from defensive linemen Warren Brinson (13 tackles) and the undrafted Nazir Stackhouse (12 tackles).

30. Minnesota Vikings

Much like the Colts, almost all the rookie value for the Vikings came from a single first-round pick. Minnesota took guard Donovan Jacksonwith the No. 24 selection, and he was a quality starter for most of the season. Jackson finished with a 92.6% pass block win rate (average for guards) and a 76.9% run block win rate (well above average).

And then ... that's about it. Undrafted free agent quarterback Max Brosmer was terrible when forced into action (14.0 QBR), and any other rookies had very minor impacts. This is Minnesota's second straight year at or near the bottom of this list.

31. Jacksonville Jaguars

Oh, what might have been ifTravis Hunterhad stayed healthy. The No. 2 pick did realize his goal of playing both ways at wide receiver and cornerback but suffered a knee injury during practice in October that ended his season. He finished with 298 receiving yards and a touchdown, plus 15 combined tackles and three passes defensed.

Otherwise, the top Jaguars rookie was fourth-round running back Bhayshul Tuten, with 307 rushing yards and seven combined touchdowns in 15 games. Safety Rayuan Lane III had 20 combined tackles, while seventh-round center Jonah Monheim started two games and undrafted edge rusher Danny Striggow started two games with 0.5 sacks.

32. Los Angeles Rams

The Rams were No. 1 on this list a year ago. This year's draft wasn't quite as productive, in part because the Rams traded away their first-round pick.

Second-round tight end Terrance Ferguson missed the first couple of games then gradually worked his way into the lineup. However, his 231 receiving yards and three touchdowns were behind a number of other rookies in a very good season for rookie tight ends. Third-round defensive end Josaiah Stewart had 22 combined tackles and three sacks. Seventh-round wide receiver Konata Mumpfield had 10 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown. Undrafted free agent linebacker Shaun Dolacmade an impact, particularly early in the season.

Has Sean Payton been holding back on offense ahead of NFL playoffs? | Broncos Mailbag

In his absence, P.J. Locke stepped into the starting lineup and has played solid football. Locke injured his ankle against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 and did not return to the game, though he took part in Denver's late-week practices last week and was not listed at all on Denver's Tuesday injury report.

""Yeah, no, B.J. was an amazing player,"" fellow safety Talanoa Hufanga said of Jones. ""It sucks that we lose a guy like that. But a guy like P.J. who studies his ass off is right there in line to be the next-best guy. So for me to play with him, it’s been amazing. We’ve never had, like, any lack of communication. It’s just learning what we’re comfortable with. We didn’t get training-camp reps together, it was a lot of me and B-Jones.

""So, for me, just getting these reps with him, we’ve definitely kinda settled into what we can disguise together, where we’re trying to be. And at the end of the day, meet at the ball, and try to take it away.”

Outside of Jones, though, the Broncos appear on track to get several other players back in the mix.

Inside linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) practiced Tuesday and Denver opened the 21-day practice window for tight end Lucas Krull (foot), who has been on injured reserve since Week 5. Inside linebacker Drew Sanders (foot) was a limited participant Tuesday after having his return-to-play window opened Saturday.

Starting defensive end John Franklin-Myers also returned to practice Tuesday, after missing last Friday with the birth of his third child.

Two other players who missed snaps due to ankle injuries against the Chargers, left tackle Garett Bolles and center Alex Forsyth, were not listed on Tuesday's injury report and are thus considered fully healthy.

Center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) isn't eligible to return from injured reserve until next week, but he did conditioning work on the side field Tuesday during the open portion of practice. Payton said after Wattenberg was hurt that his injury would keep him out right about the minimum of four weeks, so it's possible he'll be in the mix for the AFC Championship Game should the Broncos advance past Buffalo on Saturday.

Banged up Bills. While Denver had every player on its 53-man roster at practice in some capacity plus two candidates to return from injured reserve, the Bills had a lengthy injury report.

They listed 14 players overall, including quarterback Josh Allen with foot, knee and right finger issues. They also found out that receiver Tyrell Shavers tore his ACL.

Overall, Buffalo had five players on the 53-man roster who didn't practice at all Tuesday. Everybody on the 53 in Denver practiced.

Buffalo could get a couple of players back from injured reserve in defensive tackle Ed Oliver (bicep) and wide receiver Curtis Samuel (elbow). Oliver was limited and Samuel full on Tuesday.

Bolles appreciates All-Pro nod. Left tackle Garett Bolles is having a banner year in his ninth NFL season. He is a Pro Bowl starter, he is the Broncos' Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee and Saturday he was named an Associated Press first-team All-Pro.

""I'm proud to represent this organization and to be able to get that accolade,"" Bolles said Tuesday. ""We have a lot of people in that locker room that deserve it. ... I'm grateful for all of them. We know where we're going. And, obviously, when you're winning and you're doing those types of things, obviously you're going to get those kind of accolades.

Gabrielle, a lifestyle blogger and content creator, posted a heartfelt end-of-season tribute to her husband on Instagram Jan. 13.

Two days prior, the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles – who clinched back-to-back NFC East titles – were eliminated in the wild-card round in a shocking loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

""Season 6 ✅ Always a little bittersweet when it doesn’t end the way you hope, but this year in Philly was still so special. So many memories, incredible people, and moments we’ll always be grateful for,"" Gabrielle wrote in her post.

He would end up playing in seven regular-season games, rushing for 60 yards on 12 carries and catching three passes for 21 yards. He was inactive for the Eagles' playoff game.

In the Premier League squad, the most logical move would be Ramsay — adding a defender would move him back down the pecking order.","Conor Bradley’s season-ending knee injury has reduced Liverpool’s slim defensive options even further.

Head coach Arne Slot has already spent most of the season without summer signing Giovanni Leoni, who arrived at the end of August and suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in September’s Carabao Cup tie with Southampton.

Eight senior defensive options became seven, and now it has dropped to six — right-back Jeremie Frimpong, centre-backs Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez and left-backs Milos Kerkez and Andrew Robertson.

It is a precarious predicament, and while all indications were that they are set for a quiet January window, this latest injury setback should change that.

Earlier this season, adding defensive reinforcements seemed necessary due to Konate’s poor form, but the France international has looked more secure in recent weeks. Instead, additions are required because they are one more injury away from being in serious trouble.

Kerkez was the only fit senior defender who did not feature in the 4-1 FA Cup third-round victory over Barnsley and although Slot said before the game he would play a strong team, Van Dijk playing another 90 minutes felt unnecessary.

In recent weeks, right-back Calvin Ramsay and centre-back Wellity Lucky have been regulars on the bench due to Liverpool’s lack of squad depth. A tie against Barnsley, who lie 16th in the third-tier League One, offered an opportunity for Slot to give them first-team game time, but he didn’t. Ramsay, 22, was an unused substitute and Lucky, 20, did not make the matchday squad. Unless there is an extreme injury crisis, Slot is clearly reluctant to use them.

Liverpool have already been treading a fine line. Gomez, whose unfortunate injury history is well known, has been the only cover for centre-backs Van Dijk and Konate — and now the 28-year-old will also have to be the primary backup option at right-back for the remainder of the season.

Despite limited game time, Gomez has still needed to manage a knee injury this season. Frimpong, who has been playing right wing in recent weeks due to attacking shortages, has missed more than a dozen Liverpool games due to hamstring injuries. Konate’s chequered injury past — even if he has largely been reliable since Slot’s arrival — cannot be ignored either.

“Jeremie Frimpong has to play a lot of minutes, also comes back from an injury, has missed out on three or four months of a lot of playing time,” Slot told reporters in his post-Barnsley press conference.

“I liked him again today, by the way, but I have to make sure he can play again at the weekend and then we go to Marseille and to Bournemouth. It is nine games in January with six defenders available. I have to manage it in the right way.”

That sounds like a head coach who will have to find solutions internally.

Whenever Slot has been asked about his limited options at centre-back, for example, he has frequently referenced midfielders Ryan Gravenberch and Wataru Endo as possibilities. He has also shifted Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones from midfield to right-back.

Experimenting with Szoboszlai at right-back was forced on Slot in the opening weeks of the campaign because of injuries to Bradley and Frimpong. Wins were secured against Newcastle United, Arsenal and Burnley but its effectiveness has diminished.

Bradley and Frimpong were missing for the successive home defeats to Nottingham Forest, when Szoboszlai started at right-back, and PSV, when Jones lined up there. Opponents have begun targeting the defensive deficiencies of a midfielder playing out of position. Liverpool have looked more balanced with a natural right-back.

Liverpool’s ongoing 11-game unbeaten run has seen them start a defender at right-back in each game. Slot has also used more midfielders in his starting XI. That may change with Hugo Ekitike back fit and when Mohamed Salah returns from the Africa Cup of Nations, but needing to use a midfielder at right-back weakens the depth of another area of the squad while papering over the cracks of another.

Slot has made it very clear in recent press conferences that there is still plenty for his side to achieve this season. His strong line-up against Barnsley was an indication of his thoughts on an FA Cup run. Performances against Inter Milan and Real Madrid suggest a deep run in the Champions League is not improbable, but qualification for next season’s edition is a must.

Not accelerating summer plans — which Liverpool have done in the past — or making any move risks putting those aspirations in jeopardy.

Signing a right-back on loan, for instance, would be a sensible short-term solution, but whether players considered good enough are available is a different question. It would be more likely that Liverpool think long-term and buy a player who will help in the present and the future.

Their squad size — ironically, given the lack of options Slot has had available to him for recent games — does present an issue. They only have homegrown spaces available to register any new signings, which is one of the reasons Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi continues to make perfect sense.

A £35million ($47m) deal was all but finalised at the end of the transfer window until Palace pulled the plug. There is no guarantee Guehi leaves this month, as he will be a free agent and have his pick of clubs in the summer, but Manchester City are pushing to sign him.

If Liverpool made a signing that was neither under-21 nor homegrown, it would require them to unregister one of their 17 non-homegrown players.

In the Premier League squad, the most logical move would be Ramsay — adding a defender would move him back down the pecking order. Outside of him, it would mean sacrificing another lesser-used squad player, such as Federico Chiesa or Endo — although neither feels like a realistic possibility.

In the Champions League, even if the player was under-21, they would have to be registered. That would be a tougher decision — Ramsay was not originally included and Leoni, who also could not be classed as an under-21 player because he has not been at the club for over two years, has already been replaced by Chiesa.

Chiesa was the surprise omission from the initial squad, with Rio Ngumoha chosen ahead of him. The former has played 61 minutes across three appearances in the Champions League, while the latter clocked up 16 minutes in his only appearance on matchday one against Atletico Madrid.

Linebacker Dre Greenlaw, who was one of the Broncos' biggest free agency acquisitions this past offseason, returned to the practice field and is on track to play in the divisional round game at Empower Field at Mile High.

Greenlaw, who missed eight games this season because of injuries and one because of a suspension, had missed the last two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury.

Greenlaw left the Broncos' Dec. 21 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars when he pulled up trying to chase down Travis Etienne Jr. with just over two minutes left in the game. He had missed six other games earlier this season with a thigh injury.

""It's good to have a healthy Dre Greenlaw back in the game,'' Broncos coach Sean Payton said after Tuesday's practice, the Broncos' first on-field work of the week.

Given the Bills led the league in rushing this season with 159.6 yards per game, it is a welcome return even for a Broncos defense that has been one of the league's best this season. Especially since it was also the Bills who unceremoniously shoved the Broncos out of the playoffs this past January with 210 yards rushing in the 31-7 wild-card win with 79 of those rushing yards coming in the first quarter alone.

James Cook III, who led the league in rushing this season with 1,621 rushing yards with a 5.25 yards per carry average that was second best in the NFL, finished Buffalo's playoff win this past January with 120 yards on his 23 carries.

""Obviously they whupped our butt last year,'' Broncos outside linebacker Nik Bonitto said.

""There were a lot of things we felt coming away from a game like that [such as], 'we're not there yet [and] we need to improve,''' Payton said. ""It's the runner, it's the scheme. ... We'll have to be ready.''

The Broncos signed Greenlaw to a three-year, $31.5 million contract last March with the hope he would add some physicality to a defense that had some difficulty limiting opponents' explosive runs in the 2024 season. But he missed the offseason program with thigh injuries as well as the Broncos' first six games of the season.

He was also suspended for a game -- the Broncos' Oct. 26 win over the Dallas Cowboys -- because of a postgame confrontation with referee Brad Allen after the Broncos' win over the New York Giants. At the time, the NFL said Greenlaw ""chased after referee Brad Allen and verbally threatened him as he tried to leave the field.''

The Broncos finished No. 2 in run defense overall this season -- 91.1 rushing yards allowed per game -- and had the highest rate of run stops at, or behind, the line of scrimmage this season at 30.3%.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0114%2Fr1600311_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 04:02:19.256899

The Broncos return to practice Tuesday in preparation for their AFC Divisional round playoff game against the Buffalo Bills.

The anticipation is inside linebacker Dre Greenlaw will be out there among ‘em. Still, it would be wise if Justin Strnad keeps his chin strip buckled tight.

Starting with the final week of April, Greenlaw missed six months with a nagging quad injury, returned to play in eight games, then suffered a hamstring injury late in the Broncos’ 11-game-winning streak-snapping loss to Jacksonville on December 21 and missed the final two regular-season games.

The “soft-tissue” injury, as they’re called, has so plagued Greenlaw it wouldn’t be a surprise if he again returns on a limited snap count this week against the Bills. When Greenlaw returned from his quad injury in late-October, he played 21 and 27 snaps in his first two games back while his backup Strnad played 41 and 57 snaps.

The Broncos should also return defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers to practice Tuesday. Franklin-Myers had been recently bothered by a strained hip that caused him to sit out the previous 1 ½ games.

Meanwhile, the Broncos were hoping center Luke Wattenberg could return for next week’s AFC Championship Game providing all goes well Saturday afternoon against the Bills at Empower Field at Mile High.

Then there’s the longer-term injuries to safety Brandon Jones and running back J.K. Dobbins. Jones did have surgery to repair a torn pec muscle, sources tell 9NEWS, with the team keeping open the possibility the safety could return by Super Bowl 60, again if the Broncos make it that far. Dobbins had surgery to repair a Lisfranc injury suffered Nov. 6 in a 10-7 win against the Raiders. Head coach Sean Payton has said he hopes Dobbins returns ""soon.""

Keep in mind, the usual recovery time for those respective injuries – torn pec and Lisfranc -- extends beyond the February 8 Super Bowl date. Jones’ pec injury occurred near the end of the first half of the Broncos’ win against Green Bay on December 14. The Super Bowl would be just seven weeks from his injury.

Asked Tuesday if he thought Jones would make it back, Broncos head coach Sean Payton paused to think about it, thn said, ""I don't think so."" He thought some more and repeated, ""I don't think so.""

Still, Jones obviously hasn't given up. He was working out on the side rehab field during the early portion of practice Tuesday. And again, the Broncos did keep his return window open for longshot chance at Super Bowl.

Dobbins’ Lisfranc issue would be three months from the Super Bowl. Former Broncos All Pro left tackle Ryan Clady suffered a Lisfranc injury in week 2 of the 2013 season and was unable to return in time for Super Bowl 48.

Then again, there may be no better medicine than motivation. Neither Jones or Dobbins, who were 2020 draft class mates – Jones in the third round by Miami and Dobbins in the second round by Baltimore - have played in a Super Bowl as their sixth NFL season winds down.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/e1e56de9-0db2-42ec-bafb-edba8fcaa88a/20260113T192454/e1e56de9-0db2-42ec-bafb-edba8fcaa88a_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 04:02:23.854249

American snowboarder Chloe Kim shared an optimistic update on her status for the Milan Cortina Olympics.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist said she’s ""good to go"" for the competition despite dealing with the effects of a torn labrum in her shoulder. Kim sustained the injury during a recent training run in Switzerland.

The 2026 Games are scheduled to begin in less than a month, giving Kim a short window to recover and pursue her third consecutive gold medal in the halfpipe. Kim won gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang and again in 2022 in Beijing.

In an update posted to Instagram Tuesday, Kim said she wasn’t surprised to learn she had torn her labrum, the lining of the socket that holds the shoulder together. She did not specify which shoulder was injured when she fell while preparing for the upcoming Laax Open.

""There are two ways to do it, and the way I did it is less severe than the other, so I’m really happy about that,"" she said. ""Obviously, I’m really disappointed that I can’t snowboard until right before the Olympics, which is going to be hard. I haven’t gotten nearly the amount of reps that I would have liked, but that’s OK.""

LINDSEY VONN, 41, CONTINUES REMARKABLE COMEBACK WITH WORLD CUP DOWNHILL WIN AHEAD OF OLYMPICS

The women’s Olympic halfpipe contest begins Feb. 11.

The 25-year-old Kim, who has already qualified for the U.S. team, would be the heavy favorite to win in Italy if she’s healthy. She said she won’t compete this weekend in Laax. She didn’t mention the Winter X Games in Aspen later this month, which are the last big contest before the Olympics.

Kim has participated in only one competition this season — last month in Copper Mountain — and while warming up for the final there, she sustained a shoulder injury.

Last week, she posted video of her fall in Switzerland, which showed her skittering across the halfpipe after losing her bearings on the landing of a jump. At that time, she said she dislocated the shoulder and wasn’t in much pain. An MRI from last Friday revealed the labrum tear.

In her video, Kim said she’ll have to wear a ""super-sexy shoulder brace"" that is uncomfortable.

""I went through a bunch of different waves of emotions, but, honestly, I’m really excited for this week,"" she said.

Prior to that game, Cooper told Tampa play-by-play broadcaster Dave Randorf that they avoid the “worst-case scenario” on Point.
“But he is week to week.” Any absence longer than three weeks would jeopardize Point’s availability for the Olympics.
Maybe an injury replacement offers Team Canada a chance for a do-over there and they can rethink roles in other ways.
One way or another, if Point needs replacing, it’s another difficult decision coming for Team Canada and one that won’t please everyone.","Jon Cooper called it “the elephant in the room.”

The Tampa Bay Lightning coach had just watched one of his NHL team’s best forwards, Brayden Point, have to be helped off the ice Monday in Philadelphia, unable to put any weight on his right leg. And, as Team Canada’s coach, Cooper had also watched one of his Olympic team’s more trusted players injured with the start of the Milan Cortina Olympics just around the corner.

“I mean, there’s a big tournament coming up in a month, and he’s a big part of us,” Cooper said. “Let’s just hope everything turns out all right.”

The early indications aren’t encouraging. The Lightning haven’t placed any firm timelines or revealed the nature of the injury to Point’s right knee, but a league source said Tuesday that it’s “not good.”

The injury occurred moments after Point scored a power-play goal for the Lightning. As he stretched out to knock home a rebound, Flyers defenseman Cam York fell awkwardly on his right leg. Point immediately threw off his gloves and grabbed for the knee. Teammate Nikita Kucherov and Lightning head athletic trainer Tom Mulligan then slowly helped him off the ice.

Point traveled with the Lightning to Pittsburgh, where they’re set to face the Penguins on a back-to-back Tuesday. Prior to that game, Cooper told Tampa play-by-play broadcaster Dave Randorf that they avoid the “worst-case scenario” on Point.

“His season is not over,” said Cooper. “But he is week to week.”

Any absence longer than three weeks would jeopardize Point’s availability for the Olympics. NHL players are due to charter to Milan on Feb. 7, and Olympic teams have until the Feb. 11 start of the tournament to make injury replacements. Beyond that date, they are limited to the 25 players on their official roster.

Point was one of six players named to the initial Canadian roster in June. A two-time Stanley Cup winner and former 50-goal scorer, his versatility was on display while helping Canada win the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. Point played both center and right wing at that event, including seeing time beside Connor McDavid during the championship game.

He had a slow start to the season for Tampa Bay, but his game was rounding into much better shape over the past month. Point has scored eight goals and 19 points in 15 games since Dec. 9, helping the Atlantic Division-leading Lightning to a 10-game winning streak in the process.

“The tough part for Pointer is his game had really turned the corner, and it seemed like he was scoring every night for us,” Cooper said.

The Calgary native hasn’t previously represented his country at the Olympics.

In the event that Point’s injury knocks him out of the tournament, Canada general manager Doug Armstrong’s management team has a group of forwards already standing by in reserve to select a replacement from.

Obviously, everyone involved hopes Point recovers in time for Milan. But in the meantime, conversations need to be had in case he ultimately has to be replaced.

On Dec. 31, the day Canada’s roster was announced, Armstrong explained how they would go about assembling the reserve list should an injury occur.

“We’ve worked a (reserve) list that we think checks a lot of different boxes,” Armstrong told The Athletic. “So if this player gets hurt, and he performs a certain role, what replacement do we want?

“We’ll want to make sure we keep as many options available so that we take the player that’s playing the best in the area we need him.”

In other words, there isn’t necessarily one specific player who is the “next man up” should an injury require a roster change. The replacement would depend on two factors: the candidate’s performance at the time of consideration and the skill set and role of the player being replaced.

Sam Bennett, Connor Bedard, Wyatt Johnston, Mark Scheifele, Seth Jarvis and Travis Konecny are among those on the reserve list, according to league sources.

What role would Point have on the Olympic roster, if healthy? One league source said the plan was to play him on the top line alongside McDavid. As mentioned, that’s where Point was in the championship game, but there was some line-blending and line-matching as the game went. He also played some center in that tournament.

Either way, he would be headed for a top-six role in Milan.

There are two ways Team Canada could go about replacing him: Replace him with a player who can directly take over his role or elevate a player already named to the team to that role and backfill at the bottom.

If Team Canada was looking for a player who could play both center and wing and also, like Point, was a right shot, that would bring Bedard and Johnston especially into focus. One can’t discount fellow right-hand shots Scheifele and Jarvis, either.

Probably the closest skillset match for Point is Johnston. But Bedard offers the most offensive ceiling.

And don’t overlook Bennett, for the simple fact that he was the most difficult player for management to leave off the roster in the first place. Maybe an injury replacement offers Team Canada a chance for a do-over there and they can rethink roles in other ways.

One way or another, if Point needs replacing, it’s another difficult decision coming for Team Canada and one that won’t please everyone.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13165039/GettyImages-2200098923-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 01:59:21.029204

Edwards and offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo on injured reserve, the team announced on Tuesday. The move effectively ends both of their respective seasons after injuries suffered in Chicago’s Wild Card win over the Packers on Saturday.

As corresponding roster moves, the Bears activated offensive tackle Braxton Jones off the injured reserve list and called up linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin from the practice squad to the active roster. Taking Reeves-Maybin’s spot on the practice squad will be linebacker Nephi Sewell, a four-year NFL veteran who also is Bears linebacker Noah Sewell’s older brother.

Jones, arguably the best value pick from Ryan Poles’ first draft as Chicago’s general manager, was the team’s primary starting left tackle from 2022 to 2024. He started the first three games of the season in 2025 but ultimately got benched in favor of Theo Benedet. He suffered a knee injury afterwards and has been on the Bears’ injured reserve list since October. With 44 career starts, he brings valuable experience to the table with Trapilo out for the rest of the postseason.

Reeves-Maybin, a 2023 Pro Bowler and All-Pro as a special teamer, signed with the Bears in November. He has played in three regular season games for the Bears this year purely as a special teamer, most notably tallying two tackles in Week 15 against the Browns. He took eight defensive snaps on Saturday against Green Bay, finishing with a tackle and a quarterback hurry as a blitzing defender.

Edwards suffered a fractured fibula in the Packers game that will leave him out for the remainder of the postseason. It’s unfortunate timing for the 29-year-old, who missed seven games during the regular season with multiple injuries. Trapilo had been coming into his own as Chicago’s starting left tackle, having held the role since Week 12 when Benedet got hurt and keeping a stranglehold on the role since.

Packers Preparing Contract Talks with Matt LaFleur

ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Packers plan to work on a new deal with Matt LaFleur after the season. Green Bay doesn’t want him entering 2026 on an expiring contract, even if another playoff flameout has turned up the outside noise. The organization has never been one to hand out top-tier coaching salaries, and LaFleur’s 76-41-1 record is now weighed against postseason frustration. Teams with openings are watching closely in case negotiations sour. If LaFleur ever actually hit the market, he’d instantly jump near the top of multiple lists.

Harbaugh Mania Takes Over the Coaching Cycle

The Falcons completed an interview with John Harbaugh, marking the first confirmed conversation after his firing and the clearest sign yet that he’ll be able to pick almost any job he wants. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo believes the Titans are firmly in the race thanks to a roster reset, enormous cap space and rookie QB Cam Ward. SNY’s Connor Hughes reports many coaching candidates think this comes down to the Giants or Falcons, with the runner-up turning to Kevin Stefanski. Harbaugh is expected to pace himself, interview next week, and let teams come to him. Wherever he lands, it’s going to shape the rest of the carousel.

Mike McDaniel Drawing Heavy Interest

The Falcons completed their interview with Mike McDaniel, who also met with the Browns and has sit-downs scheduled with the Titans and Ravens. He’s one of the more unique candidates in this cycle, with a track record of squeezing strong offensive output out of Miami’s fractured quarterback situation. The Browns also completed their interview with him, viewing him as a real candidate for the top job. While offensive coordinator opportunities will be plentiful, it’s clear there’s still real head-coaching interest in him.

Ravens Coaching Search Expands

The Ravens completed an interview with Kliff Kingsbury and formally requested interviews with Browns DC Jim Schwartz, Rams pass-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, Chargers DC Jesse Minter and Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver. Kingsbury continues to float between head-coaching buzz and coordinator options, while Schwartz has drawn strong in-house support in Cleveland. Weaver has already met with Arizona and Atlanta. Minter’s surge continues after a strong defensive showing late in the season. Baltimore appears willing to explore every possible angle to reset around Lamar Jackson.

Browns Request Udinski

Cleveland requested an interview with Jaguars OC Grant Udinski. He’s a fast-rising name after helping Jacksonville settle into one of the league’s better late-season offenses. With Jim Schwartz already interviewing in-house, the Browns seem determined to cover the field before making a call.

Raiders Add Jesse Minter to Their List

The Raiders added Chargers DC Jesse Minter to an already lengthy candidate list featuring Jeff Hafley, Vance Joseph, Klint Kubiak, Matt Nagy, Nate Scheelhaase and Davis Webb. Minter’s defense smothered Drake Maye in the Wild Card Round even in a losing effort, and it’s clear teams noticed. Las Vegas remains one of the trickier landing spots given roster questions and front-office uncertainty, but the volume of interview requests signals they’re determined to reset the identity of the franchise.

Giants Request Chris Shula

New York requested to interview Rams DC Chris Shula, joining the Cardinals and Raiders as teams lining up for a closer look. Shula’s work with a low-budget defense earned him significant league-wide respect this season, and he has quickly become one of the more interesting defensive candidates of the cycle. The Giants continue to cast a wide net as they pursue their next coach.

Dolphins Request Kelvin Sheppard

Miami requested an interview with Lions DC Kelvin Sheppard after completing their interview with Klint Kubiak. Sheppard made an immediate impact in his first year as coordinator, building a tough, aggressive defense that played well above expectations. The Dolphins also have requests out for Jeff Hafley, Robert Saleh, and Chris Shula as they search for the successor to Mike McDaniel.

Injury Ward

Nico Collins (head) exited Houston’s Wild Card win after landing head-first into the turf. Collins showed signs of disorientation and was ultimately carted off. Expect him to be in concussion protocol this week. His status for the Divisional Round is very much up in the air.

Matthew Stafford (finger) is good to go for the Divisional Round, according to Sean McVay. The sprain didn’t keep him off the field last week and shouldn’t limit him as the Rams prep for Chicago.

Dalton Kincaid (foot) wore a boot after the Wild Card win, but Sean McDermott called the move precautionary. His practice participation later in the week will determine whether Dawson Knox is in line for more work.

Gabe Davis (knee) tore his ACL and will miss the rest of the playoffs. It’s a brutal blow for Buffalo, who will turn to Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, Tyrell Shavers and Keon Coleman to fill the void.

Tucker Kraft (knee) anticipates opening training camp on the PUP list, though he expects to be ready for Week 1. His return timeline remains one of the bigger Packers storylines heading into 2026.

A coaching cycle rarely tilts an entire postseason, but the league is spinning fast and every interview feels like the start of another ripple. Meanwhile, contenders are taping up quarterbacks, shuffling receivers and adjusting game plans on the fly. Buckle up. The Divisional Round is here, and the next domino is never far away.

There are just three weeks of football left in the 2025 season. For most of the league, preparations for 2026 have already begun. This article will break down the biggest team needs that will benefit fantasy managers heading into the 2026 offseason.

AFC Offseason Team Needs

Baltimore Ravens: Add More Pass-Catching Talent

The Baltimore Ravens will enter the 2026 season with a new coaching staff leading the Lamar Jackson offense. Baltimore is also set to return Derrick Henry and four of five offensive linemen (center Tyler Linderbaum will be a free agent) but is set to lose Isaiah Likely and DeAndre Hopkins in free agency.

The Ravens need to explore replacing (or retaining) those big bodies in the passing attack to complement the skill sets of Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews.

Buffalo Bills: Try to Find a WR1 for Josh Allen (Again)

Once again, the Buffalo Bills’ passing attack is being held up by the stellar play of Josh Allen with a mishmash of average talent. Buffalo had just one receiver (Khalil Shakir) with over 600 receiving yards. 11 different players had at least 100 receiving yards.

Keon Coleman hasn’t worked out as the team’s WR1 after being drafted as the 33rd pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but that shouldn’t discourage Buffalo from going back to the well to find a pass catcher again. The Bills’ offense can unlock another level if they can find a player that defenses must account for in the passing attack.

Cincinnati Bengals: Upgrade the Interior Offensive Line

The Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line showed growth over the course of the 2025 season. According to StatsHub, the Bengals ranked 17th in pressure rate (29.9%) and tied for 21st in sack rate (5.2%). Both marks were improvements over 2024.

Unfortunately, Cincinnati is set to lose a starting center (Ted Karras), guard (Dalton Risner) and two experienced backups (Cordell Volson and Lucas Patrick). Protecting Joe Burrow is paramount given his injury woes, which means the team needs to invest resources to fortify its interior line this offseason.

Cleveland Browns: Re-Tool the Offensive Line

The Browns have a lot of needs on the offensive side of the ball, but the most glaring issue for 2026 is the offensive line. Right tackle Jack Conklin is the only starter set to return next season on a unit that has struggled with age and injuries in recent seasons.

Cleveland could choose to bring back a couple of veterans like Joel Bitonio and Ethan Pocic on the interior, but it would be wise to use their increased draft capital to infuse some youth into this group.

Denver Broncos: Add a Reliable Complement to RJ Harvey in the Backfield

RJ Harvey had a fantastic rookie season for the Denver Broncos (and fantasy managers), but Denver’s run game took a clear step back when J.K. Dobbins was knocked out with an injury. Among 58 running backs with at least 40 carries since Week 10, Harvey ranked 50th in expected points added (-16.19) and 37th in success rate (39.6%).

Harvey should improve in his second season, but this is still an offense that prefers to utilize multiple backs with varied skill sets, which is set to lose Dobbins, Jaleel McLaughlin and Tyler Badie to free agency.

This is a stellar running back free agent class with plenty of options that can spell Harvey in his second season to give the Broncos a more stable rushing attack.

Houston Texans: Continue to Build up the Offensive Line

The Texans are seemingly set at the skill positions, but they could stand to add talent in the trenches. Houston’s offensive line held up well in the passing game by finishing in the bottom 12 among all offenses in sacks (31) and pressures (177) allowed. However, they were terrible as run blockers.

The Texans had the third-lowest expected points added (-54.44) and success rate (36.8%) in the NFL in 2025. They also had the seventh-highest stuff rate (21.1%) and third-lowest explosive run rate (9.1%). Only guard Ed Ingram is set to hit free agency in 2026, but Houston could stand to upgrade several pieces of this group.

Indianapolis Colts: Figure Out the Quarterback Position

It looked like the Colts had struck gold with Daniel Jones under center the first 10 weeks of 2025. The Colts had one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL and were the top seed in the AFC. Just four weeks later, Jones had suffered a torn Achilles and the season spiraled.

That injury leaves the Colts in a bad position. Jones was starting to regress before suffering a significant lower-body injury but played at a high level before being hurt. Early reports indicate the Colts and Jones are open to agreeing to a long-term deal, but the Colts will need to figure out who is under center until he’s ready to return.

Anthony Richardson Sr. or Riley Leonard could play to start the season, or the team could add a more reliable option out of free agency.

Jacksonville Jaguars: Add to the Backfield

The Jaguars had an excellent season thanks to Travis Etienne Jr.’s ability to keep the offense on schedule as a runner while adding explosive plays. Thankfully for Etienne, his high level of play came during a contract year.

Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen Jr. can have bigger roles in 2026, but Jacksonville will likely look to extend Etienne or dip into the deep free agent running back class to ensure their running game stays a strength next season.

Kansas City Chiefs: Add a Dynamic Running Back

Kansas City’s rushing attack struggled again in 2025. Kareem Hunt (3.7) and Isiah Pacheco (3.9) both averaged fewer than four yards per carry. The issue was more thanks to the talent in the backfield than the offensive line. According to StatsHub, the Chiefs were ninth in both rushing success rate (43.3%) and yards before contact (2.4).

The Chiefs tried (and failed) to trade for Breece Hall at the trade deadline but should use their free agent money to upgrade the backfield now that the season is over. Both Hunt and Pacheco are set to hit free agency.

Las Vegas Raiders: Add the Quarterback of the Future

The Raiders came into 2025 with a new, highly paid coaching staff, an exciting rookie running back (Ashton Jeanty) and a theoretically upgraded quarterback (Geno Smith). Fast forward 18 weeks and the team has fired the coaching staff and will surely replace Smith.

This goal won’t take much to accomplish since the Raiders hold the first pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza is considered the favorite to be selected first overall, but there is plenty of time between now and the draft for things to potentially change.

Regardless, the Raiders need to identify a quarterback to get the most out of their young corps of weapons.

Los Angeles Chargers: Upgrade the Interior Offensive Line

The Chargers once again had brutal play across the offensive line thanks to significant injuries to left tackle Rashawn Slater (knee) and right tackle Joe Alt (ankle). Both players will hopefully be ready for 2026 (Slater’s injury is far less certain).

However, the Chargers also have glaring issues on the interior. Los Angeles has a chance to reset the group this offseason with three contributors at guard (Zion Johnson, Jamaree Salyer, Trevor Penning) set to hit free agency.

Miami Dolphins: Overhaul the Offense

The Dolphins elected to fire head coach Mike McDaniel, meaning a new offensive system will be in place. The team is expected to move on from Tua Tagovailoa as well.

Miami has some solid pieces along the offensive line and two explosive weapons (De’Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle). However, decisions on the coaching staff, and subsequently the quarterback, loom large ahead of 2026.

New England Patriots: Continue to Upgrade the Offensive Line

Drake Maye took a big step in 2025, turning into an MVP candidate in his second season. The Patriots are set to return their entire receiver group (plus Hunter Henry) and both of their running backs next season. One area they need to address is the offensive line.

Garrett Bradbury and rookie left guard Jared Wilson combined to allow four sacks and 48 pressures on the interior this season and could be upgraded. The team could also explore adding a right tackle in the draft with Morgan Moses’ injury history and age.

New York Jets: Find a New Direction at Quarterback

First-year head coach Aaron Glenn hoped that Justin Fields could be his starting quarterback of the future. Unfortunately, his struggles as a passer led the Jets to start Tyrod Taylor and Brady Cook for four games apiece.

The Jets have the second overall pick in the draft, but this quarterback class lacks many NFL-ready options after Fernando Mendoza. The Jets will need to decide if they can develop a young quarterback in the draft or if they can acquire a veteran with multi-year starting potential this offseason.

Pittsburgh Steelers: Figure Out the Quarterback Position

Aaron Rodgers was fine in his (first?) season with the Steelers and has not ruled out returning in 2026. He proved he is still a viable option, but at some point, the Steelers need to try and find a quarterback who can provide multiple years under center.

The Steelers drafted Ohio State’s Will Howard with a Day 3 pick in 2025, but there is no indication that the team views him as more than a developmental option at this point.

Tennessee Titans: Add Receiving Talent to Help Cam Ward Develop

The 2025 Titans had just two players finish with over 500 receiving yards in Cam Ward’s rookie season. Three of their top four pass catchers were drafted in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The team’s leading receiver, tight end Chig Okonkwo, is set to hit free agency.

The Titans need to hit on their new coach, but more importantly, they have to give Cam Ward more consistent weapons at receiver. The Titans will have plenty of veteran options in free agency like George Pickens, Mike Evans, Rashid Shaheed and Wan’Dale Robinson, if they hit free agency.

Any team can almost win a game. Monday, I counted down the most unlikely losses of the season, the games where a team climbed up around 95% or higher in win probability (per ESPN) only to let the opponent come back and win. It can happen to great teams (the Rams and Eagles have two of the 12 worst losses), it can happen to terrible teams (the Giants had the single least likely loss of the season).

But only really bad teams can have no chance at any point.

There’s an easy explanation of this, of course — the start of the game. The Broncos can come out and lay a total egg and lose 35-10 or something, but because they start out as a good team, their start-of-game win probability isn’t ever going to dip that far below 50%, even if they play terribly the rest of the way.

In other words, what follows below — the most expected losses of the 2025 season, aka the teams that had the lowest “peak” win expectancy in a given game — might not come as a huge surprise. But it’s still a fun look back.

There were nine times this season a team failed to reach a 25% win probability at any point in the game, coming from six different teams. You can probably name them (or at least four of them) pretty easily. Let’s count them down.

The Least Unlikely Losses of the 2025 NFL Season

9. Miami Dolphins vs. New England Patriots, Week 18

Peak win probability: 22.8%

The Patriots entered Week 18 in a situation where a win kept them in contention for the AFC’s No. 1 overall seed. The Dolphins entered Week 18 in a situation where the 2026 season couldn’t come soon enough. That’s why the Miami win probability was only 18.4% at kickoff, and with the Patriots scoring a touchdown inside of the first two minutes, it didn’t climb much. Early in the second half, the Dolphins had it at 17-10 and had the ball just outside the red zone, so they reached up around a 1-in-4 chance … until a Quinn Ewers pass was picked off. That was all she wrote, and the Pats won 38-10.

8. Cincinnati Bengals vs. Detroit Lions, Week 5

Peak win probability: 21.7%

The Bengals were supposed to be contenders, and even by Week 5, they were only 2-2. That said, the two wins came in Joe Burrow’s starts, and 2025 Jake Browning hadn’t looked anything like 2023 Jake Browning Meanwhile, the Lions had looked rough in Week 1 but then turned dominant, beating the Bears, Ravens and Browns by a combined 63 points and scoring 124 points in the three games. So even an offense that had Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Chase Brown wasn’t enough for the win probabilities, and the Bengals never climbed much above a 1-in-5 chance (which they were after one snap of the game). The Lions led 7-0 after 4:10 of the game, and the Bengals never got closer than that in a 37-24 loss.

7. Las Vegas Raiders vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Week 15

Peak win probability: 20.9%

In the end, the Eagles clearly weren’t as good as many of us expected them to be, and entering Week 15 they were on a three-game losing streak. Still, pretty much everyone saw this as a get-right game, with the Raiders bottoming out early this season and never rising much above that. The 20.9% mark was where the game started for the Raiders, and the Eagles ran a long, 13-play drive to score a touchdown. The Raiders responded with a long, 13-play drive of their own, where they … turned it over on downs. They trailed 7-0 after a quarter, 17-0 after a half and never scored en route to a 31-0 loss.

6. Tennessee Titans vs. San Francisco 49ers, Week 15

Peak win probability: 18.4%

The Titans never got anything going this year. Their only wins were over the Cardinals when Arizona shot themselves in the foot enough times that Plaxico Burress was jealous, a win over a Chiefs team that had given up on the season, and an actual win over … Shedeur Sanders and the Browns. So every team was heavily favored over the Titans, but the 49ers — who entered their matchup off a bye and on a three-game winning streak where they had outscored their opponents 87-39 — were perhaps the best for the task. And hey, late in the first half, the Titans had the ball in San Francisco territory with a theoretical chance to tie the game. And even at that moment, their win probability was … 15.2%. They’d go on to lose 37-24.

5. Tennessee Titans vs. Indianapolis Colts, Week 8

Peak win probability: 16.8%

Man, remember when the Colts were good? /wistful Colts fan

Week 8 was probably the peak of the Colts season. They entered at 6-1 and rolling and destroyed their division rivals 38-14 to get to 7-1. They’d go 1-8 the rest of the way. It stunk. But hey, in Week 8, they looked great, and they jumped out to a 10-0 lead. The Titans made it 10-7, but the Colts scored the next 28 points, so it was never really a sweat.

4. New Orleans Saints vs. Los Angeles Rams, Week 9

Peak win probability: 15.6%

Tyler Shough looked pretty good as a rookie! That didn’t really include his first start, back in Week 9, when the Rams took him, and the Saints, to the woodshed. Taysom Hill led the team in rushing. The Rams led 10-0, 20-3 and 34-10 (the final score). The 15.6% mark was the “eh, let’s throw them a bone” win probability as the start of the game. No one ever thought they’d win this one.

3. New York Jets vs. New England Patriots, Week 17

Peak win probability: 15.5%

Notice that team that had this game? Get used to seeing it here.

Turns out, having Brady Cook throwing to Adonai Mitchell and John Metchie III against the possible NFL MVP and a potential No. 1 seed in the AFC means you don’t get a lot of respect from the models. And given the Patriots scored their first touchdown within 5 minutes and their second within 10 en route to leads of 21-0 and 42-3 before winning 42-10, the lack of respect appears to have been warranted.

2. New York Jets vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Week 15

Peak win probability: 12.5%

Another game, another Jets game started by Brady Cook against a contending team. The Jags entered on a four-game winning streak where they had beaten the Chargers, Cardinals, Titans and Colts by a combined 123-52, and Trevor Lawrence was forcing his way into the MVP conversation. The Jets actually did manage a few points in this one, getting to 20, but with the Jags roaring to 48, it didn’t really matter. (But hey, if you bet “Both teams score in all four quarters” for this one, good for you, because it hit.)

1. New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills, Week 18

Peak win probability: 8.5%

A thing I probably should know but don’t is how much the win probability model takes into account things like “Josh Allen is going to start the game but barely play.” Like, I know it takes players into account — that’s how it knows when a bad team is facing a good one and opens the probability at some impossibly low number. But Allen is determined to keep his consecutive-game streak going, so he wasn’t going to sit; he was going to play a snap and then give way to Mitchell Trubisky. Thus, did the model think Allen was going to play (in which case the Jets never even sniffing 10% makes sense), or did it believe it would be almost entirely Trubisky (in which case the odds still make sense, but man, what an insult)? I don’t know, but given the Jets didn’t even score until the last half of the last quarter when they were down 35-0, whatever the model thought, the odds were very solid.

The Jets were so bad, y’all.

The 2025 NFL season felt extremely weird for any number of reasons, but here’s one more: By ESPN in-game win probably, there were 13 games in the 2024 regular season where a team reached 90% win probably or better and lost. In 2025, there were 24.

Now, obviously, win probability charting is more of a for-fun exercise than hard science. It’s fun to look at, but it doesn’t actually tell you that much. But oh boy, the fun to look at is very fun to look at.

What comes below is about the regular season, but here’s a playoff example: Sunday, the Bears had an incomplete pass on third-and-3 from around midfield when they were down 11 points with 5:41 left. At that moment, win probability had the Packers at 97.8% likely to win the game:

Of course, we know what came next. 27-yard completion to Rome Odunze. Touchdown to Olamide Zaccheaus. Two-point conversion to Colston Loveland. Brandon McManus missed kick. DJ Moore touchdown. Bears win. 2.2% likelihood turned to 100%.

That sort of thing happened with shocking frequency in the 2025 season. So below, I’m counting down the 14 most unlikely losses of the 2025 NFL regular season. These are the 14 times a team reached at least 94.0% win probability only to see if disappear. Remember: Not analysis. Just fun.

The Most Unlikely Losses of the 2025 NFL Season

14. Green Bay Packers vs. Cleveland Browns, Week 3

94.0% win probability

Early in the fourth quarter, Jordan Love completed a 34-yard pass to Matthew Golden on third-and-8. They were up 10-0 on the moribund Browns and were driving to go up 13 or even 17. A minus-1 yard run and two incompletions later, the Packers punted. The Browns dinked-and-dunked down to get a field goal. But it’s a field goal, right? Who really cares? Except … Love threw an interception deep in his own territory on the next drive, the Browns turned it into a one-yard field goal. Tie game. The Packers got a field goal blocked. And ultimately, Andre Szmyt kicked a 55-yard walkoff field goal. Every single thing that could have gone wrong for the Packers in the last 10 minutes of that game did go wrong.

13. Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings, Week 1

94.2% win probability

It’s easy to forget this one now, with the Bears marching into a home game in the Divisional Round and the Vikings entering an offseason where they might not even keep their young quarterback as starter. But in Week 1, J.J. McCarthy had a fourth quarter for the ages. The Vikings entered the fourth down 17-6, but McCarthy threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. The Bears scored a late touchdown, but it wasn’t enough. Week 1 ended with the Vikings 1-0 and excited, the Bears 0-1 and deflated, and the NFC North looking like a Green Bay/Minnesota matchup. Oh, how things changed.

12. Los Angeles Rams vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Week 3

94.4% win probability

It’s rare to reach elite win probability super early in the second half, because it’s hard to run away that much. But only a couple minutes into the third quarter in Week 3, the Rams were beating the Eagles 26-7 and got the Eagles to second-and-13 after a holding penalty. Only … Jalen Hurts completed a 38-yarder to A.J. Brown on the next play. Believe it or not, the Rams were done scoring in the game, while the Eagles went touchdown (33 yards, Dallas Goedert), touchdown (9 yards, Brown), touchdown (4 yards, DeVonta Smith) and for good measure, they blocked a potential game-winning Rams field goal with no time left, and Jordan Davis returned that for a touchdown. The Eagles scored 26 unanswered points to stay undefeated.

11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Atlanta Falcons, Week 15

95.1% win probability

Tampa was probably never going to win the Super Bowl, but there are still going to be some major regrets from the 2025 season. The team was 3-0, 5-1 and 6-2. Baker Mayfield was an MVP candidate. Instead, they lost four of their last five, seven of their last nine and eight of their last 11. And none was worse than this one, when the Bucs led the all-over-but-the-shouting Falcons 28-14 in the fourth quarter before letting Kirk Cousins lead two touchdowns drives and a field goal. The Falcons beat the Bucs, didn’t lose again, and because they tied the Bucs and Panthers at 8-9, tiebreakers sent the Panthers into the playoffs and sent the Bucs home.

10. Philadelphia Eagles vs. Denver Broncos, Week 5

95.4% win probability

There were several times this season where everyone basically concluded that the Broncos were a smoke-and-mirrors affair. This was one of them, trailing 17-3 late in the third quarter and at risk of falling to 2-3. They punted here, and the Eagles spent more than a full quarter of game time (from 13:18 of the third quarter to 13:11 of the fourth) at 80% win probability or above. But the Broncos woke up in the fourth quarter, getting touchdowns from J.K. Dobbins and Evan Engram and a 36-yard Wil Lutz field goal with 1:11 left to beat the Eagles 21-17. They only lost one time the rest of the season.

9. Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys, Week 12

96.3% win probability

Back-to-back Eagles! And this one came early, with the Eagles up 21-0 in the second quarter and driving. It looked not only like a victory over their rival, but a demolition that would have all but ended the Cowboys season. Instead, they punted. The Cowboys scored a touchdown before halftime and two more in the second half, then kicking a game-winning field goal as time expired. The Eagles missed a field goal and lost a fumble in the fourth quarter, and in the second half they 30 plays for 108 yards. “The offense falls apart in the second half” was kind of a theme of the 2025 Eagles.

8. New York Giants vs. Chicago Bears, Week 10

96.9% win probability

Under 6 minutes left, and the Bears trailed by 10 points. The win probability for the Bears was 3.1%, but given how Chicago’s season has gone, it was probably like 94%, as the Cardiac Bears had comebacks galore. They scored a touchdown on the drive they were on. The rest of the game, the Giants had nine plays on offense — a three-and-out for minus-8 yards, and a turnover on downs on a six-play, 11-yard drive. The Bears followed up one touchdown with another, and within five minutes they managed to go from “under 5% to win” to “comfortably kneeling the ball to finish off a victory.”

7. Arizona Cardinals vs. Tennessee Titans, Week 5

97.4% win probability

Hands down the funniest game of the year. The Cardinals led 21-6 with 12 minutes left looking to get to 3-2. Instead, they had a whole comedy of errors in the game. The snap off Kyler Murray’s face that became a turnover had happened earlier, but they also added in a massive Emari Demercado run into a goal-line fumble and touchback and somehow turned a Cardinals interception into a Titans touchdown, when Dadrion Taylor-Demerson picked off a pass and fumbled it into the end zone for Tyler Lockett to recover. Podcasts did entire episodes just about the Cardinals’ comedy in that second half.

6. Cincinnati Bengals vs. New York Jets, Week 8

97.5% win probability

It was Week 8. The Jets were winless. The Bengals were struggling, but they were expected to compete, especially if they could just tread water until Joe Burrow got back. And with 9:28 left, the Bengals were up 14 and the Jets had third-and-6 in their own territory. Even the most nihilistic of Bengals fans had to feel very secure. But the Jets scored a touchdown and got the two-point conversion (doing the “go for 2 when a touchdown gets you within 8” thing that draws so much conversation), the Bengals had a three-and-out, the Jets scored again, the Bengals turned it over on downs, and the Jets had their first win of the season. Absolutely no one saw it coming.

5. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Houston Texans, Week 10

98.4% win probability

This one peaked at 98.4% early in the fourth quarter, but it was really a whole-game thing. The Jags were up 3-0 after 4 minutes, up 10-0 after 7 minutes, up 17-0 after 16 minutes. But yes, with 13:09 left, the Texans had an incompletion on third down to get to fourth-and-2 down 29-10. It seemed over, especially with C.J. Stroud hurt and Davis Mills under center. Instead, Mills led not one, not two, but three touchdown drives, including a 14-yard running score to take the lead that was the second-longest run of his career. And for good measure, the Jags forced a fumble on the Texans’ desperation play to end the game and returned that for a touchdown too. A 26-0 fourth quarter really set the Texans’ season in the right direction, as they didn’t lose again. But it was OK — the Jags didn’t have another loss in the regular season either.

4. Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks, Week 16

98.8% win probability

This was the game of the year, unless one our No. 2 finishers is it. Thursday night, DVOA Bowl, division rivals. Only … the Rams led 30-14 in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks passing game couldn’t get going. Outside of a single 55-yard Kenneth Walker III run, neither could the running game. Kind of a letdown. And when Sam Darnold threw a pick at the goal line with 9:48 left, it certainly seemed all over. But the Seattle defense forced a three-and-out and Rashid Shaheed returned the ensuing punt for a touchdown, and … the Seahawks came alive. Touchdown, another touchdown, the craziest two-point conversion you’ll ever see, missed Rams field goal, overtime. The Rams scored a touchdown in overtime (Puka Nacua with an all-time game), but the Seahawks answered with a touchdown and another two-pointer. Ballgame, 1 seed all but locked up.

T2. Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, Week 16

99.1% win probability

So Week 16 was wild, huh? And it certainly foretold of a crazy postseason. With 3:27 left, the Packers led the Bears 16-6. The Chicago offense had nothing going on. Caleb Williams had just run for 11 yards on third-and-10, but a holding brought it back and forced third-and-20. But a face mask on the next play gave the Bears life. They notched a field goal on that drive, recovered an onside kick (who knew that was still possible?) and scored a touchdown with 24 seconds left (Jahdae Walker’s second career reception), before winning in overtime. The Packers had been in line for maybe the NFC’s 1 seed, the Bears were facing fraud allegations. Instead, the Packers never won again, and the Bears are hosting a game in the Divisional Round.

T2. Baltimore Ravens vs. Buffalo Bills, Week 1

99.1% win probability

If that Week 16 Seahawks/Rams game wasn’t the game of the year, this one was. The first Sunday of the NFL season had been fine, but it didn’t have a signature game until the prime-time battle between AFC favorites Buffalo and Baltimore. The Ravens got to 99.1% when they were up 40-25 with 4:48 left in the fourth quarter, but they spent most of the fourth quarter above 90%. It looked like the Ravens were on their way to having their finally-breaking-through season in 2025, even if it was only Week 1. And then all of a sudden, it wasn’t. Keon Coleman caught a touchdown on a scramble play. Derrick Henry, who had 169 yards and 2 touchdowns in the game, fumbled. The Bills scored again. The Ravens had a three-and-out. And then Matt Prater, who was 41 and had been on the team for three days, kicked a walkoff field goal. It was all anyone could ask for out of the season opener … unless you were a Ravens fan.

1. New York Giants vs. Denver Broncos, Week 7

99.8% win probability

The Giants led 19-0 entering the fourth quarter. The Broncos had gained all of 111 yards through their first eight drives — six punts, a turnover on downs and the end of the first half. It wasn’t just an upset, it was a beatdown. And that wasn’t even the 99.8% part! The Giants were overwhelming favorites as the fourth quarter started, 92.5%, but then they answered the Broncos’ first score with a touchdown of their own to go up 26-8. Surely the game was iced, right? Nope, the Broncos scored with 5:01 left. The Giants threw an interception. The Broncos scored again. The Giants punted. The Broncos scored again. They were up 30-26. OK, you lose. But then! The Giants scored, just to make it interesting. Unfortunately, Jude McAtamney missed the extra point (his second of the game, so when the Broncos kicked a 39-yard field goal as time expired, it wasn’t to tie the game (or even to lose by one) … it was the game winner. The Giants lost a game that should have been impossible to lose.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/John-Harbaugh.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 01:59:31.937079

The Seahawks kicked off their practice week on Tuesday in preparation for their divisional round game against the 49ers, and did so with nearly everyone on their 53-man roster, as well as two players designated to return from injured reserve, taking part in the practice.

Only two players did not practice, linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and tackle Josh Jones (knee), who started at left tackle in place of an injured Charles Cross for the final three games of the regular season, playing through knee and ankle injuries in Week 18.

Cross, meanwhile, was listed as a full participant after missing three games with a hamstring injury, as was safety Coby Bryant, who missed the previous two games with a knee injury. Their statuses lines up with what Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said about those two players heading into Week 18, which was that both Cross and Bryant would likely make it back for the playoffs.

Two new names to the injury report were cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) and outside linebacker DeMarcus Lawrence (Achilles), who were both limited participants.

Tight end Elijah Arroyo, who was designated to return to practice last week, was listed as a full participant, while linebacker Chazz Surratt, who was designated to return on Tuesday, was limited.

The 49ers, coming off a wild card win over the Eagles on Sunday, held a walkthrough, meaning their report was an estimation of participation had they practice.

""What that looks like at a pretty impactful position on your salary cap, when you're able to possibly plan for your depth chart looking in a way where you can be competitive no matter what.""

McCarthy entered the season with massive questions after suffering a preseason knee injury in 2024 that caused him to miss the entire season. It was a roller-coaster for the Michigan product, who flashed at times late in games but was inconsistent, missing passes badly for long stretches. Injuries also plagued the QB, who missed time with ankle, hand and concussion issues.

""J.J., I was really encouraged by the type of football he started to play towards the second half of the season and finishing the way he did,"" O'Connell said. ""We spend a lot of time talking about what the layers of change really were, and I think we all just tried to have a mindset on completions and however we could generate them, we started to see a little bit of that show up.

We saw the ability to kind of balance that with what I thought at many points this year, our run game was productive enough for us to move the football and stay in a lot of games.""

There is little question that the Vikings need a reliable veteran to buffer McCarthy.

Late in the third quarter, the 26-year-old caught a pass from quarterback C.J. Stroud but had a hard fall where he fell on his face and was in enough pain that he needed to be taken to the blue medical tent. After being carted to the locker room, he was ruled out with a concussion. And now Texans fans are worried that Collins might not be able to play when the team faces the New England Patriots on Sunday, January 18 in the NFL Divisional Round.

When will Nico Collins return?

Nico Collins has a low chance of returning to the field for the Patriots game, according to an analysis from NFL injury expert Jesse Morse on X (formerly Twitter).

The doctor, who specializes in assessing football injuries, gives him a “30% chance” of clearing the sport’s concussion protocol within six days.

Morse notes that this is the second concussion that Collins has apparently received in his career, with his first being sustained earlier this season against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7. That injury forced him to miss one game. That said, he suggests that this second concussion could take longer for him to recover from.

He explained, “The fact that he required help off the field, that this is his 2nd concussion in less than 3 months (sometimes repeat concussions cause lingering symptoms) and that this game was played on a Monday (short week), will make him clearing the protocol very difficult.”

The NFL concussion protocol, which Patriots’ Christian Gonzalez is also going through, has five steps and each step requires a minimum of one day to clear. So the earliest that Collins could return to the field is Saturday, with him needing to be in limited practice on Thursday for him to have a shot to return in time.

Bills coach Sean McDermott said Tuesday that Shavers played the second half Sunday on his torn ACL, which he suffered in the second quarter on a punt return. As he came off a block, Shavers immediately pulled up and began limping and then was looked at by athletic trainers on the field. Shavers came back to play 21 offensive snaps in the final two quarters but did not return to special teams.

""He embodies what we're all about,"" McDermott said. ""... For him to then come back into the game, and then for it to turn out to be what it was is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""

The Bills also lost Gabe Davis to a torn left ACL in the game, and fellow wide receiver Joshua Palmer was placed on injured reserve last week with a lingering ankle injury.

That leaves Buffalo with only three available receivers on the active roster -- veteran Brandin Cooks, Khalil Shakir and Keon Coleman -- as it prepares to play in Denver on Saturday against the top-seeded Denver Broncos. Curtis Samuel (elbow) had his practice window opened from injured reserve Tuesday and was listed as a full participant in the team's walk-through practice. The practice squad includes receivers Mecole Hardman Jr., Stephen Gosnell and Kristian Wilkerson.

""Another guy's got to step up. That's point-blank what it means,"" McDermott said. ""And I don't mean to be short. It's just right now, it's full confidence in the guys in that room, and we brought back Kristian Wilkerson, and he'll be a good addition back to us on the practice squad, and we go from there.""

Quarterback Josh Allen was listed as limited on the injury report with his same foot injury and two others from the game against the Jaguars -- a knee injury and right finger injury.

""I feel good. I feel good,"" Allen said. ""Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks on a ... I know it's a Tuesday for us, but on a Wednesday-type mindset. Feel good.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0113%2Fr1600226_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:13:15.778250

Beal, who played for the New York Giants, was last seen near Virginia Beach in Virginia on July 12, 2025. He was 28 years old at the time he was reported missing but would now be 29.

According to details provided by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, which is a federal system for tracking people who have disappeared in the U.S., Beal's girlfriend was the last person to see him.

Beal's girlfriend reported that he borrowed her car and was supposed to head to work. Instead, she got a call from him a day later, with Beal reportedly saying that he was in Virginia Beach, but was headed home.

""Samuel has not been heard from or seen since the phone call,"" the NMUPS alert for him said.

Federal officials said they don't believe he brought anything with him to Virginia Beach other than the clothes he was wearing, some extra shoes and a wallet containing his credit card and driver's license.

When the vehicle was recovered in Virginia Beach by one of the girlfriend's family members, officials say, the family member found Beal's shoes and socks on the floor of the car along with some sand.

Virginia Beach is an oceanfront city in Virginia just north of the North Carolina border. It's unclear how far Beal drove to get to Virginia Beach, or how far it was from his work.

Beal's sister, Essence Zhane, shared a post on Facebook on Jan. 12 that included additional details about the case, urging anybody with info about the NFL player's disappearance to come forward.

In her post, Zhane included photos of a paid parking ticket for a beachfront lot in Virginia Beach with a timestamp from just before 6 p.m. on July 13.

""Tomorrow makes it 7 months since we’ve last heard from or seen my brother,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""We’ve done everything we could on our end to piece things together and at this point we’re in desperate need of support on all ends.""

Beal was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2018 supplemental draft, and appeared in six games as a cornerback for the team.

His career with the NFL was cut short in the 2020 season when he opted out of playing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to court documents, Beal was arrested in July 2020 during a traffic stop in Ohio, where he was charged with improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of marijuana. He was indicted a month later on the two weapons charges and initially entered a plea of not guilty. Beal eventually changed his plea to guilty in June 2021 and was placed on probation for a year.

This is the second time in as many years that Bland has had surgery on his foot. Todd Archer of ESPN said that Bland should be ready for the Cowboys’ offseason program, but the veteran cornerback’s focus is on training camp.

DaRon Bland played in 12 games this season, posting 73 tackles, three tackles for loss, and one interception. Before the start of the season, Bland signed a four-year, $92 million contract extension with the Cowboys. He was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 20 due to an injured foot.

In 2024, Bland played in just seven games because he suffered a stress fracture and began the season on injured reserve. He played in the team’s final seven games of the year and notched 41 tackles, five passes defended, one forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.

The Cowboys selected Brand in the fifth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. He had a breakout season in 2023, leading the NFL in interceptions (nine) and tying the NFL record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown in a season (five).

DaRon Bland reacts to signing a new contract with the Cowboys

Before the start of this season, Bland shared his reaction to getting a new contract with the Cowboys. “Kind of surprised, kind of a little bit dumbfounded,” Bland said, per Tommy Yarrish of DallasCowboys.com. “Couldn’t believe it, that I’m making that much and doing what I do.”

Bland also discussed finding a role with the Cowboys after joining the team in 2022. “Being patient and learning to grow, having that mindset that where I was at that point was not the end point, so just keep driving each day, take it day by day…” Bland said. Not many fifth-rounders get the opportunities that I had and be in this league and be able to do what I do, and I’m just thankful for the opportunity to keep being out here.”

Before joining the Cowboys, Bland played one season at Fresno State. In that season (2021), the 26-year-old tallied 45 tackles, two interceptions, and five passes defended.",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2026/01/13155804/DaRon-Bland-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:13:19.488136

The number six linebacker, Eric Kendricks, had ten and the game-sealing pass defensed.
This team can do what no one thinks they can, and let's hope they prove everyone wrong for another three games.","A few weeks ago, I wrote that the Niners are the grittiest team in the NFL. That could not have been truer on Sunday night.

Down their number one, number two, number three, and number four linebackers? Who cares? The number seven linebacker, Garret Wallow, had eleven tackles and a pass defensed. The number six linebacker, Eric Kendricks, had ten and the game-sealing pass defensed.

Though the defensive line produced little pressure, it forced numerous three-and-outs and held the Eagles to field goals, keeping the game close throughout.

Quarterback Brock Purdy, whom so many have disparaged over the years, made a few mistakes, one of them costly, but was lights out in the most important moment, avoiding sacks and rushing for a key first down on the game-winning drive.

I have written before that the way to tell a great player from an average player is by when they make mistakes. Purdy threw an interception at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Then he went 5-for-6 and threw a touchdown (and scrambled for a first down) when the game was on the line. Give me the interception early and the game-winner late over no interceptions and a string of incompletions when it matters.

The worst news of the game was the injury to star tight end George Kittle, who suffered a torn Achilles. This late in the year, it will likely keep him off the field for most of next season.

But faced with that loss, Kyle Shanahan did something unusual. Rather than simply shift to backup tight end Jake Tonges, who has been effective this year, he also used fullback Kyle Juszczyk the way he uses Kittle.

Philadelphia had never seen Juszczyk used in the passing game that extensively, and he made several key plays down the stretch, catching three passes on the last two touchdown drives.

The team also rallied around Kittle. McCaffrey was not alone in calling him the ""heart and soul of the team"" and told reporters the squad is ""going to play for him the rest of the way."" This is the attitude of a team that has faced adversity on a nearly weekly basis.

Perhaps Kendricks said it best when he related that when he got to the Niners in November, ""It was easy [to adjust to his supporting role] because everybody on this team is so unselfish. So it was just easy to come in and check [his] ego at the door and just get it done for the team to win.""

Before Kittle went down, the 49ers entered the game shorthanded on playmakers, but Demarcus Robinson played like a number one receiver, catching six balls for 111 yards and a touchdown. Jauan Jennings reprised his Super Bowl throw two years ago to hit McCaffrey for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.

Overall, the victory might not be on par with one of The Catch epics, but given all that this team has had to overcome, it was a memorable accomplishment. It was a game they had to win, and a performance they can take not only into the upcoming matchup with the Seahawks but even into next year.

This team can do what no one thinks they can, and let's hope they prove everyone wrong for another three games.",https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/bMmZxV/content/media/article/01b13d8efdb8fca4429cbd1d7c9fc7f2.jpg?social=true,N,,2026-01-14 02:00:10.034012

Patriots injury analysis: Wild card round

CB Carlton Davis III: When the Patriots came out of the two-minute warning in the second quarter, Davis was not in his usual position at outside cornerback. Instead, he was in the blue medical tent and shortly thereafter departed for the locker room. Announced as questionable to return with a toe injury, he ended up missing five defensive snaps before returning to start the second half. Davis did not show any obvious signs of discomfort before his exit, so it is unclear when exactly he injured his toe.

CB Christian Gonzalez: Breaking up a Justin Herbert pass attempt intended for Quentin Johnston, Gonzalez collided with the wide receiver on his way to the ground and was slow to get up afterwards. He did remain in the game for the next snap — another incompletion to set up a punt — but headed into the medical tent afterwards. From there, the Pro Bowl defender left the field for the locker room and was later announced as questionable to return with a head injury. He never came back out and shortly before the game ended was officially downgraded to out.

What this means for the Patriots

While Carlton Davis managed to return to the game and finish without any visible limitations, Christian Gonzalez is a massive question mark. As head coach Mike Vrabel noted on Monday, the Pro Bowler is in the league’s concussion protocol, and there is no timeline yet for his return.

Arguably New England’s best player on this side of the ball, Gonzalez missing any time in the lead-up to Sunday’s game, let alone the contest itself, would be a blow to the team’s defense. While Houston’s offense is not in the upper echelon in terms of productivity and scoring potential, it features some high-end receiving talent led by wide receivers Nico Collins and Christian Kirk.

Having Gonzalez available against that pair and the rest of Houston’s defense would be a massive plus. For now, however, uncertainty reigns.

Wednesday will mark the first key date in that regard, and when it comes to finding out which other Patriots are nursing injuries or illness after the wild card round.

""We're opening his window, so he can do some stuff like that,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said.
""Again, we're not doing much [in practice], so he'll walk through out there with us today and things like that.
As Shanahan pointed out, the 49ers will not be doing much on-field or full-speed work this week as they prepare for the Seahawks.
Shanahan said Tuesday that Warner hasn't been pushing him behind the scenes to return earlier, at least not verbally.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Linebacker Fred Warner took a significant step toward a potential playoff return as the San Francisco 49ers began preparations for Saturday's showdown with the Seattle Seahawks.

The Niners opened Warner's 21-day practice window on Tuesday, clearing the path for him to possibly be available for the NFC Championship Game after dislocating and fracturing his right ankle in a loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Oct. 12.

""We're opening his window, so he can do some stuff like that,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""Again, we're not doing much [in practice], so he'll walk through out there with us today and things like that. But hoping he can be ready for next week.""

As Shanahan pointed out, the 49ers will not be doing much on-field or full-speed work this week as they prepare for the Seahawks. It is the third time in four weeks that the Niners have played with less than a full week's worth of rest.

That means Warner will not get a chance to do much aside from walk-throughs, but since Tuesday is 26 days from the Super Bowl, it made sense to open his practice window now because the season is going to end close to when his 21 days would end, and the Niners would have to decide whether to activate him.

Warner said on ""The Ryen Russillo Show"" this week that he is ""ready whenever they're ready,"" adding that he's ""pushing, training hard"" and ""back doing full football drills.""

Warner was spotted last Thursday doing some drills on a side field for the first since the injury and then posted some footage of him going through drills on his Instagram account.

Shanahan said Tuesday that Warner hasn't been pushing him behind the scenes to return earlier, at least not verbally.

""That's not Fred's style totally,"" Shanahan said. ""He does that by showing how hard he's working on the side and knows that we're watching.""

Warner has been on injured reserve since mid-October and missed the final 12 games of the regular season as well as Sunday's NFC wild-card win against the Philadelphia Eagles. And while he is trending in a positive direction, he still has plenty of steps to clear medically before he can play again this season.

""I approach it by what doctors tell me,"" Shanahan said. ""I'm like Fred; if he feels good and tells me he's good, I'm probably going to think he's good and trust him to get out there. But you can't always think with your heart and emotionally, so you ask doctors where he's at -- all the things that these guys have to pass, just protocols that we have in, just sprinting and jumping and things like that. And he's got to hit all those before we feel safe.""

Elsewhere on the injury front, 49ers tight end George Kittle is scheduled to have surgery Wednesday for his torn right Achilles and will go on injured reserve this week.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall, who has missed the past two games with knee and ankle injuries, is slated to be a limited participant in Tuesday's walk-through with the same designation for left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), defensive linemen Keion White (groin, hamstring) and Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) and guard Dominick Puni (ankle).",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0320%2Fr1466603_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 18:01:57.637465

Franchise stability (8): Tomlin deserves most of the credit for the stability over the past 19 seasons.
Roster talent (6): The skill player talent is there, with Skattebo and Malik Nabers giving Dart something to work with on offense.
Roster talent (5): Pro Football Focus had Miami’s offensive line ranked 30th and defensive line ranked 31st this past year.","The Arizona Cardinals need a head coach after firing Jonathan Gannon. During their last coaching search, the rest of the NFL job openings were snapped up before Arizona could land on its hire of Gannon.

Ultimately, this process comes down to selling yourself to a pool of candidates who have a decent bit of leverage. If other teams have more appealing situations, you might miss.

Or you take a risk on pursuing a candidate nobody else is, something that ended up happening with the Gannon hire — because of timing at least.

How enticing is Arizona’s job opening? Quarterback Kyler Murray appears to be on the way out. The roster-building under general manager Monti Ossenfort has been happening for three years with mixed results. What do the other gigs have that Arizona does not?

To do this in an organized way, we’re giving each team’s quarterback situation, franchise stability and roster talent a rating from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best-case scenario. And then we’re ranking the job in terms of desirability based on the totals.

We went through this exercise on Jan. 6, the day after the regular season ended, when six teams had openings.

There are now nine total openings NFL-wide after Mike Tomlin stepped down from his post with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Spoilers: The Cardinals will not be at the front of the line if the top candidates have multiple options.

Ranking the NFL’s head-coaching openings by QB situation, stability and roster talent

1. Baltimore Ravens (John Harbaugh fired)

Total: 25

QB situation (9 out of 10): Lamar Jackson appears to be very involved in the head-coaching search, which is probably good news for any coach who wants the job.

Franchise stability (9): Six finishes atop the AFC North in Harbaugh’s 2008-25 reign is pretty good. A Super Bowl XLVII win and three more AFC Championship Game appearances make for a lot of winning, too. Executive vice president and general manager Eric DeCosta has been with the team since 1996 and took over as the guy in charge in 2019. That screams stability.

Roster talent (7): The offensive and defensive lines need work, but you have great starting points with Zay Flowers coming off his best season yet and Derrick Henry remaining a beast with 1,595 rushing yards at 32 years old. Linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton are earning their large paychecks on defense to give stability behind a presumably reshuffled defensive line.

2. Pittsburgh Steelers (Mike Tomlin stepped down)

Total: 17

QB situation (3): Pittsburgh navigated a weird wait for Aaron Rodgers to sign with them last offseason, and it appears that having a new coach incoming does not make that scenario optimal if Rodgers is going to be wishy-washy about whether he wants to play football or consume jungle foliage while locked in a lightless room. Mason Rudolph is the backup, and there’s just a No. 21 pick to seek a QB of the future in the draft.

Franchise stability (8): Tomlin deserves most of the credit for the stability over the past 19 seasons. Double-digit wins were commonplace, after all, but five Wild Card losses in the past six years made it time. Similar to the Ravens’ situation, general manager Omar Khan has only been in charge of the whole thing since 2022 but has been part of the franchise dating back to 2001. He gets to make his first head-coaching hire with all that organizational knowledge in mind.

Roster talent (7): Other than quarterback, the roster isn’t in bad shape and neither are the books. Top-end talent on both sides of the ball begins with D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Warren on offense, with a defense with very productive starters in T.J. Watt, Cam Heyward, Joey Porter Jr., Payton Wilson and Patrick Queen. The defense should be set up nicely, and then it’s on Khan to figure out the signal caller and how to protect him and add to the skill slots.

3. New York Giants (fired Brian Daboll)

Total: 16

QB situation (7): Jaxson Dart’s emergence was a breath of fresh air for a franchise struggling to build confidence among its fan base, and he produced with 2,272 yards, 63.7% accuracy and 15 touchdowns to five picks — plus nine rushing scores.

His bro-nection with Arizona State product Cam Skattebo gives the team easy-to-root-for leaders, so long as both remain healthy. Concussion issues cropped up for Dart a handful of times. A new head coach must connect with them.

We are pretty sure Dart is a guy to build around.

Franchise stability (3): General manager Joe Schoen is 22-45-1 with a single playoff appearance since he joined the team. This is probably his last chance to get it right.

Beyond that, the Giants have had a single winning season since 2016. Schoen, at present, is most well-known for giving a reason to let very good running back Saquon Barkley walk, while being filmed for Hard Knocks. Not great awareness.

Roster talent (6): The skill player talent is there, with Skattebo and Malik Nabers giving Dart something to work with on offense. Defensively, a front that includes Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeaux and Abdul Carter is the strength of the roster.

New York’s offensive line needs a reboot, and what’s behind the defensive line needs it, too.

The Giants have the No. 5 pick.

T-4. Atlanta Falcons (fired Raheem Morris)

Total: 15

QB situation (3): Have we ruled out Michael Penix Jr. as a franchise quarterback? Probably? I guess? That’s generous, even if you get over his many seasons dating back to college that ended with a serious knee injury. And he’ll miss the start of next season with a knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably gone. Atlanta doesn’t have a first-round pick, so the options don’t look excellent at the moment.

Franchise stability (6): If we’re going by purely reputation, the Falcons have the best among the teams with head-coaching openings. They’ve just failed to get out of the mediocre zone since the 2017 season and Matt Ryan era. More decent news: A first-year general manager will be replacing Terry Fontenot, so this coach will be tied to whomever that guy is.

Roster talent (6): Eight wins is still eight wins, a sign this team wasn’t lacking in talent to a huge degree. Running back Bijan Robinson is whom the offense will revolve around. But among the questions is tight end Kyle Pitts, who finally appeared to figure it out and led the team with 928 receiving yards. He’s a free agent if they don’t franchise-tag him.

Leading tackler and linebacker Kaden Elliss, plus backup running back Tyler Allgeier, are free agents as well.

This team won four games to end the year, some against very good playoff squads.

T-4. Tennessee Titans (fired Brian Callahan)

Total: 15

QB situation (7): Rookie first overall pick Cam Ward took a beating playing for a team that had no clear No. 1 receiver. He and the Raiders’ Geno Smith tied for the NFL lead with 55 sacks taken, but at least the touchdown-to-pick ratio (15 to seven) wasn’t terrible. Ward’s arm talent gave Titans fans something to look forward to at least, but consecutive three-win seasons speak to the roster talent issues in Tennessee.

Franchise stability (4): It looks a little worse now that former head coach Mike Vrabel, who left in 2023, is doing so well so quickly with the New England Patriots. Maybe that is just about optics and timing, where he saw the end of the Ryan Tannehill era, and quarterback prospects Will Levis and Malik Willis didn’t pan out.

Some more weird optics: Owner Amy Adams Strunk clarified this week that GM Mike Borgonzi will run the 53-man roster and coaching staff, while president of football operations Chad Brinker will do the other stuff. Better late than never to clarify job descriptions, I suppose.

Roster talent (4): There’s no No. 1 receiver but plenty of No. 2 or No. 3 options. The Titans have running back Tony Pollard under contract and a defense bolstered by tackle Jeffery Simmons. Holding the No. 4 pick, Tennessee could use a difference-making wideout, a defensive back or linebacker.

The Titans have the cash to spend big in free agency as well. Shoring up the offensive line will need to be done with that cash.

T-6. Miami Dolphins (Mike McDaniel fired)

Total: 14

QB situation (4): Tua Tagovailoa is under contract for three more years and eating up $56.4 million next season. His contract is hard to dump before the 2026 season with so much guaranteed money. Does any coaching candidate think they can piece together a quality first season on the job with the 27-year-old who struggled with a bottom-third QBR and concussion issues this past season?

Franchise stability (5): The Dolphins hired former Packers executive Jon-Eric Sullivan to run the team, which before McDaniel was on a run of blah coaching hires, including Brian Flores (2019-21) and Adam Gase (2016-18).

Roster talent (5): Pro Football Focus had Miami’s offensive line ranked 30th and defensive line ranked 31st this past year. Problem: They are last on this list of teams needing a new coach in projected cap space entering the offseason with the NFL’s fourth-fewest dollars to spend. Cutting receiver Tyreek Hill, who is accounting for $52 million on the cap sheet next season and ended 2025 with an ACL injury, would open up more than $23 million in space.

T-6. Cleveland Browns (fired Kevin Stefanski)

Total: 14

QB situation (4): Deshaun Watson began practicing on the field toward the end of the year and makes $80.7 million coming off a foot injury. He has played 19 whole games since 2022, and we are unsure if he is worth a quarter of that price tag, even if we skip over the sexual assault allegations that we absolutely cannot skip over.

Rookies Dillon Gabriel (937 yards, seven touchdowns, two picks, 80.8 passer rating) and Shedeur Sanders (1,400 yards, seven touchdowns, 10 picks, 68.1 passer rating) might have burned two 2024 draft picks to answer the backup quarterback question. Sanders did look like he had a leap toward the end of the year, and the Browns at least have options in-house.

Franchise stability (3): Did you read the section above? The only good news here is that the Browns live in a division of mediocrity, with the Steelers and Ravens underachieving until the end and the Cincinnati Bengals getting six wins despite the past offseason financial efforts to keep their quarterback-receiver talent intact.

Roster talent (6): Myles Garrett is still awesome! There are some talented pieces elsewhere, with rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger piling up 156 tackles in a season.

Offensively, running back Quinshon Judkins had a strong rookie year — it also came with a domestic assault allegation that led to no charges — as did tight end Harold Fannin Jr. But nearly the entire starting offensive line is entering free agency, and the receiver group need major upgrading.

Defensive tackle Mason Graham, last year’s No. 5 pick, had some meh basic numbers but still projects to be a talented interior force.

Cleveland owns the No. 6 pick and a late-first via the Jaguars.

8. Arizona Cardinals (fired Jonathan Gannon)

Total: 13

QB situation (4): Give this a bump if you feel somewhere in your heart that Kyler Murray could return and a new coach could optimize him. That seems out of touch with reality, where a bridge has probably been burnt and at this point in his career, he is what he is.

Owning the No. 3 pick gives the Cardinals a shot to draft a quarterback if one of the Raiders or Jets gets the ick and, best-case, only one quarterback is off the board. That seems unlikely. Reality appears that Arizona would be taking the third quarterback off the board in a draft where even the top two options are shrug-worthy.

Jacoby Brissett is under contract and could be a bridge quarterback, whether or not Arizona drafts the future option.

Franchise stability (4): Ossenfort’s press conference explaining the firing of Gannon became a test to see if he could defend his drafting and roster-building duties that were, of course, undercut by the injury bug. He enters his fourth year with a roster that hasn’t seen drastic talent improvement in three years on the job.

Roster talent (5): In Ossenfort’s defense, the injury-hit youngsters could get healthy and back on track. That is where there’s a good chance the roster talent isn’t as bad as the other teams on this list. There are plenty of in-house options who will have an opportunity to take starting jobs at positions like cornerback, linebacker and along the defensive line.

Trey Benson at running back, wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. has shown enough flashes if you put his draft position aside and Michael Wilson shocked the league with a huge Year 3 leap. Josh Sweat made the big spending worth it at edge.

Draft to bulk up the offensive line, attack the WR market in free agency to be sure about the depth in that group and you can sell us on a competitive team returning.

But a coach taking this gig must understand he’s potentially living without a franchise quarterback for a year.

9. Las Vegas Raiders (fired Pete Carroll)

Total: 11

QB situation (5*): Big asterisk here. The QB situation could swing a couple different ways. Starting quarterback Geno Smith is under contract, and the numbers weren’t dreadful. But Las Vegas has the No. 1 pick, and you’d think that is used on a quarterback so long as the evaluators led by (certainly not minority owner Tom Brady) general manager John Spytek like the options of college QBs Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore.

If not, that is an unfortunate spot to be in.

Franchise stability (3): Aside from Jon Gruden’s 22-31 run from 2018-21, owner Mark Davis and the Raiders have not had a head coach last longer than three seasons since — scrolling, scrolling, scrolling — Jon Gruden in 1998-2001.

Roster talent (3): Is Maxx Crosby on this team next year? It would appear that the team ticked him off by shutting him down against his will to secure the No. 1 pick in the draft. Hopefully, that answers our question about whether they like a quarterback in this draft class.

There is some fun talent like tight end Brock Bowers (680 receiving yards, seven touchdowns) and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty (975 rushing yards, 10 total touchdowns). But the foundations in the trenches aren’t there.",https://cdn.arizonasports.com/arizonasports/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cardinals-monti-ossenfort-trade-deadline-e1761766974701.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:14:26.593743

In 2025, Shavers stepped into a larger role with the Bills after making the team's 53-man roster at the end of training camp. He appeared in all 17 games during the regular season, recording 23 catches for 245 yards and a touchdown.

Buffalo also announced Monday that WR Gabe Davis tore his ACL against the Jaguars.

How would you grade the Patriots’ performance in the playoff opener?","The New England Patriots were able to exorcise some playoff demons. After going one-and-done in each of their last two appearances, they finally earned a victory again. Beating the visiting Los Angeles Chargers with a final score of 16-3, they won their first postseason game since the 2018 season and are now on their way to a divisional round meeting with the Houston Texans.

Before our attention turns to that game, let’s tie up some loose ends from the contest that was — a process that will give us some clarity of where the team needs to improve moving forward.

Patriots position grades from NFL wild card playoffs

Quarterback: Appearing in his first playoff game at 23 and with 29 career starts under his belt, Drake Maye looked a bit more jittery than usual. Whether it was the moment or the opposing defense, he started relatively slowly and had some plays he likely would want back — including an interception and a pair of fumbles while trying to make something out of nothing. Those were some uncharacteristically negative plays for the MVP candidate, but he also showed why he is deserving of that label. Maye made hay of some openings to finish with 69 rushing yards while his touchdown pass to Hunter Henry was as good as it gets. | Grade: B+

Running back: Rhamondre Stevenson continues to be a weapon for the Patriots, becoming just the third player in franchise history on Sunday to finish a postseason game with more than 50 yards both as a receiver and a runner. The veteran accumulated a combined 128 yards on 13 touches, despite New England’s blocking not always being up to par. Fellow running back TreVeyon Henderson was less actively featured, but still added 36 yards on 10 combined carries and catches and had a key blitz pickup on Maye’s touchdown pass to Henry. | Grade: A

Wide receiver: The Chargers dared the Patriots to beat man coverage on critical downs, and it proved to be a problem. Part of it was receivers getting open on a consistent basis, part of it was drops by both Stefon Diggs and DeMario Douglas. Against the Texans next Sunday, both will have to improve. It wasn’t all bad for the wideouts, though. Kayshon Boutte once again showcased his big-play abilities en route to a 66-yard outing, while Kyle Williams had a big blog on Rhamondre Stevenson’s 48-yard catch and run that helped set up the first field goal of the day. Efton Chism was quiet, but did catch a 20-yard pass on that same field goal drive. | Grade: C+

Tight end: Hunter Henry continues to be one of the Patriots’ most reliable performers, and he managed to haul in three passes for 64 yards and a touchdown against his former team. He also continued to look good as a run blocker, something that cannot be fully said about Austin Hooper. While New England’s second tight end had some tough moments and saw a would-be touchdown sail over his head, FB/TE-hybrid Jack Westover caught his first career pass for a gain of 8 yards | Grade: B+

Offensive line: Together for the first time since early November, the Patriots’ starting looked rusty at times. While Garrett Bradbury and Mike Onwenu fared mostly well at center and right guard, and right tackle Morgan Moses was stout in pass protection against a very good edge group, the left side was an issue. Tackle Will Campbell was driven back on multiple occasions, especially early on in the game, and failed to keep Odafe Oweh off of Drake Maye on his lost fumble in the early third quarter; guard Jared Wilson had several uneven moments as well in his debut after missing back-to-back games with a concussion. Both did get better as the game went on, and one would be remiss to mention that they are still rookies, but the Patriots need them to do better — and fast given what awaits. | Grade: C

Defensive line: It took the Patriots’ defensive line a while to get going, but once it did it was game over for the Chargers. Led by seven pressures each from K’Lavon Chaisson and Cory Durden, the group disrupted Justin Herbert on 56.8% of his dropbacks and sacked him six times. On one of those takedowns, Chaisson forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Christian Elliss; on another, Milton Williams put the nail in the coffin in the late fourth quarter. Scramble lane integrity was a bit uneven, but the outing against both the pass and the non-scramble run definitively what the team had in mind when it opened the checkbook to bring players like Williams, Chaisson and Harold Landry to town in the offseason. | Grade: A-

Linebacker: With Robert Spillane returning from a four-game absence and immediately playing 100% of snaps again, the Patriots linebacker group finally had all hands on deck again. It looked the part. Spillane, Christian Ellis and, to a lesser degree Jack Gibbens and Jahlani Tavai, were integral to New England’s pressure-heavy game plan and efforts to make Los Angeles’ offense one-dimensional. The group’s ability to come down from the second level to shut down gaps against the run and finish tackles in open space was crucial. | Grade: A

Cornerback: Before he departed with a head injury in the early fourth quarter, Christian Gonzalez played like he had a score to settle with those who opted not to vote him to the All-Pro team this year. He was outstanding, erasing whoever he was going up against. Fellow starters Carlton Davis and Marcus Jones also played a very good game, with the former bouncing back from an uneven performance in the regular season finale and the latter making some of the low-key biggest plays of the game. All in all, the group managed to severely limit the impact a good L.A. wide receiver room could have had on the game. | Grade: A

Safety: Even though he likely would have had the 10-yard catch back he gave up against tight end Oronde Gadsden on a fourth-quarter fourth down, Craig Woodson played one of the better games of his rookie season on Sunday. He finished with a team-leading nine tackles and also had a tackle for loss, while fellow starter Jaylinn Hawkins swarmed all over the secondary to help prevent the Chargers from hitting anything deep. The safety group has not always played on the same level as the cornerbacks this year, but on Sunday there was no such drop-off. | Grade: A

Special teams: Mike Vrabel praised the Patriots for a “very clean game from a special teams perspective” on Sunday night, and there is nothing more to add. Led by Andy Borregales’ three field goals, which proved to be the extent of the scoring for most of the game, New England’s kicking game operation constantly seemed like the more consistent of the two. | Grade: A

Drake Maye summed up the Patriots’ outing versus the Chargers well during his postgame presser, when he said that “[t]hey had a great defense, a great quarterback. We were the better team tonight. We made plays when we needed to.” Ultimately, that is what matters — and will continue to do so with a big challenge coming up.

While he emerged victorious after a game-winning touchdown drive, Stafford sustained an index finger injury in the middle of the game that appeared to hamper his abilities throughout the contest.

Rams head coach Sean McVay later revealed Stafford sustained a sprain to his finger but would be available for the divisional round game against the Chicago Bears. Stafford, meanwhile, told Jim Gray on the ""Let's Go!"" podcast that he doesn't have any concerns about his finger injury ahead of the critical playoff match.

“Hand is good. I'm not worried about it at all,"" he said. ""I was just throwing a ball over the middle to Puka [Nacua] and caught somebody's forearm. Just bent it way back. I was just looking down a little bit, like what's this thing gonna look like when I go down there and look at it? But it was fine, a little bit stiff throughout the game, like a jammed finger. But I know by Sunday next week I'll be feeling great.”

This is great news for the Rams, as even a slightly injured Stafford could have forced McVay to adjust the game plan a bit. Stafford might be overselling his pain tolerance for the injury, but his confidence is a good sign that he'll be business as usual against the Bears.

At the very least, he'll have his full cadre of pass-catchers to utilize once more. Nacua led the team with 10 receptions for 111 yards, one receiving touchdown and one rushing touchdown in the wild-card win, while Davante Adams, Kyren Wiliams, Blake Corum and tight ends Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson will both be ready to go.

The shocking loss, in which the NFL’s most expensive defense forced three turnovers against Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud but ultimately fell by a 24-point margin, preceded the announcement that Mike Tomlin would be stepping down as Pittsburgh’s head coach after 19 seasons. The team made it official with a statement from team president Art Rooney II on Tuesday afternoon.

In addition to plenty of shakeups in the league’s coaching carousel — currently sitting with nine head coaching vacancies — it was a record-setting wild-card round. This round marked the first time in NFL history that four-plus games were decided by four or fewer points in a single postseason round, per Opta Stats; it’s also the first time there have been six-plus fourth-quarter lead changes in a single playoff round in NFL history, Dante Koplowitz-Fleming of NFL research noted.

The Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers opened things up with a surprising thriller; after LA entered the week as historic road favorites, its 34-31 win over Carolina came down to the wire as MVP favorite Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard, go-ahead touchdown to tight end Colby Parkinson in the final minute of the game. The Panthers got bad news on top of the loss, as starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu reportedly suffered a ruptured patellar tendon, which could affect his availability next season.

That was followed by another Saturday thriller, as Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears mounted yet another comeback win — this time, over their NFC North rival, the Green Bay Packers — to advance to the divisional round. The Packers were off to a 21-3 lead in the first half before the Bears dropped 25 points in the fourth quarter to take the win.

On Sunday, the magic continued with the Josh Allen-led Buffalo Bills defeating Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars, ending Liam Coen’s Cinderella-esque first season as a head coach. After Allen managed a rushing touchdown after the two-minute warning (right after the best tush push ever, perhaps?), a perfectly timed interception from Bills safety Cole Bishop put Allen in position to kneel it out and snag the team’s first road playoff win in 33 years.

The San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles followed that up with another game that came down to the wire, as the Niners dethroned Philly with a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive (and some trickery from wideout Jauan Jennings). Despite the thrilling win, the Niners will have to deal with yet another brutal blow on the injury front, as All-Pro tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles injury, ending his season.

Despite holding Drake Maye to just one touchdown, the Los Angeles Chargers couldn’t muster up enough offense to take down the New England Patriots. Los Angeles failed to score a touchdown during the contest, losing 16-3 and inviting questions over whether the Chargers’ coaching staff needs to be shaken up over the offseason.

More on the Seattle Seahawks","RENTON, Wash. (AP) — Ahead of the Seattle Seahawks’ first home playoff game in five years, and their first in front of fans since 2017, their top two coordinators each spent the end of last week interviewing for jobs elsewhere.

What national voices are saying about Sam Darnold

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins for their head coaching vacancies, while defensive coordinator Aden Durde did the same with the Falcons and Cleveland Browns. But Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald wasn’t worried about his assistants’ focus on their jobs ahead of Seattle’s matchup with the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday.

NFL playoff bracket

The Seahawks had a bye as the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and Kubiak and Durde did their interviews on days the team was off.

“It worked out well that they had the two days off and they could kind of shift their focus,” Macdonald said. “Once it’s over, then that’s over and we’re able to move forward. So really fortunate we had the bye.”

Last week’s practices, he said, consisted mostly of self-scouting and working ahead on potential playoff opponents. Now, Seattle has turned its focus to San Francisco, which ended Philadelphia’s bid for a Super Bowl repeat with a 23-19 victory on Sunday.

“I think just watching it live, it was just an incredibly resilient win,” Macdonald said of the 49ers. “I mean, the team has a lot of character. They’re really tough. You know, but really it’s nothing new with these guys. It’s what you know. But it’s a heck of a win. Tough place to go and play and get a win.”

Arroyo and Bryant could return

Both tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) and safety Coby Bryant (knee) are expected to practice this week. Arroyo, who missed the final four games of the regular season and landed on injured reserve, returned to practice last week and could play Saturday.

“Elijah is looking good,” Macdonald said. “He’s a possibility about coming back for this game.”

Bryant missed the Seahawks’ last two games with a knee injury. Left tackle Charles Cross, who signed a four-year contract extension last week, is expected to be back in the starting lineup. Cross missed the last three games with a hamstring injury.

That's the reality for the 49ers in what has been an injury-riddled season for almost everyone involved. George Kittle is the latest to suffer a major injury, which will sideline him for the remainder of the postseason and beyond.

The 32-year-old star tight end suffered a torn Achilles during the Niners' wild-card weekend win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Kittle now joins a list that already includes Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and Brandon Aiyuk, among others.

While his team sets their sights on the divisional round, Kittle is now staring down a long road of rehab before getting back on the field again.

San Francisco has been tested time and time again this season. Now they'll have to deal with losing the heart and soul leader of the group.

Here's a look at how long Kittle could be sidelined.

What happened to George Kittle?

Kittle suffered a torn Achilles during the second quarter of the 49ers' wild-card weekend win over the Eagles.

The star tight end addressed the injury on Jan. 12 in an Instagram post.

""Football sucks sometimes,"" Kittle wrote. ""But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.""

There wasn't much doubt about the injury for Kittle, who saw his season promptly come to an end after a 6-yard catch.

""The trainers knew before the cart came out,"" head coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. ""They got word to me in the headset.""

Kittle has been no stranger to injuries this season, having already missed time with hamstring issues and an ankle ailment.

From a contractual standpoint, the star tight end just inked a new four-year, $76.4 million extension in April 2025 to extend his stay in the Bay Area through the 2029 season.

George Kittle injury updates

Kittle suffered a torn Achilles and is out for the remainder of the season.

It was quickly confirmed after the star was carted off the field, bypassing the typical ""questionable"" designation that most players earn.

Kittle's exit came after his only catch of the game, which resulted in a 6-yard gain. The 49ers were trailing 13-7.

How long is George Kittle out?

Kittle is out for the remainder of the 49ers' postseason and figures to miss a large portion, if not all, of the 2026 season as well.

A torn Achilles typically carries a recovery timeline of about 9-to-12 months, which would put Kittle's return in mid-Oct. at the earliest if he had surgery immediately after the injury. Given that Kittle would've missed offseason activities, training camp and the preseason, it's unlikely he would be thrown right back into action without any ramping up.

The timeline isn't favorable to Kittle for the 2026 season, meaning his next game might not come until the 2027 season, when he'll be 34.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/USAT/88151069007-george-kittle-011226.jpg?crop=2177,1224,x1788,y574&width=2177&height=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-13 15:04:00.639325

Kittle, who has been named a first-team All-Pro twice, missed several games this season with a hamstring injury he suffered in the Week 1 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. He didn’t return until the 49ers’ Week 7 game against the Falcons on Oct. 19.

Selected by San Francisco in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft, Kittle now ranks 10th all-time among tight ends in yards (8,008) and 11th in receptions (595).

Kittle had words of gratitude for his teammates and owner Jed York in his Monday post:

“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it. I love these guys and this team,” Kittle wrote. “Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.”

49ers All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams said he was in “disbelief” after Kittle was injured. “He’s like Superman around here.”

Fullback Kyle Juszczyk was emotional about Kittle’s injury in a postgame interview with CBS Sports, his voice cracking at times.

“It’s tough, man. It sucks, but I know he definitely would be happy with the win,” Juszczyk said. “Like he said to me at halftime, he’s not dead. He’s going to be all right. If anybody can handle this, it’s George Kittle.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/12200153/GettyImages-2255770045-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-13 16:01:25.802388

The matchup is thanks to the San Francisco 49ers beating the Philadelphia Eagles 23-19 over the weekend. The 49ers are heading to Lumen Field to face the Seattle Seahawks.

The Rams took down the Carolina Panthers 34-31 after a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown passes from Stafford. Chicago just had another insane 4th quarter comeback of its own after being down 21-6.

After going into halftime with a 21-3 deficit, the Bears allowed the Green Bay Packers to score six points and put up 28 of their own in the second half for a 31-27 win.

Sunday's game will be the first time the Rams and Bears have played since last season. Chicago got a 24-18 win over Los Angeles in that game.

It should be an exciting matchup, but there is growing concern about Stafford and the injury he suffered during the Wild Card game against the Panthers. A helmet hit Stafford's finger, and Rams' head coach Sean McVay revealed that the quarterback has a sprain in his index finger at a recent press conference.

""Yeah, he's just got a little sprain on his index finger,"" McVay said. ""Um, you guys saw, you know, kind of hit the helmet. Um, he's as tough as it gets, but he's feeling good. Had a little, you know, sprain on his finger. I don't want to say little, but he had a sprain on the index finger, but he was able to push through it. He's as tough as it gets, and we'll be good to go.""

Playing with this injury could be a big-time risk for Stafford and the Rams. If the veteran quarterback does play, there's a chance it would inhibit his ability to throw the football and have him at less than 100%.

There is also the added factor of playing in the cold environment at Soldier Field. Since Chicago is the higher seed, it will host the game.

Throughout Stafford's career, he is 1-9 in games with cold temperatures. The quarterback has thrown 14 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in those conditions. For reference, it's going to be just under 10 degrees in Chicago at game time on Sunday.

For now, let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every divisional-round game.
49ers at Seahawks Like the Bills, the 49ers are playing on six days rest against an opponent who got the week off.
The Seahawks absolutely dominated the 49ers' offensive line in the game that decided the No.
But the injuries to Trapilo and Edwards have me less confident the Bears will find a way to win the game.","Survive and advance is the name of the game in the NFL playoffs, and while six teams pulled it off on Super Wild Card Weekend, survive is a relative term for key players on the teams that advanced. Whether it was ACL or Achilles tears, concussions or even just a star QB playing through a finger injury, no team made it out of the wild-card round unscathed.

The Rams lost starting corner Ahkello Witherspoon for the rest of the playoffs, but the main focus was around Matthew Stafford's finger injury, which seemed to affect the MVP candidate for a portion of the win over the Panthers. Postgame X-rays on the finger were negative, and considering he finished the game, I'm not expecting him to miss any time.

The Bears pulled out the win against the rival Packers but lost left tackle Ozzy Trapilo and linebacker T.J. Edwards to season-ending injuries. The former solidified the blindside protection for Caleb Williams after taking over the role, so Trapilo's injury has a chance to be one of the more impactful from the wild-card round. Edwards is a key component in the middle of the defense as well.

The Bills relied on Josh Allen's heroics to gut out a win over the Jaguars but lost Gabe Davis to a torn ACL and Jordan Poyer to a hamstring injury that will likely keep him out against Denver. Dalton Kincaid was also in a boot after the game but the situation was labeled precautionary; we'll see how much that's true as practice reports come out throughout the week.

The 49ers cannot catch a break with injuries, losing star tight end George Kittle to a torn Achilles in the win over the Eagles. Kittle is the most complete tight end in the league, and while the team managed to survive his stint on IR earlier in the season, this latest injury plus the absences on defense could be what finally ends their run against a rested Seattle team.

The Patriots were up next, shutting down the Chargers offense en route to a low-scoring win, but star corner Christian Gonzalez picked up a head injury during the game. His placement in the concussion protocol means his status for the matchup with the Texans is in question.

The Texans closed out the weekend with a dominant win over the Steelers but lost their own star on the offensive side of the ball to a concussion as well. Nico Collins has one less day of recovery to get ready to face New England after playing on Monday, and the calculus of the matchup changes if one or both of Collins and Gonzalez can't go.

With all the injuries, the biggest winners of the wild-card round may be the teams that didn't play. The Seahawks and Broncos didn't lose any key players over the weekend, and each could have a player return from IR as Denver linebacker Drew Sanders and Seattle tight end Elijah Arroyo seem to be tracking toward playing this weekend. Other key players who could be back for wild-card winners include Bills defensive tackle Ed Oliver, Rams guard Kevin Dotson and 49ers receiver Ricky Pearsall.

I'll have my spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to access all my picks as they're made throughout the week and hopefully take advantage of some good line value. For now, let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every divisional-round game.

Divisional round power ratings

The Broncos and Seahawks get a half-point bump for the rest advantage they enjoyed by not playing last week, but I'm also bumping up the Rams with the expectation Stafford is fine and Dotson's potential return matters more than the loss of Witherspoon.

I moved the Patriots up a full point due in large part to a defense that got back Milton Williams, Robert Spillane and Harold Landry over the last two weeks. Playcaller Zak Kuhr also had a fantastic game in the win over the Chargers, and that ability to keep the offense guessing could give New England as good a defensive unit as the other teams left on the AFC side of the bracket but with a higher offensive ceiling.

I was thoroughly impressed by the Bills' defensive effort as well, and we'll see how much of that is repeatable this week and how much was chalked up to abysmal decision-making by Trevor Lawrence. I'm keeping them where I had them in my ratings, as I felt I was already being pretty aggressive with the best-case scenario for Allen's health.

The Texans don't get a bump either, even though they dominated the box score, and that's because of both the Collins injury and how careless C.J. Stroud was with the ball in the win. It ended up not mattering, but you can't outplay a team by that much and only hold a 7-6 halftime lead, counting on your defense to score to win a game.

I knocked the 49ers down due to the Kittle injury and to not fully buying into the play of the defense after how easy the Eagles' playcalling made it for them. I probably could've done the same with the Bears but decided as the low man on the table I'd just keep them where I have them.

Let's take a quick look at each game's spread projection

Bills at Broncos

I understand why the Bills opened as favorites once again, as so much gets attributed to the quarterback position, but once again I feel like the completeness of the Denver roster plus home-field advantage should make them clear favorites in this game. My spread projection is Broncos -3.5.

Last week, we saw late movement push the Jaguars to 2-point favorites by game day, and after seeing where this spread opened I felt like we were in line for the same movement. That may be happening early, as I see the Broncos as slight favorites on the money line at some books as of Tuesday morning. The rest advantage may play a huge factor here as well.

49ers at Seahawks

Like the Bills, the 49ers are playing on six days rest against an opponent who got the week off. However, San Francisco also lost a major part of their team with Kittle's torn Achilles. My projections make this Seahawks -7.5, so I agree with the market move that has pushed it up from an opener of 7 at many books.

The Seahawks absolutely dominated the 49ers' offensive line in the game that decided the No. 1 seed in Week 18, but San Francisco didn't have left tackle Trent Williams that day, and he may be the most valuable player in football (even if the award always goes to a quarterback). His presence gives the line a fighting chance, but we'll see what impact the Kittle injury has on the rest of the offense and whether the defense can replicate its effort from last week.

Texans at Patriots

This line opened at Patriots -2.5 at most books but is likely to quickly settle at 3. My projected spread would be a decent bit higher, as I have the Patriots as 2.5 points better on a neutral field and 5-point favorites in Foxborough.

The outdoor environment seemed to affect Stroud in the win over the Steelers, with just one successful offensive drive that resulted in points until the fourth quarter when the Houston defense had let the air out of Pittsburgh. This should be a tougher test for the Texans against a Patriots offense that isn't as likely to be turned into mush by Houston's excellent defensive unit.

Rams at Bears

This is actually a pretty significant line considering the Bears have had a quality home-field advantage in recent years, but my gap between the teams would actually make it Rams -4 based on ratings.

I wanted to love the Bears this week due to their ability to generate turnovers on defense, which we've seen Matthew Stafford struggle with in the Rams' losses down the stretch. But the injuries to Trapilo and Edwards have me less confident the Bears will find a way to win the game.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/13/83ac7ecd-297f-4d84-baf1-32683c883008/thumbnail/1200x675/d3afa37923030ebf5b5940d7fd235ba5/george-kittle-49ers-injury.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 18:02:02.606232

There’s such a dearth of well sized, athletic left tackles in this draft and Lomu could be elevated based on upside.

The big question will be — with a weak draft class in 2026 — how reasonable are selling teams going to be to make deals?","I’m publishing an updated Horizontal Board today with accompanying notes. Things will be impacted in the next few weeks by the Senior Bowl. I’ve also created a list of players at the end of the piece who are either not turning pro or have transferred to stay in college.

Position-by-position breakdowns

Quarterbacks

I think it’d be a mistake for Oregon’s Dante Moore to declare. The game against Indiana showed he needs more playing experience. Plus, is that really the way you want to end your college career? He will undoubtedly be well compensated for playing another season of college football. I hope the people advising him are focusing on what gives him the best chance to have a long and successful pro career and not what’s best to ‘game’ the draft and take advantage of a weak class.

Should Moore remain at Oregon, Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza is going to be the #1 overall pick. He deserves a lot of respect for his 2025 season. However, I don’t personally believe he deserves a first round grade, let alone going first overall.

Physically he is good not great — both in terms of arm talent and improv. He doesn’t operate under center and benefits a lot from a scheme that is about as well coached as you’ll ever see in college football. The abundance of back-shoulder throws won’t be readily there at the next level and he will need to challenge more into tight windows over the middle and deliver downfield. His footwork also needs cleaning up after his initial read isn’t open.

Before the Oregon game he only ranked 13th for EPA in college football — which speaks to the Indiana environment meshing with his talent and consistency. I think the challenge for the Raiders, if they select him, will be to create a dynamic and brilliant offensive scheme. Mendoza is not a physical marvel waiting to take the league by storm (although his accuracy, poise and the way he’s elevated Indiana this year all should be noted).

Vegas need an inspired offensive-minded Head Coach to lead from the front and set out a clearly defined system. If they do this, Mendoza can thrive within structure and they’ll make the most out of the positive aspects he delivers — including his obvious dedication to his craft. He is not a rare franchise saviour who can revolutionise a franchise with individual brilliance though.

If Trinidad Chambliss (Ole Miss) fails in his court case to gain another year of eligibility, I think he could be a fascinating prospect. He made plays out of structure for Ole Miss that were very interesting.

There isn’t a quarterback in this class I would draft in round one. If I were a team needing to select a quarterback, I would be pitching to the owner why we had to wait and would offer veteran solutions for the short term. Some owners won’t want to hear that, of course.

I think there’s a chance Ty Simpson (Alabama) will find a home in the top-40 — potentially to a team like Minnesota who should be dipping back into the market. That feels like a good scheme fit. I would also be interested in Garrett Nussmeier (LSU) and Taylen Green (Arkansas) if they stick on the board. They are two players with obvious plus talent who for different reasons did not have the finish to 2025 they would’ve hoped for. There could be value in taking a shot on both with a low-risk pick later on.

Running backs

The position is led by Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love — a potential top-five pick with the potential to be the next dynamic runner in the NFL to go along with the James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs, De’Von Achane type backs.

The more I’ve watched of the class though I just don’t think there’s a ton of value to be had early on. I really enjoyed watching Emmett Johnson (Nebraska) and Mike Washington Jr (Arkansas) but I think you have to cap their value at round three and believe they could be available later than that.

Johnson doesn’t have a majorly explosive looking lower half. His speed is good but he doesn’t have a second gear when he breaks free. He’s not a short-yardage power back. He’s agile and quick and makes plays in the passing game but he’s a 7.5/10 talent in college and probably a 5.5/10 at the next level.

Washington Jr collected yards after contact during his best spell of 2025 but his impact was limited by how often Arkansas had to play from behind. He dodges and weaves through tackles but doesn’t possess game-changing long-speed. He reminds me of Knile Davis, a third round pick from the same school in 2013.

Nicholas Singleton (Penn State) has bags of physical potential but his final year in college was a massive disappointment. You might be able to find a diamond here if you believe he has a lot more to offer. I think he does.

If you’re in the market for a really good running back next year, there’s one solution if you’re not in position to get Love early in round one. Call the Dolphins about Achane. I don’t think people realise just how good he is. A lot of people scoffed at a second round price tag at the trade deadline. With hindsight — I think a good team should’ve pulled the trigger:

Wide receivers

I think USC’s Makai Lemon will be the first receiver drafted and he should probably send Jaxon Smith-Njigba a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape when it happens. Lemon has a very similar frame and playing style. With JSN’s excellent year fresh in the minds of GM’s, don’t expect Lemon to last into the 20’s.

He’s savvy with his routes and can get open in both the short-game and downfield. He adjusts to the ball in the air superbly and his ball-tracking is top tier. He shows strong and consistent hands paired with excellent focus and technique. He’s not electric or sudden but he’s shifty and finds ways to get open. I really like him.

Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State) won’t be too far behind, provided he passes all medical checks. His injury history will be a concern (14 missed games out of 38 for ASU). However, he’s such a natural receiver that there’s every chance he will also find a home within the top-20.

Tyson wins a lot of contested catches and can jump up to go and get the ball. He did a bit of everything in college — slot, outside, screens. He shows good hands, he turned awkward and off-target throws into completions and he has a subtle separation talent to make up for a lack of blazing quickness. His ball-tracking is good and it’s easy to imagine him making plays in the league.

Carnell Tate (Ohio State) saw his season tail off at the end but he too should go reasonably quickly. He has great body control, he catches the ball away from his body, he can hang in the air to make catches and his ball-tracking is also excellent. He lines up almost exclusively outside and his speed is a question mark.

Lemon, Tyson and Tate all have a very reasonable chance to become solid NFL starters.

After that there’s some depth but I sense we might end up seeing players pushed way above their grading. I’m struggling with the first round buzz Washington’s Denzel Boston is getting. To me he feels like a useful bigger target on slants and in the red zone but someone who will struggle to separate at the next level and doesn’t have the vertical leaping ability to win-out.

Zachariah Branch (Georgia) is a screen/pass into the flat specialist used basically as a ‘kick-returner’ on offense, getting the ball into his hands and trying to get him to run through traffic. He has an explosive lower half and he can sprint away from defenders in space but he wasn’t used as a conventional receiver and his tendency to body catch highlights this. Again, it’s hard to see some of the round one buzz here.

KC Concepcion (Texas A&M) could go in round one due to his ability to separate and make big plays — but that’s not certain. I’m hoping Evan Stewart returns to Oregon after missing the 2025 season with a serious injury.

Tight end

After a strong top of the draft a year ago, this is the opposite. Oregon’s Kenyon Sadiq is regularly assumed to be a very high pick but what is this based on? Testing. He’s expected to be one of the big winners at the combine. His performance on the field for Oregon was nothing to write home about. Did you feel his presence against Texas Tech or Indiana? He only had four games this year with +50 yards.

He’s talking about potentially going back to school. I think he should. A lot more development is needed here and I’d have a hard time taking him early believing his production is suddenly going to explode at the next level. I’d describe his blocking as ‘OK’. He’s a major upside project.

Eli Stowers (Vanderbilt) feels like someone who is more likely to come in and contribute quickly but he will need to test well to show off his upside to warrant going in round two. I’m glad the Seahawks took the opportunity to draft Elijah Arroyo a year ago and believe in time he will prove to be an inspired pick. There are no truly exciting solutions as part of this draft class.

Offensive line

Spencer Fano (Utah) and Francis Mauigoa (Miami) should both go very early. They are highly aggressive, tone-setting, consistent arse kickers. Both might have to kick inside to guard, however.

The more I watched of Caleb Lomu (Utah) I think he might go quite early too. There’s such a dearth of well sized, athletic left tackles in this draft and Lomu could be elevated based on upside. He could go in the top-20.

I’ve really battled with Kadyn Proctor (Alabama) and I studied a bunch of his tape again recently. I think I like him more than I did prior to that work. I still have real reservations about his size/weight and how that’d need to be controlled. However — he ticks a few boxes. His zone-blocking is surprisingly effective. He does a great job moving into space and finding blocks at the second level. He can smother and dominate when blocking square-on. He bullies opponents 1v1 in a wrestling match. He’s shown evidence of passing off defenders to handle stunts. He’s a finisher and a people mover. He also has rare speed/mobility for his frame — although that works best moving forwards and not protecting the edge at tackle.

There is a level of uniqueness to Proctor you don’t see with many players and in a draft like this, I’d probably roll the dice. If you have the luxury of drafting him to kick inside to guard, even better. I think he could be really good there. I’m not sure I’d trust him defending the edge against speed at the next level.

I think Brian Parker (Duke) might go earlier than people realise. He’s an excellent zone blocker and moves people off the ball. He’s extremely physical. He shows good technique with the ability to get his hands inside to control blocks. He’s very mobile and capable of progressing to the second level. His success rate landing on second-level blocks is impressive and he uses forceful hands to jolt defenders off balance with violence.

There are examples on tape of him springing big run plays due to his key blocking Duke seemed to funnel their run game to his side. I think he has a bright future and is worthy of top-45 talk.

Gennings Dunker (Iowa) and Emmanuel Pregnon (Oregon) also provide quality zone-blocking tape and finishing ability. Dunker, like Parker, will project to move inside from tackle. I wonder if we could see a major run on offensive linemen simply because there are players here with some starting ability and you can’t say that in other areas of this class.

Later round options that have caught my eye include Beau Stephens (Iowa) and Pat Coogan (Indiana). Stephens is another really good zone-blocker. He sinks his hips well to anchor, is adept at getting on the move and reaching up to the second level. He has the brawling mentality you expect from an Iowa lineman. There are examples on tape of him turning defenders and finishing his blocks to the turf. He has a willingness to combo block but some technical tweaks are needed to execute at a higher level. I’d prefer to see a better initial punch into the chest of opponents. Coogan excelled against Oregon and while his upside is limited — he’s going to give everything on every down. There’s evidence of good zone-blocking on tape.

I studied newly declared Monroe Freeling (Georgia) today before writing this piece. He’s a pure pass-pro tackle and not a great run blocker. His height (6-7) means he struggles with leverage and he has a high centre of gravity. He gets beat through the chest because he can’t sink and anchor well enough. He can also get out over his toes when he gets on the move — lunging at blocks. There’s enough athleticism to seal off the edge with his footwork and his foot-speed on the kick-step is a positive. He showed he can contain Texas’ Colin Simmons with his kick-step and peppering hands. Yet his technique needs major work — he too often lunges at EDGE defenders with his arms over-extended meaning he’ll be so easy to counter off. He also loses all balance and it hinders his base.

He’s a project with upside but there’s a lot of work needed and he’s not helping you set a tone up front. I think he could go in round two because teams are always looking for athletic tackles.

EDGE

I’m really struggling to understand the first round buzz with some of these players. David Bailey (Texas Tech) has taken the form of ‘first round lock’ in the media but I just found his tape underwhelming. Cashius Howell (Texas A&M) is going to get blasted against the run at the next level. Romello Height (Texas Tech) is a rotational rusher and R Mason Thomas (Oklahoma) plays with a lot of intensity and motor but as with many defensive ends/EDGE rushers in this class, he just doesn’t have the measurables.

I have Joshua Josephs (Tennessee) currently graded as my top EDGE after reviewing tape. He looks the part with great arm length and a long, lean frame. He shows evidence of speed-to-power. He works nicely to disengage and his arm/over can be effective to win 1v1. He seems to prefer to sprint into contact rather than the preferred bend/straighten which isn’t ideal but Josephs offers a physical playing style and the motor never stops. His run discipline is evident on tape. I think he’s someone who could realistically start and play some early downs without necessarily being a star player.

This isn’t a class where I’d be looking for solutions if I wanted to add an impact rusher. I think you all know by now what I would do if that was a desired off-season aim.

Defensive end

Keldric Faulk (Auburn) is one of several players with enticing physical tools who didn’t have a great 2025 season — yet within this class he could/should be a top-15 pick because those teams at the top will need to take someone. After that, I think Ohio State’s Kenyatta Jackson (if he turns pro) has some intriguing upside, perhaps enough to tempt a team to take him in the top-40.

I’ve been pretty consistent since September in saying I think Rueben Bain Jr (Miami) has been overrated by the media and fans on Twitter. Short-armed players with his frame and playing style don’t go early in round one.

He has 30 inch arms at 270lbs with a stocky 6-3 frame — that’s difficult to place in a NFL context. Is he an inside/out rusher? Not many players with his body type succeed. His game is based on power and while he does show occasional bend for his size he just doesn’t seem all that twitchy. He had a four game stretch where he missed 21.3% of his tackles in 2025 and he just reminds me of those AJ Epenesa, Boogie Basham, Myles Murphy types who go earlier than they should. He has this tendency at Miami to be impactful one week and then have a couple of games where you barely notice he’s playing. The limitations in this class could mean he still finds a home in round one but it’s not the banker many would have you believe.

I’m also not sure why his older team-mate, Akheem Mesidor, who has an injury history, is being projected in round one. I thought his tape was pretty average personally.

There’s not a lot of excitement to be had here. This isn’t a position in the draft I’d be chasing.

Defensive tackle

Ohio State’s Kayden McDonald is one of the best six players in the draft. His run-defense and ability to control double-teams, anchor down, disengage and just generally be a load in the middle of the defense are not typical. On top of that, he has great size (325lbs) and carries his weight well. He’s also far more athletic than people give him credit for — there’s untapped pass-rush ability here. I think he’s potentially another Derrick Brown.

Peter Woods (Clemson) had a very disappointing season but is expected to run a 4.8 at +300lbs so teams may feel obliged to take him early, knowing his 2024 tape was so much better than what we saw in 2025. Caleb Banks (Florida) had injury problems all year but there simply aren’t many humans with his incredible size, length and ability to disrupt. If he passes medical checks he will go early.

Domonique Orange (Iowa State) is a big nose tackle type with plus athleticism and disruptive qualities. I think he’d be a very solid day two pick. Darrell Jackson Jr (Florida State) is another player who just jumps off the screen thanks to his size, motor, aggression and length. He plays with genuine violence to throw off blocks with disdain. His one-arm bull rush is interesting and effective. At the very least he can provide some early-down run defense value. In my notes I wrote ‘has an AFC North vibe to him’.

I get why A’Mauri Washington (Oregon) is talked up as a first round type due to his athletic upside for his size. He does things a lot of players can’t do — albeit in flashes. His bull-rush is thunderous when it starts rumbling. He has reps on tape where he side-steps O-liners to dodge blocks like he’s 250lbs. Yet he had too many games in 2025 where you barely noticed he was playing or you even thought, ‘is that the guy everyone is putting in round one?’ He needs a lot of work.

I’m not buying the sudden ‘Lee Hunter (Texas Tech) in round one’ talk either. His frame is unappealing and apologies for the crude comparison — he’s built like an orange. I’m not convinced he’ll test well. He does have surprising shiftiness and an ability to dodge blocks to penetrate. He can also sift down the line to get a feel for the blocks then slip through gaps. His arm/over is competent but he’s not a bully vs the run and doesn’t take the game to the opponent with violent hands.

Linebacker

Ohio State’s Arvell Reese is going to be a very high pick as a hybrid EDGE/LB who could develop into another Abdul Carter type player. He plays with a thunderous ferocity, getting under the pads of bigger linemen and somehow stacking/disengaging. He delivers a jolting punch which has to be seen to be believed at his size. He displaces linemen to throw them off balance which again, at his size, is remarkable.

He’s a tremendous run defender because of his ability to disengage and/or keep his frame clean. There’s evidence on tape of throwing off offensive tackles to explode into the backfield. As a linebacker he plays with fantastic range and he looks like a sudden athlete. He’s very willing to fill gaps and put a hat on a hat. He’s light on his feet and will read/react to make plays. His pursuit speed is excellent. That said, he had quiet games in the BIG-10 Championship and Ohio State’s playoff exit to Miami.

CJ Allen (Georgia) has grown on me. He’s a classic downhill linebacker who can explode to attack the LOS and expose gap opportunities with his quickness. His closing speed when running forward is excellent. He reads the eyes of the QB and remains patient when playing read/react. He has good stalking speed when he runs to the sideline.

He likes to keep everything in front of him and doesn’t look that comfortable going backwards. He’s not the best at reacting to play-action and he could be exposed when forced into coverage situations. His tackles pack a punch and he’ll help set a stone. His lateral movements (sidesteps) are solid but not the most sudden or free. He doesn’t miss many tackles. There’s a little bit of stiffness/tightness with his movements.

I think he has the makings of a solid starter.

I’m not sure why Sonny Styles (Ohio State) is suddenly being projected as a top-20 lock everywhere. Is it because of testing? The former safety is a long, lean linebacker but he doesn’t have a typical build for the position. You can see his former DB background in the way he drops with ease. Yet he lacks take-on power when attacking the LOS, he doesn’t always fly to the ball carrier and he can overcommit and get washed out. There’s some over-eagerness at times that means he runs into blocks and it costs him. You can see tight ends having success in the blocking game against him too.

I like linebackers with speed, range and mobility but to me Styles feels like a project who warrants far more restraint in terms of taking a shot than the top-20. For me he’s a day-two player.

One player I loved watching is Kyle Louis (Pittsburgh). He’s undersized and I’m not sure he’s going to test well enough to compensate for that — however, he gives absolutely everything in every game and he’s said to be an absolute work-horse off the field in terms of preparation and dedication. Keep an eye on him during the Senior Bowl.

Cornerback

Clemson’s Avieon Terrell covers well running across the field and he’s sticky downfield with strong recover ability. For me he has the most potential to be a plus starter — although his lack of size looks an issue at times. I did like the way he played the run and his brother has obviously had success in the league. There’s a natural classiness to his play which speaks to those bloodlines. He looks like a NFL player on tape.

Jermod McCoy (Tennessee) has a lot of snaps where he’s face-guarding but he’s well built and can stick in coverage downfield. He’s a ball of clay to develop into a rounded CB1. There are injury checks to take place after he missed 2025 but he sticks in the hip-pocket in man and can trace steps downfield with ease. He looks the part but against the top opponents (Jeremiah Smith & Ryan Williams) he did give up some plays.

Mansoor Delane (LSU) is intelligent, makes plays on the ball and shows a degree of natural talent and flair for the position. The concern is his long-speed and testing — and whether limitations here could be an issue at the next level.

Safety

Ohio state’s Caleb Downs is one of the best players in the draft, possibly the best. Testing expectations are not sky-high and with his low positional value he might last a bit longer on draft day than he should (see: Kyle Hamilton). He is probably the safest bet in the class to hit on a good starter.

Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman is being slept on — he is expected to test brilliantly and he has good size too. His range as a deep-cover safety is impressive and he can be a chess piece at the next level. Keep an eye on Arizona’s Genesis Smith too.

Overall assessment

There’s still time for things to change but right now I think it’s pretty clear what this class is (or isn’t). There’s a distinct lack of obvious blue-chippers at the top of round one. You are unlikely to find players from #15 onwards with first round grades, at least in my view. You will badly struggle to get value in round two.

I think we’ll see teams resort to attacking the trenches positions, receiver and cornerback early — feeling like these are the areas you might as well plunder if the grading value isn’t up to par.

I continue to think we’ll see a rich appetite for teams picking later in each round to attack the veteran trade market. The big question will be — with a weak draft class in 2026 — how reasonable are selling teams going to be to make deals? And are you going to have to dig into your 2027 resources to sweeten certain deals?

The Los Angeles Chargers' 16-3 loss to the New England Patriots marked the sixth one-and-done postseason appearance of his career -- one with Oakland, two in Chicago, three with L.A.

The question is whether Mack, who turns 35 next month, is going to give it a 13th year to find that postseason win, or hang up the pads and wait for Canton to call.

""Not trying to make that decision right now like I've almost done before,"" Mack said Monday, via the team’s official website. ""Trying to stay as present as possible, stay prayed up, make a decision based on how I'm feeling and how my family is feeling, the vibes.

""If the vibes are high, the decisions will be made. Just figuring it out day by day.""

Mack considered retirement last year before ultimately inking a one-year deal to remain in L.A. He is slated to hit free agency in March. For now, the latest playoff loss is too fresh for him to consider what the future might bring.

""You're still kind of processing it a little bit, but ultimately ... just didn't do enough to win,"" Mack said. ""Can't live with ifs and what-ifs. Turn that page and look forward to getting better in all facets of the game. The chips fall where they may without talking too far ahead. Try to stay where your feet at. One of those things where you're pissed off, but what happened was supposed to happen.""

Mack later added that he doesn't want to ""make a decision based on how you feel in the present moment, especially after a tough loss. It's about taking time and taking that step back.""

While missing five games due to injury, Mack compiled 5.5 sacks, 11 QB hits and 32 tackles. His 113 career sacks place him 29th all-time and seventh among active players.

Even as his production winds down from being a perennial All-Pro early in his career, a player with Mack's ability to affect the passer -- even on a rotational basis -- would still be coveted on the open market.

Now that the Bills have advanced out of the wildcard round with their 27-24 victory over Jacksonville, that hope for a return is ramped up because Sean McDermott said Monday that Oliver’s 21-day practice window would be opened this week as the Bills prepare to meet the Denver Broncos in an AFC divisional game Saturday.

Of course, opening Oliver’s window to practice is not a guarantee that he’ll be ready to go for the game, but at the very least, he can start getting back into the flow and if he isn’t quite ready for Denver, should the Bills advance to the AFC Championship Game, maybe he’s ready for that game.

Defensive coordinator Bobby Babich wasn’t ready to get too excited about a potential Oliver return, saying on Monday, “We’ll see. I mean, we got to see where he’s at and those type of things. And Ed’s certainly a talented player. He’s had some time off, so we just got to see where he’s at.”

Oliver has been at the facility doing whatever he can to stay in football shape while his injury healed. He has mugged for reporters and cameramen, flashing that infectious smile of his, but he hasn’t really provided an update on his timeline, mainly because he’s not required to speak to reporters while he’s on injured reserve.

“Some of these guys, when they go on IR, they don’t come around as much because they’re more worried, their focus is on their rehab,” Babich said. “But you guys have seen it, he can’t stay away. He’s showing up at individual and all that. Then he’s on the side doing, like just little things and mimicking drills and all those things. Ed loves ball. Ed wants to play football. The way he practices shows you that he loves football. So we’ll see where he’s at.”

Deone Walker, DaQuan Jones stepped up after Ed Oliver injury

Getting Oliver back would be a boost for the Bills, both against the run and obviously as an inside pass rusher. Rookie Deone Walker has done a solid job pairing with veteran DaQuan Jones in the middle of the line, and last week against the Jaguars, Walker played 41 snaps which was the most of any Bills defensive tackle (Jones played 39).

That was the second-highest total of Walker’s season behind only the 56 snaps he played at Atlanta, the night that Jones suffered a calf injury in pregame warmup so the Bills were down to three DTs.

Going into the season, with free agent acquisition Larry Ogunjobi on suspension and DeWayne Carter on injured reserve, the expected four-man rotation was supposed to be Oliver, Jones and the two rookies, Walker and TJ Sanders. That foursome has been on the field together just once, that in the Week 1 victory over Baltimore.

Ed Oliver stats before the injury

Oliver has played in only three games. He was dominant in the victory over the Ravens, but he suffered an ankle injury the following week in practice and missed the next four games. He returned to play against the Falcons and Panthers, but midway through that Week 8 Carolina game he tore his bicep while making a tackle and he’s been on injured reserve ever since.

In the three games he played, Oliver was outstanding as he made 12 tackles including seven for lost yardage, three of those being sacks, plus 11 QB pressures, a forced fumble that helped turn the Baltimore game, and 10 stops, a Pro Football Focus stat that is defined as a tackle that caused a failed play for the offense. He did all that on just 108 total snaps.

Gabe Davis injury update

Elsewhere on the injury report, McDermott delivered the expected bad news on wide receiver Gabe Davis, a torn ACL in the same knee that he had surgically repaired last season when he was with Jacksonville, a crushing blow for the sixth-year pro, especially since he’ll be a free agent in the spring.

With Joshua Palmer on injured reserve as of last week, the Bills are down to four healthy receivers in Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman, Brandin Cooks and Tyrell Shavers, but even Shavers’ situation is murky.

He hurt his knee at Jacksonville, though he was able to return and finish the game, but McDermott said, “We’ll see where it goes from here. Still evaluating his situation.”

Bills roster options at wide receiver

Like Oliver, wide receiver Curtis Samuel, who has been on injured reserve since early November, will also have his practice window opened with the hope that he can be ready for the game to take Davis’ spot.

Another option at wide receiver would be Mecole Hardman, who could be elevated from the practice squad to be the No. 5 receivers and also replace Shakir as the primary punt returner. Of course, if Shavers can’t play, the Bills would need both Samuel and Hardman.

Jordan Poyer injury update

Additional bad news came on the Jordan Poyer front as the safety re-injured his hamstring against the Jaguars and he’s now in a week-to-week situation meaning he’s definitely out against Denver. The Bills have to make a decision on who to play because rookie Jordan Hancock struggled when he took over for Poyer. Cam Lewis would an option, but also, Damar Hamlin could figure into this equation.

Hamlin has been on injured reserve since October, but his practice window was opened last week and McDermott said, “He had a good first week overall coming not off the IR, but opening up his window, and we’ll see where that goes.”

There were also a number of high-profile deaths by suicide among some NFL players after 2010 that were discussed publicly.
From 2011 to 2019, however, we saw an almost threefold increase in suicide among NFL players when compared to these other professional athletes.","For more than a decade, the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University (FPHS) has been conducting research on how a career in football impacts the long-term health and wellbeing of players and their families. The latest FPHS study, published Jan. 12 in the Journal of Neurotrauma, is on suicidality among National Football League (NFL) players, especially in the context of growing awareness of and attention on neurodegenerative disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The study found that NFL players faced increased risk of suicide compared to their basketball and baseball counterparts, likely due to multiple factors including “copycat” effects from high-profile suicides, increased fears around CTE, and high rates of medical conditions whose symptoms can mimic those of CTE.

Below, the study’s lead authors—Rachel Grashow, senior research scientist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of epidemiological research initiatives for the FPHS, and Marc Weisskopf, Cecil K. and Philip Drinker Professor of Environmental Epidemiology and Physiology and director of epidemiological studies for the FPHS—talk about their findings and why they instill senses of both caution and hope.

Q: What did you examine in this study?

Weisskopf: Recent high-profile suicides among NFL players have raised serious concerns about player health, wellbeing, and safety. Our study asks whether professional football players are different from other professional athletes when it comes to suicide. We’ve known for some time that suicide rates among male professional athletes, including NFL players, are lower than that of the general male population—but since these groups differ in many ways, we decided to focus exclusively on elite athletes and compare NFL players to their Major League Baseball (MLB) and National Basketball Association (NBA) counterparts.

Grashow: We were also interested in how suicide rates among NFL players may have changed over time. In recent years, conversations around head injury and neurodegenerative disease have shaped a collective narrative around football and health. We believe 2011 was a pivotal year for that conversation, when the publication of scientific studies on brain injury, neurodegenerative disease, and football accelerated. In particular, CTE—a neuropathological condition that is determined only through autopsy, and that cannot yet be diagnosed or treated in living patients—gained attention in a series of highly publicized research articles. There were also a number of high-profile deaths by suicide among some NFL players after 2010 that were discussed publicly.

This study asked whether NFL suicide was more likely from 2011 onwards, since CTE wasn’t as widely discussed prior to that, and we know from our previous research that there is a link between CTE concerns and suicidality. One of our previous FPHS studies, which used data from our cohort of nearly 5,000 former NFL players, showed that players with CTE concerns were more likely to report frequent thoughts of self-harm or killing themselves.

Q: How did you conduct this study and what did it find?

Weisskopf: We used publicly available playing data on all professional baseball, basketball, and football players going back to 1920 that included their names and dates of birth. That information was submitted to the U.S. National Death Index, who returned a list of deceased players along with their date and cause of death. We flagged the deaths by suicide in this list to determine the suicide rate across all the years studied—1979, when the U.S. started maintaining electronic death records, through 2019—as well as broken into two eras: 1979-2010 and 2011-2019.

Grashow: Similar to other studies of suicide among professional athletes, when we pooled all the data from 1979 to 2019, we saw a comparable rate of death by suicide among NFL, MLB, and NBA players.

When we split the data at 2011, we found that prior to 2011, NFL, MLB, and NBA players also had the same rate of death by suicide. From 2011 to 2019, however, we saw an almost threefold increase in suicide among NFL players when compared to these other professional athletes.

Q: What might account for this increase?

Weisskopf: We can’t say for sure from this study, but there are many possible contributing factors. While we did not find any rule-, policy-, or equipment-based changes that could account for the increase, these and other biological or exposure-based causes can’t be ruled out. It’s also possible that deaths among NFL players that would not have been classified as suicides by medical examiners prior to 2011 may have been labeled a suicide after 2010, as a result of greater awareness of issues related to head trauma. Additionally, high profile suicides have been known to cause a “copycat” or contagion effect called the Werther effect. More research is needed to determine the individual contributions of each of these factors.

Grashow: Previous research may lend additional relevant context. Similar to prior FPHS findings linking CTE concerns with thoughts of self-harm or suicide, studies have shown that individuals who have been diagnosed or believe themselves to be at risk for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, or Parkinson’s disease are at greater risk of suicide. Descriptions of these conditions as neurodegenerative diseases without cure—and, in the case of CTE, treatment—may be contributing to increased suicide rates, although, again, we cannot say for certain based on this study.

On a hopeful note, however, while some former players may indeed have the underlying brain changes associated with CTE, there are also other conditions commonly found in former NFL players that may result in symptoms frequently attributed to CTE, but that are treatable. A previous FPHS study showed that members of our cohort disproportionately report living with conditions that can cause cognitive symptoms—issues with memory, concentration, and impulsivity, for example—including sleep apnea, high blood pressure, low testosterone, chronic pain, depression, and opiate use. Players with these conditions and symptoms were more likely to think they had CTE. While these players may have the underlying brain pathology that characterizes CTE, some may not. We believe encouraging players to be proactive about their treatable conditions is worth emphasizing.

Q: What are the study’s key takeaways—for players, their families, and the institutions responsible for their health and safety?

Grashow: We hope our findings motivate collective action among players, families, the NFL, and other organizations who support current and former players to address what may be preventable deaths. First and foremost, the sudden onset of increased suicide risk among NFL players should motivate increased screening, surveillance, and programming for former players related to depression, thoughts of self-harm, and suicide. Further, it may be beneficial for players, families, PCPs and sports medicine physicians, and other organizations that support former players to increase screening for conditions that may mimic symptoms attributed to CTE. Treatments are available for many of these conditions, with the potential to improve quality and length of life and, in so doing, reduce feelings of despair. These investments are important and warranted regardless of whether or not the increased attention and concern about head injury and brain effects are among the contributors to the higher NFL suicide rate.

Weisskopf: There’s still a lot we don’t know about CTE, and specifically how it may relate to enhanced suicide risk. Research to identify treatments and diagnostics should be prioritized.

George Kittle tore his Achilles during a play in the first half of Sunday's game. The latest injury now makes it three of the Niners' best players who have been lost for the season -- the others are All Pro linebacker Fred Warner and star defensive lineman Nick Bosa.

There have been many other players during the season who have missed games because of injuries. Many consider, even for the National Football League, the amount of injuries dealt to the 49ers this season is a lot.

""Injuries will occur. Every team has injuries. But it's true the 49eres have had more than most,"" said Matt Maiocco, a 49ers insider for NBC Sports Bay Area.

The 49ers' injury list has also included quarterback Brock Purdy, who missed eight games with turf toe before returning a few weeks ago.

""It's a violent sport. And it's a difficult sport,"" Maiocco said. ""I don't think bodies were made to play football.""

Maiocco said players have evolved over the last few years, making the game even more intense.

""The size of these players -- the collisions are more intense than they ever have been,"" Maiocco said. ""And every year it seems the players get bigger, faster, stronger. And bones, ligaments and tendons kind of remain the same.""

When asked about all the injuries, Niners receiver Kendrick Bourne after Sunday's game jokingly referenced electro-magnetic waves created by a power station next to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara -- a conspiracy theory that has gained buzz online.

It is worth noting experts have dismissed the ""power plant theory"" as a social media myth.

Entering that game, however, there is some uncertainty about one of the Patriots’ most important players.

With that said, let’s take a look at the injury situation after rewatching the wild card win over Los Angeles.

Patriots injury analysis: Wild card round

CB Carlton Davis III: When the Patriots came out of the two-minute warning in the second quarter, Davis was not in his usual position at outside cornerback. Instead, he was in the blue medical tent and shortly thereafter departed for the locker room. Announced as questionable to return with a toe injury, he ended up missing five defensive snaps before returning to start the second half. Davis did not show any obvious signs of discomfort before his exit, so it is unclear when exactly he injured his toe.

CB Christian Gonzalez: Breaking up a Justin Herbert pass attempt intended for Quentin Johnston, Gonzalez collided with the wide receiver on his way to the ground and was slow to get up afterwards. He did remain in the game for the next snap — another incompletion to set up a punt — but headed into the medical tent afterwards. From there, the Pro Bowl defender left the field for the locker room and was later announced as questionable to return with a head injury. He never came back out and shortly before the game ended was officially downgraded to out.

What this means for the Patriots

While Carlton Davis managed to return to the game and finish without any visible limitations, Christian Gonzalez is a massive question mark. As head coach Mike Vrabel noted on Monday, the Pro Bowler is in the league’s concussion protocol, and there is no timeline yet for his return.

Arguably New England’s best player on this side of the ball, Gonzalez missing any time in the lead-up to Sunday’s game, let alone the contest itself, would be a blow to the team’s defense. While Houston’s offense is not in the upper echelon in terms of productivity and scoring potential, it features some high-end receiving talent led by wide receivers Nico Collins and Christian Kirk.

Having Gonzalez available against that pair and the rest of Houston’s defense would be a massive plus. For now, however, uncertainty reigns.

Wednesday will mark the first key date in that regard, and when it comes to finding out which other Patriots are nursing injuries or illness after the wild card round. The team will hold its first practice of the week that afternoon, with the initial injury report set to come out later in the day.

George Kittle has built a reputation as one of the most effective tight ends in the NFL, regardless of his role — whether as a pass-catcher or blocker, the San Francisco 49ers star has cemented himself as one of the best players at his position.

Part of Kittle's stardom has always been connected to his toughness, playing a position that typically isn't very forgiving. Tight ends do plenty of dirty work for an offense, and that means Kittle has had his share of injuries in the past.

Potentially the worst ailment of Kittle's career came in the 2026 playoffs, however, as he exited the 49ers' Wild Card game against the Philadelphia Eagles with an Achilles injury feared to be a tear.

Here's a breakdown of George Kittle's injury history.

George Kittle injury history

Foot sprain, October 2016, Iowa

When he was in college, Kittle injured his foot in October 2016 during his senior season as a member of the Iowa Hawkeyes.

Advertisement

The injury to Kittle's right foot caused him to be limited the rest of the season, including two missed games.

Hamstring injury, August 2017, 49ers

Kittle's first reported injury issue in the NFL came just before his rookie season began. In training camp before the 2017 season, he missed around a week with a hamstring injury.

The tight end, however, was ready by Week 1 and made his debut, totaling 27 yards against the Panthers.

Ankle sprain, November 2017, 49ers

Later in Kittle's rookie season, he missed one game for the 49ers due to a sprained ankle.

Kittle returned the following week and played out the remainder of his first NFL season.

Shoulder A/C Joint Separation, August 2018, 49ers

Prior to the 2018 season, Kittle dealt with another training camp ailment. He separated his right shoulder in San Francisco's preseason opener.

However, there was no structural damage for Kittle, and he was ready by Week 1 of the 2018 season.

Knee sprain, October 2019, 49ers

Kittle's first multi-game absence in the NFL came in October 2019, when he injured his knee against the Arizona Cardinals. On the first play of the game, he injured his knee and missed the next few plays before returning, catching six passes for 79 yards and a touchdown a victory.

However, the tight end then wound up missing two games with a knee sprain.

Hamstring strain, August 2020, 49ers

One of Kittle's lighter injury issues was a hamstring strain prior to the 2020 season, but the star tight end played through his tight hamstring.

MCL sprain, September 2020, 49ers

Early in the 2020 season, Kittle injured his knee. He sustained a sprained left MCL in Week 1, causing him to miss the following two 49ers matchups.

He made a return from the injury in a big way, posting 15 receptions for 183 yards and a touchdown on ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Eagles.

Advertisement

Foot fracture, November 2020, 49ers

While Kittle made a return from his sprained MCL in 2020, soon after, he suffered a longer-term injury. In the 49ers' Week 8 loss, the tight end fractured a bone in his foot.

Kittle was placed on IR for the first time in his career, and he missed around two months before a return to action in late December, being activated on Christmas Day.

Calf strain, September 2021, 49ers

Following the 49ers' Week 3 loss to the Packers in 2021, Kittle began dealing with a calf injury. Initially, he played through it, but the ailment proved too extensive to ignore.

Kittle was placed on IR, missing about a month for San Francisco before a return to the field in November. He posted six catches for 101 yards and a touchdown in his return.

Groin strain, September 2022, 49ers

Early in the 2022 season, Kittle missed two games with a groin strain.

It wouldn't be the last time a groin issue would hold him back, however, as a nagging groin injury followed him in 2023.

Groin injury, 2023 season, 49ers

Between a training camp groin pull that resulted in a week of missed practices, plus another groin injury sustained in November of the 2023 season, Kittle dealt with issues throughout his age-30 season.

Kittle played through the groin issues, but then underwent surgery after the 2023 season.

Hamstring sprain, September 2024, 49ers

A chain of hamstring issues began for Kittle in the 2024 season. He missed the 49ers' Week 3 game with a hamstring injury.

It was just a one-game absence for the tight end, but the injury re-appeared later in 2024.

Hamstring sprain, November 2024, 49ers

Kittle once again sat out in Week 11 of the 2024 season due to a hamstring sprain, another one-game absence.

Hamstring tear, September 2025, 49ers

Around a year after he had shorter-term absences due to his hamstring, Kittle faced a longer-term recovery early in the 2025 season due to a Grade 3 torn hamstring.

Advertisement

After the Week 1 injury, Kittle missed five games, one of many injuries for the 49ers throughout the 2025 campaign. He was activated on Oct. 15, 2025.

Ankle sprain, December 2025, 49ers

The second injury of Kittle's 2025 season came in Week 16 against the Colts. He sustained a left ankle sprain in that matchup, in which he totaled seven receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown.

Kittle missed the 49ers' following game before returning to the field.

Achilles injury, January 2026, 49ers

While Kittle has had years of nagging injuries, he's typically been able to either play through them, or return to the field after a short-term absence. When he went down against the Eagles in the first round of the 2026 NFL Playoffs, however, it was feared Kittle had a longer recovery than usual ahead of him.

Kittle was carted off the field in the Wild Card Weekend matchup, and the 49ers quickly called it an Achilles injury for their veteran tight end. With the possibility that he tore his Achilles, he was set to be out for the remainder of the playoffs and potentially part of the 2026 regular season.

“I don’t know how long it will take, but when you’re not allowed to return to the game because of the concussion protocol, you have to wait. We’ll see how things develop throughout the week.”

González, a 23-year-old cornerback, exited in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Wild Card game, in which the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 16–3.

The injury occurred on a play in which González broke up a pass intended for Quentin Johnston and then hit his head as the Chargers receiver fell on top of him.

The cornerback, who earned his first Pro Bowl selection this season, was a key piece of New England’s secondary in holding Los Angeles scoreless for six quarters of play.

Before heading to the locker room, González had recorded 27 coverage snaps, two passes defended, and allowed no receptions or yards to opposing receivers, making him the Patriots’ top defensive performer up to that point.

A standout at Oregon in college football, González entered the NFL as a first-round pick in the 2023 Draft and earned a starting role during his rookie season.

In his first year, when he was considered a candidate for Defensive Rookie of the Year, a shoulder injury sidelined him after four games.

Fully healthy in 2024, he reaffirmed his talent with 59 tackles, 11 passes defended, two interceptions, and one fumble recovery. His performance stood out on a Patriots team that failed to reach the playoffs.

How the NFL concussion protocol works

Concussions are one of the biggest concerns for the NFL and the sport in general. The league recognizes this, implementing several measures over the years in order to increase player safety and limit the prevalence of head injuries. There is still plenty of work to be done, but the introduction of strict guidelines such as the concussion protocol has created a more sensible environment compared to 10 or 20 years ago.

The protocol itself kicks into action when a player is either displaying or self-reporting signs of head injury. Once that happens, the team’s medical staff as well as the league’s unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants — three are assigned to each game — take further steps.

In Gonzalez’s case, this process did not start immediately. He remained in the game for one more snap, an incomplete pass that prompted the Chargers to punt. During the ensuing break for the defense, he retreated to the blue medical tent and afterwards left for the locker room for further evaluation. It was at that point, that the “questionable” label was applied.

Shortly before the game concluded, Gonzalez was then downgraded to out. That designation happened in accordance with the medical experts.

As part of their evaluation, after all, they run through a series of tests including checks of the eyes, speech, spine and cognitive abilities. In addition, the play itself will also be reviewed to determine whether or not the player in question will be cleared to return to the game or not. Gonzalez was not.

He is therefore now entering the next phase of the protocol.

What this means for the Patriots and Christian Gonzalez

After being placed in the concussion protocol on Sunday, Gonzalez will have to be cleared by medical professionals before returning to practice or game action. Both the Patriots’ own staff, led by Dr. Scott Martin, as well as an independent neurological consultant will need to green-light a comeback.

A follow-up step was taken on Monday with the goal of finding out whether the symptoms displayed after exiting the game have worsened. The results of those tests as well as a player’s personal history — Gonzalez also suffered a concussion the last time the Patriots played the Chargers, in December 2024 — will be factored into the next steps and the resulting timeline to be cleared.

The NFL’s return-to-participation protocol outlines five of them that Gonzalez will have to go through.

Phase 1: Symptom-limited activity. Gonzalez will be prescribed rest as well as limiting and/or avoiding physical and cognitive activities which increase the risk of aggravating symptoms. Limited stretching and balance training can be introduced under supervision of the athletic training staff, progressing to light aerobic exercise. Gonzalez can attend meetings and film study, if permitted by the medical staff.

Phase 2: Aerobic exercise. In this phase, Gonzalez can graduate to doing cardiovascular exercise under supervision of the Patriots’ medical staff. This includes riding on a stationary bike or a treadmill, as well as some stretching and balance training.

Phase 3: Football-specific exercise. This phase includes cardiovascular exercises and sport-specific activities. Gonzalez may also do some strength training, all under supervision.

Phase 4: Non-contact training drills. Building on Phases 2 and 3, Gonzalez will be allowed to continue cardiovascular, strength and balance training while also introducing specific exercise and non-contact football activities.

Phase 5: Full football activity/clearance. At this point, Gonzalez will be fully cleared to resume all football activities including full contact. If both the team’s physician and the independent neurological consultant are in agreement, he will be allowed to participate in the next game or practice.

Despite that clear structure, there is no set timeline when it comes to a player returning from a concussion. As a result, every option from returning to practice as early as Wednesday to missing Sunday’s divisional round game against the Houston Texans, and possibly even more time, is on the table.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/09/gettyimages-2233655751.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C2.1428670818589%2C100%2C78.525154502636&w=1200,N,,2026-01-13 12:02:18.497275

The 23-year-old cornerback was making his postseason debut and had already contributed two pass breakups before the injury, which occurred midway through the fourth quarter while he was defending a pass intended for Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston. Gonzalez jumped the route and nearly came away with an interception, but as both players went to the ground, Johnston landed on Gonzalez’s helmet, with the back of Gonzalez’s head appearing to strike the turf. He was initially listed as questionable to return before being downgraded to out following further evaluation in the locker room. After the game, Gonzalez briefly interacted with reporters but said he was not permitted to speak, adding that he was “fine.”

Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed Monday that Gonzalez was not cleared to re-enter the game, which automatically placed him into the league’s concussion protocol. Speaking to reporters, Vrabel emphasized that the process is routine in such situations: “How long that lasts, I don’t know,” Vrabel said. “But when they don’t let you go back in the game that would put you in the protocol. So wherever that goes, that goes.” Vrabel also praised Gonzalez’s overall impact, saying, “Gonzo continues to play at a high level. We appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. He’s handled that all really well.” Gonzalez will have the week to progress through protocol, though Vrabel said there is no clear timeline.

Gonzalez, a first-round pick (17th overall) in the 2023 NFL Draft, has been one of the Patriot’s most consistent defensive performers this season. In 15 starts, including the playoffs, he recorded 69 tackles and led the team with 12 passes defended, earning his first Pro Bowl selection. However, injuries have been a recurring theme in Gonzalez’s career — he missed most of his rookie season due to a torn labrum, sat out one game last year with a concussion, and missed the first three games of the current season with a hamstring injury sustained during training camp.

The Patriots will face the winner of Monday night’s wild-card matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans, with the divisional-round game set for Sunday at Gillette Stadium.

Kraft meant even more to the Packers' offense, as he caught 32 passes for 489 yards and six touchdowns in the season's first eight games.
It's not hard to see him picking up where he left off in 2026 provided everything continues smoothly with his ACL rehab.
As the proverbial saying goes, the game had slowed down for Kraft in his third year.
Watching those struggles, as well as how the season ended this past weekend in the wild-card round, was tough on the ultra-competitive Kraft.","GREEN BAY – Tucker Kraft wasn't being boastful, only truthful.

Speaking in the locker room Monday for the first time since losing his season to a torn ACL on Nov. 2 vs. Carolina, Kraft explained in straightforward fashion what he missed out on personally due to his injury.

""I was on the cusp of putting together one of the greatest seasons by a Packer tight end,"" he said. ""That was something I was looking forward to, just leaving my legacy on this game and playing as hard as I could every snap for this team, because the end of the day, the guys in this room, they mean so much to me.""

Kraft meant even more to the Packers' offense, as he caught 32 passes for 489 yards and six touchdowns in the season's first eight games. At the time he went down, he led the team in every category.

As for the history he was on pace to make, double his totals to 64 catches for 978 yards and 12 TDs over a full season and all those marks would've broken the franchise records for tight ends set by Jermichael Finley (61 catches in 2012) and Paul Coffman (814 yards, 11 TDs in 1983).

It's not hard to see him picking up where he left off in 2026 provided everything continues smoothly with his ACL rehab. Kraft isn't giving himself a timeline, but the good news is there were no complications with his surgery, despite some minor damage to the meniscus and LCL.

At this early stage he's thinking he'll start training camp on the physically unable to perform list (PUP), just as he did when recovering from a torn pectoral muscle two offseasons ago. He'll look to be ""bulletproof"" by Week 1, which will be 10 months post-surgery.

What's fun to ponder is if his last full game before getting hurt was just a preview of the rest of Kraft's career.

In a big road win at Pittsburgh, which featured receiver Christian Watson's return from his torn ACL, Kraft had his best game as a pro – seven catches, 143 yards, two TDs, and running with abandon every time he got his hands on the ball.

It was his second 100-yard game of the season (also Week 2 vs. Washington, 6-124-1). As the proverbial saying goes, the game had slowed down for Kraft in his third year. He was beating man coverage more regularly, and he was looking even more dangerous after the catch.

His role was growing, for good reason, and he wants to remain as big a part of the offense as he was when his season came to a screeching halt.

""I wasn't feeling that stress or anxiety, mainly just excitement,"" he said of his 2025 season. ""I was hungry for every snap, every opportunity I could get. That's going to be the same thing going forward. I don't know entirely what my future holds in this offense, but … as many snaps as I can get, whether that's 40 or 65. I don't ever want to come out of this game again.

""Moving forward, I do feel like as a tight end, I'm a full package and that I can be anything for this team. Just put the ball in my hands.""

This past season, a surge of explosive production from Watson once he progressed to a full workload helped the offense get back on track after an initial lull following Kraft's injury.

Watching those struggles, as well as how the season ended this past weekend in the wild-card round, was tough on the ultra-competitive Kraft. He had the joy of a newborn daughter at home, but he felt this Packers team ""had all the pieces"" before injuries befell him, Micah Parsons, Devonte Wyatt and others.

Now that the missing-out part is over, he's focused on rejoining the team and being ready when needed.

""When I wasn't able to be out there for the last month and a half, two months this season, it was really hard on me … just knowing that, if I would have been out there and contributing, maybe things would have gone different,"" he said. ""But the end of the day, my injury is my reality, and all I can do is work and come back to be a better Packer than I was before.

""This is something I could have gone without, but it will make me a better person, a better athlete, a better teammate. It just has to.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/xury7xfrnajn9lwnvugy,N,,2026-01-13 14:01:48.618729

Head coach Sean McDermott provided an early look at the team's injury report.

Wide receiver suffers torn ACL

WR Gabe Davis will miss the rest of the postseason with a torn left ACL, McDermott stated. It's the same knee Davis injured last season in Jacksonville that caused him to miss extensive time in 2024 and half of the 2025 season.

Davis played seven total games this year with Buffalo, recording 14 catches for 143 yards and a touchdown.

With WR Joshua Palmer placed on IR prior to the Wild Card game, the Bills have four receivers on the active roster: Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, Keon Coleman and Tyrell Shavers.

Shavers had a knee injury pop up during Sunday's game in Jacksonville but was later cleared to return.

""We'll see where it goes from here, still evaluating his situation,"" McDermott said.

Two players have 21-day window opened

DT Ed Oliver (biceps) and WR Curtis Samuel will have their 21-day practice windows opened this week as the pair make their way back from injured reserve.

Both players are expected to be on the field when the Bills begin their practice week, though their game status is still to be determined.

Oliver has been on IR since Week 9 with a torn bicep. McDermott shared on Dec. 31 that Oliver also had a meniscus cleanup procedure.

Samuel has appeared in six games, catching seven passes for 81 yards and a touchdown; he has been IR since Nov. 28.

One defensive player ruled out at Broncos

S Jordan Poyer has been ruled out for Saturday's game at Denver with a hamstring injury.

""He's week to week,"" McDermott said.

Players that are ""improving""

TE Dalton Kincaid was in walking boot after the Jaguars game, but McDermott shared that it was precautionary.

""He should be fine this week,"" McDermott said of the TE's game status.

LB Terrel Bernard (calf), CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle) and RB Ty Johnson (ankle) are all ""improving"" after missing the Wild Card game.

K Matt Prater is also ""in a good spot"", coming out of the game clean after re-injuring his right quad the week prior against the Jets. Prater went 2 for 2 on field goal attempts and 3 for 3 on extra points.

Claire shared Kittle’s post on her Instagram story and wrote, “My real life super hero.”

Kittle suffered the injury with 5:58 left in the second quarter after making a catch and being tackled near the sideline.

NFL Divisional Round Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Matthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams

Stafford is dealing with a finger sprain on his throwing hand, but he will be good-to-go against the Chicago Bears in the divisional round. That said, factoring in potential grip issues with the expected single-digit weather in Chicago, we may see more struggles than we’re used to.

But first, let’s rewind and look at the biggest questions facing the Patriots after beating the Chargers.
Will Christian Gonzalez play next weekend?
Players dealing with head injuries don’t always follow the same recovery timeline, so there’s risk in speculating what a concussion means for the talented cornerback’s availability in the divisional round.
For the first time in 18 games this season, the Patriots recorded a pressure rate over 50 percent in their win over the Chargers.","FOXBORO, Mass. — Coach Mike Vrabel was given a chance to dunk on the naysayers Monday, those who insist on bringing up the New England Patriots’ weak regular-season schedule and dismiss what they’ve accomplished because of who they’ve played.

His team was one day removed from the franchise’s first playoff win in seven years and was asked what it means that the Patriots beat a Los Angeles Chargers team that went 11-6 this season when considering all the talk about the schedule.

“It means we get to keep playing,” Vrabel said. “That’s what that means. It means we’re not on vacation.”

The Patriots will face the Houston Texans on Sunday in the divisional round. A big test awaits.

But first, let’s rewind and look at the biggest questions facing the Patriots after beating the Chargers.

Will Christian Gonzalez play next weekend?

No question matters more to the Patriots, which makes this answer unsatisfying: Maybe.

Gonzalez suffered a head injury Sunday night and entered the concussion protocol, Vrabel confirmed Monday. Players dealing with head injuries don’t always follow the same recovery timeline, so there’s risk in speculating what a concussion means for the talented cornerback’s availability in the divisional round.

It does, however, mean that Gonzalez is a long shot to practice on Wednesday and should be considered questionable for the game. (For comparison, left guard Jared Wilson suffered a concussion in Week 16 and missed two games while in the protocol, while tight end Austin Hooper suffered a concussion in Week 10 and missed one game as a result.)

For as good as Milton Williams is, Gonzalez is probably the Patriots’ most important player on defense. When the Pats have their No. 1 corner, it allows them to play the man-to-man defense Vrabel prefers.

Without Gonzalez, the Pats would turn to Charles Woods, who has been fine for them in a fill-in role this season. But he still would be a meaningful drop-off from the Pro Bowl-level play of Gonzalez.

“How long that lasts, I don’t know,” Vrabel said of Gonzalez being in the concussion protocol. “So wherever that goes, that goes, but we appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. … Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

Can Rhamondre Stevenson keep it going?

There were a lot of reasons to throw cold water on the New England running game — Stevenson, especially — one month ago.

Through the first 13 weeks of the season, he ranked 51st among running backs in yards after contact (2.82). Since then, though, he ranks first (7.34).

It’s been a dramatic turnaround for Stevenson, who has returned to playing like one of the game’s top running backs over the last month. Since the team’s Week 14 bye, Stevenson ranks second among running backs in expected points added and first in success rate.

If he can keep up his hot play, that would go a long way toward helping the offense bounce back next weekend. Still, despite his 128 all-purpose yards, it’s noteworthy that Stevenson only got 10 carries Sunday night.

“We’ll evaluate that and kind of see where it is,” Vrabel said when asked whether Stevenson should have gotten the ball more. “Again, we were able to stay balanced. Some of those checkdowns, I felt like, were part of the idea. Those guys were going to take some of the (deep) stuff away.”

What should we make of the pass rush?

For the first time in 18 games this season, the Patriots recorded a pressure rate over 50 percent in their win over the Chargers.

They did it by blitzing at a 43 percent clip, their second-highest mark of the season, per Tru Media. Still, the 56 percent pressure rate the Pats recorded Sunday is astounding.

So many people deserve credit for that. Milton Williams was great, everything the Patriots envisioned when they made him the team’s highest-paid player last offseason. Cory Durden was quietly excellent, matching Williams’ seven pressures for the team high. He has been an under-the-radar important player for the Pats. And K’Lavon Chaisson had a pair of sacks.

As the Pats begin prep for next week, expecting similar results is probably wishful thinking. The Chargers had the NFL’s worst offensive line this season. A more realistic target for next week would be a pressure rate of 40, which the Patriots did seven times during the regular season.

Are there concerns about the rookie O-linemen?

While Vrabel admitted there were some tough moments for rookie left tackle Will Campbell and rookie left guard Jared Wilson in pass protection on Sunday, he later came to their defense.

That’s because on one play where they were beaten, they set in a certain way because quarterback Drake Maye was supposed to throw it quickly, but did not get rid of the ball. The pressure got to him.

Wilson allowed two sacks in the game, and Campbell allowed one. But Campbell was excellent in run blocking and finished as the offense’s highest-graded player, according to Pro Football Focus.

“(They) had some good plays, had some plays they’d like to have back,” Vrabel said of the left side of the offensive line. “We just put 65, 70 plays out there. There’s going to be some good ones, there’s going to be some bad ones, and hopefully there’s not too many of them that get you beat.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/12163850/GettyImages-2243464343-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-13 12:02:31.825903

There are more questions about the offensive line this offseason than the Eagles have had to deal with in a long time — Can Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens get healthy?","The Eagles’ offensive line dealt with injuries and ineffectiveness throughout the entire 2025 NFL season. As the team left the locker room after losing to the 49ers in the Wild Card round, Landon Dickerson spoke to reporters about the pain he was playing through all season.

Dickerson didn’t detail all the issues he was dealing with, but said it was “a lot” and ultimately was “shitty” to have to endure.

He underwent knee surgery during training camp, returned in Week 1 only to leave the Cowboys game early with a back injury. Dickerson was then ruled out of the Eagles Week 5 game with an ankle injury, and in Week 14, suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him for portion of the game — he was able to return, but ultimately was just the latest in his long list of ailments.

The 27-year-old guard kept suiting up each week because he didn’t want to let his teammates down. Dickerson also revealed that he’s not sure if he’ll require offseason surgery, and in one of the more depressing quotes to come out of the post-game, admitted he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to return to full health.

E.J. Smith of PHLY Sports reported that when asked if he’ll make a full recovery, Dickerson said, “If I had that answer, I’d feel a lot better.”

Given his injury history coming out of college, and the long seasons he’s endured in Philly, being able to keep him healthy is going to be a factor moving forward.

There are more questions about the offensive line this offseason than the Eagles have had to deal with in a long time — Can Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens get healthy? Is Lane Johnson coming back, and can he get healthy? Is Tyler Steen still the guy at right guard? Can the group return to the top of the league?

Dickerson, for his part, didn’t offer much hope for what the future holds and walked out of the locker room on Sunday night with a big bag of ice on his leg.",https://platform.bleedinggreennation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2026/01/gettyimages-2255118140.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.736140551992%2C100%2C78.527718896016&w=1200,N,,2026-01-13 12:02:36.231737

Collins, a former third-round pick from Michigan, has been C.J. Stroud's go-to target over the years. The Michigan product has racked up 289 receptions for 4,347 yards with 24 touchdowns over the past five seasons.

During the second half of the Texans-Steelers game, Collins tried catching a pass from Stroud over the middle of the field. The plat resulted in his head crashing straight down into the turf at Acrisure Stadium.

Unsurprisingly, Collins was evaluated for a concussion. ESPN's camera crew eventually showed him leaving the field on a medical cart. As you'd imagine, that left fans awfully concerned about his health.

""Nico Collins is not okay. He took a huge hit and is definitely concussed,"" a fan wrote on social media. ""He apparently couldn’t get to the right locker room. Pray.""

Witherspoon had one interception and eight tackles for the Rams this season.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Quarterback Matthew Stafford is expected to play for the Los Angeles Rams this weekend after tests revealed only a mild sprain of the index finger on his throwing hand.

Stafford injured his finger in the first half of the Rams’ 34-31 victory over the Panthers last Saturday when he banged his hand into the arm of a Carolina defender while throwing a pass.

The MVP candidate was able to play through the injury in the wild-card round, leading the Rams’ dramatic comeback for the Super Bowl champion’s sixth career playoff victory.

Coach Sean McVay said Monday that Stafford will be available when Los Angeles (13-5) faces Chicago in the divisional round on Sunday.

“He’s as tough as it gets, but he’s feeling good,” McVay said. “He was able to push through it, and he’ll be good to go.”

McVay also said cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon will miss the rest of the Rams’ season after reinjuring his shoulder blade. The nine-year veteran will be placed on injured reserve.

The Rams got more encouraging news about Kevin Dotson, with McVay saying the right guard has “a good chance” to return this weekend from his sprained ankle.

Dotson, a key part of the Rams’ rushing attack, sprained his ankle last month when it was stepped on by Seattle linebacker Derick Hall, who received a one-game suspension for his actions.

Witherspoon began the season as a starter for the Rams, but he has played only seven games in a secondary that has been repeatedly exposed as the defense’s weakest link, with or without his presence.

Witherspoon broke his shoulder blade in Week 2 at Tennessee, although the injury initially was reported by the Rams as a broken collarbone. He missed 2 1/2 months before returning for the final four regular-season games as a reserve.

He played just 12 snaps at Carolina before getting hurt again, and McVay confirmed that Witherspoon’s ninth NFL season is over. Witherspoon had one interception and eight tackles for the Rams this season.

Cobie Durant moved into Witherspoon’s starting spot after Week 2, and he kept the spot after Witherspoon’s return. Durant had an early interception in the Rams’ win at Carolina.

For the second straight year, wide receiver Gabe Davis suffered a major left knee injury, this time a torn ACL, coach Sean McDermott said Monday.

Davis returned to the Bills this season after he played 10 games with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2024 before suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee. He was able to return to the field with Buffalo in Week 11, playing in six regular-season games and Sunday's wild-card win at Jacksonville.

Buffalo also will be without starting safety Jordan Poyer on Saturday after a hamstring injury kept him out of the second half against the Jaguars. Rookie Jordan Hancock played in his place, but the Bills have rotated players at the spot because of injuries.

Elsewhere, McDermott said the Bills will open the practice windows of defensive tackle Ed Oliver and wide receiver Curtis Samuel.

Oliver has been on injured reserve since Oct. 28 and had surgery for a torn left biceps. He also dealt with an ankle injury early in the season. In three games, he had three sacks and a forced fumble.

""Ed's certainly a talented player,"" defensive coordinator Bobby Babich said. ""He's had some time off, so we just got to see where he's at.""

Samuel's potential return comes as the Bills navigate losses at receiver, including Davis and Joshua Palmer (ankle), who was put on season-ending injured reserve Saturday.

When asked if he felt good with the group they have or if the Bills would be looking outside at receiver, McDermott said, ""Yeah, I feel good with the group we have.""

When it comes to the health of their franchise quarterback, Josh Allen did not miss a snap but took a bit of a beating during the win in Jacksonville. He made two visits to the medical tent, including being cleared for a possible concussion, after coming into the game with a right foot injury.

Collins had three receptions on seven targets for 21 yards against the Steelers. He led the Texans in the regular season in receiving yards with 1,117 and was tied for the lead in receiving touchdowns with six.

The Texans also lost wide receiver Justin Watson to a concussion in the second half. Safety Jaylen Reed, who was activated from injured reserve early Monday after a forearm injury, left briefly in the first quarter because of a knee injury.

Full game recap:

Patriots coach Mike Vrabel talked to his team about being prepared to bleed as New England entered its first playoff game since the 2021 season.

Then, shortly after Milton Williams sacked the Chargers' Justin Herbert on Sunday night to secure the Patriots' first playoff victory in seven years, Williams celebrated with a head-butt of Vrabel.

It knocked the first-year coach backward and bloodied his lip.

“The big dogs come out in January. I think Milt took that to heart,” Vrabel said. “He came over and got me pretty good. But that’s what happens.”

>> Who will Patriots play next? New England awaits winner of Monday Night Football game on WMUR-TV

Drake Maye threw a touchdown pass to Hunter Henry in the fourth quarter, and New England's defense roughed up Herbert as the Patriots beat Los Angeles 16-3 in an AFC wild-card playoff game.

Andy Borregales kicked three field goals for the Patriots (15-3), who hadn't won in the postseason since their Super Bowl victory to cap the 2018 season. They’ll host the winner of Monday night’s game between Pittsburgh and Houston in the divisional round.

In his playoff debut, Maye completed 17 of 29 passes for 268 yards and ran for a team-high 66 yards.

“We made plays when we had to do it,” Maye said.

He also threw an interception and lost a fumble, but the Chargers (11-7) couldn't capitalize on those turnovers.

New England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Herbert six times, with one of those resulting in a lost fumble that set up the Patriots' TD.

“It's on us, what we do. I've been saying that all season,” Williams said. “We can control the game. If we do what we need to do up front, we're going to win.”

This is the second straight season in which the Chargers have lost in the wild-card round. Herbert finished 19 of 31 for 159 yards and was his team's leading rusher with 57 yards as he fell to 0-3 in the playoffs.

Herbert was just over a month removed from surgery to repair a broken bone in his nonthrowing hand.

“There was no issue,” Herbert said. “I just have to do a better job holding on to the ball.”

Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said his quarterback wasn't 100 percent.

“He’s a warrior. He just gives it everything he has, all the time,” Harbaugh said, acknowledging that Herbert was limited by his hand injury. “It’s an issue, but he doesn’t flinch, like a warrior would.”

The last time the Chargers failed to score a TD in the playoffs was their 21-12 AFC championship game loss to the Patriots during the 2007 season.

The Patriots drove into the red zone on their first possession of the third quarter, but the drive ended when Maye was strip-sacked by Odafe Oweh and De'Shawn Hand recovered for the Chargers.

After Los Angeles punted, Maye connected on a pass to Kayshon Boutte that went for 42 yards to set the Patriots up on the Chargers 27. But New England settled for a 39-yard field goal that stretched their lead to 9-3.

Early in the fourth quarter, Maye used a 16-yard pass to Boutte and a 13-yard burst by Rhamondre Stevenson to set up his precise 28-yard TD toss to Henry that put the Patriots in front 16-3.

The Chargers picked up back-to-back first downs to open their ensuing drive. But when Herbert dropped back to pass on the next play, linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson strip-sacked him and fell on loose ball.

Los Angeles had one final possession, but it ended with Herbert getting sacked by Williams on fourth down.

“It’s playoff football. It’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get nasty. But you’ve got to keep going,” Williams said.

The opening quarter had lots of action, but it took until early in the second quarter for the Patriots to end a scoreless stalemate.

With New England pinned inside its own 10 after a Chargers punt, Maye had a pass intended for Austin Hooper tipped by Teair Tart and intercepted by Daiyan Henley.

Los Angeles started with the ball on the Patriots 10 but was stopped on fourth-and-2 when Herbert misfired a pass to Keenan Allen.

The Patriots took over and got some breathing room via a 48-yard catch-and-run by Stevenson.

Thirteen plays and a fourth-down conversion later, the drive ended with Borregales' 23-yard field goal.

Daily best bets & picks

George Kittle, TE, San Francisco 49ers

It seems like the 49ers can’t go a single week without a key player being lost to injury this year. Not only will they not have George Kittle for the remainder of the playoffs, but they will almost surely lose him for the upcoming season as well. Kittle tore his Achilles shortly before halftime in Philadelphia and was ruled out shortly after that. San Francisco has to travel to Seattle to face its divisional rival this week, but the offense will be missing yet another weapon. Receiver Ricky Pearsall also missed the game against Philly. San Francisco had Kittle, Pearsall, and Jauan Jennings to start the year with hope that Brandon Aiyuk would come back around the middle of the season. Jennings could be the only one of that quartet available to take on the Seahawks this week. Without Kittle, Jake Tonges will be asked to step up once again.

Josh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills

Tyrell Shavers, WR, Buffalo Bills

Gabe Davis, WR, Buffalo Bills

The Bills won in Jacksonville Sunday, but it didn’t come without a cost. Josh Allen came into the game with an existing foot injury, then he was checked for a concussion and dealt with a knee issue during the game. The knee injury looked especially scary since his knee locked up and was bent during a tackle attempt at the goalline. There doesn’t seem to be much concern about Allen missing the game against the Broncos, but he is clearly not 100% right now.

Also of concern is the depth in the receiver room. Gabe Davis is likely done for the playoffs with a knee injury, but the swelling hasn’t gone down enough yet to give a proper diagnosis. Tyrell Shavers was also dealing with a leg injury during the game on Sunday. Buffalo could head into Denver with Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Keon Coleman as their main options. That’s not the best matchup against a talented Denver defense.

Matthew Stafford, QB, Los Angeles Rams

The Rams were in a fight against the Panthers and pulled out a victory on the road on Saturday. However, Matthew Stafford had an X-ray on his throwing hand. While he is “good to go” according to coach Sean McVay, Stafford did suffer a sprained index finger. It will be interesting to see how the week unfolds and if there are any lingering issues with that finger for Stafford as the Rams prepare for Chicago this week.

As we wrap up one of the most exciting first rounds in recent memory, the Steelers once again find themselves hosting a pivotal game. After narrowly surviving DK Metcalf’s suspension, Pittsburgh now looks to keep the AFC’s best defense from forcing Aaron Rodgers into retirement. C.J. Stroud, who has now made the playoffs in each of his first three seasons, will try to direct his team to another first-round victory instead of succumbing to the Steel City voodoo.

Below, I’ll break down where we can find some scoring opportunities in this low-total game, along with everything else you need to know for this NFL DFS showdown slate.

Wild Card Weekend MNF Showdown: Texans @ Steelers

Total: 38.5; Spread: HOU -3

Weather: Cold, but nothing else of note

Injury News/Notes

Houston: Jawhar Jordan out; Trent Brown returning; Jaylen Reed questionable to return from IR (he may play a meaningful amount of safety snaps)

Pittsburgh: Metcalf returning

Game Breakdown

Note: Lack of a mention does not imply a bad matchup. If a star player has a neutral matchup, I won’t bore you with two paragraphs about how they could do a bit above or below average. This is intended to point out spots that are particularly high-upside, volatile or concerning.

At the very least, he will fall right in line with the nine-month recovery timeline that was initially reported after he suffered the injury.
But realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4, just to make sure and just getting back into football.""
The Packers are also in line to get tight end Tucker Kraft (torn ACL) and defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt (fibula, ankle) back from season-ending injuries.
Kraft implied he's in line for a Week 1 return, while Wyatt said he'll be ready for training camp.","The Green Bay Packers lost star pass rusher Micah Parsons to a torn ACL almost one month ago, and according to the prized preseason trade acquisition, the recovery process is off to an excellent start. Parsons said that the feedback he received over the first few weeks since his surgery is that he is ""flying"" through rehab, and he already has his eyes on a return to the field in the first quarter of the 2026 season.

While it may be a stretch for Parsons to return to the Packers' lineup in Week 1, early indications suggest that he may make his 2026 debut slightly ahead of schedule. At the very least, he will fall right in line with the nine-month recovery timeline that was initially reported after he suffered the injury.

""In September I want to be at a really good spot,"" Parsons said. ""So far, they say I'm fine. So whatever that means. There's a timing standpoint they want. I don't think I'll be on IR to start the season. I think, lofty, I'd be saying Week 1. But realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4, just to make sure and just getting back into football.""

Avoiding an injured reserve stint at the beginning of the campaign would be a win for Parsons, who missed the final three weeks of the 2025 regular season in addition to the Packers' Wild Card round loss to the Chicago Bears. When all is said and done, he could miss fewer than eight total games with the serious knee injury.

The Packers are also in line to get tight end Tucker Kraft (torn ACL) and defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt (fibula, ankle) back from season-ending injuries. Kraft implied he's in line for a Week 1 return, while Wyatt said he'll be ready for training camp.

CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo said last month that one of the biggest hurdles Parsons will face in his recovery is the strengthening required to prepare his body for the demands of high-level pass rushing. Parsons' position, and the high motor with which he plays, could set the stage for a longer than usual rehab period. The former first-round pick acknowledged that reality himself.

""Practicing hard and getting ready to sustain taking my body through what I go through -- I think it's just more of that,"" Parsons said. ""I play so free and go. I gotta learn how to simulate that in practice before they send me out there on the field.""

The long-term outlook for players who suffer torn ACLs is much brighter now than it once was, and Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley set a high bar for Parsons once he returns. Hafley said he foresees Parsons coming back ""even better"" and breaking the sack record in 2026.

C Josh Myers played 100 percent of offensive snaps (1,048), while rookie RT Armand Membou and Joe Tippmann -- who moved to right guard ahead of Week 1 -- played all but 1 snap.

Beck played just 110 offensive snaps this season, but the seventh-year veteran matched his career-high in receiving TDs (2).","In the first season under GM Darren Mougey and HC Aaron Glenn, the Jets (3-14) fell short of their goals. The team struggled to play complementary football, and several position groups were battered by injuries.

Mougey and Glenn, however, addressed several roster needs throughout the season, and newcomers stepped up late. Ahead of Week 18, the roster included 16 players that were not with the team prior to Aug. 19, and 11 of those players were acquired after Week 1. There were also 10 players on the active roster who were originally signed to the practice squad.

Here's a look at the snap count and how playing time was distributed during the 2025 season.

O-Line Consistency

For the first time since 2012, the Jets started the same 5 offensive linemen in every game this season. C Josh Myers played 100 percent of offensive snaps (1,048), while rookie RT Armand Membou and Joe Tippmann -- who moved to right guard ahead of Week 1 -- played all but 1 snap. Olu Fashanu played 1,040 snaps (99.24%) while John Simpson played 1,016 (96.95%).

This consistency allowed the Jets to find some success up front as the team the No. 10 ranked rushing offense (123.3 yards per game) in the league.

RB Breece Hall, who played 640 (61.07%) offensive snaps, had the most productive season of his career. Hall rushed for 1,065 yards, marking the first time in his NFL career that the fourth-year player eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark. He led the team with 6 total TDs (4 rushing, 1 receiving and 1 passing), and he finished the season with 1,415 scrimmage yards, the second-highest mark of his career.

Offensive Playmakers

Outside of the O-line, the Jets struggled to find offensive consistency this season. Three quarterbacks -- Justin Fields (501/47.81%), Tyrod Taylor (251/23.95%) and Brady Cook (296/28.24%) -- started for the Green & White. Several key contributors -- including star WR Garrett Wilson (383/36.55%) and second-year RB Braelon Allen (58/5.53%) -- sustained injuries that cost them significant playing time.

Rookie TE Mason Taylor, who finished the season on injured reserve due to a neck injury, led the offense with 654 snaps (62.4%) despite missing the final four games of the season. Taylor appeared in 13 games (11 starts) and totaled a team-leading 44 receptions. The LSU product, who was a second-round pick of the Jets last April, recorded 369 receiving yards and 1 TD during his rookie campaign.

RB Breece Hall's 640 snaps were the second most of skill position players, while Fields and TE Jeremy Ruckert (494/47.14%) followed. WR John Metchie III, who was acquired during an in-season trade with the Philadelphia Eagles, did not appear in a game until Week 10, but became a significant contributor for the Green & White. He recorded 33 receptions for 274 yards and 2 TDs and played the most snaps of any Jets' receiver -- 414 (39.50%) across 9 games (7 starts).

Evolving Defense

It was a challenging year for the Jets' defense, which began working with interim defensive coordinator Chris Harris after Steve Wilks was relieved of his duties in mid-December.

The unit finished the year ranked 25th in total yards allowed per game (355.6) and 31st in points allowed per game (29.6). The Jets especially struggled to defend the run, allowing 139.5 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league.

LB Jamien Sherwood, who played the second-most defensive snaps in 2024, topped the defense in 2025. Sherwood played all but 18 snaps (1,111/98.41%) and led the team with 154 total tackles, tied for the seventh-most in the league. Sherwood added 2 sacks, 8 TFL and 8 pass defenses in 2025.

The Jets' secondary underwent significant changes throughout the season. S Andre Cisco (499/44.20%) sustained a season-ending injury against Cincinnati in Week 8, and CB Sauce Gardner was traded to the Colts a few days later. Rookie CB Azareye'h Thomas (311/27.55%) stepped up, but a concussion kept him sidelined for Week 11 before a shoulder injury in December landed him on injured reserve.

It was CB Brandon Stephens who was a steady presence in the defensive backfield, playing 1,048 snaps (92.83%), while rookie S Malachi Moore played 950 (84.15%), the third-most among defensive players. Moore, a fourth-round draft selection of the Jets in 2025, started 14 games and recorded 101 total tackles, 3 TFL, 1 FF, 1 FR and 3 pass defenses.

LB Quincy Williams (784/69.44%) appeared in 13 games (12 starts) and recorded 83 total tackles, 8 TFL and a career-high 3.5 sacks.

Special Teams

Special teams were a consistent bright spot for the Green & White in 2025. The unit finished the season leading the league in average kickoff return yards (29.9) and field-goal percentage (96.6%).

On a standout unit that produced several highlight-worthy moments, FB Andrew Beck led the team with 319 snaps (67.87%) played. Beck played just 110 offensive snaps this season, but the seventh-year veteran matched his career-high in receiving TDs (2).

Sixth-year player LB Mykal Walker, who logged the second-most special teams snaps for the Green & White (306/65.11%), led the unit with 10 ST tackles. S Isaiah Oliver (300/63.83%) and CB Qwan'tez Stiggers (288/61.28%) were also consistent contributors.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/qx5zgngbghwae0cuqbn9,N,,2026-01-13 01:15:10.921193

It started in training camp when he tore the meniscus in his right knee and underwent surgery Aug. 2.
“It’s a pretty bad injury,” Hadden said.
He said he thought he had suffered a serious knee injury because he was in an enormous amount of pain.","GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers finished the season with 18 players on reserve injured lists.

Some say they would have been Super Bowl contenders if a few of them – Micah Parsons, Tucker Kraft, Devonte Wyatt and Elgton Jenkins, to name a few – would not have suffered season-ending injuries.

Kraft is one of them.

“If I’m betting on myself I’m going all in,” Kraft said. “One of the best players in the NFL on defense, Micah Parsons, like, yes, I do think that things would be completely different had we not lost him in the Broncos game. I’m not even going to speak of myself because we lost so many weapons.

“Elgton Jenkins, Devonte Wyatt, like excuse after excuse you could say, but like this team, we had so many weapons dialed up, loaded up, and we lost them.”

The Packers will be missing a lot of players during offseason conditioning, but some will be back for training camp.

Here’s a roundup of some of some of the injuries that were part of the 2025 season:

Right tackle Zach Tom tried to play through patellar tear, will undergo surgery soon

After he injured his right knee against the Denver Broncos, right tackle Zach Tom underwent tests and found out he had suffered a partially torn patellar tendon in his right knee. A fully torn patellar is a devastating injury and can result in a player missing an entire calendar year.

Tom said he received a platelet rich plasma injection in hopes it would help the tendon heal, but it didn’t help. He said he could have played but he was having trouble pass protecting and was at risk to suffer a fully torn patellar.

“I’m leaning toward surgery because I just want to get it over with, move on,” Tom said. “I think it’s like six months (recovery).”

Tom said he wanted to help the team as it headed into the playoffs, but when he practiced he couldn’t take on bull rushes the way he needed to when it came to pass protection. After seeing Carolina tackle Ickey Ekwonu and Chicago tackle Ozzy Trapilo tear their patellar tendons in the playoffs, he knew not playing was the right decision.

“It was probably one of the hardest decisions I had to make in my life,” Tom said. “Obviously, you want to be out there in the playoffs because that’s when you know everything’s at stake. But I just don’t think I was in position (to play).”

Defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt expects to be back for the start of training camp

In the midst of the best season of his career, Devonte Wyatt had his left ankle fallen on by teammate Warren Brinson and suffered a broken fibula and a torn ligament at Detroit. Wyatt had two screws put in his ankle and said he will take the entire offseason to recover.

The ligament tear is the worse of the injuries and will require the longest time to heal.

“It could be longer it could be shorter, it just depends on how the recovery goes,” Wyatt said. “I should be back by training camp.”

Wyatt said he felt he was on the verge of a Pro Bowl year when he got hurt and was especially pained that he couldn’t play in any of the three games against the Chicago Bears. He said getting a chance to be a starter and being able to play multiple positions on the defensive line was the biggest difference for him.

“I played a lot more this year,” he said. “It made me a lot more comfortable being on the field so long. You see what (teams) are trying to do. We had Chicago the next week, I was ready for that. That ticked me off so bad. But we’ll be back.”

Wyatt is under contract for one year at around $14 million guaranteed. He said he hadn’t talked to his agent about whether there have been negotiations on an extension, but he said his thought now is that he would play the deal out and see what happens after next season.

Cornerback Nate Hobbs vows he will return and be a factor in the Packers defense

Cornerback Nate Hobbs was almost in tears as he described his 2025 season.

It was nothing as expected after signing a four-year, $48 million free agent contract. Hobbs expected to be a starter at one of the outside corner positions, but he kept getting injured.

It started in training camp when he tore the meniscus in his right knee and underwent surgery Aug. 2. He missed the season opener and then started the next five games. He wasn’t playing at the level the Packers hoped, but was starting to get healthy when he injured his left knee against Carolina.

This injury was a sprained MCL and it sidelined him for four games. He returned to play in the first Bears game and had probably his best performance of the year. Coordinator Jeff Hafley said Hobbs added a physical presence in that game and was looking forward to him progressing.

But a week later he collided with Ravens receiver Zay Flowers in the end zone and reinjured his left knee, suffering another MCL sprain.

“I wouldn't wish this on nobody what I had to go through,” Hobbs said. “But I can honestly say now I'm getting to the point where I'm glad it happened. It's made me a better person, a better leader, a better man, and I know if I get kicked back to nothing, rock bottom, I know I could get it back, every time.

“At the end of the season, I was starting to come back alive, be myself.”

Hobbs said he knows he took a lot of criticism from the public but he said the public didn’t get to see what he can add to the Packers and he vowed they would see it next season.

“It’s just a part of it, and I understand,” Hobbs said of the criticism. ""As a fan, you give your heart and your soul to this ride, so when somebody’s not performing up to what you thought, you can be like, ‘Hey, what’s going on, man?’

“But my message to Packers nation, I don’t think you guys got to see a fair version of Nate Hobbs. I think you got to see the version of Nate Hobbs that God chose this season to teach me what he had to teach me.”

He added later, “I promise you guys I will be one of the best players on this defense.”

Cornerback Kamal Hadden will need time to overcome gruesome injury suffered against Baltimore

Cornerback Kamal Hadden was on the verge of playing a much bigger role on defense when he decided to lower his shoulder and tackle Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.

Hadden was in the game because cornerback Carrington Valentine was not tackling well, but he was doing what he normally does as one of the team’s biggest corners. But his ankle got caught underneath him and got twisted in such a violent way that he broke both the tibia and fibula in his right leg.

Hadden is still using a knee coaster to get around and said he’s hopeful to be back next season, although it may not be in time for the season opener.

“It’s a pretty bad injury,” Hadden said. ""They said it’s a four- or five-month recovery, but I’m just taking it one day at a time, just coming in (for rehab). The main thing now is to elevate my leg and that’s what I do most of the time. Elevate and ice it in the cast and take it a day at a time.”

Hadden said he was in shock after the injury and when he looked at the way his foot was bent said it really hit him that something bad had happened. Though he has a long recovery ahead, Hadden said he would try to make that tackle again if it comes up.

“It’s sad that it happened like that, but it was a routine play,” he said. “That’s what I was coached to do, my job, and I’d do it again. It just was an unfortunate play where I just got caught up under and got rolled up on.”

Coach Matt LaFleur said Hadden was the most improved player on the roster from training camp to the season and Hadden said he felt he made strides.

“I grew and I showed my even more than I thought I could do,” Hadden said. “I just got better. And it gives me anticipation that I can go even further, the more work I put in. This injury has just helped me lock in more. I’m hurt right now, but I’ll be back 100%.”

Bo Melton said he suffered a four-week injury and will be OK

Bo Melton injured his ankle against the Minnesota Vikings and was put on injured reserve soon after.

Melton is walking around without too much of a limp and said he was told it would take him about a month to recover. If the Packers had made the Super Bowl, he might have been able to return, but he said he wasn’t expecting any delay in his return next season.

Melton was listed as a cornerback after being moved there in the offseason but he wound up playing mostly at receiver. When asked if he was going to ask to be moved back to receiver, he said he didn’t want to talk about that right now.

When he asked if there would be time for that discussion with the coaches, he said yes.

Center Sean Rhyan suffered a bone bruise in his knee, thought the injury was much worse

Center Sean Rhyan got hit on the side of his knee as he was anchored in the ground late in the playoff loss to the Bears. He said he thought he had suffered a serious knee injury because he was in an enormous amount of pain.

He said the scan he underwent showed only a bruise, although there was a lot of swelling.

“It was a full shock to my body and I just went down,” Rhyan said. “That was the first time that ever happened. That’s why I was a little bit worried. It was just one of those bad ones.

“I got a good bone bruise and a lot of swelling and inflammation. They said it might be hyperextended, too. I would have done my darnedest to be out there (next week), but I guess we’ll never know.”

Rhyan is an unrestricted free agent and he said he doesn’t know what the future will bring. But he said he wasn’t going to let it weigh on him.

“It will be what it will be,” he said. “I’m going to try to get my knee back to 100% as fast as possible so I could get back to training for next year.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/27/PMJS/87499514007-getty-2248776082.jpg?crop=4397,2473,x3,y317&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-12 21:13:42.936532

Gonzalez exited the game after hitting his head on the turf while in coverage against Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston. The Patriots initially ruled him questionable to return, but later downgraded him to out after he went into the locker room for evaluation.

""Gonzo continues to play at a high level,"" Vrabel said in Monday's media availability. ""Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him. I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don't know.

But we appreciate what he's done and his willingness to line up in different places. … He's handled that all really well, and hopefully we'll get him back.""

Patriots' suddenly dominant defense becomes the biggest wild card of the NFL playoffs

Tyler Sullivan

Gonzalez told reporters in the locker room after Sunday's win that he was not allowed to speak with the media, but he also said in that interaction that he was ""fine."" His availability for the next round of the postseason will be among the most impactful storylines to follow on the New England side as he has been one of the NFL's best pass defenders since his arrival in the league in 2023.

""I did talk to him,"" Vrabel said in his weekly WEEI radio appearance. ""We'll go through whatever the steps are that would require him to pass through whatever he needs to do. Without having seen him today -- I can't sit here and speculate -- I just know that they wouldn't let him go back into the game.""

While he remains in search of his first interception of the year, Gonzalez is in the midst of a fantastic campaign with 12 pass breakups (including playoffs) and a career-high 69 tackles. He earned his first Pro Bowl selection on the heels of a 2024 season in which he landed on the All-Pro second team.

Injuries have, unfortunately, cropped up in each of Gonzalez's first three professional seasons. He suffered a torn labrum in Week 4 of his rookie year and missed the final 13 games, sat one game the following year with a concussion and missed the first three contests of the present campaign with a hamstring injury he sustained in training camp.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/12/a5690e04-1011-4c61-8438-07645401b001/thumbnail/1200x675/09d8ba1f9173fbdef46740a9438040f1/gettyimages-2255809263-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 20:00:09.461905

Davis, 26, was carted to the locker room in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s 27-24 road win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild-card round. Buffalo advanced to face the Denver Broncos, the AFC’s top seed, in the divisional round on Saturday.

Davis’ knee buckled as he was hit while trying to catch a pass in triple coverage. He previously sustained a torn PCL and meniscus in the same knee in November 2024, during his lone season as a member of the Jaguars.

Davis signed with Buffalo in September as his recovery continued and played six games during the regular season, recording 12 catches for 129 yards and one touchdown. He had two catches for 14 yards against Jacksonville in the playoff opener.

A fourth-round draft pick in 2020, Davis spent his first four seasons with the Bills. In 80 career games (61 starts), he has 195 receptions for 3,098 yards and 30 scores.

Davis' season is over.

Davis, 26, returned to Buffalo this season after spending last season with the Jaguars. He didn't make his season debut until Week 11 but quickly took a prominent role in the receiver rotation. He started five of the Bills' final eight games and finished the regular season with 12 catches for 129 yards.

Davis caught two of three targets for 14 yards against Jacksonville on Sunday before taking a nasty hit to his knee early in the fourth quarter. He was helped to the sideline and then eventually carted off the field. He had played roughly half of Buffalo's snaps to that point.

2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl

John Breech

Nicknamed ""Big Game Gabe"" for his previous playoff performances -- including a four-touchdown game against the Kansas City Chiefs four years ago -- Davis was one of several Bills who got banged up ahead of a divisional round matchup against the Denver Broncos, and his injury puts an already struggling receiver unit in more trouble.

Bills receiver situation vs. Broncos

Buffalo has been rolling with a by committee receiver approach all season, though the members of that committee often rotate.

Khalil Shakir has been the one constant. The slot man played on 71% of Buffalo's offensive snaps against Jacksonville, the highest of any receiver. He finished with 12 catches for 82 yards; no other player had more than three catches.

Tyrell Shavers (54% snap share) and Brandin Cooks (48%) were next in line. Cooks had three catches for 58 yards, including a crucial 36-yarder on the game-winning drive. Cooks, a midseason addition, has been up and down in his short time in Buffalo, seemingly alternating big plays and drops. Shavers had one catch for 14 yards, and he also suffered a knee injury the Bills are still evaluating, McDermott said.

The only other receiver with a catch was Keon Coleman, who brought in his lone target for a 36-yard gain. Coleman, the 2024 second-round pick who was a healthy scratch at times this season, played 43% of Buffalo's offensive snaps. He was only active Sunday because Josh Palmer (ankle) was unable to play; Palmer was ultimately placed on injured reserve.

With Davis and Palmer out and Shavers dealing with an injury, Coleman's role could increase. He's a big body (6-foot-4, 215 pounds) who has flashed the ability to win 50-50 balls but struggled with consistency throughout his brief career.

The Bills also opened the practice window for Curtis Samuel, who has not played since mid-November due to neck and elbow injuries. It remains to be determined whether he will be able to play.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/12/962b88ef-bea9-4c9e-95e8-c52b61860060/thumbnail/1200x675/a7e1471f67c4b4af10412fd7eeb06473/gabe-davis-bills.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 19:00:46.523985

A torn Achilles suffered during the 49ers' win over the Eagles has ended Kittle's season. It will also presumably kick off an extended recovery and rehabilitation process over the next eight-plus months or so. Put another way: This is a really awful injury to suffer, both in the short term, in not being able to be there for your team in the playoffs, and in the long term, in how much effort and energy it will take to return to play at a healthy and high level of athletic ability.

In response to such a pitfall, Kittle responded to such a terrible moment in his NFL career the way many adults of legal-drinking age might after a long day: By apparently pounding a full bottle of hard liquor. In this case, per The Athletic's Dianna Russini, it was a bottle of Patrón tequila, seemingly special-requested by Kittle from the 49ers' owner, Jed York.

I suppose there are worse ways to cope with a horrific day at work:

I'm not sure what to say to Kittle in this moment because ""Cheers!"" is probably inappropriate ... right? That would imply Kittle had something to celebrate, which he doesn't.

Here is the Bills vs. Broncos injury report for the divisional round of the playoffs.

Buffalo Bills injury update for playoffs

Jordan Poyer, S, hamstring

Jordan Poyer re-aggravated a hamstring injury in the second quarter against the Jaguars and did not return. He was replaced by rookie Jordan Hancock.

Poyer missed the final two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury that occurred while recording a half-sack on Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders late in the fourth quarter in Week 16.

Poyer, 34, who began the season on the Bills practice squad and was considered back with the organization as a mentor, was second on the team in tackles in the regular season. He finished the regular season with 70 tackles, one interception and a half sack in 10 games in 2025.

Gabe Davis, WR, knee

Gabe Davis suffered a left knee injury and was carted to the locker room in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars on Sunday.

He dropped a pass over the middle, took a hard hit and was helped off the field by trainers. Davis was carted from the sideline with a towel over his head ruled out for the game with a left knee injury.

Davis left the locker room on crutches after the game posted a photo of his leg in a brace on his Instagram story with the caption ""Appreciate everybody reaching out.""

Davis had two catches for 14 yards versus Jacksonville before the injury.

Davis suffered a season-ending left knee injury last year as a member of the Jaguars.

With Davis out, the Bills will likely have Curtis Samuel or Mecole Hardman active against the Broncos.

Josh Allen, QB, foot/knee

Josh Allen was took two trips to the blue medical tent against a physical Jaguars defense in the wild-card round.

Allen was evaluated for a concussion and cleared to return in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, his right throwing hand jammed into the helmet of offensive guard O'Cyrus Torrence on a follow through. Three plays later, Allen plowed into the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown run but his left knee bent as he was knocked backward. Allen went back into the tent but returned to the bench and didn't miss any plays.

""It was more of a precautionary thing,"" Allen said in his postgame press conference. ""Just got rolled up on and they wanted to take a quick look, but we're all good.""

Allen underwent X-rays postgame on his right foot in Week 16 and Week 17 and only played one snap to extend his consecutive starts streak in Week 18 as the Bills rested multiple starters.

He originally suffered the foot injury while retreating and falling to the ground on a 22-yard sack against the Browns in Week 16. Allen limped off the field and was evaluated by athletic trainers as he sat on the bench late in the second quarter. He walked to the locker room with trainers just prior to halftime with his right cleat off and received X-rays, which were negative. Allen returned for the second half and did not miss any plays.

Allen played the entirety versus the Eagles, rushing for two touchdowns in the final 5:11 of the game, but he was sacked five times. He appeared to be favoring the foot and attempted all of his passes from the pocket for the first time in his career.

Ty Johnson, RB, ankle

Ty Johnson was inactive with an ankle injury against the Jaguars. He was spotted in a walking boot entering EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville on Sunday.

Johnson suffered the injury while getting 15 touches and scoring two touchdowns in the Week 18 win over the Jets.

Shaq Thompson, LB, neck

Shaq Thompson entered the wild-card game against the Jaguars listed as questionable but played all 56 of the Bills' defensive snaps and was a difference-maker.

Thompson intercepted Trevor Lawrence in the first quarter, which set up Matt Prater's 50-yard field goal to open the scoring. He finished with a game-high eight tackles.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard has missed the last two games since exiting with a calf injury against the Eagles in Week 17.

He did not practice all week leading up to the wild-card round. The Bills' defensive captain recorded 65 taclkes, two forced fumbles and an interception in 12 games in 2025.

Bernard also missed three games this season with a dislocated elbow.

Maxwell Hairston, CB, ankle

Maxwell Hairston did not play in the wild-card win over the Jaguars.

He suffered an ankle injury in the fourth quarter of the regular season finale against the New York Jets.

The rookie first-round pick was hurt while making a tackle on wide receiver Quentin Skinner. Hairston seemed to plant awkwardly, lunged at Skinner and landed on his right knee, then was inadvertently collided with by rookie linebacker Keonta Jenkins.

Hairston walked gingerly to the blue medical tent before heading to the locker room. He did not return. Hairston was spotted wearing a walking boot on his right foot after the game.

Hairston spent the first six games of the season on injured reserve with a right knee injury he suffered during training camp.

Matt Prater, K, right quadriceps

Matt Prater's injured quadriceps held up to win the kicking battle against the Jaguars. Prater played despite entering the game as questionable. He went 2-for-2 on field goals, with makes from 50 and 47 yards, and 3-for-3 on extra points. Punter Mitch Wishnowsky handled kickoff duties to save Prater's leg. Jacksonville's Cam Little, who holds the NFL record for the two longest field goals in history and entered the game with 20 straight made field goals, missed a 54-yarder to end the first half.

Prater, 41, missed the last 2 1/2 games of the regular season after injuring, then re-aggravating his right quadriceps. He made 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 46 of 49 extra points for 100 points in 15 games this season.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

Buffalo opened Hamlin's 21-day practice window on Jan. 7. He logged three limited practices but did not come off injured reserve to play against the Jaguars in the wild-card game.

Hamlin was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but played a reserve role in 2025. He had one tackle in five regular season games.

DaQuan Jones, DT, calf

DaQuan Jones returned for the playoffs after missing Week 17 and Week 18 with a calf injury. He played 39 snaps, 70% of Buffalo's defensive snaps, and had one tackle.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury that required and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and was eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Oliver could potentially return for the playoffs.

McDermott gave an update on Dec. 28 that Oliver suffered a minor setback in his recovery but is ""moving in a good direction.""

Curtis Samuel, WR, elbow

Curtis Samuel has been on injured reserve since Nov. 28.

He has seven receptions for 81 yards and a touchdown and nine kickoff returns for 223 yards (24.5 avg.) in six games in 2025.

Jordan Phillips, DT, ankle

Jordan Phillips was placed on injured reserve on Jan. 7.

He missed Week 16 and Week 17 with an ankle injury but played in Week 18. Phillips recorded nine tackles and one sack in 11 games in 2025.

Joshua Palmer, WR, ankle

The Bills placed Joshua Palmer on injured reserve on Jan. 10, ending his season.

Palmer finished with 22 catches for 303 receiving yards and no touchdowns in 12 games in 2025.

This was Palmer's first year of a three-year, $29 million contract.

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp had 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Bass underwent season-ending surgery in November.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Chase Lundt, OT, knee

Chase Lundt, a rookie sixth-round pick, was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 19. Lundt has appeared in two games, with three offensive snaps and five special teams snaps, in 2025.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

Denver Broncos injury update for playoffs

Dre Greenlaw, LB, hamstring

Drew Greenlaw was out the final two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury. He played eight regular games and missed nine games due to injury and suspension in his first season in Denver.

Greenlaw was on injured reserve earlier this season with a quadriceps injury, missing the first six games and making his season debut in Week 7. He was also suspended for one game for running at a referee.

Greenlaw has 45 tackles, one sack, one forced fumble and one interception in eight games in 2025.

Greenlaw suffered a torn Achilles as a member of the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 58 in February 2024. He played two games for the 49ers in 2024 and signed a three-year contract with the Broncos in March.

P.J. Locke, S, leg

P.J. Locke suffered a leg injury in Week 18.

Locke has started for the Broncos in place of Brandon Jones, who is on injured reserve.

Rams head coach Sean McVay spoke to reporters Monday ahead of Sunday’s game, and said that tests had revealed Stafford suffered what he called a “minor sprain” on a finger on his throwing hand.

McVay said that he fully expects Stafford to be on the field Sunday when his team takes on the Bears at Soldier Field.

“He's as tough as it gets, but he's feeling good,” McVay said. “He was able to push through it, and he'll be good to go.”

Stafford is considered to be a strong contender for the MVP award after a stellar 2025 season, where he threw for 4,707 yards and 46 touchdowns for the Rams. He also threw just eight interceptions on the year, and was named a first-team All-Pro for the first time in his storied NFL career.

In Saturday’s game against the Carolina Panthers, Stafford suffered the finger injury during the first half but still put together a strong performance, throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns as the Rams beat Carolina 34-31 to advance in the postseason.

In eight postseason games with the Rams, Stafford has thrown for 2,392 yards and 18 touchdowns, winning the Super Bowl during the 2021 season.

The Packers led by at least nine points after halftime in three of their five losses to end the season.","GREEN BAY, Wis. — Green Bay's Micah Parsons calls his torn anterior cruciate ligament ""the most challenging thing that I think I've ever faced as a human.""

But the All-Pro defensive end believes he can recover in time to play early next season.

Speaking to reporters for the first time since his Dec. 14 injury, Parsons said Monday that he hopes to be back for the start of the season, but added that a more realistic goal is ""probably like Week 3, Week 4.""

""I wouldn't wish this on anyone,"" Parsons said. ""I don't think people realize how much the knee is. It's the most challenging thing that I think I've ever faced as a human. When you talk about pain, can't sleep, can't move around. … I can't remember the last time I slept through the night. My body's tired. My mind's tired. I'm exhausted, man. But it's going to be worth it once I'm going to be able to move and play again.""

Parsons and tight end Tucker Kraft both discussed their recoveries from torn ACLs as the Packers packed up their lockers two days after blowing a 15-point, fourth-quarter lead in a 31-27 wild-card playoff loss at Chicago.

Kraft, who tore his right ACL on Nov. 2, compared this injury to the torn pectoral muscle that caused him to spend part of the 2024 preseason on the physically unable to perform list. Kraft returned in time to play all 17 games that season.

""By the time Week 1 rolls around, I'll be 10 months post-surgery and hopefully bulletproof by then,"" Kraft said.

The Packers were leading the Denver Broncos in the second half when Parsons hurt his left knee, knocking him out for the rest of this season. They didn't win again, losing their last five games.

It's the first major injury of Parsons' career. It ended his first season in Green Bay prematurely after the Packers acquired him in an August trade with the Dallas Cowboys.

""I'm not a very vulnerable person and during this period I've probably been the most vulnerable I've been in the last like, probably my whole life, Parsons said. ""I'm telling people how much I need them and appreciate them being there for me.

""Because to be honest, man, you can't go through this injury by yourself. … Like I can't shower by myself. I can't even get off the bed myself. So I couldn't imagine being alone. So I'm so appreciative of my family being there for me.""

The injuries to Parsons and Kraft left the Packers without two of their best players.

Parsons had 12 ½ sacks this season to earn All-Pro honors despite missing the Packers' final four games. Kraft had 32 catches for 489 yards and six touchdowns despite playing only eight games.

""I was on the cusp of putting together one of the greatest seasons by a Packer tight end, and that was something I was looking forward to, just leaving my legacy on this game and playing as hard as I could every snap for the for this team, because the end of the day, the guys in this room, they mean so much to me,"" Kraft said.

Although the Packers were winless after his injury, Parsons said ""there was no point in the season where I felt like we weren't a championship-caliber team.""

The Packers led by at least nine points after halftime in three of their five losses to end the season. Another loss came when the Packers rested their starters in the regular-season finale at Minnesota.

Parsons and Kraft both expressed support for Matt LaFleur as speculation swirled about their coach's future.

""I think Matt's an outstanding head coach,"" Kraft said. ""There's no doubt in my mind that he'll remain here as a Packer. I think a lot of that talk is pretty silly.""

Parsons said LaFleur's presence was part of the reason he wanted to come to Green Bay. Parsons said he mentioned that to LaFleur after seeing questions about the coach's job status.

""You can get spoiled with good coach and good people, and you don't realize until they're gone,"" Parsons said. ""I don't want to be at that point where we realize like, 'Damn, we let such a great coach go.' ""

Parsons said players must take accountability regarding the way the season ended.

""There's a lot of reality checks that us as players need,"" Parsons said. ""Yeah, I think as fans and people I see the same things you see. People want to look at the play-calling and people want to look that, but I'm looking at the effort of the guys. I look at the how guys are playing. Are we blocking? Are we getting blocks? Are we attacking? Those are the things us players we can control. And I think more people need to realize that.""

But now, a new theory may actually shine light on the 49ers injury situation.
Could it be that EMF are weakening cellular structure and collagen strength in players who have chronic exposure to these magnetic fields?","Although the San Francisco 49ers grinded out a gutsy win against the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles over the weekend, the win did not come without cost, as the 49ers lost another key component of their team to injury, as star tight end George Kittle suffered a significant Achilles injury in the second quarter. However, even before Kittle’s injury, the buzz around the league revolved around whether or not an electrical substation positioned near the 49ers home stadium may be linked to the team’s soft tissues injuries.

Even prior to Kittle’s injury, the 49ers topped the list of the most injured team in the NFL over the past decade. Since the 2014 move to Levi’s Stadium, the 49ers have consistently ranked among the league leaders in adjusted games lost (AGL), which is a metric that quantifies the impact of injuries to starters or key players. Most notably, the team ranked dead last for AGL in 2020 and 2024 when their injury burden far exceeded league average.

Many initially wrote the injuries off as fluke. Then, questions arose about the training staff and conditioning programs. But now, a new theory may actually shine light on the 49ers injury situation.

EMF Wave Transmission And Injury Rates

Peter Cowan recently decided to investigate a theory that had been circulating around the 49ers locker room for years – that a nearby electrical substation played a role in the teams’ injury rates. During his investigation, Cowan walked around the team’s practice fields, located a little over 100 yards from Silicon Valley Power’s Mission Substation. He turned on a gaussmeter and found that readings were much higher than what may be seen if measured at an average American household. Readings could be even higher in the facilities where players lift, watch film and recover. This lead Cowan to surmise that this chronic exposure to extremely low-frequency (ELF) magnetic fields could be having a physical impact on the 49ers.

Dr. Silverman Comments

This research is pretty crazy, but it’s rooted in sound science. We know that EMF has effects on human tissues. In the medical world, we can use it to help signal bones to heal in patients with delayed and non-unions. We also know that EMF can help decease pain and inflammation. So it’s not crazy to assume that since EMF needs to be properly delivered to achieve positive results (to effect the cells correctly at the nuclear level to induce the desired change) that EMF in excess can affect cells negatively.

Could it be that EMF are weakening cellular structure and collagen strength in players who have chronic exposure to these magnetic fields? Certainly. We can’t say for fact that it is absolutely the case, but the evidence seems to suggest more testing and studies are warranted. Injuries have derailed many playoff runs for San Francisco over the last decade, and they are once again facing an uphill playoff battle with a depleted squad. We’ll certainly be following their playoff run and the additional testing that is sure to come in wake of this new theory. Not only could it provide answers to the 49ers, but it could improve our medical knowledge as a whole, and that’s a win for everyone.",https://www.anklefootmd.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-1.31.27-PM-e1768246416900.png,N,,2026-01-13 00:14:04.578268

Houston finished the regular season with a 12-5 record, holding 2nd place in the AFC South, while Pittsburgh entered the playoffs at 10-7 as the AFC North champion. The Texans have two of the players with the most sacks recorded in Danielle Hunter (15) and Will Anderson Jr. (12), while the Steelers are within the top 15 teams with the fewest points per game allowed at home (21.4) this season. However, one major question that haunts the chances is: Will both teams’ key players, like Aaron Rodgers, play in the upcoming matchup? Here’s a detailed final injury report for the upcoming clash.

Will Aaron Rodgers play against the Houston Texans?

Aaron Rodgers has been managing a wrist injury late in the 2025 regular season, an issue that placed him on the injury report heading into the AFC Wild Card round. The wrist problem did not force Rodgers to miss any games, and he continued to start and finish contests while receiving treatment during the week.

According to the latest report, Rodgers was a full participant in practice this week despite the wrist issue and is listed without a game designation ahead of the matchup against the Houston Texans. The QB finished the 2025 regular season with 3,322 passing yards, averaging 207.6 yards per game, while completing 65.7% of his throws. He threw 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Rodgers also contributed as a runner, totaling 61 rushing yards on 21 carries with one rushing touchdown.

Amid speculations of his future with the team, Aaron Rodgers mentioned that he will be evaluating the options post-season.

“I’m 42, and I’m on a one-year deal. You know what the situation is. Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. That’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play — not a lot of options, but … I would think maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play,” he said on December 31.

Will Derek Stingley Jr. play against the Pittsburgh Steelers?

Derek Stingley Jr. is managing a new injury concern ahead of the AFC Wild Card matchup. The Houston Texans’ top cornerback has been dealing with an oblique issue late in the season. The injury surfaced during the regular-season schedule and led to Stingley being limited in practice earlier in the week. However, this didn’t hinder his consistency, and the team has handled his workload cautiously to avoid aggravation.

Oblique injuries are particularly sensitive for defensive backs due to the rotational demands of coverage and tackling. This makes his practice participation closely monitored. According to the latest injury report, Stingley progressed from limited participation to full participation in practice later in the week and does not currently carry a game-status designation.

Derek Stingley Jr. finished the 2025 regular season with 36 total tackles, including 26 solo stops, while also breaking up 15 passes and recording four interceptions. He added a forced fumble and even scored a defensive touchdown. Stingley appeared in all 17 games for the second straight season.

With both injury reports finalized, the Wild Card matchup shapes up as a near full-strength contest.

Gonzalez broke on a pass intended for receiver Quentin Johnston at the 14:20 mark of the final quarter, nearly intercepting it as he dove in front of Johnston. But when Johnston worked back toward the line of scrimmage to try to catch the pass, he landed on the helmet of the diving Gonzalez.

Vrabel said in his weekly interview on sports radio WEEI on Monday that Gonzalez had not been cleared to return to the game Sunday night. When Vrabel later met with reporters, he noted that when a player is in that situation, he is officially entered into concussion protocol.

""How long that lasts, I don't know,"" Vrabel said. ""Hopefully we'll get him back.""

The Patriots will host the winner of Monday night's game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans on Sunday at Gillette Stadium (either 3 p.m. ET or 6:30 p.m. ET).

Gonzalez, who was voted a Pro Bowler this season for the first time in his three-year career, has started 15 games. He has totaled 69 tackles while recording a team-high 12 passes defended, but no interceptions. He finished fifth in Associated Press All-Pro voting at the position.

""Gonzo continues to play at a high level,"" Vrabel said. ""We appreciate what he's done and his willingness to line up different places. He's handled that all really well.""

The Patriots usually start Gonzalez opposite eight-year veteran Carlton Davis III, with Marcus Jones in the slot. Second-year pro Charles Woods is a top backup, with 2025 seventh-round draft pick Kobee Minor also on the cornerback depth chart. Third-year pro Alex Austin, who has practiced the past two weeks while remaining on injured reserve (wrist), could also potentially be part of the mix if he's added to the 53-man roster.

In Week 16, the Patriots had running back TreVeyon Henderson, receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson all enter concussion protocol due to injuries sustained in a win over the Baltimore Ravens.

Christian Gonzalez injury

Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed on Monday that Gonzalez is in the NFL's concussion protocol and it is not yet known how long until he could be cleared to play.

""I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don't know. When you don't return to the game and they won't let you return to the game, that would put you in the protocol. Wherever that goes, that goes,"" Vrabel said during his Monday news conference.

New England next plays Sunday against either the Pittsburgh Steelers or Houston Texans.

Boston Herald reporter Zack Cox said after the game that Gonzalez was in the locker room and said he felt ""fine,"" but could not talk to reporters due to NFL concussion policy.

Will Christian Gonzalez be out this week?

The speed of a player exiting concussion protocol can vary. Earlier this season against the Baltimore Ravens, Patriots players TreyVeon Henderson, Kayshon Boutte and Jared Wilson all suffered concussions.

Henderson was back the next week without missing any game action. Boutte returned after missing one game, while Wilson missed multiple weeks.

Gonzalez suffered the injury early in the fourth quarter as he broke up a pass intended for Chargers wide receiver Question Johnston. After Gonzalez dove to the turf making a play on the ball, Johnston landed on the cornerback's head.

The television broadcast captured Gonzalez walking slowly up the tunnel toward the locker room, and he was ruled out a short time later.

The Pro Bowl cornerback was having a stellar performance before the injury.

""Gonzo continues to play at a high level. Those are the expectations that he has for himself and we have for him,"" Vrabel said. ""We appreciate what he's done and his willingness to line up different places. It's not quite as east as, we've been through this, different coverages, locations, motions, things like that. He's handled that all really well and hopefully we'll get him back.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/12/7415d5a9-829b-461a-8bd3-4fd0a6903e95/thumbnail/1200x630/45a8333e90b168cce34ccc94a7857007/ap26012030449654-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:03:22.979314
