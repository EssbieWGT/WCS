Matthew Stafford went 25-of-35 passing for 273 yards with three touchdowns, two of which went to Davante Adams. Teddy Bridgewater, who replaced Mayfield, went 8-of-15 passing for 62 yards.

The Rams improve to 9-2 while the Buccaneers fall to 6-5.

The ""MVP!"" chants were loud and present at SoFi Stadium as Matthew Stafford was putting on the full display of what has turned his 17th NFL season into his best yet. He was lofting deep passes to Davante Adams, converting a 3rd-and-19 to Puka Nacua and tossing a no-look touchdown pass to Colby Parkinson as Todd Bowles' Buccaneers had zero answers for him, much like the rest of the NFL this season.

Stafford is up to 30 touchdowns and two interceptions, and over the past eight games, he's tossed 25 touchdowns without a single pick. He's now one of four quarterbacks to start a season with a touchdown-to-interception ratio this strong, joining a class of Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.

For as long as Stafford can be this dialed in before the snap and after, the Rams will absorb the personnel losses they're seeing around him. He took the field down three original starters in wide receiver Tutu Atwell, tight end Tyler Higbee and right tackle Rob Havenstein. But with Adams and Nacua at his disposal, everything is working for Stafford as he plays in a special kind of unison with what Sean McVay is dialing up for him.

Much of this Rams season to date has been about whether the offense and defense could be prolific enough to make up for a disastrous special teams unit. That was especially true with the field goals, as Joshua Karty missed more kicks than anyone else prior to his benching.

But not only have the Rams solidified their protection as well as their snaps with Jake McQuaide over the past few games, but they might have found a kicker, too. Harrison Mevis is now 13-for-13 on extra points, and he got to try his first two field goal attempts and knocked those through from 40 and 52 yards.

Mevis has always had a strong leg, dating back to when he set a Southeastern Conference record with a 61-yard game-winner at Missouri. But if he can add a steadiness to the operation in addition to the potential to hit from distance, he'll make this Rams team that much harder to keep from scoring with how Matthew Stafford is playing.

This week was supposed to be a major challenge for the Rams defensive backfield. They were facing Baker Mayfield, Emeka Egbuka and Chris Godwin with a group that was now down its top two players, with cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon and safety Quentin Lake on injured reserve. But all it meant was that someone other than Lake could be the star on the back end.

Cobie Durant ripped a pass out of a receivers hands and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. added his second interception in three games in addition to five pass deflections. And with Kobie Turner and Jared Verse winning in the pass rush, the group held Mayfield to his worst game of the season, as he finished 9-of-19 for 41 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions before leaving the game with a shoulder injury.

The 103 yards the secondary allowed to Mayfield and Teddy Bridgewater combined are their fewest in a game this season.

The challenges will still come in communication and alignment for younger and newer defenders as the season trudges on without Lake, who is targeting a return for the postseason. But Witherspoon could be back in the next month, which would open Durant up to slide inside and allow the Rams to continue to get playmakers on the field in their dime looks.

Above are the updated standings for the NFC West. With tonight's win, the Los Angeles Rams improve to 9-2 and are atop the NFC standings as the No. 1 seed. They are one game up on the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC West and a game ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears for the NFC's No. 1 seed.

The Rams also lead the NFC West in point differential with 127.

Above are the latest NFC South standings with Tampa Bay Buccaneers are currently tied atop the NFC South with the Carolina Panthers at 6-5.

The Panthers still have a game to play against the San Francisco 49ers on “Monday Night Football.” With a win, the Panthers could lead the NFC South.

Tampa Bay still has two games remaining against Carolina, which likely will determine the NFC South champion. The Buccaneers lead the division in point differential at -25. All four teams in the NFC South have a negative point differential.

After Baker Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury, Teddy Bridgewater was tasked with guiding the Bucs offense in the second half and it was a difficult watch.

The veteran completed 8-of-15 passes for just 62 yards and he was sacked twice while being pressured often. He also rushed once for six yards. The offense did not look good all night but looked especially clunky with Bridgewater at the helm.

It remains to be seen if Mayfield will miss time with his injury.

Colby Parkinson was the only player on the Rams offense to find the end zone tonight aside from Davante Adams.

The tight end is a quality route runner at his size and can be dynamic after the catch. He caught all four of his targets for 41 yards, including a 5-yard touchdown courtesy of Matthew Stafford in the first half.

With the attention Adams and Puka Nacua draw, Parkinson and the rest of the Rams offense will have opportunities to make plays.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/OsCJSFXZCwdz_yhAnMm04XKaU_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-11-24 06:01:16.771704

Jackson has been held under 200 yards passing for three straight games for the first time in five years.
Jackson acknowledged last week that he might continue to miss one practice a week for body maintenance.
Jackson, who holds the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback, is averaging a career-low 29.6 yards rushing per game.","BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Ravens have gone from a 1-5 start to a first-place tie in the AFC North despite quarterback Lamar Jackson not at his MVP form.

After Sunday's 23-10 win over the New York Jets, Jackson said knee and ankle injuries haven't affected his play, even though he's mired in one of the biggest slumps of his decorated eight-year career.

""I feel like we just need to execute a lot better,"" said Jackson, who finished Sunday with 12-of-23 passing for 153 yards. ""We get in great field position, but we're not pulling points on the board. That has nothing to do with an injury.""

Jackson has been held under 200 yards passing for three straight games for the first time in five years. He has also gone back-to-back games without a touchdown pass for the first time in six years.

During this rut, the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player was sidelined for one practice two weeks ago because of knee soreness and was absent from one practice last week because of an ankle injury. Jackson acknowledged last week that he might continue to miss one practice a week for body maintenance.

One of the biggest changes in Jackson's games has been a decrease in his rushing. Jackson, who holds the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback, is averaging a career-low 29.6 yards rushing per game.

""I'm out there so I feel like I should still be able to do what I do,"" said Jackson, who ran 11 yards on seven rushing attempts.

Jackson, who entered Sunday with the NFL's highest career passer rating at 102.8, has produced a 62.8 rating over the past three games. In wins over the Vikings, Browns and Jets, Jackson has completed 57.1% of his passes (44-of-77) for 522 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.

Ravens coach John Harbaugh said he has the ""utmost confidence"" in Jackson.

""He's our guy, he's our quarterback and Lamar's doing what he needs to do,"" Harbaugh said. ""He is winning football games and it's not always pretty. The pretty games will be there. They'll be there for Lamar Jackson, you can bet on that. But I'm proud of him right now. I'm really proud of him, the way he's fighting to win football games.""

The Ravens (6-5) have won five straight games to go from last place in the AFC North to a tie atop the division with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But it has been defense, which has held the past six opponents under 20 points, that has carried Baltimore.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley has talked with Jackson about how their execution needs to improve on offense to achieve their Super Bowl aspirations.

""So while winning is great, to reach our goals, we know we need to be better,"" Stanley said.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1123%2Fr1579807_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 06:01:29.637127

The Delaware News Journal provided live coverage of the Eagles game against the Cowboys. Here is how their loss unfolded:

Eagles 21, Cowboys 21: Dak Prescott TD erases Birds' big lead

The Cowboys overcame a 21-0 deficit and tied the game on Dak Prescott's 7-yard run with 11:40 left in the fourth quarter. The Eagles' depleted secondary, down Adoree Jackson and Reed Blankenship, couldn't stop Dallas. Prescott hit George Pickens for a 43-yard reception down to the Eagles' 11 with Cooper DeJean in coverage. DeJean was playing on the outside after Jackson left with a concussion in the third quarter.

Prescott scored two plays later.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 14: Adoree Jackson, Reed Blankenship hurt

The Cowboys pulled closer as the Eagles offense sputtered, and three defenders left a third-quarter drive with injuries. Cornerback Adoree Jackson (concussion) and defensive tackle Moro Ojomo (undisclosed) left on successive plays. Later in the drive, safety Reed Blankenship was hurt.

The Cowboys took advantage of Cooper DeJean moving to the outside, and also Kelee Ringo coming into the game after Blankenship was hurt. They scored on Dak Prescott's 4-yard pass to Brevyn Spann-Ford with 2:02 left in the third.

Halftime update: Eagles 21, Cowboys 7

The Eagles offense broke out in a big way, at least early on. That was particularly true of wide receiver A.J. Brown, who had 5 catches for 67 yards and a touchdown in the first quarter.

Not to be overlooked, DeVonta Smith had an incredible backwards flip catch that went for 42 yards setting up another touchdown.

But the Eagles also got some help by some careless play by the Cowboys to take a 21-7 lead into halftime. The Cowboys lost a fumble, threw an interception into the end zone, and were called for a roughing the kicker penalty on an Eagles punt.

The Eagles took advantage of most of that. Jalen Hurts was 13-for-19 for 164 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 2 more, one on a tush push.

The Cowboys, however, outgained the Eagles 211-195 and got on the board with 21 seconds left on George Pickens' 1-yard TD.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 0: Reed Blankenship INT on Dak Prescott in end zone

The Cowboys have been their own worst enemy. They lost a fumble, they were called for roughing the kicker on a punt. And now, with their best chance to get back in the game, Eagles' safety Reed Blankenship made a diving interception in the end zone.

The Cowboys faced a 2nd-and-goal from the 1 when Tyler Guyton was called for a false start, pushing Dallas back to the 6. That's when Prescott tried for CeeDee Lamb in the end zone. But Blankenship dove and picked it off, giving the Eagles the ball at their 20.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 0: DeVonta Smith's incredible backwards flip

The Eagles extended their lead, helped in large part by an incredible backwards flip reception by DeVonta Smith. On 3rd-and-13 from the 47, Jalen Hurts threw deep for Smith, who caught the ball falling backwards, then flipped over. He held onto the ball for a 42-yard reception to the Cowboys' 11.

Smith then went 10 yards on a jet sweep down to the 1. Hurts then finished the job with a tush push TD for a 21-0 lead with 11:32 left in the second quarter.

Eagles 14, Cowboys 0: Jalen Hurts scores, A.J. Brown big factor

A.J. Brown must be happy now, even though he had a 7-yard TD taken off the board after a replay ruled he was out of bounds. No big deal. Jalen Hurts ran a QB draw for the touchdown, giving the Eagles a 14-0 lead with 57 seconds left in the first quarter. So far, Brown has 5 catches for 67 yards.

The Eagles got a break when the Cowboys' Ryan Flournoy was called for roughing the kicker as Braden Mann punted. That gave the Eagles a first down, and they took advantage.

Eagles 7, Cowboys 0: Jalen Hurts goes to A.J. Brown for TD

The Eagles took advantage after they stopped the Cowboys on 4th-and-3 from midfield to get a quick touchdown drive. And it was Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown, the subject of controversy the past two weeks, who hooked up. Hurts went to Brown on the first two plays, connecting for 6 and 10 yards. Then they capped the drive with a 15-yard touchdown with 8:41 left in the first quarter.

This came after the Cowboys tried going for it on 4th down from midfield. Was that a sign of disrespect for the Eagles offense?

Eagles inactives: Lane Johnson is out, Cam Jurgens in

As expected, star right tackle Lane Johnson is sitting out with a Lisfranc injury. He's being replaced in the starting lineup by Fred Johnson. Lane Johnson could miss a few more games. But he did not go on IR.

But center Cam Jurgens is playing after he was cleared out of the NFL's concussion protocol. Still, Jurgens will have a brace on his knee after missing two games on Oct. 26 and Nov. 10. He returned vs the Lions on Nov. 16, but left in the fourth quarter with the concussion.

Brett Toth took Jurgens' place while he's been out.

The Eagles' other inactives are QB Sam Howell, CB Mac McWilliams, RB A.J. Dillon and DT Ty Robinson.

Lane Johnson not placed on IR. When will he return?

Interestingly, the Eagles did not place right tackle Lane Johnson on injured reserve, a sign that they expect him back within the four-game minimum that he would have to miss by going on IR. Johnson suffered a Lisfranc injury in the Nov. 16 game against the Lions. Reports indicated Johnson would miss 4-6 weeks. If he needed surgery, he'd be out for the season.

Johnson thus does not need surgery. If he had gone on IR, he wouldn't be eligible to return until Dec. 14 when the Eagles host the Las Vegas Raiders. So either that day or the Dec. 8 game against the Chargers in Los Angeles would seem to be the timetable.

Eagles vs. Cowboys prediction

Eagles 24, Cowboys 19: As much as the Eagles' offense could use a breakout game, the determining factor could be Carter's revenge game. Carter was infamously ejected for spitting on Cowboys QB Dak Prescott before the first snap on Sept. 4. Needless to say, the Eagles missed him. As well as the defense has played in the last two games, Carter has been the linchpin. No doubt, Carter is looking forward to getting within spitting distance of Prescott ... without actually spitting on him. – Martin Frank

Eagles injury updates

The Eagles originally listed C Cam Jurgens (concussion) as QUESTIONABLE, but then cleared him to play on Nov. 22. The Eagles also listed G/C Willie Lampkin (knee/ankle) and T Myles Hinton (back) as QUESTIONABLE. But both are still on IR and have yet to be activated.

Cowboys injury updates

The Cowboys listed T Hakeem Adeniji (illness) and DE Jadeveon Clowney (shoulder/neck) as QUESTIONABLE. Everyone else has been cleared to play.

Weather forecast for Eagles vs Cowboys

Normally, this would be a good day to have the roof opened at AT&T Stadium, with late fall temperatures expected in the upper-60s under partly cloudy skies at game time. But the retractable roof will likely be closed as the game goes along. While there's just a 5% chance for rain when the game starts, it increases to 70% by the end.

Tampa Bay can certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push as the season progresses.","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers dropped to 6-4 following their 44-32 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 11. It's their third loss in four games, as they continue to play without some of their top offensive contributors.

Buccaneers all-time leading receiver Mike Evans is among those playmakers who have been out of action. Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the team's loss to the Detroit Lions on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 7 and has been out since the injury required surgery.

Baker Mayfield has had to rely on tertiary options as Evans' absence has been a significant blow to the Bucs, and he'll remain out for tonight's ""Sunday Night Football"" clash against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 12.

Like many teams around the NFL, Tampa Bay is dealing with many injuries across its roster. Chris Godwin and Bucky Irving have also missed multiple games but Tampa Bay has remained in the thick of the playoff picture.

When will Evans be able to return to the field? Here's the latest on the Buccaneers' veteran:

When will Mike Evans return?

Evans' injury will keep him off the field for most of the season, but there is a possibility of a return in December.

According to multiple reports, Evans underwent surgery to repair the clavicle fracture, which the NFL Network described as a ""clean break."" This suggests that, with no setbacks, he could return in about two months.

If the eight-week timeline from the injury holds, Evans might be able to return in Week 15, when the Buccaneers host the Falcons on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Dec. 11, or in Week 16, when they play on the road against the Panthers on Dec. 21.

Evans was placed on injured reserve (IR) and has not yet been designated to return. Once the Buccaneers open his practice window, they will have 21 days to activate him.

The Buccaneers remain in first place in the NFC South entering Week 11 but the Carolina Panthers are right on their heels at 6-5. Tampa Bay can certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push as the season progresses.

Here's a look at who the Buccaneers will have at wide receiver while Evans remains sidelined:

Emeka Egbuka

Chris Godwin (injured)

Tez Johnson

Ryan Miller

Kameron Johnson

Sterling Shepard

Dennis Houston (practice squad)

Godwin reaggravated his fibula injury and missed Week 8, and has remained out since. Without the pair of vets, Egbuka, the team's first-round pick in this year's draft, has led the receivers and is among the league leaders in multiple categories.

McMillan remains sidelined with a neck injury, which has forced the 10-year veteran Shepard alongside rookie seventh-rounder Tez Johson into action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/USAT/87346264007-2242274598.jpg?crop=5859,3296,x130,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-24 06:01:57.098471

They have been without Bucky Irving, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin for extended periods of time, but never Baker Mayfield. The engine that powers the Tampa offense, Mayfield has been one of the only things keeping Tampa's ship afloat.

That is potentially going to be put to the test on ""Sunday Night Football,"" as Mayfield entered and exited the blue medical tent in the first half. Now, the starting quarterback will be out for the remainder of the game, and potentially beyond, depending on the results of forthcoming tests.

Here's the latest on the Buccaneers quarterback:

Baker Mayfield injury update

Mayfield suffered a left (non-throwing) shoulder sprain in Week 12 and will receive an MRI on Nov. 24, according to head coach Todd Bowles.

Bowles added that Mayfield hurt the shoulder initially earlier in the game, but reaggravated it at the end of the first half.

""Teddy [Bridgewater] will play if he's out for some time, obviously we'll bring up Connor [Bazelak] from [the practice squad] and then we'll go from there,"" Bowles said. ""Very confident in what Teddy can do with a full week of practice, taking every snap and every play, we think he'll be fine.""

Mayfield was ruled out for the remainder of ""Sunday Night Football"" in Week 12. He was spotted on the sidelines with his left arm in a sling in the second half.

Teddy Bridgewater replaced Mayfield to begin the second half, who was listed as doubtful to return with a shoulder injury, the Buccaneers announced.

His discomfort was on full display at the end of the first half.

The quarterback heaved up a pass, hoping for a last-second score, but his pass was intercepted. While Emmanuel Forbes Jr. tried to run it back for a Rams' touchdown, Mayfield was down and in plenty of pain. He ultimately walked off, but the shoulder issue is clearly bothering him and will be something to watch in the second half.

Mayfield returned to the game and didn't miss a play for the Buccaneers' offense after the initial medical tent visit.

The team said that Mayfield was being evaluated for a left shoulder injury.

The passer was seen favoring his left arm and slammed his helmet down before entering the medical tent.

NBC's Melissa Stark also noted that the independent doctor was evaluating the hit to Mayfield's head, checking for a possible concussion.

Baker Mayfield

Teddy Bridgewater

The Bucs only carry two quarterbacks on their active roster, leaving the veteran Bridgewater as the backup. Mayfield's toughness is one of his best attributes, meaning there isn't normally much risk for the starter leaving the contest.

Whatever is ailing Mayfield, it's typically something he'll battle through in order to remain in the game.

Campbell was seen walking out of Paycor Stadium with a black brace covering his leg and knee.

The injury occurred on a 4-yard run to the left side, with Campbell pulling to that side and ultimately having his leg landed on at the end of the play. Patriots players kneeled around Campbell, who had a towel draped over his head as he was carted off.

He was officially ruled out in the fourth quarter, and coach Mike Vrabel didn't have an update on him after the game.

In addition to Campbell, starting left guard Jared Wilson was carted off with an ankle injury in the first quarter -- a second blow to a Patriots team that had mostly been fortunate health-wise up to this point in the season. Wilson was seen departing the stadium with a boot on his right foot and the aid of a crutch.

Players were hoping for the best on both injuries but acknowledged the situation looked ominous.

Asked what advice he might give to Campbell after recovering from a knee injury sustained last October, receiver Stefon Diggs said: ""I hope he's back. I hope it's not as bad as we think.""

Quarterback Drake Maye's emotion was evident when asked about Campbell and Wilson.

""Shoot, I love those guys,"" Maye said. ""They're going to be all right; I think that's the big thing about those guys -- they're going to work hard and be back. They've done such a good job for us this year. Will and Jared, they mean a lot to me. I've gotten to know them in different ways. It hurts. It's disappointing, man. That's this game. That's life. They'll bounce back and help us down the road.""

Veteran starting center Garrett Bradbury added, ""It's definitely the worst part of the game. There's a lot of experience in the O-line room, and there are things we can do, put our arms around them and get them right -- whether it's certain rehab things. Hopefully they lean on us. I know the [athletic] trainers are going to do a great job and get them back out there as soon as they can.""

New England started the same offensive linemen in 10 of its first 11 games, with Maye recently referring to the unit as the ""heartbeat of the team.""

Four-year veterans Vederian Lowe (tackle) and Ben Brown (guard) were the in-game replacements for Campbell and Wilson.

Campbell and Wilson were making history of sorts this season in New England. According to Elias and ESPN Research, since 2000, they were only the second rookie tandem to open a season as starters at left tackle and left guard (joining the 2016 Baltimore Ravens with Ronnie Stanley and Alex Lewis).

Those weren't the only injuries for the Patriots on Sunday.

All-Pro special teamer Brenden Schooler injured his ankle in the first half and was ruled out of the game. Also, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga -- who was bumped up to the starting lineup this week after Milton Williams landed on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain -- injured his chest in the game.

NFL Media's Tom Pelissero reports Rodgers has been pushing to play and can potentially play through the injury. However, there is concern that there may be further aggravation and/or damage to the left wrist should Rodgers play.

There is a possibility that the injury may require surgery if any further damage is done.

Howard was a sixth-round pick by the Steelers out of Ohio State. The rookie hasn't yet played a regular-season snap for the team but completed 73% of his passes for 4,010 yards, 35 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while leading the Buckeyes to a national championship in 2025.

The Steelers also have four-year veteran Skylar Thompson on their injured reserve list. He has a 1-2 career record and has completed 58.7% of his passes for 721 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions.

Packers stop Vikings in red zone on pair of short yardage plays

Emmett Prosser

The Vikings continue to put Mason to work, first with a carry of five yards and then he breaks loose for 22 yards and a first down at the Green Bay 38. Two more carries by Mason net 12 yards and another first down before he's replaced by Aaron Jones.

A fake to Jones and then a short throw from McCarthy to Josh Oliver picks up four and then Jones picks up five to set up third-and-1. A direct snap to T.J. Hockenson is stopped by the Packers, making it fourth-and-1, but the Packers stuff a fourth-down run, with Kingsley Enagbare leading the charge. The Packers take over on downs.

McCarthy can't find anyone open downfield and checks down to T.J. Hockenson short of the first down after a big hit from Isaiah McDuffie. After a 52-yard punt, the Packers will start deep in their own territory.

On second-and-6 from the 19, a short throw to Dontayvion Wicks gains 18 yards after a nice run after the catch and gives the Packers first-and -goal at the 1. Wilson is stopped initially but gets in after first contact and the Packers lead, 7-3, after the extra point by Brandon McManus.

Josh Jacobs inactive vs Vikings

Ryan Wood

With two NFC North games in five days, the second a pivotal matchup at Detroit on Thanksgiving, the Green Bay Packers are being cautious with running back Josh Jacobs.

The star tailback is inactive against the Minnesota Vikings. Jacobs left early in last week's game at the New York Giants with a bone bruise in his knee and a contusion on his thigh above his knee, and he was listed questionable on the injury report this week.

It's the first time since Jacobs signed as a free agent before last season that he will be inactive in a game. He had scored a touchdown in 18 of his past 19 games, including six straight, before that streak ended last week against the Giants. Now his touchdown drought will extend to two straight games.

Jacobs is dealing with tenderness in his knee, but he is expected to go through pre-game warmups before deciding whether he will play, according to ESPN and NFL Media.

Jacobs didn't suffer any structural damage in his knee, but he has been battling soreness. With another key divisional game against the Detroit Lions coming up on Thanksgiving, the team will have to make sure Jacobs is healthy for the home stretch of the regular season.

Earlier in the week, Jacobs was considered to be day-to-day. The veteran running back did not practice on Wednesday, but he got limited sessions in on Thursday and Friday. The Packers officially listed Jacobs as questionable on the final injury report of the week.

Green Bay has leaned on Jacobs in the running game all season, and he's turned 169 carries into 648 yards and 11 touchdowns. When Jacobs is going, it takes pressure off a passing attack that has dealt with some key injuries to its receivers and tight ends.

If Jacobs can't go against the Vikings, backup Emmanuel Wilson will get the call. A third-year player, Wilson posted 40 yards and a touchdown after Jacobs exited the game last week.

The Chiefs' offense continues to rank among the league-leaders in numerous categories, but their execution is critical moments must improve.
Even advanced metrics such as EPA, which stands for ""Expected Points Added,"" rank the Chiefs' offense as the second-best in the NFL.
Clearly, the opening drive of the second half has served as a tone-setter for the Chiefs' offense – for better or for worse.
The Colts' offense leads the NFL in numerous offensive categories, and it all begins with tailback Jonathan Taylor.","The Kansas City Chiefs will look to get back on track this weekend with a marquee showdown against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.

Here are some quick thoughts on the game.

1. Here's a look at the final injury report for both teams.

The Chiefs will be without tailback Isiah Pacheco (knee) on Sunday, marking his third game in a row away from the field. Pacheco returned to practice this week, however, and appears to be at least moving in the right direction.

Kansas City also listed offensive guard Kingsley Suamataia (concussion protocol) and wide receiver Xavier Worthy (ankle) as ""Questionable"" for the game.

As for the Colts, cornerback (and former Chief) Charvarius Ward is listed as ""Questionable"" for the game, although he appears set to make his return after missing the last several games due to concussion protocol.

Additionally, while he isn't carrying an injury designation, one thing that may be worth keeping an eye on is the status of quarterback Daniel Jones, who was limited in practice on Thursday due to a calf injury, but returned to log a full practice on Friday. Regardless, his ability to function will be something to watch.

It's also worth noting that Indianapolis will be without defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, who is currently on Injured Reserve due to a neck injury. Buckner ranks second on the Colts in total pressures (with 33), and his absence is significant.

2. The Chiefs' offense continues to rank among the league-leaders in numerous categories, but their execution is critical moments must improve.

Kansas City remains a top-10 offensive unit in terms of scoring offense (25.4), total offense (364.2), third-down conversion rate (41.3%), successful play rate (53.6%), passing yards (2,625) and total touchdowns (30) this year. Even advanced metrics such as EPA, which stands for ""Expected Points Added,"" rank the Chiefs' offense as the second-best in the NFL.

So, what's the issue? Well, a consistent theme in the Chiefs' five losses this season – all of which have been by one score, and three by just a field goal each – has been a lack of execution in critical moments and, as a result, too many missed opportunities.

The Chiefs had numerous chances to close out last week's game against Denver, for example. Kansas City had a pair of drives late in the fourth quarter – first with the lead, and later in a tie game – but punted on both possessions. It was a disappointing result, but it also demonstrates how thin the margin has been in these games. Kansas City has been right there in all of its losses, but moving forward – and beginning this week – the Chiefs have to find a way to execute in those critical moments.

Another area to watch – and one that's not quite as obvious – is the Chiefs' opening drive of the third quarter. Kansas City has found the end zone on its first drive of the second half in all five of its wins this season. Conversely, the Chiefs have scored just once (in the opener against the Chargers) to begin the third quarter in their five losses.

Clearly, the opening drive of the second half has served as a tone-setter for the Chiefs' offense – for better or for worse. A touchdown on the opening series of the third quarter this week would be a great sign for Kansas City's offense against Indianapolis.

3. The Colts' offense leads the NFL in numerous offensive categories, and it all begins with tailback Jonathan Taylor.

Indianapolis' offense, a year after ranking 17th in scoring, is maybe the surprise of the entire season thus far. In fact, the Colts – through 10 games – are up there with some of the greatest offenses in NFL history. Indianapolis leads the NFL in point differential (+115), scoring offense (32.1), total offense (396.9), yards-per-play (6.4), first downs-per-game (23.7), and three-and-out percentage (13.1%). The Colts are also averaging 3.2 points-per-drive, which is the best for any team since the 2007 New England Patriots.

That collective performance has been nothing short of remarkable, and at the core of the Colts' offensive success has been tailback Jonathan Taylor, who's putting together an MVP-caliber season.

Taylor leads the NFL in rushing yards (1,139) and rushing touchdowns (15) while ranking second in runs of double-digit yardage (28) and forced missed tackles (48). The number that really explains Taylor's season, however, is his ridiculous, league-leading 891 yards after contact. For context, only the Bills' James Cook has more total rushing yards than Taylor does just after contact this year.

It's easier said than done, but the path to a Chiefs' victory on Sunday begins with at least limiting Taylor's damage, and for what it's worth, it has been done before. In the Colts' two losses this season, Taylor was held to a combined 121 rushing yards and just 3.9 yards-per-carry. The Chiefs have generally been very good against opposing running backs this year, yielding just one 100-yard rusher all season, and they'll need to be at their absolute best on Sunday.

4. Creating pressure on Colts' quarterback Daniel Jones is critical.

If the first step to slowing down the Colts' historic offense is stopping Taylor, the second is creating pressure on Daniel Jones, who's in the midst of a terrific season.

Jones leads the NFL in passing yards-per-game (265.9), he's third in completion percentage (69.9%) and he's fourth in yards-per-attempt (8.34). The veteran passer has also been excellent on third down, ranking in the top 10 in completion percentage (2nd), passer rating (5th), passing yards-per-attempt (6th) and total first downs (7th) among all quarterbacks.

He also has weapons everywhere, notably in wide receiver Michael Pittman, wide receiver Alec Pierce and rookie tight end Tyler Warren. Those three form the only trio of teammates across the league with 550+ receiving yards each.

So, how can the Chiefs prevent Jones and the Colts' passing game from having another brilliant outing on Sunday? The answer is by creating pressure.

In Jones' four games this season in which he has faced a pressure rate under 30%, he's 4-0 with seven passing touchdowns and zero interceptions. In his six games facing a pressure rate of 30% or higher, however, he's 4-2 with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. Creating pressure is obviously key on Sunday.

Additionally, Jones – due in large part to pressure – has thrown four interceptions and committed six fumbles (three lost) over his last two games. A takeaway or two on Sunday could go a long way toward a Chiefs' victory.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chiefs/lffitysrhk3wytyox7qo,N,,2025-11-23 07:03:00.739963

“I got to the hospital, they said this was the best possible injury,” Skattebo said on YouTuber N3on’s show.

Skattebo, who had emerged as a fan favorite as a rookie this year, suffered a season-ending ankle injury during the Giants’ loss to the Eagles in Week 8.

He described the gruesome details on the show.

“I broke my fibula, the outside bone,” Skattebo said. “And I tore the ligament that goes from here [pointing to the top of his foot] to my ankle. And then, since the bone broke, a full dislocation of the ankle. It was like 90 degrees. There’s a tendon that holds your two bones together at the ankle, that also tore.

“So they put, it’s called a tightrope, they put it inside. They drill a hole in your bones and they put it in there and it holds your bones together. But it’s really hard to do again — that won’t tear.”

He also explained why his injury was better than a potential worst-case scenario.

“The worst is if the cartilage in your ankle is bad, that’s why it is a little bit longer [recovery],” Skattebo said.

Skattebo recorded 617 scrimmage yards and seven total touchdowns before his injury, helping briefly breathe life into the Giants’ season alongside rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart.

Skattebo has stayed busy while rehabbing, recently attending “Monday Night Raw” at Madison Square Garden and playfully participating in a skit with Dominik Mysterio.

Also in the show with N3on, Skattebo made a bold prediction for next season.

“Like, this year’s probably not going so well, but next year is gonna be pretty insane,” Skattebo said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-gsja7w7bv-1763839103702.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763821733&w=1200,N,,2025-11-23 07:03:10.848777

Edmunds sustained a groin injury late in Chicago's 19-17 win over the Minnesota Vikings on Nov. 16. Although he did not exit the game, the 27-year-old linebacker did not practice this week and was ruled out for the Bears' Week 12 game against the Steelers.

The injury is a significant blow to a unit that will also be without T.J. Edwards (hand/hamstring) and Noah Sewell (elbow) against Pittsburgh. Edmunds is eligible to return ahead of the Bears' second meeting with the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 20.

Edmunds is tied for the second-most interceptions in the NFL with four and was in the midst of a strong season that has been sparked by his switch from middle to weakside linebacker. Edmunds has a team-high nine passes defensed and leads the Bears in tackles with 89. The next-highest tackle total is Sewell's with 55.

Burrow will remain on injured reserve, and Joe Flacco will make his sixth straight start for the Bengals.

Burrow had been listed as questionable to return against the Patriots after he made significant progress from a turf toe injury that has sidelined him since Week 2. The two-time Pro Bowler was a full participant at Wednesday and Thursday practices before being limited Friday. Bengals coach Zac Taylor said Burrow did everything he could to put himself in a position to play, and Burrow told ESPN there were no setbacks through the week.

However, Taylor made the decision to hold Burrow out for at least an additional week. The Bengals have two games in five days, with a showdown against the Baltimore Ravens looming on Thanksgiving Day.

""You play a game Sunday, you play a game Thursday,"" Taylor told reporters Friday. ""Got to factor in all that stuff. He's tried to put himself in a position to be ready to go.""

Burrow has been aggressive in attempting to return from previous injuries. The most notable instance was his calf injury in 2023 that he played through at the start of the season and aggravated shortly afterward.

For Taylor, it was important to make a decision that is in Burrow's best interest.

""I have to take into account what's best for him,"" Taylor said. ""He's coming back off an injury. He's been out for a long time.

Horton, who on Friday was ruled out for Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans with a shin injury, has missed Seattle’s past two games. Those two absences came as Horton was also dealing with a groin injury.

Injury Report: Seattle Seahawks could be without 2 LBs vs Titans

Horton, a Colorado State product, has six total touchdowns in his first eight NFL games. He had 13 receptions for 161 yards and five touchdowns and added 238 yards and one touchdown on 16 punt returns.

The Seahawks also added some depth to their banged-up group of linebackers by elevating Patrick O’Connell and Jamie Sheriff from the practice squad for the matchup in Tennessee.

Seattle could be without two of its top three off-ball linebackers on Sunday. Backup Tyrice Knight was ruled out with a concussion on Friday, and starter Ernest Jones IV is questionable with a knee injury. Jones did not participate in practice on Friday.

O’Connell, a Montana product, has four tackles in two games this season. He’s played just eight defensive snaps and 33 on special teams, per Pro Football Reference. The 26-year-old linebacker has appeared in eight total games over three seasons since signing with Seattle as an undrafted free agent in 2023. He has seven total tackles over those contests.

Sheriff, a preseason standout in 2024, has yet to appear in a game this season. The South Alabama product played in two games last season, one with the Seahawks and one with the Carolina Panthers. He was an undrafted free agent signing by Seattle last season.

The Titans activated running back Kalel Mullings off injured reserve and elevated wide receiver Xavier Restrepo from the practice squad for Sunday’s game.

QB Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh | Wrist | Questionable | Projecting Active

Aaron Rodgers was unable to finish Week 11’s matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals due to a wrist injury. Early concern centered around the possibility of a fracture, and subsequent reports confirmed that Rodgers did, in fact, suffer one. However, the specifics of the injury suggest it’s not severe enough to automatically rule him out for Sunday.

Rodgers’ wrist fracture is on his left, non-throwing arm. Even so, injuries to a quarterback’s non-throwing hand can still lead to missed time due to ball-security concerns. Early indications suggest that Rodgers’ fracture is not located near the wrist joint or hand bones, as an injury in those areas would make gripping the football difficult, especially this soon after the incident. While I cannot confirm the exact location of the fracture, everything currently available points toward Rodgers being able to start in Week 12.

Rhamondre Stevenson has missed the last three weeks with a toe injury, but after practicing all week, including a full session on Friday, he appears on track to return on Sunday.

While Stevenson managers likely have another running back option, Treyveon Henderson managers are wondering how much work will remain for him. Historical data on toe injuries in NFL running backs is limited, but what we do know suggests players often need a ramp-up period before returning to their previous level of production.

Stevenson was averaging nearly 16 touches per game with a 67% snap share prior to the injury, but there is evidence that snap share can decline significantly in a player’s first game back from a toe issue. I expect Henderson to remain heavily involved, and I’d be cautious about starting Stevenson in his first week back.

RB Ken Walker III, Seattle | Glute | Questionable | Expected to Play

Ken Walker III was a late addition to the injury report this week after being limited on Friday with a glute injury. The team did not clarify whether it was a muscle strain or a more common glute contusion, though I lean toward the latter given that head coach Mike MacDonald told reporters on Friday that Walker “should be fine.”

I expect Walker to play and continue operating in a timeshare with Zach Charbonnet.

RB Josh Jacobs, Green Bay | Knee | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Jurgens entered the weekend listed as questionable but the Eagles on Saturday announced they removed that status. That means that Jurgens is good to go.

The only Eagles player who was ruled out was Lane Johnson (foot), who is expected to be out for about a month with a Lisfranc sprain, although it's notable he was not placed on IR Saturday. That seems to signal a potential return within four weeks.

The Eagles on Saturday also announced that WR DeVonta Smith is traveling separately from the team for personal reasons but has no game status. That means he is gong to play.

Jurgens returned to action last week after missing two games with a knee injury. But then he had to leave in the second half after suffering that concussion.

There is, though, a bigger part of me that is thrilled that the NFL’s concussion protocol is working and that Dart won’t be on the field taking hits until he is 100% ready to do so.

For years, even as concussions have become a bigger and bigger focus and the NFL has taken them more seriously, I have wondered how NFL players consistently get a concussion one week and magically clear the protocol by the following Friday and never miss a game.

This is a brain injury we’re talking about.

Brian Roberts — a baseball player for the Baltimore Orioles — suffered two concussions in seven months and missed more than a year after suffering the second one in 2011. Anthony Rizzo of the New York Yankees suffered a concussion in a May 2023 collision at first base. That went undiagnosed until the Yankees shut him down in September with post-concussion syndrome.

I have never understood how guys playing NFL football, playing perhaps the most violent sport of them all, return from these things in seven days or less.

Houston Texans’ quarterback C.J. Stroud has now missed three games with a concussion, after missing a pair of 2023 games after suffering one. Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins suffered three concussion in two years, spent considerable time on IR after the last one, and there are still many who fear for his long-term safety.

I’m fine with Dart missing this week. Maybe next week, too, if there are questions about his long-term well-being.

Mike Kafka’s audition impacted?

Dart being out of the lineup likely impacts the Giants ability to pull off an upset of the Detroit Lions on Sunday at Ford Field.

Put that aside for a minute, though. Does Dart’s absence for a second straight game hurt the Giants’ ability to determine if interim head coach Mike Kafka deserved the full-time job? If he succeeds with Jameis Winston at quarterback, could Dart’s absence actually help Kafka? Does it not make any difference since interim head coaches only earn the full-time job about 25% of the time?

Maybe it hurts because the decision about the next coach has to be largely about what is best for Dart’s development and the Giants’ ability to maximize his talent. Then again, Kafka has been working with Dart since he was drafted and the Giants should know what that relationship is like.

Maybe it helps. If Kafka can get decent offense out of a team without Dart, Malik Nabers, Cam Skattebo and sometimes Darius Slayton, what can he do with a full complement of players?

Maybe it doesn’t matter. Odds are heavily against Kafka earning the full-time job, regardless of who is or is not playing. If the Giants don’t win some games, Kafka won’t have a shot to keep the job.

RB3 incoming?

Giants fans have been clamoring for the team to add a running back to the 53-man roster. The Giants have been carrying just two backs since Cam Skattebo was injured, and also went with just two backs when Tyrone Tracy missed a pair of games with a shoulder injury.

Calls have been made again and again for Dante ‘Turbo’ Miller to be elevated from the practice squad.

Well, it looks like Giants fans are finally going to get a third running back. Just not the one they wanted. Eric Gray, on the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list all season with a knee injury, seems likely to be added to the roster on Saturday.

That will give the Giants protection at running back, but isn’t likely to excite anyone.

Lost in the news about Dart on Friday was the fact that a couple of the beat reporters who were at the practice facility on Friday mentioned seeing linebacker Micah McFadden in the locker room for the first time since he went on IR after a Week 1 foot injury.

Could McFadden play again this year?

Per Dan Duggan, McFadden admitted to a torn Lisfranc and is hopeful of being able to play before the season is over. That, though, does not mean it will happen.",https://platform.bigblueview.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/11/gettyimages-2245879360.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-11-23 07:03:48.718060

Dart was limited in practice on Wednesday and Thursday and but has yet to be cleared from protocol.

The rookie quarterback missed last week's loss to the Green Bay Packers after suffering a concussion in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears.

After taking a number of hits in his first NFL season and needing four concussion evaluations, the Ole Miss product has reportedly been told by people inside and outside the organization to be more careful when running with the ball and to better protect himself.

Dart has had an impressive start to his NFL career with the Giants. Through nine games, he has 1,417 passing yards with 10 touchdowns and three interceptions. He has also been productive on the ground, picking up 317 rushing yards and seven touchdowns — both are tops among rookies.

[NFL injury updates live]

A Joe Burrow return this week? Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor indicated on Friday that they will wait long as possible before deciding if the quarterback will play Sunday against the New England Patriots.

""Feel comfortable waiting as long as we can with this decision,"" Taylor said, via The Athletic's Paul Dehner.

Burrow, who had surgery on his toe on Sept. 19, is still on injured reserve and the team has until 4 p.m. on Saturday to move him to the active roster.

""He’s done everything he can. He looks great,"" Taylor said. ""You expect it to respond great when he’s out there and gets tackled, but you don’t know … and two games in five days, you have to account for that.""

Burrow has been listed as ""questionable.""

Other notable Week 12 injuries:

Aaron Rodgers is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Bears as he deals with a fractured left wrist. A day after head coach Mike Tomlin said that Rodgers would not need surgery, the veteran wore a brace as a limited participant in Thursday's practice.

Bucky Irving has not played since Week 4, but is ""trending up,"" according to Tampa head coach Todd Bowles. The running back has been out with foot and shoulder injuries, but did return to practice. Bowles said that Irving ""didn't handle"" being hurt for the first time in his NFL well and are eyeing Week 13 against the Cardinals as a potential return date.

The Houston Texans do not expect to have Joe Mixon available this season as he deals with a foot injury, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Mixon was placed on the reserve/non-football injury list in late August and has not played this season. The injury kept him out of offseason OTAs, minicamp and all of training camp.

Josh Jacobs says if he missed any time, it will not be more than one game. The Green Bay Packers running back suffered a knee injury during last week's win over the Giants and was back at practice on Thursday in a limited fashion after sitting out Wednesday. He's been dealing with swelling and stiffness in the knee. He is listed as ""questionable.""

Referee Adrian Hill had to be carted off the field following a non-contact injury in the third quarter of the Texans’ 23-19 win at NRG Stadium. Hill came up limping after a play and the game was stopped as medical staff looked him over before it was decided he would leave the contest.

The referee, who was leading the officiating crew on the night, was replaced by umpire Roy Ellison, eliminating the umpire position for the remainder of the game.

The rest of the evening was no less bruising, as the Texans’ vaunted defense – entering Thursday night No. 1 in scoring defense and total defense – lived up to its reputation by battering Bills QB Josh Allen and the rest of the Buffalo offense throughout the contest.

Allen – who was coming off an incredible six-touchdown performance on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – had a rough night, completing 24-of-34 passes for 253 yards with two interceptions and no touchdowns and also being sacked a career-worst eight times.

Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said, “Credit goes to, first and foremost, our defensive line. For the way they go out, the way those guys relentlessly rush the passer and everybody on the back end is playing sound and playing together.

“When we do that, we’re tough to move the ball against, so our players are doing an outstanding job.”

Texans safety Calen Bullock was the standout player on the night, forcing three turnovers – two picks and a forced fumble – including the game-sealing interception with 24 seconds left in the fourth quarter.

Explosive first half

The game started well for the Bills, with Buffalo taking an early 6-0 lead after James Cook cut through the middle of the Texans defense for an incredible 45-yard touchdown run.

The teams exchanged field goals before Houston – which was playing without starting quarterback CJ Stroud for the third straight game due to concussion protocol – got a boost from its backup signal-calle. Davis Mills threw a short, two-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Christian Kirk to put the Texans up 10-9 after the extra point.

Bullock then nabbed his first interception of the evening, running it back for an apparent touchdown, only for a flag to have been thrown on the play on defensive end Danielle Hunter for blocking in the back. Houston ultimately settled for another field goal to extend the lead, but Buffalo hit right back off an explosive special teams play.

Ray Davis caught the ensuing kickoff, clanging off a teammate and rolling to one side, before returning it 97 yards and front flipping into the end zone to put the Bills back on top with 1:43 left in the half.

The fireworks weren’t done yet in the Lone Star State as the Texans ran a two-minute drill to perfection, with Mills throwing his second touchdown of the day to Jayden Higgins to cap off a six-play, 75-yard drive to put Houston up 20-16 at the half.

Crunchtime heroics

The third quarter began slowly with neither team doing much before Bullock came up big again. The Houston safety forced a fumble from Bills wideout Khalil Shakir after he made a catch with 4:15 left in the quarter, leading to yet another field goal from Texans kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn to make it 23-16 in favor of the home team.

The Bills cut the lead to four after getting a field goal with 5:44 left in the game, and then came crunchtime.

With 49 seconds left, Allen threw a pass on fourth-and-27 to Josh Palmer who then lateraled it to Shakir to convert and get the Bills dangerously close to the red zone and make the Texans faithful begin to worry.

After a nine-yard run sandwiched between two incompletions, Buffalo was facing another fourth down with the game on the line and Allen lined up in a shotgun formation. The defending league MVP dropped back and threw off his back foot, but the ball was intercepted by Houston hero Bullock, who sealed the contest with his pick.

Afterwards, Texans coach Ryans expressed his relief at how the game ended, praising Bullock for his heroics: “Calen went out and intercepted the ball two times, forcing a fumble to get us in plus territory there.

“A lot of emotions going on on the sideline through that entire (final) drive, but for Calen to come down with that interception was my favorite play – because it meant it was over.”

“A dream come true showing up on a stage like Thursday night. We are the only team on, everybody watching, the whole world watching, so a dream come true,” Bullock – who received the game ball for his performance – told ESPN.

With the win, Houston moves to 6-5 on the season, third in the AFC South, while the Bills drop to 7-4 and second in the AFC East, where they are in danger of falling out of reach of the surprising New England Patriots.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247724980.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-22 06:58:52.770803

Giants’ injury designations Giants QB Jaxson Dart has not cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and has been RULED OUT for this game.","The Detroit Lions (6-4) and New York Giants (2-9) have declared their injury designations ahead of the Week 12 battle on Sunday afternoon at Ford Field. While the Lions will be missing a couple of starters in their secondary, the Giants will be without their quarterback—a significant blow for their chances on Sunday.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

G Miles Frazier (knee, still on PUP) — Days remaining in evaluation: 4

EDGE Josh Paschal (back, still on NFI) — Days remaining in evaluation: 4

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder, still on IR) — Days remaining in evaluation: 11

CB Terrion Arnold (concussion)

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Frazier is nearing the end of his injury evaluation window, but as we saw with Malcolm Rodriguez last week, he won’t be activated ahead of this Sunday’s game. The Lions have been working on cross-training him at guard and tackle, in the hopes that when he does return, he’ll be able to contribute as a reserve at multiple spots.

“We’ve really worked him at both spots. I mean, he’s doing some tackle for us, but then he’s kicking in at guard, too,” Campbell said on Friday. “So, right now, we’re just trying to get him—it’s kind of like, alright, well if he’s going to go, he’s got to be able to play multiple spots if something happens.[…] So, he’s kind of doing a little bit of everything right now.”

Paschal is also nearing the end of his injury evaluation window, but whenever Campbell is asked about which players are close to returning, Paschal’s name is not included. That could mean that the Lions plan on waiting to activate him as long as possible, and then, even once activated, he may need more time before being ready to contribute.

Davenport is “close” to returning to game action, per Campbell, but it won’t happen this weekend. The Lions are in no rush to make a decision on Davenport’s status, which may not happen until after Thanksgiving.

Arnold was not able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocol and will need to sit out another game. With a short week next week (the Lions play on Thanksgiving Day), there’s a chance Arnold may be pressed to clear protocols ahead of the Packers game as well.

Joseph’s chances of playing this weekend were “slim,” according to Lions coach Dan Campbell, but the coach insisted the All-Pro safety was making progress towards returning soon.

“Doing better. Doing a lot better, progressing. Progressing, progressing,” Campbell noted on Friday.

Questionable

RB Sione Vaki (ankle)

WR Isaac TeSlaa (oblique)

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

RG Tate Ratledge (knee)

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

CB D.J. Reed (hamstring, still on IR) — Days remaining in evaluation: 11

CB Khalil Dorsey (wrist) — Started evaluation clock — Days remaining in evaluation: 19

Vaki has been seen at practices this week working off to the side with trainers, suggesting he may need some additional time before he’s ready to fully contribute. That being said, only a small portion of practice is open to the media, and his involvement may increase behind closed doors.

TeSlaa was able to play through his injury last game, and while he was limited in practices, he appears to be on track to play again this Sunday.

Sewell was estimated to have not practiced on Wednesday but was back practicing on Thursday and Friday, suggesting he’s in a good spot to start against the Giants.

Decker didn’t practice on Friday, but that has become a common practice of late as he manages his lingering shoulder injury. At this time, he’s expected to start at left tackle, barring anything unforeseen.

Ratledge was injured in Week 11, but he’s practiced all week and appears to be in a good spot to start on Sunday.

Glasgow’s back injury is behind him, but a knee injury limited him this week. However, he’s been able to practice all week, and expectations are that he should be on track to start at center in this game.

Reed still has over 10 days remaining in his injury evaluation window, but when Campbell was asked if any of the players on the team’s injury list had a chance to play this week, the veteran corner was identified as someone who could pull it off.

“He looks good. He looks good. He looks like he’s back off the injury, he’s running around well,” Campbell said of Reed on Friday. “Certainly, any of that’s going to be the more he gets back on the field and just gets his feet back under him, it’s been a minute, but yet, he’s played a lot of ball too. And so, it’s not going to take very long. It really is like riding a bike. But happy to see him out there, and I know he’s ready to go.”

Dorsey just opened his injury evaluation window, so he’s not expected to be ready for activation after just two practices, but there remains a chance with a questionable designation.

Not listed with an injury designation

RB Jacob Saylors (back)

TE Brock Wright (ankle)

LB Malcolm Rodriguez (knee)

S Brian Branch (toe)

Saylors returned from injury last week and practiced in full all of this week, so he looks good to go for Sunday. Expect him to remain in a kick returner role moving forward.

Wright, who will likely be relied upon for TE1 duties for the remainder of the season, has practiced in full this week and doesn’t appear to be limited by his ankle injury.

Rodriguez was removed from the PUP list this week, and after another week of practice, the Lions are expecting him to return to game action this weekend.

“I feel pretty good about Malcolm going (in this game),” Campbell said on Friday.

Branch was estimated to have been unable to practice on Wednesday, but he returned to practice on Thursday and looks to be in a good position to start on Sunday with no injury designation.

Giants’ injury designations

Giants QB Jaxson Dart has not cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and has been RULED OUT for this game.

Here’s Campbell on the Giants turning to Jameis Winston for this game:

“I think the core of what they do, and the pro-style offense itself is not going to change. And I think even if Dart had played, there wasn’t going to be a ton of quarterback run, things of that nature. So, I think run game itself stays intact, I think the pass game – there is some vertical pass game to it. I don’t think it changes a ton. And look, I know Winston very well, man. This guy, he can put it on a dime. He’s not afraid to freaking rip it in there, he’s competitive, smart guy. And so look, he’s going to give him a chance. He’s played a lot of games, man, won a lot of games. But we’ve been prepared for both, we’ve made sure that we prepared just in case if you got a little different flavor with Dart. But we kind of felt like Winston was probably going to be the guy.”

Though the Bengals aren't ready to declare Burrow as their Week 12 starter, the franchise quarterback is officially questionable to play.
""We'll take the time we've got, assess all the practice we've had this week,"" coach Zac Taylor told reporters Friday, via ESPN's Ben Baby.

Though the Bengals aren't ready to declare Burrow as their Week 12 starter, the franchise quarterback is officially questionable to play.

""We'll take the time we've got, assess all the practice we've had this week,"" coach Zac Taylor told reporters Friday, via ESPN's Ben Baby. ""He's done everything he can to try to put himself and get ready to go. Now I have to make a decision on what we do.""

With the questionable designation, Cincinnati is preserving the chance of Burrow feeling good enough to take the field for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots without fully committing to it right now. The Bengals are comfortable with giving Burrow as much time as possible to ensure he's ready, and even if Cincinnati activates Burrow to the active roster by the 4 p.m. ET deadline on Saturday, it isn't a guarantee he'll play Sunday, Taylor explained.

Burrow has not seen live action since Week 2, a game in which he suffered a toe injury that required surgery and a lengthy journey back to the field. That process ended quicker than initially anticipated, with Cincinnati activating Burrow's 21-day return window on Nov. 10.

It seems he may not need the full 21 days to graduate to the active roster, a place the Bengals will happily (and desperately) welcome Burrow back to with their playoff hopes on life support as Thanksgiving nears.

Cincinnati has won just one game without Burrow in the starting lineup, a thrilling Week 7 triumph over the Pittsburgh Steelers in which 40-year-old Joe Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns in the 33-31 victory on Thursday Night Football. Otherwise, the Bengals are winless without Burrow, going 1-7 in the eight games played without him.

When he is activated, Burrow will return to familiar challenges. As they did in 2024, the Bengals have continued to fail defensively, losing two games in which they scored 35 or more points while allowing a league-worst 33.4 points per game in 2025.

Others also questionable are receivers Matthew Golden (shoulder/wrist), Savion Williams (foot) and Dontayvion Wicks (calf), and defensive linemen Karl Brooks (ankle) and Lukas Van Ness (foot).

Linebacker Quay Walker (neck) is doubtful while cornerback Nate Hobbs (knee) and receiver Jayden Reed (shoulder/foot) have been ruled out. The Packers opened Reed's 21-day window to return from injured reserve on Friday.

Jacobs left Sunday's game against the New York Giants after 12 plays due to a bone bruise and thigh contusion he suffered in the game. After returning to practice Thursday in a limited capacity, Jacobs told reporters he expects the ""worst-case scenario"" is he'll be back next Thursday against the Detroit Lions.

However, the Packers are giving him the full week before determining whether Jacobs could play against the Vikings, too.

""We're just gonna see what he can do,"" said Head Coach Matt LaFleur before Friday's practice. ""Just talking to him, he's feeling pretty good, so we'll see when we get out there.""

Van Ness has missed the past five games with the foot injury he suffered last month against the Cincinnati Bengals. LaFleur said the ""the goal"" is for him to play against Minnesota before adding ""we'll see how he gets through (practice) today.""

Brooks didn't practice on either Wednesday or Thursday before returning on Friday. Meanwhile, Williams didn't practice Friday after practicing on Thursday in limited fashion.

Walker didn't practice this week after leaving Sunday's game against New York with a stinger/neck issue. In Walker's absence, fifth-year veteran Isaiah McDuffie stepped up as the ""Mike"" linebacker responsible for relaying defensive play calls.

""Isaiah's played a lot of football for us and he's played a lot of different positions,"" LaFleur said. ""It does have a little bit of a compound effect in regards to – because we all see his value on and his worth, not only on the defense but on special teams as well.""

Quarterback Jordan Love (left shoulder) was a full participant in practice all week and will play Sunday against the Vikings.

Kicker Brandon McManus also practiced in full this week and will be available Sunday. He sat out against the Giants after being added to the injury report with a right quadriceps injury before the team traveled to New York on Saturday.

""Hopefully the rest has been good for him,"" said special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia on Thursday. ""He had a really good day (Wednesday). Probably the best day he's had in a while. We're excited for what (Friday) brings and hopefully should be ready for the game.""

In addition to Love and McManus, the Packers didn't issue a game status for the following players who'll be available Sunday: defensive lineman Micah Parsons (pectoral), safety Javon Bullard (ankle), linebacker Edgerrin Cooper (foot), receiver Romeo Doubs (wrist), cornerback Keisean Nixon (illness), cornerback Bo Melton (shoulder), tackle Zach Tom (back), receivers Christian Watson (knee) and guard Aaron Banks (veteran rest).

No one is going to boycott NFL games because officials are part-time employees, or because there’s no extra official to step in when one of the officials is injured.","Nearly every NFL game includes one or more injuries to players. Thursday night’s game saw referee Adrian Hill suffer a non-contact leg injury that ended his night.

And then everyone saw that the league has no viable backup plan for the unexpected departure of the chief of the officiating crew.

Oh, they have a plan. It’s not just viable. Umpire Roy Ellison was given the white hat and, eventually, a microphone. Ellison became both the umpire and the referee for the rest of the game.

Two important jobs in one, for a game with plenty of playoff implications. And with two eyes instead of four watching the action behind the line of scrimmage, Ellison missed an obvious illegal touching violation in the fourth quarter, when a desperation throw by a harassed Josh Allen clearly struck one of his lineman.

There may have been other issues far less obvious in real time. Holding fouls may have been missed. Illegal hands to the face, too. Hits to Allen that may have been roughing the passer, which falls squarely within the referee’s purview and not the umpire’s, may not have been spotted.

In the postseason, the NFL assigns five alternate officials to the wild-card round and divisional games. For the conference championships and Super Bowl, the eight-person crew has eight on-site alternates. For 272 regular-season games, an injury results in the crew shrinking by a member — and by someone else taking on the assignments of two officials.

At a time when the NFL absolutely should be implementing full-time officials, the absence of any alternates at regular-season games is jarring. With the proliferation of gambling, from which the NFL handsomely profits, some of the millions the league is making should be directed to having extra officials on site for every game that counts.

Ideally, each member of the crew would have an understudy. At a minimum, there should be one extra official who can step in if/when an injury happens.

It’s amazing it doesn’t happen more often. Artificial turf is unforgiving. The middle-aged-and-older officials are exerting themselves to keep up with the action. (And, at times, to scamper away from a trampling.) A torn Achilles tendon (which seems to be what happened to Hill) happens all the time to aging bodies — even when not trying to accelerate on cement covered by plastic grass.

Don’t expect the NFL to change anything, for one very important reason. The league views the entire officiating function as a cost that need not become more costly. In 2012, for example, the Commissioner justified a lockout of the officials by insisting that replacements would be just as effective. (Spoiler: They were not.)

But there’s no way to force the NFL to do it. No one is going to boycott NFL games because officials are part-time employees, or because there’s no extra official to step in when one of the officials is injured. Short of Congress insisting on a significant increase in the officiating budget as part of a broader look at the NFL’s safeguards for protecting the integrity of legal wagers, it will never happen.

Even if it should have happened years ago.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e453ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F523%2F315%2Fnbc_pft_refereeinjured_251121.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 06:59:41.234629

He was ruled out by head coach Raheem Morris for Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints.

Morris said the injury occurred Friday morning during the team's walk through and that the injury was ""not good"" in the moment. He didn't have any more information beyond that on Bowman's status as he continues to receive medical evaluations.

Dee Alford cleared concussion protocol so he is slated to start at nickel. Mike Hughes also returns to the starting lineup after missing the last two games with a neck injury.

Bowman joins players like receiver Drake London and defensive lineman Zach Harrison in the group officially ruled out of Sunday's game. Both London and Harrison have knee injuries. London is considered ""week-to-week"" with a PCL sprain, whereas Morris said Harrison ""will have to get it fixed,"" referring to Harrison's knee injury.

And even though Lindstrom has been on the team's injury report for weeks, he has suited up for every game this year, working through a foot injury on the fly.

Likely the only good news the Falcons could really report Friday was about inside linebacker Divine Deablo, who was listed as questionable and not officially ruled out. He has been a full participant in the last two Falcons' practices. Deablo was not originally given a game designation. His status was updated to questionable shortly thereafter because players in the 21-day injured reserve return window have to be listed that way until they're activated to the 53-man roster. Given Morris' comments Friday, though, one could speculate that activation is coming sooner rather than later.

Amorim referenced the progress of the Argentina international when asked at Friday’s pre-match news conference whether he would be capable of playing in midfield on his return.
“He’s a smart, intelligent football player (who) can play in a lot of positions but it is not the right position for him,” Amorim said.
Amorim, meanwhile, said Benjamin Sesko would be out for “a few weeks” after he sustained a knee injury during the draw with Tottenham Hotspur on November 8.

The 27-year-old has returned to full training ahead of Monday’s Premier League fixture against Everton, having not played for United since he was stretchered off the pitch during the defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on February 2.

Amorim referenced the progress of the Argentina international when asked at Friday’s pre-match news conference whether he would be capable of playing in midfield on his return.

“He’s a smart, intelligent football player (who) can play in a lot of positions but it is not the right position for him,” Amorim said. “He needs more time to work there and he is not working there, in an emergency he can play but I am not thinking about that.

“I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.”

Having signed for the club under his former head coach at Ajax, Erik ten Hag, Martinez featured regularly following Amorim’s arrival in November 2024, starting all but one of the matches in which he was available during the three-month period before his injury. He captained United in December’s defeat by Newcastle.

Amorim, meanwhile, said Benjamin Sesko would be out for “a few weeks” after he sustained a knee injury during the draw with Tottenham Hotspur on November 8. The Athletic reported on November 17 that the forward, who missed international duty for Slovenia, is expected to be sidelined for between three and five weeks.

“I don’t know how long but it is not that serious we have to be careful with him,” Amorim said. “He is going to recover. He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back.

“I think it is going to be more or less he will be back at the same time as Amad and (Bryan) Mbeumo leave for AFCON. I don’t want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.”

Amorim also said Harry Maguire “is not ready” for Monday’s match against Everton, and that Kobbie Mainoo has not trained.

“I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see,” he added.

Jameis Winston will make his second straight start with Dart out, with Russell Wilson serving as the backup.

""[Dart's] just in the protocol. He's working through that phasing of it,"" Kafka said. ""Based on the testing and the results, we're declaring him out for this week.""

There was hope throughout the week that Dart could be ready for Sunday. He was a limited participant in all three practices, including Friday, and the Giants (2-9) say they liked what they saw from the quarterback.

""Jaxson looked like his normal self,"" Kafka said. ""He looked great.""

Sitting out provides Dart, who has been checked for a concussion four times in his past eight games, extra time to get back to full health. The Giants' next game is Dec. 1 against the New England Patriots on ""Monday Night Football.""

""My only concern was just making sure Jaxson's healthy and right,"" Kafka said. ""And again, we have a lot of trust in the doctors. We have a lot of trust in that process, going through the concussion process. I know myself, I've had a couple concussions over the course of my career, and you just want to feel comfortable and good.

""So I think having that trust and understand that everyone's just looking out for your best interest is important, and we are certainly doing that with Jaxson and wherever he ends up getting to in this concussion protocol, which is again is very vague term that again, as a coach, I'm not a medical professional, so I'm not going to speak on the process. But I trust it.""

Dart took some first-team reps earlier in the week, an indication he was preparing to play.

Winston said Friday that he ""just found out"" he would be starting. It didn't shake him.

""I believe I'm ready regardless, whatever this team needs me to do, I'm ready to do it,"" Winston said. ""Regardless if he says, 'Hey, Jameis, you're going to be No. 2 [QB], you're going to be No. 3,' I'm ready. I'm preparing.""

Dart left the Giants' game against the Chicago Bears on Nov. 9 after taking a hit to the head. He then missed last week's loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Significant attention has been paid to his and the Giants' approach with him running. Dart is averaging 3.4 designed rushes per game, behind only Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts and the Jets' Justin Fields. But that has been an asset for the team. Dart has rushed for 317 yards and seven touchdowns while averaging 5.6 yards per carry.

Winston was 19-of-29 for 201 passing yards with a rushing touchdown and an interception in the 27-20 loss to the Packers.
