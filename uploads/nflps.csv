The Buccaneers also listed Mayfield with an undisclosed knee injury. Mayfield suffered an injury to his left shoulder in a Week 12 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He left that game early, but has played in each game since and hasn't been listed with the injury in recent weeks.

The listed injuries to his throwing shoulder and knee on Tuesday were new. Mayfield was listed as a limited participant on an estimated practice report as the Buccaneers conducted a walk-through.

Further details including the nature of the injuries or when Mayfield sustained them were not clear. The Bucs didn't initially provide more information about the injuries other than listing him as limited at practice.

How will injury impact Saturday's Panthers-Bucs game?

There's no indication the injuries threaten Mayfield's status for Saturday's game against the Panthers. But they're cause for further concern around a Bucs team that's floundered in the second half of the season and enters Week 18 having lost seven of its last eight games to surrender control of the NFC South.

Mayfield's play has suffered alongside that of his team. Mayfield posted four games with a quarterback rating higher than 100 as the Bucs got off to a 6-3 start. He's not eclipsed that number since Week 10 and has four games in that time frame with a rating below 80.

Now he's dealing with new injuries ahead of Tampa Bay's biggest game of the season. The Panthers would clinch the NFC South and the division's only playoff berth with a win by securing the best record at 9-8.

The Bucs would stay alive for the division title with a win, but also need the New Orleans Saints to beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. If the Bucs and Falcons win this week, the Panthers would own the three-way tiebreaker with Carolina, Atlanta and Tampa Bay all finishing at 8-9.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/85kWTERAkRaXwZWU3HRgLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/b66779e0-e5c8-11f0-bdfb-077cc2819ee1,N,,2025-12-30 23:59:15.082192

Seahawks injury report

Left tackle Charles Cross (hamstring) and veteran swing tackle Josh Jones (ankle, knee) were listed as non-participants on Tuesday’s practice report, while safety Coby Bryant (knee) and wide receiver/kick returner Rashid Shaheed (concussion) were listed as limited participants.

The Seahawks held a walkthrough practice, so their report was an estimation of what players would have done in a full practice.

Cross, who has missed the past two games, has yet to practice since getting injured in the final minute of Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Indianapolis Colts. Jones, who has started at left tackle in place of Cross for the past two games, is a new addition to the injury report.

Bryant’s limited designation is a positive step. He didn’t practice last week and missed Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers after getting injured in Seattle’s Week 16 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams.

Shaheed is in the NFL’s concussion protocol after sustaining a concussion in Sunday’s game.

Star running back Christian McCaffrey (back) and 12-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) were both listed as non-participants on San Francisco’s practice report.

Williams suffered a hamstring injury in the 49ers’ win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday night, while McCaffrey is dealing with back stiffness, according to San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan.

Fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip) and defensive end Keion White (groin) also sat out Tuesday’s practice.

Meanwhile, seven-time Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle (ankle) returned to practice as a limited participant. He missed Sunday’s game against the Bears after getting injured in the 49ers’ Week 16 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle), defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) and cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) also were limited participants.

Rice picked up a knee injury in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion after starting the game at right-back.
“That swelling (on his knee) has to come right down for him to have the chance to function.
“Big Gabi comes back from injury after six weeks, which probably should have been a bit longer,” he said in his post-match press conference.
“And he impacts the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”","Mikel Arteta has revealed that Declan Rice is “improving” and could be in contention to make his return for Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Bournemouth.

Rice picked up a knee injury in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion after starting the game at right-back. He was able to play on and finish the game, and was hopeful of being fit to play a part in Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Aston Villa but was left out of the squad entirely for the 4-1 victory at Emirates Stadium.

The injury is not thought to be too serious, and when asked if the England international had a chance of coming back into the Arsenal squad for their trip to the Vitality Stadium on January 3 Arteta responded: “It depends.

“That swelling (on his knee) has to come right down for him to have the chance to function. He wasn’t available to do that today yet. He’s improving. Let’s see where he is in the next couple of days.”

While there are concerns over Rice, there was at least some positive news for Arteta who was able to welcome Kai Havertz and Ben White to the squad back for the Villa game.

Gabriel also returned to the starting XI after a lengthy spell out with a thigh injury to nod home the opening goal of the match, prompting praise from Arteta.

“Big Gabi comes back from injury after six weeks, which probably should have been a bit longer,” he said in his post-match press conference. “He comes against the team that is probably hardest to control — especially the front players and the striker that they have in terms of their movement.

“And he impacts the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/30180537/GettyImages-2252877314-scaled-e1767136085494.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 23:59:22.044839

Detroit entered the game with only eight giveaways as an offense all season, which was the fewest in the NFL.
That's why this season hasn't buried my belief in O'Connell, and I am still willing to envision a scenario where J.J. McCarthy starts putting it together next year.
The Vikings are 8-8 despite a team passer rating of 74.3, which ranks 31st in the NFL.
The question will be how to get that upgrade at QB, whether it's from J.J. McCarthy or elsewhere.","Smith – who will turn 37 in just under five weeks – delivered another vintage performance in Purple (or in this case, Winter Whiteout) against the Detroit Lions on Christmas Day at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings safety nabbed his 39th career interception to go along with a sack (No. 21.5 of his 14-year career), a pair of tackles for a loss and a trio of passes defensed. He also made his 202nd career regular-season start, moving ""The Hitman"" past Pro Football Hall of Famer and Vikings Ring of Honor member Carl Eller for third in franchise history.

With their savvy defensive veteran leading the way, the Vikings (8-8) dominated Detroit (8-8), forcing six takeaways and sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff five times in a 23-10 rout. Detroit entered the game with only eight giveaways as an offense all season, which was the fewest in the NFL. According to Next Gen Stats, the Vikings also held the Lions to a season-low offensive success rate of 29.7 percent. Detroit's previous low in the category was 33.9 percent, which also came against Minnesota in Week 9.

Thursday was the 34th time in franchise history Minnesota has recorded at least six takeaways in a game and its first since Week 15 of the 2019 season (the Vikings forced seven turnovers at the Chargers in a 39-10 victory). Of those 34 instances, seven have come against the Lions, which is the most against any opponent. Minnesota is 25-7-2 all time when tallying six or more takeaways in a game and has won 21 consecutive games when doing so going back to the 1973 NFC Championship Game at Dallas.

The game also marked just the second time ever the Vikings have won the turnover battle 6-0 or better. The only other occurrence was in Week 8 of the 1975 season when Minnesota forced eight Atlanta turnovers and didn't turn the ball over in a 38-0 shutout victory.

Additionally, the win gave Minnesota its first season sweep of Detroit since 2020. Last year, the Vikings swept Green Bay in the regular season for the first time since 2017; coincidentally, Minnesota not only accomplished both feats in Week 17 home victories, it also occurred in the 50th regular-season game for Head Coach Kevin O'Connell (last year) and Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores (Thursday) in their coaching roles with the Vikings.

I know Kevin O'Connell can coach. He has logged 13- and 14-win seasons, somehow kept his 2023 team competitive with a mishmash of quarterbacks and essentially has done the same in 2025 with significant shortcomings at the game's most important position. Winning a divisional bout with 3 net passing yards is something I'd brag about at parties. At 8-8, the Vikings can finish a trying season with a winning record by beating Green Bay at home – and the Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed, meaning they'll likely rest players on Sunday. That's why this season hasn't buried my belief in O'Connell, and I am still willing to envision a scenario where J.J. McCarthy starts putting it together next year. We'll see if another team tries to poach Brian Flores for a head-coaching opening, and Harrison Smith could retire, but I suspect this is still a team that can compete in 2026.

WR Justin Jefferson's 59.2 receiving yards per game are, by far, the fewest of his career − through no fault of his own. But hit that average in Week 18, and he'd join Mike Evans and Randy Moss as the only players to top 1,000 in each of his first six seasons.

Minnesota has won four in a row, restoring the can't-miss-kid status to Kevin O'Connell that had started to wane after a 4-8 start that saw the Vikings eliminated from the playoffs. Still, O'Connell has ultimately tied his fate to that of quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who missed Thursday's game with a hand injury and has only started nine games in two years. The results have been mixed (5-4 with an EPA that ranks 52nd among quarterbacks with more than 100 pass attempts in the last two years).

Last season, the Colts won eight games despite a team passer rating of 75.8, which was 31st in the NFL. They got better quarterback play in 2025 and were 7-1 before a losing streak and injuries derailed them. The Vikings are 8-8 despite a team passer rating of 74.3, which ranks 31st in the NFL. The Vikings are clearly good enough to be a playoff team in 2026 with decent quarterback play. The question will be how to get that upgrade at QB, whether it's from J.J. McCarthy or elsewhere.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/ituebbn5gog8lzndxquw,N,,2025-12-31 01:57:57.019786

That was the day general manager Omar Khan traded receiver Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers. While it was a necessary move to shake up some locker-room dynamics and part with a challenging personality, the other shoe never dropped. Khan never added another proven receiver to round out that room. During the subsequent season, the depth chart at the position looked like George Pickens … a huge gap … and then everyone else.

Many wondered who would fill the void at WR2. The real concern, though, was what happens if Pickens gets hurt?

That worst-case scenario came to fruition at the worst time, when Pickens pulled his hamstring that December. His ensuing absence coincided directly with the Steelers’ late-season tailspin. Pickens missed a Week 15 loss in Philadelphia and a Week 16 game in Baltimore, when the Steelers had a chance to clinch the AFC North. Even after Pickens returned, the Steelers never recovered.

Rather than learn from history, Khan and the Steelers repeated it. This offseason, the Steelers reshuffled their deck. They acquired DK Metcalf in a blockbuster trade and then, shortly after, dealt Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys. The receiver room looked different, sure, but the dynamic was awfully familiar. Pittsburgh had one star receiver at the top of the depth chart … a big gap … and then a lot of question marks.

At least that’s how most people who follow the Steelers saw it. Well, everyone except the person most responsible for putting the team together.

“We wouldn’t have done this if we didn’t feel good about the receiver situation (and) about our depth there,” Khan said shortly after trading Pickens. “I know people make a comparison about last year. It’s not even close to being the same.”

What’s the difference?

“Well, obviously, we made the investment with DK,” Khan said. “We’ve had another year with some of the young guys and gotten to know them and watch them develop. We added Robert Woods. Roman (Wilson’s) healthy.”

The fact that Woods was part of Khan’s answer tells you everything you need to know about how the Steelers have evaluated the wide receiver position.

Woods, if you even remember his Steelers tenure, was cut at the end of training camp and spent a week on the practice squad before being released. No offense to Woods, who he put together a solid 12-year career, but the fact that a 33-year-old in his 13th season was supposed to help provide depth at a critical position is almost laughable. None of the other 31 teams were willing to take the same gamble, as Woods’ career effectively ended when he was released.

At the same time, the “young guys” Khan mentioned — Calvin Austin III and Roman Wilson — have failed to take the anticipated step forward.

Austin looked like he was on a positive trajectory in 2024, when he caught 36 passes for 548 yards and four touchdowns. His production should have improved significantly this year, given that he was handed the WR2 role in camp. Instead, the 5-9, 162-pound receiver endured an oblique injury in camp that prevented him from developing chemistry with Rodgers, suffered a shoulder injury in Dublin in Week 4 that kept him out a month and now is recovering from a hamstring injury. For those who doubt Austin can thrive in the NFL at his size, his injury-marred season has done little to quell those concerns.

Even when he’s been healthy, Austin has been out of synch with Rodgers, especially on out routes that require timing near the sideline. How many times have we seen Rodgers barking at Austin after he’s failed to keep his feet in bounds? Austin enters Week 18 with 10 fewer targets, eight fewer receptions, 231 fewer receiving yards, two fewer touchdowns and four fewer games played than in 2024. Instead of taking a step forward, he’s regressed.

Wilson’s season has been even more disappointing. After a slow start, the 2024 third-round pick looked like he was beginning to earn Rodgers’ trust in the middle of the season. In Week 8, he caught four passes for 74 yards and a touchdown against the Packers. However, rather than building momentum, Wilson eventually slid down the depth chart and off the game-day roster entirely. He was a healthy scratch in three consecutive games, beginning with Week 14 in Baltimore. Active for the first time in a month on Sunday in Cleveland, Wilson played just nine offensive snaps and wasn’t targeted at all.

The lack of development and chemistry from those two would have been concerning on its own. It’s even more of a problem now that Metcalf has been suspended for the final two games of the season over an altercation with a Lions fan at Ford Field in Week 16.

It’s the same nightmare scenario that unfolded last year. A team that never answered its question at WR2 now has to fill Metcalf’s 6-foot-4, 230-pound void. To make matters worse, Austin missed Sunday’s loss in Cleveland with his third injury of the year.

Recognizing their need to upgrade, the Steelers have tried to remake their receiver room on the fly. They brought in a 31-year-old Marquez Valdes-Scantling and claimed 35-year-old Adam Thielen off waivers. Both players have put together careers worthy of respect and seem to be handling themselves like professionals. If either was WR3 or WR4, that would be reasonable, but when the Steelers trotted out this tandem in a pivotal Week 17 game as the top two receiving threats, that’s simply not a recipe for success.

The only way for things to get better this season is for the Steelers to beat the Ravens in Week 18, qualify for the playoffs and get Metcalf back for the postseason. That’s easier said than done, especially against the Ravens.

In the first meeting, the Ravens often dared the Steelers to throw it deep by challenging them with press-man and single-high coverages. Rodgers, who hadn’t hit a deep ball in weeks prior to that meeting, aired it out for four completions with 20-plus air yards. Yet with Metcalf suspended and Austin’s status uncertain, the Ravens would be wise to deploy a similar tactic.

If they do, and the Steelers’ undermanned receiving corps is unable to make plays, the Ravens would take control of the AFC North. Just like last year.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/29214148/USATSI_27894982-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-31 00:58:02.293066

Here's the full first practice report for Week 18.","The San Francisco 49ers are once again dealing with new injury issues entering their vital Week 18 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks.

In a bit of good news, tight end George Kittle was back in practice after missing all three sessions before Week 17 and then missing the game. He's dealing with an ankle injury he suffered back in Week 16. The 49ers listed him as questionable for the game, but head coach Kyle Shanahan indicated Kittle was never able to test out the injury. His limited participation in practice would typically be a sign that injury is trending in the right direction, but Shanahan tamped down on the optimism.

""I wouldn’t assume that,"" Shanahan said when asked if Kittle's return was a sign of his improvement. ""We're barely moving today. It's a walk-through with the short week that we’ve got, so we won't be doing much all week.""

Beyond that, a trio of key starters were on the sidelines for the session including Trent Williams, Christian McCaffrey and Kyle Juszczyk.

There's a chance the 49ers are simply being cautious on a short week and they're not going to rush veterans into action. Tuesday's practice was the first of three for the week, so Wednesday and Thursday will give us a better idea of which direction those players are trending going into Saturday.

In eight games played this season, Diggs recorded 25 tackles with zero pass defensed and zero interceptions.
While Diggs said he felt good enough to play, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer plus team owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt differently.","The Dallas Cowboys announced Tuesday that they are releasing cornerback Trevon Diggs. The veteran defensive back is subject to waivers. If he passes through waivers, he will be free to sign with any team.

Any club that claims Diggs becomes responsible for the $472,000 he is due in base salary for Week 18, and $58,823 if he is active this week, per ESPN. Diggs signed a five-year, $97 million extension with Dallas prior to the 2023 season, in which he tore his ACL. While he is technically signed through 2028, there is no more guaranteed money remaining on his deal after this year.

Diggs' release was ""a cumulation of multiple factors both on and off the field,"" CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported. Clarence Hill Jr. of the DLLS Sports reported that Diggs requested to stay in the Washington, D.C. area after the Cowboys' Week 17 game against the Washington Commanders. The team denied the request, but Diggs, who is from the area, stayed back anyway.

""It is extremely unusual for teams to allow someone to not travel back when a hardship isn't involved,"" Jones noted.

Diggs played in the first six games of the season before an accident in his home landed him in concussion protocol. Dallas placed him on injured reserve after re-aggravating a knee injury, but he returned to the lineup in Week 16. In eight games played this season, Diggs recorded 25 tackles with zero pass defensed and zero interceptions.

It appeared Diggs and the Cowboys were headed for divorce earlier this month when the two sides disagreed over whether the cornerback should be activated off injured reserve or not. Diggs said he was healthy enough to play vs. the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15, but was not allowed to do so.

""Going into the week, that was the plan, for me to play. I was included in the game plan to play, and [Saturday] I was told I wasn't playing, so that's why I thought I was playing,"" Diggs said, via CBS Sports' Garrett Podell. ""It was a quick decision. I thought I was going to come out here and play, but they felt otherwise. That's just what it was.""

While Diggs said he felt good enough to play, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer plus team owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt differently.

""Diggs isn't healthy enough to be out there for us. Period,"" Jones said following the loss to the Vikings. ""You have to look at practices and if they practice good enough. Whether it's a limitation they've had in recent games or a long-term injury, you've got to make your mind up when you see him practice. When we looked at practice, we didn't like what we saw relative to his health and ability to make plays.""

Ultimately, Diggs was activated for the Week 16 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers, and then played 100% of the defensive snaps during the Christmas victory over the Washington Commanders. However, Diggs is now being allowed a change of scenery.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/30/ae63f822-aff2-4afd-9818-8f24bc5f1b2e/thumbnail/1200x675/94cf6df97649d911dec869b800188e5d/trevon.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 01:58:11.334785

With only one week of regular season games left, every bit of news is all the more consequential as we inch closer to the playoffs and Super Bowl LX.

Who's hurt? Who's practicing? Who's starting? And who's on the hot seat? Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 18:

49ers' stars miss Tuesday's practice

Running back Christian McCaffrey and offensive tackle Trent Williams missed the San Francisco 49ers' Tuesday practice, according to head coach Kyle Shanahan. Both McCaffrey (back) and Williams (hamstring) sustained injuries during the 49ers game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday night. Williams, who got hurt on the first series of the game, has a more severe injury and may miss some time. The 49ers have a short week, hosting the Seattle Seahawks in a game that will decide the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the conference.

Colts starting QB Riley Leonard

After starting 44-year-old Philip Rivers for three consecutive weeks in place of the injured Daniel Jones, Indianapolis, which is eliminated from playoff contention, will start the rookie Leonard at quarterback in its road tilt against the Houston Texans, per ESPN. Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve. In the four appearances he has made this season, Leonard has thrown two interceptions, recorded a 40.6 passer rating and completed 54.5% of his passes, while rushing for one score. The Colts have lost six consecutive games after beginning the season 8-2.

Bills QB Josh Allen expected to sit out Week 18

A little battered and visibly frustrated, Allen can use a rest, and he's expected to get one Sunday in what’s essentially a meaningless regular-season finale against the Jets. Aside from taking the opening snap to extend his streak of consecutive regular-season starts to 122, the longest active run among NFL quarterbacks, Allen is expected to watch the rest of the game from the sideline.

It's likely to be Allen's final game at the Bills' 52-year-old stadium, affectionately called ""The Ralph"" in honor of the late franchise founder and Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson. Next season, the Bills are set to relocate across the street to a new $2.1 billion home, already dubbed ""The Stadium Allen Built.""

More important, Allen will get an opportunity to allow his sore right foot time to heal before Buffalo opens the playoffs on the road in two weeks. Allen also certainly could use a mental break during a season in which he’s been relied upon to carry the offensive load too often. Competitive and remarkable as he’s been in combining for 39 touchdowns (25 passing, 14 rushing) and engineering four fourth-quarter comebacks, even Allen has limitations, which became readily apparent in a 13-12 loss to the Eagles on Sunday.

Chargers QB Justin Herbert will miss regular-season finale

Head coach Jim Harbaugh announced Monday that Herbert will not start for the AFC's No. 6 seed in Week 18 against the Broncos. Barring an unforeseen change, Herbert will finish his sixth NFL season with 3,727 yards, 26 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Backup Trey Lance will take over for the finale, allowing Herbert to enjoy some additional rest (particularly for his broken left hand) heading into the postseason.

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown considered day-to-day

The Lions may finish the 2025 season without their star receiver. Head coach Dan Campbell announced Monday that St. Brown is ""day-to-day."" He appeared to suffer the injury late in the Week 17 loss to the Vikings. With the Lions eliminated from playoff contention, it's possible St. Brown sits out of the season finale, ending his fourth straight Pro Bowl season with 106 receptions for 1,262 yards and 11 touchdowns.

The timing couldn’t be much better San Francisco, which is heading into critical Week 18 win-it-all game against the Seattle Seahawks facing the possibility of being without all-world left tackle Trent Williams.

The 28-year-old Pleasants gave the 49ers Faithful a glimpse of what he’s capable of during the team's 42-38 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday at Levi's Stadium. Williams sustained a hamstring injury on the first play from scrimmage and did not return, leaving the blind-side protection for quarterback Brock Purdy in the hands of a player who is the complete definition of journeyman.

“There's definitely a lot of things to clean up as far as the angles of some of my sets, and just stay staying on blocks a little bit longer,” Pleasants said of his performance in the win. “Just little things. The good thing is it's all stuff that I can control.

“For the most part it really came down to the preparation throughout the whole year. I felt ready. I felt comfortable. There's obviously a little bit of butterflies, like when you first step in, but after that first drive I felt really comfortable and good.”

It definitely showed.

Pleasants played 71 snaps while helping anchor an offensive line that paved the way for 42 points and nearly 500 yards of offense.

San Francisco 49ers

“He played a great game,” said left guard Spencer Burford, who was San Francisco’s swing tackle and Williams' backup before being moved inside due to other offensive-line injuries. “He just fell back on his training, everything that he does in practice, everything that he's been practicing all year.

“It's a standard that we hold ourselves to, really as a unit, just making sure that you try to plug and plug and play. We work together in practice, just building that chemistry there, just feeding off each other, making sure that we communicate. That's the biggest deal.”

Williams has not been ruled out for Saturday’s game at Levi’s Stadium. Coach Kyle Shanahan hinted Tuesday that there was a chance the All-Pro left tackle would be available, but in all likelihood Pleasants will make his first NFL start in the 49ers' biggest game of the 2025 season thus far.

It’s a long way, physically and mentally, from the path that Pleasants traveled to get to this point.

“I’ve bounced around a lot, so it's kind of validation for all the days that I thought this could be it and just persevering anyway,” Pleasants said. “I'm going to keep my head. There were definitely those moments that I felt [like quitting], but I know God's always got my back.

Diggs, 27, will now be subject to waiver. If he clears, he'll become a free agent and can sign with any team seeking cornerback depth ahead of the playoffs.

The release of Diggs marks the end of his six seasons in Dallas, which featured a mixture of ups and downs.

Let's take a look back at the timeline of Diggs' career with the Cowboys:

Cowboys draft Trevon Diggs in 2nd round of 2020 NFL Draft

After winning an All-SEC first-team season at Alabama in 2019, the Cowboys selected Trevon Diggs with the 51st overall pick in the second round of the NFL Draft. At 6'1, 205 with 32 ¾ in. arms, Diggs fit the bill of the taller, long armed corners that Dallas has preferred from a measurables standpoint.

Diggs was the eighth CB drafted in 2020, and joined a room in Dallas that had just lost Byron Jones in free agency to the Miami Dolphins. Now, the room was made of players like Diggs, Jourdan Lewis, Anthony Brown and Chidobe Awuzie.

Diggs' rookie season in 2020

Diggs earned a starting role for the Cowboys right off the bat, tallying three tackles in his first career start and game against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 1.

From there, Diggs would go on to continue his strong season until Week 9, where he left Dallas' game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth quarter with a foot injury. It was later discovered that he had a fractured foot, and the Cowboys placed him on injured reserve.

After missing four games, Diggs returned to the lineup and closed out his rookie season strong, finishing as the team leader in pass breakups (14) and interceptions (3) while also tallying 58 total tackles.

A record-breaking sophomore season

In Diggs' sophomore NFL season, he exploded onto the scene and leapt into the upper echelon of cornerback play in the NFL. Diggs started in 16 games for the Cowboys, tallying 52 total tackles and 21 pass breakups.

He also led the NFL in interceptions with 11, the most a player has ever had in a single season since Cowboys CB Everson Walls accomplished the feat in 1981. Diggs added 142 interception return yards and two pick sixes, both of which also led the NFL in their respective categories.

After the 2021 season, Diggs earned first-team All-Pro honors and was named to his first career Pro Bowl.

Another Pro Bowl season in 2022

Diggs followed up his stellar second season with another Pro Bowl campaign in 2022, starting in all 17 games for the Cowboys in their second straight 12-5 season.

Finishing the year with 14 pass breakups, three interceptions and a career-high 59 total tackles, things were continuing to go well as he headed into the final year of his rookie contract.

Diggs signs five-year, $97 million extension

In July of 2023, the Cowboys signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension which included $42.3 million guaranteed.

It was a huge pay day for the young corner, who in just 45 career games had already tallied 17 career interceptions and 49 pass breakups, helping the Cowboys be among the best in the NFL in takeaways over his first three seasons, including first in the league in 2021.

Things were looking up for Diggs and the Cowboys heading into the 2023 season on the heels of back-to-back 12-5 finishes.

Tragedy strikes in practice

Less than three months after signing his extension with the Cowboys, Diggs tore the ACL in his left knee during practice after two weeks of the regular season, ending his season early.

Diggs was having a promising start to his fourth year in the NFL, with three pass breakups and an interception already to his name in just two games.

Now, a long recovery process laid ahead of him to get back on the field for the Cowboys in 2024.

Diggs' return in 2024, injury struggles still linger

At the start of training camp in 2024, Diggs started the year on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list as he continued his recovery from the torn ACL the year prior. Then later on at camp, the Cowboys lost their other All-Pro CB DaRon Bland to a stress fracture in his foot, sidelining him for the first 10 games of the season.

Diggs would go on to start the first 10 games of the season for the Cowboys, recording two interceptions and eight pass breakups for Dallas' defense that had its fair share of struggles.

Then, Diggs suffered a groin injury after Dallas' 34-10 loss against the Texans and returned to the lineup just once more against the Bengals in Week 14 before news came out that Diggs needed surgery to repair a knee injury in the same knee as his ACL tear the year prior. Diggs would miss the remaining four games of the season.

A rocky start to training camp

Over the offseason, Diggs elected to do a majority of his knee recovery work outside of the Cowboys' facilities, and instead in South Florida. In his latest contract, Diggs had a clause that stated he needed to participate in 84.375 percent of the offseason program at the Cowboys' facility.

Ultimately, Diggs did not reach that threshold, and the Cowboys decided to enact the de-escalator in his contract that docked $500,000 off his 2025 salary.

""We expect a player paid like Trevon to be here all the time,"" Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones said in the team's opening press conference. ""We expect him to be leading, expect him to be leading, but that's not new.""

The next day, Diggs and fellow Cowboys teammate at the time Micah Parsons held a joint press conference with reporters. Both had each other's backs for their respective situations.

""At the end of the day, this is his business, his body, it's his body equity,"" Parsons said of Diggs' decision to recover outside of Dallas' facilities. ""He's gotta feel like he got to do what's best for his body. Like always, at the end of the day, if he's not available, what are they going to do? Get rid of him. So he's got to keep his body up to par.""

Micah Parsons is traded to the Green Bay Packers

Diggs and Parsons were very close friends on and off the field during their time together with the Cowboys. When Dallas traded Parsons to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for Kenny Clark and two first-round draft picks, Diggs was surprised.

""I think everybody was surprised,"" Diggs said. ""I was really surprised, I really thought it was going to get done so we could just stay a family. Just him being here all his years, but unfortunately that's not what God had for him.""

From Diggs' perspective, the decision that the Cowboys made to ultimately move on from his friend in Parsons seemed to be a mixture of business, and personal differences.

""It's definitely a business, but people always say never make it personal,"" Diggs said. ""But when you go out there and lay your life on the line, you're practicing hard, you're in the game, you're risking your body. It becomes personal because you care about it, you care about the game so much you want to win. It is a business at the end of the day, but it is also personal.""

Diggs suffers concussion, more knee issues midseason

After Diggs cleared his physical in late August and going through practices, he returned to the field for the Cowboys and started in four of Dallas' first six games of the 2025 season, starting the year on a pitch count to get his legs back under him.

After playing in those first six games, head coach Brian Schottenheimer announced that Diggs had suffered a concussion in an at-home accident just days before the Cowboys were set to play the Commanders in Week 7. Diggs later revealed that his concussion came from a TV mounting pole that fell on him as he tried to install it in his home.

A week later, Diggs was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury added to his injury status. He would go on to later say that there was some fluid that had built up in his knee that needed to be taken care of, which is why the team decided it would be best to sit him down and allow him to recover further.

Uncertainty continues to build about Diggs' future

As the weeks went on and Diggs got closer and closer to return, the 21-day practice window opened for Diggs to make his return to the field in 2025. A week before Diggs' window was getting ready to close, Diggs was under the impression he would play on Sunday Night Football in Week 15 against the Giants, but was kept on the designated for return list.

""Going into the week, that was the plan, was for me to play. I was included in the game plan to play."" Diggs said. ""Yesterday, I was told I wasn't playing, so that's why I thought that I was playing. It was a quick decision, I didn't know. I thought I was going to come out here and play, but they felt otherwise. That's just what it was.""

That came after Brian Schottenheimer and Jerry Jones both said they needed to see more from Diggs in all areas both on and off the field when each were asked about Diggs' return to the lineup. After finding out he wouldn't play against Minnesota, Diggs told reporters he was ""upset"" with the decision and voiced his frustrations with the team.

""Definitely disappointed, because I definitely thought I was coming out, going to play, being able to help these guys try to pull out a win,"" Diggs said. ""I think how it was handled, I didn't like that, because I thought that I was playing. It is what it is, try to focus on next week, see if I can show them whatever they want to see. I'm going to show them and go from there.""

""I love Dallas. Dallas is a great place,"" Diggs said. ""I've built great relationships with these guys, they're like my brothers, so of course I want to be here. But at the end of the day, it's a business. I don't know what the future holds, it's in God's hands. I'm just doing what I can do, showing up where I can show up, and go from there.""

Cowboys waive Diggs on December 30

The uncertainty came to a close on Tuesday, with the Cowboys making the decision to waive Diggs ahead of their season finale against the New York Giants.

Should he clear waivers, Diggs will become a free agent and can sign wherever he'd like ahead of the playoffs beginning on January 10.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/ji2rdssrvqurm3fhttfl,N,,2025-12-31 00:58:10.333610

Andy Reid has spent nearly all of his adult life in coaching. For more than the last quarter-century, Reid has patrolled the sideline as an NFL head coach, first guiding the Philadelphia Eagles and now leading the Kansas City Chiefs.

Reid cemented his legacy in Kansas City with three Super Bowl titles, but his age, Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending ACL injury and the uncertainty swirling around Travis Kelce’s future have fueled speculation that he could step away as soon as 2026.

Despite those factors — including the Chiefs missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 — Reid confirmed his plans to return to the sideline in 2026. ""I mean, I think I'm coming back, right?"" Reid said in jest during a call with local reporters on Tuesday.

BULLET FIRED INTO ANDY REID'S OFFICE IN 2024 MONTHS AFTER TEAM WON SUPER BOWL: REPORT

The 67-year-old Reid is accustomed to answering questions about his future in February, after the Chiefs have played in the Super Bowl, which they had done each of the past three years. But he's less familiar with facing those questions in the final days of December, a time when the Chiefs have routinely been preparing for a postseason run.

Kansas City is 6-10 as it prepares for its season finale on Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders.

Reid, who reportedly signed a five-year, $100 million extension with the Chiefs in April 2024.

Reid has 307 wins overall. He needs 18 to pass George Halas for third on the NFL's career list behind Belichick and Don Shula. While Reid's return to the sideline seems likely, the continuity of the rest of the coaching staff remains less certain. Matt Nagy, who is in his second stint as the Chiefs’ offensive coordinator, is in the last year of his contract.

Shortly before Mahomes underwent surgery to address damage to his left ACL and LCL, Reid expressed confidence in the quarterback's mindset regarding his rehab approach.

""He'll attack it, just like he does everything else,"" Reid said of Mahomes' upcoming rehab. ""There have been some pretty good quarterbacks who have had the same injury, and they've done pretty well after they came back. He'll get after it, and he's got good people here to rehab him. He'll be right on top of all of that.

""As long as the surgery goes well, as expected, then I would expect a fairly quick recovery for him just because of those factors.""

But a couple of weeks later, ESPN host Pat McAfee revealed Kelce sent him a message confirming he would return in 2025, which said, ""I'm coming back for sure.""

When Shanahan was asked if we can assume Kittle would play this week because he’s listed as limited, Shanahan said, “I wouldn’t assume that.","Here is the San Francisco 49ers’ first injury report of the week with a Saturday game.

Kyle Shanahan said cornerback Renardo Green will practice in full after missing the previous two weeks with a neck injury.

McCaffrey was getting his back looked at during the game on Sunday night. Shanahan said McCaffrey’s back is stiff. Shanahan said McCaffrey has been battling a back injury up to the game as of two weeks ago. So, the Titans game: “I know he battled it hard that week. Hadn’t heard about it since. So, it might have stiffened up since. I know it was sore from Sunday night. That’s why we got him on here today.”

As for Trent Williams, “We’re not sure how long. Giving it a shot for this week. So, we’ll see.” Shanahan said Austen Pleasants, Williams’ replacement, played “good enough for us to win.”

With a short week and a quick turnaround, it’s safe to say the 49ers won’t have very physical practices this week. The team isn’t practicing until 5 p.m. PT on Tuesday and Wednesday. Part of that is to get the body clock right for a primetime game on Saturday. The other reason is to squeeze as much sleep recovery and treatment in as possible.

Shanahan said they are having to change quite a bit of the routine this week due to the Saturday schedule, from allowing players to arrive later to cutting some meeting time.

When Shanahan was asked if we can assume Kittle would play this week because he’s listed as limited, Shanahan said, “I wouldn’t assume that. We’re barely moving today. It’s a walkthrough, so the short week we got, we won’t really do much all week.”",https://platform.ninersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/115/2025/12/gettyimages-2253869110.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-31 00:58:14.359880

While some teams continue to fight for playoff positioning, others have made health a priority as they enter the postseason or offseason. As a result, expect plenty of players to sit out Week 18 with others playing in a reduced or limited role. Let's do an all-Turf Burns look around the league for the regular season finale.

Josh Allen: The Bills quarterback underwent additional testing on his ailing foot after Sunday's loss to the Eagles. X-rays were performed on the area, and fortunately nothing significant was found. The decision for extra images was likely precautionary but a good indicator they are worried about the integrity of the foot. The injury does appear to be limiting his mobility on the field but not substantial enough to keep him off it. The good news is Allen has not been seen wearing a protective boot, suggesting they are not concerned with him bearing weight on the ailing foot. While the Bills have secured a playoff spot and could improve their seeding with a win against the Jets, resting Allen in Week 18 could be more beneficial for their postseason aspirations. Look for this to situation to be reevaluated on a daily basis as the team weighs all their options and closely assesses Allen's sore foot. Mitchell Trubisky would start if Allen is held out.

George Kittle: The 49ers tight end continues to nurse a low-grade ankle sprain that kept him sidelined for Week 17. San Francisco remains in contention for the top seed in the NFC but has indicated it will prioritize health over everything. The Niners face the Seahawks on Saturday night, reducing Kittle's recovery time by a day. This isn't ideal for a situation that is likely to be handled conservatively. Tread cautiously here even if Kittle is cleared to return.

Amon-Ra St. Brown: The Lions are no longer in playoff contention and may opt to protect their star wideout. St. Brown has been slowed by an undisclosed knee injury over the past few weeks and appears to have aggravated the issue in Week 17. Detroit currently considers St. Brown ""day-to-day,"" though those invested here should anticipate a carefully managed workload for him.

Cowboys Running Backs: Javonte Williams has been one of the better bounce-back stories in the NFL this season and serves as a good reminder about the difference between returning to play and returning to previous form. After tearing his ACL, PCL and LCL in Week 4 of 2022, Williams struggled in the two subsequent seasons but has looked sharp since signing a one-year deal with the Cowboys. Williams has thrived this season, rushing for more than 1,000 yards while finding the endzone 13 times. Sadly, he may not be able to build on those numbers in Week 18 after suffering an undisclosed shoulder injury against the Commanders.

Malik Davis excelled in Williams' absence, finishing with 103 yards on 20 carries. Davis suffered a right eye injury during the performance but doesn't believe it will stop him from suiting up against the Giants. It sounds like the injury is nothing more than a contusion with associated swelling. The swelling should improve throughout the week, making Davis a worthy waiver-wire option. Rookie Jaydon Blue has struggled to establish himself this season but could be active if Williams and/or Davis is limited or out.

Jake Ferguson: It's not just injured running backs in Dallas, as Jake Ferguson suffered a calf injury in the team's Christmas Day win over Washington. He luckily snagged a touchdown before the injury, salvaging the performance, but his availability for Week 18 remains in doubt. Calf injuries are the most commonly aggravated or reinjured strains among athletes, and Ferguson will carry an elevated degree of risk if he is able to suit up against the Giants. Consider healthier options to close out the season.

Marvin Harrison: Head coach Jonathan Gannon said his top receiver will suit up for the regular-season finale against the Rams, ""if he is healthy enough to play."" Harrison has been limited by injury since undergoing an appendectomy in the lead up to Week 11. He missed two games recovering before sustaining a heel injury that forced him out of two more games. Harrison appears to have aggravated the injury in Week 17's loss to the Bengals. Even if he is deemed ""healthy enough to play,"" it is hard to trust a guy who is averaging just 27.7 snapes over his past three games played. By comparison, Harrison averaged 53.3 snaps through the first 10 weeks of the season prior to the surgery and heel injury. Look elsewhere to close out the season.

Josh Jacobs: The Packers are locked into the seventh seed in the NFC and could use Week 18 as extended rest for several key players. Jacobs should be at the top of the list, as he looks to overcome lingering knee and ankle injuries. He finished with just five total touches in the loss to the Ravens, and it wouldn't be surprising if Jacobs is simply inactive against the Vikings.","https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/xztbaq8bdeppbunpwsez.png",N,,2025-12-30 19:57:52.291293

The move comes just two years after the team signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension.

The 27-year-old will be subject to waivers before hitting the free-agent market. Due to the nature of Diggs' contract, a team would have to pay Diggs his $472,000 base salary for Week 18 and $58,823 if he's active for the game, per ESPN's Field Yates.

Since the rest of Diggs' contract wasn't guaranteed, the team that claims him wouldn't be on the hook for the remaining roughly $55 million Diggs would have received over the next three seasons if he remained with the Cowboys.

The possibility of Diggs being cut at age 27 seemed extremely unlikely after his first few seasons in the NFL. After being selected by the Cowboys in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft, Diggs turned in a modest rookie season.

He burst onto the scene in his second year, however, leading the NFL with 11 interceptions. That performance earned Diggs the first of two straight Pro Bowl nods and made him a first-team All-Pro.

He followed that up with a strong third season, picking off three passes and earning another Pro Bowl appearance.

Coming off two straight excellent seasons, Diggs was given a five-year, $97 million extension from the Cowboys in July of 2023. That deal proved to be ill-timed. Diggs played in just two games that season, tearing his ACL in practice ahead of Week 3. He was off to a decent start, already registering an interception and three passes defended before going down for the season.

Though he was able to return in 2024 in time to play in Week 1, Diggs didn't grade out well once back on the field, per PFF. After missing time late in the season with a groin injury, it was announced Diggs would sit out the remainder of the year to have surgery on the same knee in which he tore his ACL in 2023.

Diggs missed time in the offseason and training camp while recovering from surgery. He was able to return in time to play in Week 1, but once again posted poor metrics before a concussion sidelined him after just six games.

The Indianapolis Colts are turning to rookie Riley Leonard as their starting quarterback for Sunday's season finale at the Houston Texans, sources told ESPN, ending veteran Rivers' run after coming out of a five-year retirement.

Rivers, the longtime NFL great who retired after a single season with the Colts in 2020, rejoined the team earlier this month after the season-ending injury to starter Daniel Jones. With 2023 first-round pick Anthony Richardson Sr. also on injured reserve from a previous injury, the Colts were left with few options. Coach Shane Steichen, one of Rivers' closest friends, coaxed Rivers out of retirement because of his intimate knowledge of the offense and leadership capacity.

But with the Colts eliminated from playoff contention last weekend, the team had to weigh whether it made sense to continue starting the 44-year-old Rivers who is not in their future plans. Steichen said this week he was navigating the situation and planned to speak with Rivers before making a decision. Steichen seemed to acknowledge that Rivers had some desire to play.

""Bringing Philip in here to come here and play is what he wanted to do,"" Steichen said.

He added, ""Those are conversations that we're having with him to see how that goes. And that's pretty much it. Getting a feel for him.""

Rivers said after Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars that he'd accept any decision the team made. The Colts made the surprising move to sign Rivers in a desperate attempt to make the postseason. They were in the thick of the AFC playoff race when Jones was injured and, knowing they'd need consistent quarterback play to stay there, they took a flier on Rivers.

Indianapolis ended up 0-3 with Rivers under center, but he certainly gave their offense a fighting chance. It was no masterpiece, but Rivers was competent, completing 63% of his pass attempts (58-of-92) for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.

Philips had been a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026 before unretiring. Now he won't be eligible for consideration again until 2031.

Leonard, a sixth-round pick from Notre Dame, will make his first career start against the Texans' fearsome defense.

The prospect of Leonard starting on Sunday, Steichen said, ""will be good for his development.""

Richardson, who is recovering from an orbital fracture and injury to his right eye, returned in recent weeks but is still on injured reserve. He is not expected to be activated before Sunday.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1208%2Fr1586832_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:58:37.975873

Sam Darnold and the Seahawks have won six in a row to take a one game lead into the final game of the regular season. Seattle is outscoring its opponents 29-18. Their stifling defense has allowed just 31 touchdowns through 16 games including just one last weekend in Charlotte to the Carolina Panthers in a 27-10 win.

Last weekend seemed to be a statement game for the 49ers. Brock Purdy and the Niners’ offense was at its season’s best in San Francisco’s 42-38 win over Chicago. Mr. Irrelevant completed 24 of 33 passes for 303 yards with three touchdowns. Christian McCaffrey rushed for 140 yards and a touchdown and caught four passes for 41 yards as San Francisco denied Chicago’s pursuit of the top overall seed in the NFC.

These teams met in Seattle to open the regular season. San Francisco won 17-13. Purdy threw for 277 yards and two touchdowns and McCaffrey picked up 142 total yards (69 rushing and 73 receiving).

The following season, Diggs was named to the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive season after hauling in three interceptions. Diggs signed a five-year, $97 million contract extension at the beginning of training camp in 2023.

However, Diggs has not been on the field nearly as much after signing the contract. In 2021 and 2022, he played 16 and 17 games, respectively, whereas in 2023 he played just two games as he tore his ACL in a September practice.

Diggs played 11 games in 2024, but was unable to recapture his form and was eventually placed on injured reserve to have another procedure done on his surgically repaired knee.

In 2025, Diggs played eight games as he spent time on IR with a knee injury — the same knee that had been surgically repaired — and with a concussion. The concussion stemmed from an accident he sustained at home.

In eight games in 2025, Diggs recorded 25 combined tackles with no interceptions. In 66 career games, all with the Cowboys, the former Alabama cornerback has 20 interceptions, 63 passes defended, two forced fumbles, and 240 combined tackles.

Diggs will land on waivers after being released, and if a team were to claim him, they would owe $472,000 for his base salary, plus an additional $58,823 if he were made active. There is no guaranteed money in his contract beyond this season.

Diggs would later reveal the he sustained the injury in an at-home incident, when a TV-mount pole fell on his head. He also dealt with a knee injury this season.

Both before and after the injury, Diggs' play was rocky, giving up catches and suffering miscommunication breakdowns.

Per Pelissero, Diggs' release was not the result of a single incident but rather the culmination of multiple factors over time -- both performance and other factors.

The Cowboys inked Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension in July 2023, with the corner coming off back-to-back Pro Bowl nods and a 2021 first-team All-Pro selection. Since the payday, injuries have plagued Diggs. He's played in just 21 games over the past three seasons, including just two in 2023 before suffering an ACL injury.

With a $14.5 million base salary in 2026 but zero guaranteed money on the deal, Diggs was likely to be cut in the offseason. Dallas decided not to wait that long to part ways with the 2020 second-round draft pick.

Diggs, who had three years left on his contract, continued to say that he wanted to remain with the Cowboys beyond this season.","The Dallas Cowboys released veteran cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday with one game remaining in the season.

From the team’s perspective, the move was a culmination of multiple factors, which included his performance on and off the field. The feeling was that it’s best for both parties to part ways.

Diggs never appeared to be a fit for defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus’ heavy-zone scheme. The two-time Pro Bowler has been at his best in his career when playing man coverage.

Injuries were also an issue this season as Diggs dealt with a knee injury and then suffered a concussion at his home in October. He was then placed on injured reserve. After he returned to practice Nov. 30, it was unclear when he’d be active for a game because of other behind-the-scenes issues with the team.

Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer had talked about wanting to see more from Diggs on and off the field before making him active.

“I don’t know the special requirements that I need to show that I can play,” Diggs said while he was practicing but not active for games. “I’ve been at practice. I’ve been practicing well, running around, doing what I’m supposed to. It’s not my decision, at the end of the day. We just have to wait and see.”

He was finally active for a game in Dallas’ Week 16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. He then played again last week in the Cowboys win at Washington.

Diggs, who had three years left on his contract, continued to say that he wanted to remain with the Cowboys beyond this season. Diggs will cost the Cowboys about $5.8 million in dead cap money in 2026.

NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday that any team claiming Diggs would be responsible for his remaining $472,222 guaranteed game check this season, making it likely that he clears waivers and then will become a free agent.

Cornerback will be one of the Cowboys’ top offseason needs. DaRon Bland, who recently suffered a season-ending foot injury, and rookie Shavon Revel are expected to be two of their starters in 2026. But at least one more starting-caliber corner is needed. That other corner wasn’t expected to be Diggs.

“I’ll just say that there’s some plays throughout the game that we’re going to follow up with,” Macdonald said.
Why it matters: Shaheed impacts both the receiver rotation and the return game, a spot Seattle already had to patch together recently.
Rashid Shaheed Concussion Update: “No Time Frames” When asked directly about Shaheed’s situation, Macdonald said he doesn’t have anything concrete yet.
What It Means for the Seahawks vs. the 49ers If Shaheed can’t go, the ripple isn’t just at receiver.","Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald indicated December 29 that the team plans to likely follow up with the NFL regarding the play on which Pro Bowl wide receiver/return man Rashid Shaheed was injured, while also acknowledging he has no firm update yet on Shaheed’s status heading into January 2’s showdown with the San Francisco 49ers.

Asked what he thought of the play Shaheed was hurt on, Macdonald didn’t dive into specifics. But he made it clear Seattle wants clarity from the league on what was — and wasn’t — called.

“I’ll just say that there’s some plays throughout the game that we’re going to follow up with,” Macdonald said. “It’s just trying to understand what’s getting called, what’s not, and why… We want to defend our guys and make sure that they’re not getting put in harm’s way.”

Key details

Coach’s stance on the hit: Seahawks will “follow up” with the NFL on multiple plays, likely including the one Shaheed was hurt on.

Shaheed status: Macdonald said he has no updates and no timetable right now.

Why it matters: Shaheed impacts both the receiver rotation and the return game, a spot Seattle already had to patch together recently.

Mike Macdonald Hints Seahawks Will Send the Play to the League

Macdonald’s wording was careful, and that’s typical when coaches are trying to avoid turning officiating into a week-long sideshow. It’s also in an effort to protect their wallets and not draw any fines.

Still, the important part for Seattle fans is the signal: the Seahawks are not simply shrugging off the injury sequence as “part of football.” Macdonald’s comments suggested the team is going to press the league for an explanation on how the play was officiated and what the standards are going forward.

That matters even more with Seattle headed into a high-stakes matchup against a division rival, where every possession (and every special-teams rep) can swing the game.

Rashid Shaheed Concussion Update: “No Time Frames”

When asked directly about Shaheed’s situation, Macdonald said he doesn’t have anything concrete yet.

“I really don’t have any updates,” he said. “We just don’t have any update on time frames or anything like that… we’re really going to be playing that throughout the week.”

That puts Shaheed in the “true day-to-day” bucket as Seattle moves through a compressed practice week. In practical terms, the tells will be familiar: participation level (if any) midweek, any ramp-up later in the week, and whether the Seahawks have to plan for life without one of their most explosive open-field options.

What It Means for the Seahawks vs. the 49ers

If Shaheed can’t go, the ripple isn’t just at receiver. Macdonald already pointed to how quickly the return game can become an emergency when bodies go down, noting Cam Akers was asked to jump in with minimal reps after Seattle was suddenly missing return options.

In other words: Shaheed’s availability can affect field position, play-calling, and who’s active on game day.

Seattle’s offense has found ways to win games late — including leaning on the run game to close out wins — but losing an explosive return/receiver threat can remove one of the easiest ways to steal hidden yards, especially against a top opponent.

What to Watch Next

The next checkpoints are straightforward:",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253960644-e1767054146285.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-30 16:59:55.020885

Diggs has been released by the Cowboys amid his injury-plagued season, ESPN reported Tuesday. Diggs will immediately hit waivers and could become a free agent if he clears waivers. If a team claims him, they'll reportedly be on the hook for the $472,000 base salary and $58,823 bonus he'd get for being active for Week 18.

Rumors of the Cowboys potentially moving on from Diggs grew in recent weeks as he spent nearly two months on injured reserve. He initially missed a game due to a concussion he suffered in an incident at home in October before getting placed on injured reserve later that month due to a right knee ailment.

Diggs eventually returned to the Cowboys' lineup in Week 16, but he's largely struggled this season. Opposing quarterbacks have posted a perfect passer rating (158.3) when they've targeted receivers Diggs has covered this season, as the cornerback has allowed three touchdowns in eight games, per Pro Football Focus.

Diggs briefly emerged as one of the best cornerbacks in football not long after the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. That helped him get a five-year, $97 million extension ahead of the 2023 season. However, the two-time Pro Bowler has only played 21 games since then, tearing his ACL in the 2023 season and undergoing an operation to repair the same knee in 2024.",https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1408/814/trevon2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-30 14:59:33.726640

In the first meeting of 2025, back on Oct. 12 in Pittsburgh, Garrett had 0 sacks, and the Browns lost.
ANSWER: I have to admit, your question made me chuckle, because usually I get the other version of this question.
They've gone from the possibility of their last two games being meaningless to potentially being eliminated by a Ravens team that looked unstoppable in Green Bay.
Is there anything fans can do to request certain announcers NOT BE on Steelers games?","DONNIE BROWN FROM VAN BUREN, ME: Is it me or did the Steelers offense try harder to not let Myles Garrett get a record-breaking sack instead of playing to win the game?

ANSWER: What the recent history of the Steelers-Browns series told anyone who was paying attention was that Myles Garrett's individual success is tied closely to his team's success. Here is a snippet from what I wrote for Steelers.com after the 13-6 loss on Sunday to the Browns:

""But when it comes to the Browns, home or on the road, what the Steelers had experienced in the last 5 installments of this series is that if Myles Garrett is allowed to wreck the game, he wrecks it. In 2023, when Garrett had 2 sacks vs. the Steelers, the Browns won; when he had 0, they lost. Same thing in 2024. When he had 3 sacks, the Browns won; when he had 1, they lost. In the first meeting of 2025, back on Oct. 12 in Pittsburgh, Garrett had 0 sacks, and the Browns lost.

""Granted, there was added spice to Sunday's game because Garrett was looking for 1 sack to break the all-time NFL single-season record in that category, but the attention paid to preventing Garrett from getting to Aaron Rodgers was primarily about beating the Browns and clinching the division title. Preventing him from breaking the record came along with that.""

FRITZ SCHERZ FROM VERONA, NY: Like all in Steelers Nation, I was disappointed in the result vs. the Browns. My question: Is there a stat for dropped interceptions? I'm asking because it seems like this year the Steelers had more dropped interceptions than previous years.

ANSWER: There is no official NFL statistic kept for dropped interceptions, but there are some analytics sites that take a shot at that. But like all analytics sites, in my opinion, there is a lot of guessing and speculation involved.

DOUGLAS PIPER FROM STATE COLLEGE, PA: I'm sure many will ask this question, but do you have any thoughts on why the offense had trouble moving the ball all day in Cleveland, but was able to quickly drive from their 20-yard line to the Browns 7-yard line at the end of the game?

ANSWER: I have to admit, your question made me chuckle, because usually I get the other version of this question. As in, why did the Steelers defense stop the opponent for three quarters of the game and then allow the opponent to move it up and down the field in the fourth quarter? I suspect the answer to your question is that the Browns knew that the Steelers had to score a touchdown to tie the game and had no timeouts left, and so they made the decision to force the offense to complete passes in the middle of the field to keep the clock running and count on their No. 1 pass defense to make a play.

TOM HENSON FROM MARTINSVILLE, IN: It's well documented that the Steelers never seem to take the easy road. The disparity between the two possible scenarios leading into Week 17 was enormous. They've gone from the possibility of their last two games being meaningless to potentially being eliminated by a Ravens team that looked unstoppable in Green Bay. Can you recall a time when the Steelers (or any team) has had their playoff scenario change this drastically in literally one weekend?

ANSWER: First of all, in order for the Week 17 game vs. the Browns to be meaningless for the Steelers, the Packers had to beat the Ravens. That was totally out of the Steelers' hands. As to that outcome, were the Ravens really unstoppable, or was the Green Bay defense simply not ready to do what was necessary to minimize Derrick Henry in a game where Baltimore's quarterback was going to be Tyler Huntley instead of Lamar Jackson? Anyway, the facts are that the Steelers entered last weekend's games with two different ways to clinch the AFC North Division – a Ravens loss on Saturday, or a Pittsburgh win on Sunday. Neither of those happened, and so the Steelers now have another chance to clinch the division and the home playoff game that comes with that by defeating the Ravens on Sunday night. Everything else is speculative drama.

MIKE PALOMBO FROM McMURRAY, PA: I've read varying reports about the Steelers decision not to void the guaranteed money remaining in DK Metcalf's contract. What is actually correct? Has the team already decided not to void this money? If the decision hasn't yet been made, what is the deadline for doing so?

ANSWER: My sense is that the ""varying reports"" you read were speculation, because what you're asking about is not something the Steelers typically make public, and I would doubt they are going to change that policy of revealing detailed matters involving contracts in this instance.

JACK G. FOSTER FROM ROUNDUP, MT: Is it just me or does the rest of the fan base think that the game announcers (Tony Romo in particular) hate the Steelers? Romo never says anything positive about us but always says positive things about the other team. Is there anything fans can do to request certain announcers NOT BE on Steelers games?

ANSWER: No. There is nothing fans can do to impact which announcers are assigned to which games. That's the sole purview of the network broadcasting the game.

JOE LaMOLINARE FROM DALLAS, GA. I see quite a few players wearing face shields on their helmets. Are QBs allowed to wear shaded face shields to prevent the defense from reading the QB's eyes?

ANSWER: The way I believe it works for a defense is that when an attempt is being made to ""read the quarterback's eyes"" to determine where he's going with the football it will look at the quarterback's helmet and judge where he's looking by using the stripe on the top of his helmet as something of a pointer.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/jd5su1uqyxg3wqxqq2y5,N,,2025-12-30 18:01:02.738819

Patriots injury analysis: Week 17

QB Drake Maye: The Patriots’ starting quarterback being a bit slow to get up after taking a hit to the head in the second quarter, drawing a roughing the passer penalty and prompting head coach Mike Vrabel to sprint onto the field, could have been a scary moment. It ultimately wasn’t, because Maye looked fine right away and remained in the game without showing any limitations from the play. He went 8-of-9 for 97 yards and a pair of touchdowns from that point on, and overall played one of the most productive games in recent memory.

FB Jack Westover: New England’s fullback remained down after a kickoff with 14:51 left in the fourth quarter, but walked off under own power. After some time in the blue medical tent, he returned to the sideline trying to walk the injury off. Ultimately, Westover did not reenter the game after he was announced as questionable to return with an ankle ailment.

CB Charles Woods: The Patriots’ backup quarterback, who entered the contest questionable with a foot issue, showcased some apparent discomfort in his back after unsuccessfully trying to break up an 18-yard pass in the late fourth quarter. Woods remained in the game and no injury was announced.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots were down seven players heading into their game against the Jets, but that list growing ahead of the season finale seems unlikely: New England escaped without any obvious major injuries. The biggest question mark is Jack Westover, but head coach Mike Vrabel gave a positive update on his status on Monday.

“Sore, probably could have returned,” Vrabel said. “We’ll monitor him here in the next couple days. I don’t think it’s anything that is too significant, but we’ll just see how he progresses here when we get back to work.”

The Patriots will hold their first practice of the week on Wednesday, and will release an injury report later that day.

And he’s still going. Happy birthday, LeBron!

About last night

A knee injury that could change everything

I thought about GIF’ing the play in which Nikola Jokić seemed to hyperextend his knee against the Heat on Monday. But I didn’t want to broadcast a replay of something you don’t want to see. The Nuggets’ superstar left the game at the end of the first half with the injury, after he limped off the floor to the locker room. Teammate Hunter Tyson stepped on Jokić’s foot in a way that made him take a bad step. Our Sam Amick reported that the results of Jokić’s medical tests will be known today.

Jokić is having one of the best seasons we’ve ever seen. He went into last night averaging 29.9 points, 12.4 rebounds and 11.1 assists. He’s leading the league in rebounds and assists. He has absurd 60.4/44.0/85.5 shooting splits. And he still managed to lead Denver (22-10) in points (21) in its 147-123 loss to Miami (18-15) despite not playing the second half.

Now we all just wait with bated breath and hope it’s not a serious knee injury. We’ll update tomorrow when we know more.

Cavs 113, Spurs 101: If it wasn’t for the Jokić injury, this would have led the night. Cleveland had a monster 37-23 fourth quarter to take control of this game. Donovan Mitchell only had 10 points on 12 shots, but Jarrett Allen put in 27 points. Victor Wembanyama’s 26 and 14 weren’t enough, and the Cavs (18-16) finally looked like the team we saw last year.

Raptors 107, Magic 106: Jamal Shead’s 19 off the bench helped erase a 20-point deficit as Toronto (20-14) held Orlando (18-15) to 12 fourth-quarter points. The Raptors had 50 bench points in this one.

Knicks 130, Pelicans 125: Zion Williamson had 32 and Saddiq Bey had 27 for New Orleans (8-26). But the Knicks (23-9) dished out 35 assists and knocked down 20 3-pointers to overcome it. Jalen Brunson had 28 and 10 to lead New York.

Thunder 140, Hawks 129: The good news is the Hawks (15-19) did not lose another game with Trae Young. That’s because he didn’t play. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s 39 for OKC (28-5) sent Atlanta to its seventh straight loss.

Suns 115, Wizards 101: Devin Booker struggled a bit with 22 points on 8-of-23 shooting. But Dillon Brooks helped with 26 and Collin Gillespie had 25 for Phoenix (19-13). Rookie Tre Johnson dropped 24 for Washington (7-24).

Wolves 136, Bulls 101: The Wolves (21-12) outscored the Bulls 81-53 in the second half. Chicago (15-17) lost both Coby White (calf) and Josh Giddey (hammy) in the first half.

Bucks 123, Hornets 113: Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24, Bobby Portis had 25 and Myles Turner had 23 as the Bucks lit up the Hornets for 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from deep.

Warriors 120, Nets 107: Steph Curry’s 27 points were enough for Golden State (17-16) to hold off a spirited effort by the Nets (10-20), who got 23 from rookie Egor Demin. Also, this happened.

Blazers 125, Mavs 122: Deni Avdija’s 27 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds were enough for Portland (14-19) to stop the Max Christie (25) comeback in this one. Cooper Flagg’s great stretch hit a speedbump; he had 15 points on 20 shots for Dallas (12-22).

Rockets 126, Pacers 119: This game was not as close as the score says. Indiana won the fourth 41-21 to make it look better. Kevin Durant dropped 30 on the Pacers (6-27), who have lost nine straight.

Fix the lottery?

We judge the NBA’s anti-tanking ideas

The NBA wants to fix tanking … again? Or for the first time? I’m not sure the league ever accomplished this, but it does believe flattening the lottery odds has helped curb tanking, along with the Play-In Tournament. I’m dubious that flattened lottery odds actually stopped any tanking, but the Play-In Tournament has helped a lot. You only get a few teams bailing on the season, rather than several.

As part of the NBA’s effort to fight illegal gambling incidents, the league wants to put a stop to teams tanking as blatantly as they have. Whether that’s setting up your roster for a season of feces ball or just deciding in the last couple of months that all your best players are coincidentally too banged up to play, tanking is a blight for the league. It’s hard to justify charging full price on tickets when teams tank. (They still do it, but it’s hard.)

The league has been brainstorming some ideas to help curb tanking further. David Aldridge wrote a great article on the problem being the lottery itself. This part struck me the most:

“Trying to make the lottery somehow ‘fairer,’ while at the same time discouraging teams from embarking upon it as a roster-building tool, is a contradiction of purpose — a fatal flaw in the whole apparatus of letting ping-pong balls determine the fate of billion-dollar franchises, rather than significant investment in infrastructure, coaching and development to make the players you have get better. Standing on your own two feet as an organization, not praying for lottery luck, is a much better predictor of adding difference-makers in free agency and/or trades, as more great players think your shop is where they want to be.

“But you’re either all in and competing for real, or you’re not. And there’s no way to reconcile those two contradictory approaches.”

That is perfectly and succinctly stated. I guess that’s why DA is literally in the Hall of Fame. There’s a lot of potential benefit to tanking, which is why Sam Hinkie went so hard with it with the 76ers over a decade ago. Most teams are subtle about it. Plenty of teams are accidental about it. And some teams are fine flaunting it in your face at some point. They do it because you can end up with a superhero to save your franchise. Sometimes, you can even end up with multiple superheroes.

You don’t always end up with a Wembanyama, but you still want to play the lottery odds to give yourself the best chance. Let’s go over some ideas and judge them on a “Fix It” meter of 1-10 hammer emojis.

NBA Idea 1: Freeze future draft-pick protections.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨. I think draft-pick protections can cause some trouble. We saw Dallas bow out of Play-In Tournament contention a few years ago to save its pick (it landed them Dereck Lively II). The idea is to get rid of anything between top-four protection and outside of the lottery. It could work a little, but I don’t see this changing anything but trades being made.

NBA Idea 2: No top-four picks in consecutive years.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨. This prompts the conversation of whether it’s fair for a team to have a situation in which it lands a top-four pick one year and the next year suffer legitimate major injuries. I’m open to this idea, but we might see more on-the-fly tanking spread across the league than just the same bad franchises over and over.

NBA Idea 3: Draft position locked in on March 1.

Fix it meter: 🔨🤦. So we just move the tanking season from March and April to January and February? This is the dumbest idea possible, and it doesn’t fix anything. It just moves the tanking window.

My idea: Unweight the lottery.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨. I like my idea! I do not believe teams will consistently tank out of the playoff picture for a 1-in-14 chance to win the lottery. Owners won’t pass up any playoff revenue, and you have to convince them this is the right move. This is a nearly flawless plan, but is there another version better? Let’s go to The Athletic’s Eric Koreen!

Koreen’s idea: Unweight the lottery, including teams that lose in the first round of the playoffs.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨. This would eliminate any idea of missing the postseason to tank for a 1-in-14 chance. Now you make it a 1-in-22 chance for the top pick and you’re drawing for all 22 spots, not just the top four? Sign me all the way up.

Early returns

Fans are over Lebron and KD as All-Stars

The NBA released the first fan voting returns for the 2026 All-Star starters yesterday. And there are some very surprising developments. Remember, this year will have two teams of USA-born All-Stars and one team of international All-Stars. So the voting process is a little more complicated. However, the league also simplified it by making it entirely positionless. Here are the top 20 in each conference.

A pretty huge one. Rice has arguably been Arsenal’s player of the season so far and his influence in midfield, and anywhere on the pitch, is crucial to the Gunners being on the front foot.

With so many injuries cropping up in the same few areas of the pitch in spells throughout this season for Arsenal, they have stalled in terms of performances in recent weeks.

Quarterbacks

Josh Allen

Injury: Right foot injury

Analysis: Allen clearly aggravated his right foot on Sunday. However, he did continue to play, and although he looked slightly slower, he still performed fairly well. Allen had X-rays again, which were negative, continuing to hint at a sprain in the mid-foot. As we discussed during last week's injury preview article, the mid-foot is a critical junction in the foot for throwing and running. The mid-foot adapts shape depending on what the foot and body are doing. When the foot is accepting weight, it flattens out to absorb ground reaction forces, and when the foot is ready to pushoff the mid-foot creates a rigid arch to generate power from. When an injury is mild, this function is spared, but moderate-severe sprains (which do not appear to currently be the case for Allen) disrupt the mid-foots shape-shifting ability and impact power generation needed for throwing and running.

Right now, there is no indication Allen is dealing with anything more than a mild injury, and pain is the main factor that could impact performance. Allen will receive plenty of treatment throughout the week and will likely utilize either a supportive insert or heavy tape job to protect the midfoot and allow him to play fairly well, but he may not be at 100% until this foot heals more. Rushing upside is the main potential impact, though at times it appeared Allen was not comfortable fully pushing off his right foot to throw.

Is Davante Adams playing tonight?

Adams is officially inactive for the Rams vs. Falcons game on ""Monday Night Football in Week 17.

Adams' absence is not a surprise. He wasn't expected to play, as Los Angeles listed him as ""doubtful"" on the team's final injury report for Week 17 because of a hamstring injury.

Davante Adams injury update

Adams is dealing with a hamstring injury he originally suffered in the team's Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions. The 33-year-old was unable to return to the field on ""Thursday Night Football"" in Week 16 before being ruled ""doubtful"" for Week 17.

Rams coach Sean McVay told reporters throughout the week that Adams is progressing well in his recovery from the injury.

""He's doing great. He's making really good progress,"" McVay said of Adams at a Dec. 27 media availability. ""I know he's chomping at the bit to get back out there.""

Despite McVay's positive prognosis, Adams was unable to practice in the lead-up to the Rams' ""Monday Night Football"" game against the Falcons. He was a non-participant at each of Los Angeles' three listed practice sessions and isn't expected to take the field in Week 17.

Nonetheless, McVay didn't seem worried about Adams' injury lingering in the playoffs.

""We'll be in good shape when we get him back, whether that's this week or next week with the playoffs,"" McVay said.

The Rams have little incentive to rush Adams back into action, as they are guaranteed to be either the No. 5 or 6 seed in the NFC playoff field after being eliminated from the NFC West race by the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers' Week 17 wins.

That should afford the 33-year-old a couple of extra weeks to heal before the Rams look to mount a Super Bowl 60 run.

The Rams have six wide receivers on their 53-man roster, including Adams. They are:

Multiple teams are fighting for just a few playoff spots, and no one is safe from the injury bug. With playoff spots on the line, let’s take a peek and see which teams may or may not be missing some of their biggest stars.

Let’s dive in.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens

At this stage, Lamar is expected to return from his back injury for the team's Week 18 game against the Steelers with a playoff spot on the line. Huntley played fine in his relief, but Derrick Henry was the true star of the game with over 200 yards and 4 TDs on the ground.

Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills

Allen underwent another set of X-rays on his injured foot on Sunday, and it was determined that those were negative. This is the 2nd straight game with this occurring, so it’s clearly hampering his performance, and he may sit out week 18 for the playoffs.

Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers

While Love missed week 17 due to a concussion, Matt LaFluer did state that he would resume starting once healthy, but declined to say if players may be rested in week 18 with the Chicago Bears having secured the division title.

Geno Smith, Las Vegas Raiders

Smith suffered a high ankle sprain in the team's week 17 loss to the Giants. He’s unlikely to play in week 18, and we will likely see Kenny Pickett start the team's final game on their way to the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.

J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings

McCarthy is progressing, and swelling has come down in his injured hand, but his status for week 18 will be determined throughout the week.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Running Backs

Alvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints

At this point, Kamara is not expected to return to action in 2025 with nothing on the line for the team. Audric Estime took over the majority of rushing work in Week 17, and I expect him to do the same in week 18.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Odunze has still not returned to practice, and I’m expecting him to be inactive in week 18 with little on the line for Chicago besides seeding.

Luther Burden, Chicago Bears

Burden suffered a quad injury at the end of the game and had to be carted off the field. After the game, though, he seemed fine and mostly just tired, likely meaning this won’t impact him much moving into the playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, Arizona Cardinals

Harrison left Sunday’s game with a reaggravation of the heel injury that caused him to miss time recently. I’m expecting Marv to be shut down for the remainder of the year with no playoff spot on the line for Arizona, making Michael Wilson Jr a fringe WR1 in the final week of the season.

Drake London, Atlanta Falcons

London is listed as questionable for Monday night's game with a knee injury. This is likely precautionary, and he’s expected to play tonight.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions

ARSB suffered a knee injury in week 17 and is currently day-to-day for their season finale in Chicago. With Detroit out of the playoffs and just playing for pride, ARSB may sit out this one.

Rashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks

Shaheed suffered a concussion on Sunday and was removed from the game. He will need to clear protocol to play in week 18, but I’m expecting him to be inactive with the playoffs right around the corner for Seattle.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Tight Ends

JaTavion Sanders, Carolina Panthers

Sanders suffered a broken ankle during their week 17 loss, likely ending his season, as he will undergo surgery to repair it. He may be able to return should Carolina make it to the playoffs, but they’ll be without him for the time being.

Harold Fannin, Cleveland Browns

Fannin aggravated the groin injury he suffered in practice on Friday and came out of the game as a result. He will undergo an MRI to determine the severity of the injury, but his season is likely over.

Jake Ferguson, Dallas Cowboys

Ferguson left the team's Christmas Day game with a calf injury and did not return. While he may attempt to play in week 18, Dallas is out of playoff contention, and the team may opt to rest him with eyes towards 2026.

George Kittle, San Francisco 49ers

Kittle ultimately sat out against the Bears in week 17. He’s expected to return to practice this week, but I’m expecting the team to sit him and get him healthy for the playoffs.",https://d29m18w01sxjzp.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/source/fatest/arsb_injury_report_week_18-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 10:15:23.125414

Whether Lamar Jackson will take the field for that game is “to be determined,” according to head coach John Harbaugh:

Jackson exited Baltimore’s Week 16 game against the New England Patriots after taking a knee to his back, and suffering what Harbaugh described as a “very painful” injury. Speaking to the media ahead of Baltimore’s Week 17 game against the Green Bay Packers, Harbaugh had this to say:

“It’s not like a black and blue mark. These are deep-tissue contusions,” Harbaugh said.

“I’m not a medical guy, but I did see the MRI. It’s legitimate, very painful. The muscles lock up around it, you can’t really move very well. He’s in the process now of loosening all that up. You can’t really say when it’s going to be right. He’s got to be able to play. He’s got to be able to be an athlete and go move.”

Jackson was inactive for Baltimore’s Week 17 game against the Packers, with Tyler Huntley starting in his place. Huntley completed 16-of-20 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown, but the big story was Derrick Henry. Baltimore’s standout running back ran for 216 yards and four touchdowns in the Ravens’ 41-24 win, which kept their playoff hopes alive.

When the Steelers lost to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, it set up a Week 18 showdown for the division title.

One thing for Seattle didn’t feel as potent in the second half, though.

A key part of Seattle Seahawks’ success isn’t on the stat sheet

“Special teams do not hit the same if Rashid is not in that game, man,” Michael Bumpus said, referring to Pro Bowl return man Rashid Shaheed, on Monday’s edition of Bump and Stacy on Seattle Sports.

The 27-year-old Shaheed suffered a concussion in the first half, leaving Seattle to turn to running back Cam Akers to return kicks for the rest of the game. It also puts Shaheed’s availability in doubt for Saturday’s huge regular season finale against the San Francisco 49ers that will decide the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed from the NFC in the playoffs.

Time and TV set for Seahawks’ huge Week 18 showdown vs. 49ers

Shaheed, who was a big acquisition by the Seahawks last month just before the NFL trade deadline, has been perhaps the best returner in football since the trade from New Orleans. He has 180 yards and a touchdown on 11 punt returns plus 384 yards and a touchdown on 14 kick returns in eight games with Seattle.

The presence of Shaheed has breathed new life into the Seahawks’ special teams.

“It’s not like we took (Shaheed) for granted, but we’re just a bit spoiled,” Bumpus said. “It’s so fun having them back there and feeling the potential of a return going to the house. No disrespect to Cam Akers… I think it’s safe to say that (Shaheed) is the best returner in the game. And when you have a guy back there, as we run a special teams unit that you feel can take it to the house, it’s not like you play a little harder, but it just feels different. Your angles are different. You feel like every play can be a home run.”

The injury to Shaheed has Bumpus, a former wide receiver and return man for the Seahawks and WSU Cougars, lowering his expectations in the return game.

“As soon as he was out and whoever was returning, it just didn’t feel the same. It felt like, alright, just possess the football and let’s get the offense out there. When he’s back there, I’m literally looking for lanes for him to go to the house every single time. I doubt that he passes concussion protocol and plays on Saturday. That’d be unfortunate, but he’s special, man. And I think that whoever has to replace him, possession is all we need at this point. Just possess the football. Don’t turn it over.”

What about on offense?

While Shaheed has been a big boost for Seattle’s special teams, he hasn’t been as noticeable as a wide receiver in Seattle’s offense. He has 186 yards on 14 catches in his eight games with the Seahawks, and most of that production came in a two-game stretch in early December against the Atlanta Falcons (four catches, 67 yards) and Indianapolis Colts (five catches, 74 yards). Shaheed has just one catch for eight yards over his last two games combined.

“Are you still kind of hoping for him to be even more integrated into the offense?” co-host Stacy Rost asked Bumpus.

“Yeah, I am,” Bumpus responded. “I think because of what he can do with the football on his hands, you’ve got to find ways to get him football. Put him on some of those crossing routes you put JSN (wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba) on. He’s run some of them, you’ve got to find him. Go ahead and take the top off with some double moves. He should be the double-move guy when it comes to taking those shots.”

Michael Bumpus answers four football questions during the Four Down Territory segment at 11:15 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. during each edition of Bump and Stacy. Catch Bump and Stacy from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays on Seattle Sports.

But on Sunday, for the first time in his career, Allen did not attempt a pass from outside of the pocket.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has been dealing with a foot injury sustained in the narrow Week 16 victory over the Cleveland Browns. He has not missed any time, but his touchdown in the final seconds of this Sunday’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles was the only time his offense got into the endzone the entire day.

Perhaps now, offensive coordinator Joe Brady has provided some insight into why the Bills’ offense struggled so badly against the Eagles.

“I think yesterday was a little different,” Brady said when asked if he had to adjust his play calling to account for quarterback Josh Allen’s injured foot. “He was hobbling a little bit, but once the adrenaline got going a little bit — I mean, you can look at the last drive of the game, he’s running away from Jalen Phillips — so it was just constant communication with him about how he’s feeling.

“Once Josh is out there, I have to just trust that if he’s out there, he’s 100% and good things will happen.”

Despite what the offensive coordinator had to say, there was one glaring statistic that stuck out in Allen’s performance.

Josh Allen Didn’t Throw Outside The Pocket Once

The reigning MVP’s game is built on the utilization of his legs, both on and off script.

Allen leads all NFL quarterbacks in rushing yards with 579, the only gunslinger over the half-century mark. But on Sunday, for the first time in his career, Allen did not attempt a pass from outside of the pocket.

According to ESPN’s Buffalo beat reporter Alaina Getzenberg, this was the first time in the 29-year-old quarterback’s career that he has finished a game with at least 20 pass attempts coming all from inside the pocket.

Allen averaged 3.9 yards per carry on Sunday, the fifth-lowest mark of the season. One run contributed 17 of his 27 yards, meaning the remaining of his six rushing attempts ended up with a gain of less than two yards on average.

The week prior, when the injury was sustained, was the same story. He had just seven carries for 17 yards with a long of seven in that win over the Browns.

Despite his 262-yard passing performance, it is clear that the injury is playing a factor in the quarterback’s performance during a crucial stretch of the season.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1815555661.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2025-12-30 14:00:25.370803

MVPs and All-Pro lists will be debated for the next month, but I wanted to build first- and second-team All-Rookie rosters to highlight standout debut seasons before the playoff field is set and we turn our eyes to the race to Super Bowl LX.

Before we get into the picks, a few considerations:

All rookies make bad plays. Every single player on this list has made massive mistakes this season. You could easily cut up a lowlight montage that would make me look like an idiot for calling Carson Schwesinger the no-brainer Defensive Rookie of the Year. This list is largely based on the bulk of positive plays, and peak performances are weighed fairly heavily. Optimism is fun with rookies. Believe a little bit!

Late-season production is weighted heavier, but early-season performance is not discarded. Should Tyler Shough be penalized for failing to beat outSpencer Rattlerin camp, or for quieter performances before hisrecent surge in production? Probably not. Should Emeka Egbuka be docked for dominating early but losing his starting job to Jalen McMillan over the past month? Still probably not. It's easy to trick ourselves into thinking development is linear, and that the past three games we've seen from a rookie are predictive of his next three (and rest of his career). Anyone who woke up from a coma on Thanksgiving would put Shough above Cam Ward on their list and would have Egbuka as a third-team rookie receiver. I did neither, because September and October still matter to me.

Snap counts matter (kind of). The most productive rookie pass rusher at defensive tackle this season was the Cardinals'Walter Nolen III, who had 13 pressures on just 93 pass-rush snaps before being placed on the PUP list before Week 17. Are 93 pass-rush snaps enough to confidently put Nolen on this list over players with more than twice as many reps? I don't really know the answer. Earning snaps is a skill, though it's more significant for some teams (such as the loaded Eagles) than others (such as the Browns, who are handing out rookie snaps like there's no tomorrow). Being healthy and available is critical for rookies -- it is the best predictor of future development. So I tried to acknowledge and credit Week 1 starters while also giving nods to players with smaller roles, whether for depth chart concerns or injury absences.

With that out of the way, here are my first- and second-team All-Rookie rosters.

Jump to a position:

QB | RB | WR | TE | OL

Edge | DT | LB | CB | S

Quarterback

Cam Ward, Tennessee Titans

2025 stats: 320-for-537 passing (59.6%), 3,117 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 7 interceptions; 148 rushing yards, 1 touchdown

Drafted: Round 1, No. 1

Shough finished the season strong for the Saints, but in terms of quality of film, Ward still has him in seasonlong excellence. Ward's advanced metrics, such as EPA or success rate, all show a passing game suffering league-worst levels. But the Titans' wide receivers room has dealt with injuries, drops and general dysfunction -- and the same is true of their offensive line. Ward has demonstrated tremendous resiliency and creativity through it all.

A supercut of Ward's best throws stands up with those of Drake Maye, Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, C.J. Stroud and a slew of other quarterbacks during their own rookie seasons. All of those passers' peak plays foretold strong ensuing seasons. Ward is at his best pushing the ball down the field aggressively, and he has the arm talent, post-snap processing and sharp timing to access high-difficulty throws in the structure of the offense. Undeterred by safeties, Ward will rip throws to the seam with Dak Prescott-esque accuracy and boldness.

Now, Ward will put the ball in danger and must become more willing to find his checkdown and live for another play, but it is far preferable to have a quarterback capable of such throws and dial him down than it is to draw such throws out of a QB naturally averse to them. Ward's rookie season has been clear proof of concept for his potential as an above-average NFL starting quarterback.

Second team:Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints. Shough became the betting favorite to win Offensive Rookie of the Year after leading the Saints' come-from-behind win over Ward and Tennessee in Week 17. I kind of get it -- the Saints have won their past four games, and Shough has looked better with each passing week. But while I see quality play from Shough, I don't see the sort of jaw-dropping, math-changing potential I see in Ward.

Shough has checked every box you could hope for out of a rookie: poise, creativity, execution of the offense, a short memory for mistakes. He needs to cut down on the sacks and sprays, but he looks like a clear hit for general manager Mickey Loomis and a Saints team in need of a rookie contract starter at quarterback.

Running back

TreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots

2025 stats: 168 carries for 858 rushing yards (5.1 yards per carry) and 7 touchdowns; 35 receptions for 221 yards and 1 touchdown

Drafted: Round 2, No. 38

On a down-to-down basis, Henderson has not been as consistent as several other rookie backs this season. He misses lanes as a runner, and despite his reputation as an elite pass protector, he has some errors in that capacity. With that said, the way he creates yardage with the ball in his hands is simply impossible to ignore. Henderson is a walking home run in both the handoff and checkdown game, and that profile of missed tackles and hidden yardage created tends to expand a player's role over his career. For the peaks, Henderson gets my nod.

Second team:Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns. It is agonizing to decide between Judkins, Kyle Monangai, Ashton Jeanty, Omarion Hampton, RJ Harvey, Cam Skattebo and Woody Marks for one second-team spot. Each of them was solid in some ways and disappointing in others. I gave the nod to Henderson's college teammate, Judkins, because he ran tough and minimized negatives behind a floundering offensive line and without any supporting passing game to create space for him.

Judkins, Skattebo and Hampton are the three who stand out on film with consistent positive plays. Still, this is a tough pick.

Wide receiver

Tetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers

2025 stats: 66 receptions for 922 yards (14.1 yards per reception) and 7 touchdowns

Drafted: Round 1, No. 8

The favorite for Offensive Rookie of the Year before he was held to just one catch against the Seahawks, McMillan needs 71 yards in Week 18 to clear 1,000 on the season -- an impressive milestone for any rookie receiver, and doubly so with Carolina's inconsistent quarterback play. McMillan is showing the physicality and catch radius that was promised of him when he was coming out of Arizona, and his route running has really shined as NFL-caliber despite his supersized frame. He looks the part of a three-level X receiver who can win over the middle of the field just as frequently as he wins jump balls against the sideline -- a Courtland Sutton-type of pass catcher.

Emeka Egbuka, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 stats: 62 receptions for 930 yards (15.0 yards per receiver) and 6 touchdowns

Drafted: Round 1, No. 19

Egbuka was far more productive in the first half of the season (34 catches, 562 yards, 5 touchdowns) than in the second (28 catches, 268 yards, 1 touchdown). But the entire Buccaneers offense experienced a downswing, and Egbuka still looks as detailed and smooth as ever on film. An ideal do-it-all receiver who can provide value as a blocker, a downfield threat and everything in between, Egbuka is the lone rookie to stand next to McMillan as a potential No. 1 receiver after one pro season.

Luther Burden III, Chicago Bears

2025 stats: 44 receptions for 617 yards (14.0 yards per reception) and 2 touchdowns

Drafted: Round 2, No. 39

It took time for Burden to get a foothold in Ben Johnson's thick and detailed playbook, but as the game has slowed down for him, he has cashed in on his opportunities and carved out a bigger role, culminating with his career-best 138-yard performance Sunday night against the 49ers. Burden has run at least 16 routes in every game since the Bears' Week 5 bye after never running more than 12 before it. In seven games post-bye, he has snagged 31 of 41 targets for 446 yards -- that's a 17-game pace of 75 catches on 100 targets for 1,083 yards.

Burden is a sudden movement player who can win on the outside, in the slot and with designed touches behind the line of scrimmage. He's still more of a screen/checkdown option than a downfield target, but that part of his game will come as he improves his play strength. With only two drops this season, Burden has earned more downfield opportunities entering Year 2.

Second team:Chimere Dike, Tennessee Titans;Pat Bryant, Denver Broncos;andJayden Higgins, Houston Texans. Dike gets an additional boost for his return ability -- he set a record for all-purpose yards in a rookie season! Higgins has come along late and wonderfully so for an ascending Texans offense, while Bryant's contested catch and blocking abilities shine -- two traits in which rookie receivers often struggle.

Tight end

Harold Fannin Jr., Cleveland Browns

2025 stats: 72 receptions for 731 yards (10.2 yards per reception) and 6 touchdowns; 1 rushing touchdown

Drafted: Round 3, No. 67

You're forgiven if you haven't been dialed in to the season Fannin is having in Cleveland. He has emerged as a unique threat as a movement piece (using pre-snap motion) in Cleveland's offense by creating huge hidden yardage with broken tackles on screens and jump balls over the middle of the field. Fannin is only the ninth tight end since the merger with 700-plus receiving yards in his rookie season.

Fannin already has some of the best change-of-direction skills at the position, and his instincts as a tackle breaker are excellent. It's fair to expect him to become a Sam LaPorta-esque producer, and his ceiling is in the range of Trey McBride and prime Travis Kelce as team-leading target-getters who can be used at all three levels of the field.

Second team:Colston Loveland, Chicago Bears. I had the Colts' Tyler Warren in this spot until Sunday night, when Loveland posted a quality six-catch, 94-yard performance. It's razor thin between the two first-rounders. Were it not for Warren's quarterbacking situation going down the drain, he'd likely still take this spot. Loveland has the edge as a blocker and catcher outside of his frame, while Warren wins as a tackle breaker and has a greater variety of routes in his bag. Both look like bona fide No. 1 tight ends and game-plan-worthy playmakers.

Left tackle

Kelvin Banks Jr., New Orleans Saints

2025 stats: 16 starts, 87.7% pass block win rate, 76.1% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 9

One of the quieter first-round picks, Banks has slid easily into New Orleans' left tackle spot and taken on a veteran's workload with aplomb. Rarely given tight end or chip help, Banks has been an above-average pass protector and has the quickness and flexibility that elite pass protectors often have. Those movement skills translate into the running game, where Banks has been a high-impact blocker as a puller and climber. The Saints got a good one.

Second team:Josh Simmons, Kansas City Chiefs. I don't think Simmons would have knocked Banks out of the first-team spot if he had been healthy the whole season, but it sure would have been close.

Left guard

Grey Zabel, Seattle Seahawks

2025 stats: 16 starts, 89.2% pass block win rate, 83.1% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 18

Zabel would be the overall No. 1 offensive lineman on this All-Rookie team if positions were removed from the equation. He has been a little less consistent since his Week 11 knee injury, but his steadiness in pass protection before the injury looked like that of a 10-year veteran. Zabel has rarely been beat clean this season, and when it has happened, it has been by some of the league's best. If Zabel had the name recognition of a vet, he would have been a Pro Bowler this season.

Second team:Dylan Fairchild, Cincinnati Bengals. One of the least-known rookies on this list, Fairchild has gotten better each week and makes splash blocks with impressive quickness and core strength for his size. He was a developmental player coming out of Georgia and looks to be ahead of his curve. He's a nice middle-round find for the Bengals.

Center

Jonah Monheim, Jacksonville Jaguars

2025 stats: Two starts, 95.1% pass block win rate, 77.8% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 7, No. 221

Haven't heard of Monheim? I don't blame you. The seventh-round pick has played 187 snaps at center this season, which is ... 162 more than second place. For those 187 snaps, he is our first-team center. (The film against the Colts this past Sundaywas ... not great!)

Second team:Drew Kendall, Philadelphia Eagles. Kendall has played 25 snaps at center, which gives him the slight edge for No. 2 center on the All-Rookie team over Seahawks rookie Bryce Cabeldue, who has played ... six snaps.

Right guard

Tyler Booker, Dallas Cowboys

2025 stats: 13 starts, 93.7% pass block win rate, 76.0% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 12

Booker moves people. It's a sight to see. He's already one of the most imposing guards in the downhill running game, and while his sheer size will always create some disadvantages on the move or against quick pass rushers, he's much better in pass protection than expected for a rookie of his heavy-footedness. In Booker's best games, he has been a key engine of the Cowboys' offensive success, and that will continue for years to come.

Second team:Tate Ratledge, Detroit Lions. Ratledge has been about as good as you'd expect for a second-round offensive lineman. The shaky play around him has limited his ceiling, but he's a clear starter for the duration of his rookie contract.

Right tackle

Armand Membou, New York Jets

2025 stats: 16 starts, 91.7% pass block win rate, 79.6% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 7

Membou occasionally gets beat clean or suffers a rookie mental lapse. But snap to snap, he has a solid floor and a high ceiling in pass protection due to his tremendous grip strength and the reach to catch and control speedy rushers. The Jets' best runs and screens have often come to the offensive right on the back of Membou's ability to uproot defensive linemen and carve out running lanes. He's an impactful player.

Second team:Josh Conerly Jr., Washington Commanders. Conerly was getting worked in the first month of the season but found his sea legs as of late. If he can continue this developmental arc into Year 2, the Commanders will be set at right tackle throughout his rookie deal.

Edge rusher

Abdul Carter, New York Giants

2025 stats: 43 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries

Drafted: Round 1, No. 3

My All-Rookie team is not particularly concerned with attending team meetings on time or paying attention while in them; we just like good players on the football field, and Carter sure is one. He is first among all defensive linemen in quick pressures with 44, and his time to pressure of 2.41 seconds is leaps and bounds above second place (2.57 seconds) among edge rushers. Carter must learn how to convert his incredible first step into more targeted rushes that end with sacks, but the bones of his play are tremendous. He looks like a future double-digit sack artist.

Jalon Walker, Atlanta Falcons

2025 stats: 33 tackles, 5.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 1 fumble recovery

Drafted: Round 1, No. 15

Walker was a tweener coming out of Georgia but has spent 90% of his snaps on the edge -- and to great effect. His football IQ leaps off the film, as he regularly sees blocks developing fast enough to slip, shed and create havoc in the defensive backfield. Pound for pound, the 6-foot-2, 245-pound Walker is tough to uproot and has more power as a pass rusher than expected. His ability to drop into coverage is also integral to defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich's pressure packages. Walker is a high-impact player for his dirty work in the margins.

Second team:Donovan Ezeiruaku, Dallas Cowboys;andJames Pearce Jr., Atlanta Falcons.Ezeiruaku looked a bit like a luxury pick in April, but once Micah Parsons was traded to Green Bay in August, he suddenly became a key part of Dallas' rotation. Ezeiruaku has the tools of a productive outside pass rusher, but it's his play against the run at 6-foot-2, 248 pounds that really impresses. Ezeiruaku is behind only Carter among rookie edge rushers in run stop EPA and has eight tackles for zero yards or negative gain on the season.

Pearce is the sack artist he was billed to be in the leadup to the 2025 draft, leading all rookies with 8.5 sacks. His blistering 2.66-second time to pressure is ninth among all edges and third among all rookie edges, and he creates immediate opportunities for sacks with that wicked first step. Pearce is almost purely a pass-rush-down player at this point and struggles to hold the point of attack in the running game, so an offseason in the weight room is needed for him to become an every-down performer.

Defensive tackle

Deone Walker, Buffalo Bills

2025 stats: 39 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble, 12.5 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 4, No. 109

Once a prospective first-rounder thanks to his truly elite size (and great movement skills at 6-foot-7, 331 pounds), Walker fell in the draft after a poor final season at Kentucky. Buffalo struck gold when it took the risk in Round 4. Walker regularly takes on two blockers at the line of scrimmage, creates tackle-for-loss opportunities and makes high-effort pursuit plays into the boundary. He has also found more quick wins as a pass rusher than I expected. He'll get his hands into passing lanes, too -- and at his size, that's a big impediment for opponent QBs.

Elijah Roberts, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 stats: 13 tackles, 2 sacks, 1 fumble recovery, 3 passes defensed

Drafted: Round 5, No. 157

A fifth-rounder out of SMU, Roberts was not a big part of the rotation until Calijah Kancey went down with a torn pectoral in Week 2. Roberts has answered the call wonderfully. A college defensive end who is transitioning to defensive tackle, Roberts sometimes loses ground in the running game and needs some weight room work in the offseason. But he's slippery, with active hands and good lateral quickness. For a fifth-round rookie undergoing a positional switch, he has been very impressive.

Second team:Mason Graham, Cleveland Browns; and Walter Nolen III, Arizona Cardinals. If I did this list at the midway point of the season, Graham would not have made it. He was getting moved with ease in the running game and was providing little impact as a pass rusher. He overcame the rookie hump in the second half of the season, collecting 19 pressures in eight games after the Browns' bye relative to 11 pressures in the eight games before it. Graham still needs to be better when engaged -- he struggles to shed blocks without giving up ground -- but he is creating more quick wins, which is what the Browns drafted him to do.

Several defensive tackles played more snaps and had flashier plays than Nolen (such as the Steelers' Derrick Harmon, Dolphins' Kenneth Grant, Chargers' Jamaree Caldwell and Dolphins' Jordan Phillips). But Nolen's limited film is so good and so disruptive that I have to give him the nod over the field. A healthy sophomore season from Nolen could lead to eye-popping tackle-for-loss and pressure numbers given how naturally he won as a penetrator as a rookie.

Linebacker

Carson Schwesinger, Cleveland Browns

2025 stats: 159 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 interceptions, 13 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 2, No. 33

The easy pick for Defensive Rookie of the Year, Schwesinger is all that and a bag of chips. He is fast, physical, slippery, quick to see plays unfold, nimble, savvy before the snap, a great tackler on the move, improving as a zone dropper, productive around the football, aggressive in seeking splash plays and overall just really instinctive. He was dropped in an ideal run-and-chase system in Cleveland, but the alacrity with which he got up to NFL speed was something to see. Tackle stats are generally unreliable, but Schwesinger is one of five linebackers this century to post 150-plus tackles, 10-plus tackles for loss and 2-plus passes defensed in his rookie season. The other four are Kiko Alonso, Luke Kuechly, Shaquille Leonard and DeMeco Ryans. Good group.

Jihaad Campbell, Philadelphia Eagles

2025 stats: 70 tackles, 2 passes defensed, 2 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 1, No. 31

It's a little tricky to give a first-team nod to Campbell, who was pretty resoundingly removed from the starting lineup once Nakobe Dean returned from injury and regained his old form. From Weeks 12 to 15, Campbell played 26 total defensive snaps. But his film is still pretty good. And now that Dean is hurt again, Campbell is back to a full menu of snaps. Campbell makes bad rookie mistakes against misdirection and in coverage, but his peak plays of explosive speed, stopping power and turnover creation are a sight to see. He just ekes out the first-team selection ahead of the second-team picks below.

Second team:Teddye Buchanan, Baltimore Ravens; and Cody Simon, Arizona Cardinals. Buchanan wrested the starting job from incumbent Trenton Simpson early in the season and proved an impactful coverage player before a Week 15 ACL tear ended his rookie year prematurely. Buchanan could struggle against the league's more complex running games, but he was playing faster as the season went on, and his ability to cover ground in space minimized easy yardage for opposing offenses.

Simon is a bit of a ""best of the rest"" nod. He has been up and down when thrust into the starting lineup because of injuries ahead of him on the depth chart, but the rest of the field has been a lot more down than up. The Bengals, who are starting two rookie linebackers, would do anything to have a player like Simon in their building right now.

Cornerback

Will Johnson, Arizona Cardinals

2025 stats: 37 tackles, 10 passes defensed, 1 forced fumble

Drafted: Round 2, No. 47

Johnson's advanced metrics aren't great, and he has gotten cooked by some top receivers, but that's the reality of playing corner in the NFL. The body of work on film is still quite good. Johnson is an impressively fluid mover at his length and would benefit from a scheme that allows him to play closer to the line of scrimmage when tasked with man-coverage responsibilities. Johnson needs to stay healthy, but I'm willing to bet on his physical profile on a healthier defense for seasons to come.

Quincy Riley, New Orleans Saints

2025 stats: 31 tackles, 1 interception, 8 passes defensed

Drafted: Round 4, No. 131

A fourth-round pick out of Louisville, Riley got his first significant action in Week 3 and his first start in Week 5. But he took the starting job with both hands and refused to give it back. A sticky downfield corner with surprising physicality, Riley has impressive production at the catch point despite his size (5-foot-11, 195 pounds), detailing a highly encouraging future. Riley was only the No. 3 corner for the Saints this season and had some classic rookie mental snafus, but with Alontae Taylor being a rising free agent in 2026, Riley might end up a starter in all packages next season. He has earned it.

Second team:Denzel Burke, Arizona Cardinals; and Maxwell Hairston, Buffalo Bills. Burke has provided the ball production for the Cardinals' rookie cornerback duo, with three interceptions and 11 passes defensed on 52 targets. His ballhawk rate of 21.2% is 11th among all corners this season, rookie or otherwise, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Some of Burke's ball production has been fortuitous, and he did give up a 20-yard completion to an offensive lineman this week. But even with the warts in run support and issues tackling in space, Burke's production at the catch point is too valuable to ignore.

Hairston has 156 coverage snaps this season, which is just enough to qualify (it's a made-up list, so there are no real rules). Hairston has the speed, ball-tracking ability and ball skills of a true No. 1 cornerback with shadow ability, though his play is predictably up and down for a rookie who missed training camp. His lack of bulk will also be exposed by physical receivers and in run defense. Hairston barely beats out two more physical corners -- Nohl Williams (Chiefs) and Azareye'h Thomas (Jets) -- who have fewer splash plays. But man, both of those guys looked great, too. This is a good cornerback class.

Nickel

Jacob Parrish, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 stats: 73 tackles, 1 interception, 6 passes defensed, 2 sacks, 5 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 3, No. 84

Parrish has had a prototypical rookie season: a splash play here, a brutal rep there and a whole lot of vacillation in between. His film shows quickness, physicality and willingness to make plays against the run when facing bigger bodies. Parrish has the Bucs' nickel job secured and should see his play smooth out over time, but for a third-round pick thrust into immediate starting action, his season was far more good than bad.

Second team:Upton Stout, San Francisco 49ers. Stout is a perfect fit in the 49ers' secondary under Robert Saleh. Ferocious and undeterred, Stout will stick his nose into the fan with reckless abandon, regularly creating splash plays along with solo tackles in run support. Stout needs to play with faster eyes and feel in coverage, but he did well to minimize yards after the catch with his tackling ability. The peaks are very impressive, and if the game slows down for him, he'll generate a lot more forced incompletions

Safety

Jonas Sanker, New Orleans Saints

2025 stats: 78 tackles, 2 interceptions, 6 passes defensed

Drafted: Round 3, No. 93

One of my favorite rookies independent of position or draft capital, Sanker has shined in Brandon Staley's defense as a premier communicator and coverage player. He takes great angles, rarely false steps and doesn't get fooled by route distributions. Sanker looks like a 10-year vet but has the spry legs of a rookie, which allows him to make plays sideline to sideline. Sanker is also a reliable tackler at the third level and prevents explosive runs from becoming house calls. He is a rising star to watch.

Nick Emmanwori, Seattle Seahawks

2025 stats: 74 tackles, 1 interception, 11 passes defensed, 2.5 sacks, 5.5 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 2, No. 35

For as fun of a debut season as it has been, Emmanwori gets billed as a fusion between Kam Chancellor and Kyle Hamilton, which is a little too rich for my blood. But he is a highly disruptive player with length, closing speed and a nose for the football. He rarely misses tackles given his length and play strength, and he can rip through blocks to produce behind the line of scrimmage as well. On blitzes, Emmanwori is a true playmaker who must be accounted for at all times. Another offseason of work on coverage instincts and play recognition is needed for a player mostly operating on feel right now, but his ceiling is through the roof in that regard.

Second team:Xavier Watts, Atlanta Falcons; and Malaki Starks, Baltimore Ravens. There were three great safety seasons from rookies, and only two first-team spots. Watts was easier to slot into the second team before his two-interception performance on ""Monday Night Football"" -- he now leads all rookies with five interceptions. Watts has tremendous feel for route combinations and spacing, which allows him to anticipate route breaks with unreal quickness. Doubly impressive is Watts' ability to play on the roof and in the box. He also has a sky-high ceiling.

Starks would be a first-teamer in many other seasons. A true center fielder, he doesn't see the ball often but tracks it well and addresses it at the highest point. He doesn't experience mental lapses as often as expected for a rookie, especially in the Ravens' tricky defense. Starks barely gets the nod over Malachi Moore, a fourth-rounder who has brought impressive physicality to the box for a Jets defense in need of tone-setters. Moore is one to watch as well.

Not only did they celebrate a 42-10 victory over the New York Jets that was very much uncontested, they also ended up clinching the AFC East later on Sunday.

As the cherry on top, they also caught a much-needed break on the injury front. After sustaining some losses in recent weeks, there are no obvious concerns coming out of their latest game. Let’s assess the damage.

Patriots injury analysis: Week 17

QB Drake Maye: The Patriots’ starting quarterback being a bit slow to get up after taking a hit to the head in the second quarter, drawing a roughing the passer penalty and prompting head coach Mike Vrabel to sprint onto the field, could have been a scary moment. It ultimately wasn’t, because Maye looked fine right away and remained in the game without showing any limitations from the play. He went 8-of-9 for 97 yards and a pair of touchdowns from that point on, and overall played one of the most productive games in recent memory.

FB Jack Westover: New England’s fullback remained down after a kickoff with 14:51 left in the fourth quarter, but walked off under own power. After some time in the blue medical tent, he returned to the sideline trying to walk the injury off. Ultimately, Westover did not reenter the game after he was announced as questionable to return with an ankle ailment.

CB Charles Woods: The Patriots’ backup quarterback, who entered the contest questionable with a foot issue, showcased some apparent discomfort in his back after unsuccessfully trying to break up an 18-yard pass in the late fourth quarter. Woods remained in the game and no injury was announced.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots were down seven players heading into their game against the Jets, but that list growing ahead of the season finale seems unlikely: New England escaped without any obvious major injuries. The biggest question mark is Jack Westover, but head coach Mike Vrabel gave a positive update on his status on Monday.

“Sore, probably could have returned,” Vrabel said. “We’ll monitor him here in the next couple days. I don’t think it’s anything that is too significant, but we’ll just see how he progresses here when we get back to work.”

The Patriots will hold their first practice of the week on Wednesday, and will release an injury report later that day. They will host the Miami Dolphins in their regular season finale at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 4.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2253193017.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.2577102278641%2C100%2C34.908403200398&w=1200,N,,2025-12-30 09:59:04.646432
,,2025-12-30 10:43:26+00:00,The Athletic,Reece James has gone a whole year injury-free. Both he and Chelsea deserve credit,"Simon Johnson, Cerys Jones",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6923198/2025/12/30/reece-james-chelsea-premier-league-injury-free/,"Reece James’ 2025 has been peppered with landmarks in his Chelsea career, and he will end the year with another.
On May 25, Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time under James’ captaincy.
Given how injuries have disrupted the 26-year-old’s career to date, that is a huge achievement — for which both player and club deserve credit.
“He’s growing in terms of leadership, he’s growing also in terms of (as a) player, because he’s playing more and more minutes.
At a time when Chelsea need strong leadership, James’ continued fitness and growth are surely one of the biggest positives to take from 2025.","Reece James’ 2025 has been peppered with landmarks in his Chelsea career, and he will end the year with another.

On May 25, Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time under James’ captaincy. Three days later, he lifted his first trophy as captain when Chelsea won the Conference League, and on July 13, he added another with victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. October 18 saw James reach 200 appearances for his boyhood club on their trip to Nottingham Forest.

Tonight, when Chelsea host Bournemouth, will mark another milestone: one year injury-free. After a hamstring injury in November 2024, James returned to Enzo Maresca’s matchday squad on December 30 for their 2-0 defeat away at Ipswich Town and, bar a brief illness in March, has been fit ever since.

Given how injuries have disrupted the 26-year-old’s career to date, that is a huge achievement — for which both player and club deserve credit.

“The fact that he’s been able to sustain a good period without injury is definitely a positive sign for him going forward,” says physiotherapist Luke Anthony, who has not worked with James but provided The Athletic with a general view from his time at Watford, Reading, and Norwich City.

“I think probably the biggest difference with him is he’s been able to get on a run (of games) and he’s had a period of adaptation where he has developed that robustness.

“What may have happened is either that he has just been able to develop that consistency of training and develop strength in his body, (or) whether he has changed his approach.”

Two statistics from Chelsea’s festive fixtures highlight the improvement in James’ availability.

He made his 50th club appearance of 2025 against Aston Villa on Saturday, the highest figure he has reached in a calendar year since 2021. Hamstring and knee problems have particularly plagued James, and across the past three full seasons, he has averaged 22.3 appearances in all competitions per campaign. He has already made 22 appearances this season with five months remaining.

The club’s medical team, led by Bryce Cavanagh, have managed James carefully. Ben Macdonald, one of Chelsea’s rehab physios, has been tasked with working closely with James on his fitness and the two have developed a strong rapport.

James is also an example of how Chelsea believe their approach to load management can pay off. As The Athletic have reported, this season has seen a deliberate strategy of carefully managing players’ minutes, led by the medical and performance team.

The graph below shows James’ rolling minutes-per-game average. Previously, steep drops were followed by sharp peaks as he was introduced to a heavy load quickly after returning. Since his return in January, his minutes have been managed more carefully.

“It makes perfect sense to take longer with the return to play,” Anthony says. “There is such a huge gap between a few days or a week of training and then being able to sustain 90 minutes of high-intensity Premier League football game by game.

“Sometimes with these soft-tissue injuries, you don’t necessarily get the warning signs, and the player plays and feels OK. Then the temptation is to use him again, especially if they’re an important player in your team.”

Anthony explains the importance of patience as a player’s tissues adapt to the load of professional football after a lay-off. “It takes a period of time to develop that, especially when you’re coming back from injury. Otherwise, you are more vulnerable to that injury.”

A tweak to James’ position could also have helped his continued fitness. The idea of using him in midfield is not new; in the days after Maresca’s appointment, the head coach sent James footage of him playing in midfield when on loan at Wigan Athletic in the 2018-19 season and suggested they could explore that.

It has become increasingly common to see the Chelsea captain playing in a defensive-midfield role, and as well as yielding impressive performances, Anthony suggests the shift might also have helped reduce the strain on his muscles.

“(Wide players) generally have an exposure to more distance of high-speed running and more sprints, more one-v-ones in those areas offensively and defensively. The central positions will generally have less distance of sprints and high-speed running.

“As a midfielder, you’ll have more distance covered, but you’ll likely have fewer offensive and defensive sprints, which are again, slightly more attritional for a soft-tissue injury.”

James himself is also credited for his hard work, with one source close to the player — speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships — saying it is like he lives at the training ground. The individual work he has done includes working with his own external physiotherapist, in addition to the support he is given by Chelsea.

Hand in hand with James’ improved availability has been his growth as a leader, which has been noticed around the club.

“I spoke with him, and I expected more from him in terms of leadership, inside the changing room and for different kinds of things,” Maresca said of James in October 2024. “He’s one of the captains. I expected from him, and his team-mates expected from him, to give always more in terms of leadership in general.”

Naturally, being on the pitch more often has helped James’ leadership, and he has responded well to Maresca’s challenge. As he has grown into the captaincy, he has expressed himself more and his increased comfort in media interviews has been noticed at Chelsea. He is described as having the respect of everyone at the club.

James’ maturity was evident in his post-match interview with Sky Sports on Saturday, when he said Chelsea “have ourselves to blame” for errors that cost them in the 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.

“Absolutely, yes,” Maresca said when asked in his press conference ahead of the Villa match if James was now playing and behaving like the captain he wanted. “He’s growing in terms of leadership, he’s growing also in terms of (as a) player, because he’s playing more and more minutes.

“We are all happy, first of all, because he can be fit, he can be healthy. And then because we know that he can behave as a leader.”

Chelsea have supported their captain throughout his injury troubles. In September 2022, he signed a contract that runs until 2028. Chelsea’s general policy is not to hold contract talks during the season, wanting players to focus on the campaign, and prefer to do so in summer. Even if James travels to the World Cup in 2026 with England as expected, that does not necessarily mean an agreement could not be reached this summer; Cole Palmer, for instance, signed a new deal in August 2024 after the European Championship.

At a time when Chelsea need strong leadership, James’ continued fitness and growth are surely one of the biggest positives to take from 2025.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/11094644/GettyImages-2224957390-scaled-e1762872425466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 10:15:31.344799

According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, the Bears believe that strongside linebacker Noah Sewell tore his Achilles in their 42-38 loss to the 49ers on Sunday Night Football. He suffered an ankle injury in the third quarter and rode the cart into the locker room.

“#Bears LB Noah Sewell, who has been a key part of the defense, especially with all the injuries to the position, is believed to have torn his Achilles, sources say. He’ll have an MRI to confirm,” Rapoport wrote on X on December 29.

“Right before he was to play his brother, #Lions OT Penei Sewell, Noah is out.”

Sewell has been a core part of the Bears’ linebacker room for much of the 2025 season, missing three games with injuries but otherwise starting in their strongside role. He has 59 total tackles and three tackles for loss on a career-high 409 defensive snaps in 2025.

While the Bears have not yet announced Sewell’s Achilles injury, they will likely place him on the injured reserve list if Rapoport’s report is confirmed through more testing.

The Bears (11-5) will play their regular-season finale against the Detroit Lions (8-8) at home at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday, January 4.

Bears Have LB Depth to Endure Without Noah Sewell

Losing Sewell just two weeks before the start of the 2025 NFL playoffs is not ideal for the Bears, but the good news is they have been here before — for most of 2025, frankly.

The Bears have struggled to field their complete linebacker unit throughout the 2025 season. Middle linebacker T.J. Edwards missed seven of the first 12 games with a slew of injuries, including a hamstring issue that has nagged him since training camp.

Tremaine Edmunds — a 2025 breakout in the weakside role — also spent four games on injured reserve, only just returning for Week 16’s rematch with the Green Bay Packers.

Fortunately for Chicago, the Bears have received quality contributions from the backup linebackers when they have needed them, especially D’Marco Jackson — whom they claimed off waivers from New Orleans after the 53-man roster cutdown in August.

Jackson has played a career-high 249 defensive snaps in his first season with the Bears, recording 42 tackles, two tackles for loss, three pass deflections and a fumble recovery. He also added the first interception and sack of his career in Week 15’s win over the Cleveland Browns, earning him NFC Defensive Player of the Week recognition.

Look for him to step into Sewell’s shoes if the Bears shut down the latter on IR.

Luther Burden III Also Carted Off After Final Play vs. 49ers

The Bears also brought out the medical cart for rookie wide receiver Luther Burden III on Sunday night after he tried to walk off after the final play and dropped to his knees.

Burden had a breakout game against the 49ers, catching eight of his nine targets for 138 yards and a 35-yard touchdown in the first quarter. He is now one of four pass-catchers on the Bears’ roster with at least 40 receptions and 600 receiving yards on the season, and he has the best catch percentage (78.6) among them, hauling in 44 of 56 targets.

While the Bears did not have an update on Burden following the game, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported the following morning that Burden had injured his quad in the loss but that the team does not believe it is a serious injury. Even still, it is unclear whether Burden will need to miss time because of the injury, even if only Week 18’s finale.

“He will undergo additional testing today,” Schefter wrote on X on December 29.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253876068-e1767033764316.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-30 10:15:35.648359

Jake Matthews' streak nearly ended three years ago, and it had nothing to do with an injury.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons left tackle Jake Matthews left the ""Monday Night Football"" game against the Buffalo Bills in Week 6 with a high ankle sprain. In most cases, such an injury would keep an NFL player out for several weeks.

Not Matthews.

The 12-year veteran went back to doing what he always does when something like this happens. He takes it day-by-day, sets a goal for the following 24 hours and tries to get incrementally more ready to play as the week wears on.

""It's like, I try not to freak out and think, 'Am I going to play in this game?'"" Matthews told ESPN. ""Let's see how Wednesday feels.""

Sure enough, Matthews was back in the starting lineup for the Falcons' Week 7 game against the San Francisco 49ers. It's just what he does. Whether it's injuries or even the birth of his first child, Matthews has proved to be the NFL's Mr. Reliable.

""We know who he is,"" Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. ""We know what he doesn't miss.""

Last week, Matthews started his 193rd straight game, making his streak the fifth-longest since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger among offensive linemen. When he starts Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams, Matthews will tie former Cleveland Browns' lineman Doug Dieken for fourth on that list.

Matthews, 33, also holds the NFL's longest-active consecutive games started streak. Chicago Bears safety Kevin Byard III is a distant second with 162. No NFL player has started as many games in a row as Matthews since quarterback Philip Rivers, who had a 240-game streak when he retired in 2020, before coming back for the Indianapolis Colts last week.

What makes Matthews' streak unique is that the offensive lineman with the longest such streak since the merger is Matthews' father Bruce, a Hall of Famer who played 19 seasons in the league. Bruce started 229 straight games from 1987 to 2021.

Matthews' grandfather Clay Sr. played in the NFL, as did his father, an uncle (Clay Jr.), a cousin (Clay III) and a brother (Kevin).

""Anytime you can play that long, stay that healthy, be that reliable, heal that quickly, recover that well, it's extremely unique,"" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said. ""I think the genetics have to play a factor at some point. Not just his dad, but his uncle, his cousins. It's pretty incredible, and I would love to do a genetic test on their family and then have it line up against my own and see where the gaps are.""

The only game Matthews missed was the second of his career, in 2014. Matthews suffered a leg injury, and at the team's family dinner after the game, Bruce told him he better get his Normatec boots on for recovery, because ""you have to play next Sunday.""

""And he shared that story with me and it was cool,"" Falcons Pro Bowl right guard Chris Lindstrom said. ""Just that approach of like, 'Yeah, you got to get going.' So, I think his mindset and his mind are as powerful as anything.""

Jake Matthews said there's a genetic element to it, but there's also preparation, work ethic, nutrition, his faith and an iron will.

Bruce joked that during his era getting ready for a game consisted of ""an ice bag and how do you feel Sunday morning?"" Now, he sees the kind of work his son does to get ready every week, which includes steam rooms, cold plunges and infrared saunas.

""Obviously starting in the offseason with his workouts, but he's got a whole regimen that he goes through every evening and I'm like, 'Yeah, I don't want to miss any games, but I don't know if I'm that committed,'"" Bruce told ESPN.

Jake Matthews' streak nearly ended three years ago, and it had nothing to do with an injury.

In 2022, Matthews and his wife, Meggi, were set to have their first child, a son named Beckett Thomas. Meggi ended up going into labor early the morning of the Falcons' Thursday night game against the Carolina Panthers -- in Charlotte.

A Falcons security official ended up driving Matthews back to the Atlanta area, speeding down I-85 in a rental car. Matthews got to the hospital in time to help with the delivery process. He got to hold Beckett for 15 minutes and then was driven to owner Arthur Blank's private jet to head back to Charlotte for the game. Matthews arrived about 30 minutes before warmups.

""My wife is a godsend,"" Matthews said. ""She was all-in. She's a competitor, as well.

""She knew the cutoff when I had to leave was 3:30. She was looking at the clock the whole time. You want to talk about streaks and tough decisions and all that. 'Hey, let's see what happens.' And thankfully she made it happen, and I think the streak is more important to her than to me.""

Matthews said that Meggi will ask him once in a while how much longer he thinks he'll play. He is signed to the Falcons through 2028. His response is usually: ""Let's see how this week of practice goes.""

It's not like Matthews is just durable, either. A Pro Bowler in 2018, he has remained a consistently good left tackle for his entire career. This season, he is 14th in the NFL among tackles in pass block win rate (93%).

Matthews said he feels healthy, and while maybe he's closer to the end of his career than the beginning, he believes his knowledge and feel for the game have only continued to get better.

So, any talk of retirement might be premature. Matthews has more games to start. If he starts the final two games of this season, Matthews will be 35 games short of his dad's record. In other words, a little more than two years, if the NFL remains at 17 games in a regular season.

Matthews is not thinking about that, though. If he were prone to such things, he might not be in the situation he is in now.

""I get overwhelmed when I start looking and planning on the future,"" Matthews said. ""So, I'm gonna take it day-by-day.""

Will he just ride it until the wheels fall off?

""I'd love to,"" Matthews said. ""As long as the body can take it. And like I said, I feel great. So, Lord willing, that continues.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1226%2Fr1593821_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 04:58:20.112968

Week 18 will be one to remember as it's the final regular season home game at Highmark Stadium, and with the Bills not winning the division, it could be the last home game in the stadium, period.

""It'll be emotional,"" head coach Sean McDermott said. ""That stadium has been really good to us, it really has. I know I'll miss it.""

Sunday evening's game against the Jets will provide the Bills one more chance to make a lasting memory inside the 53-year-old building.

""We want to win the game. That's number one,"" McDermott said.

With the division out of reach, the Bills can climb no higher than the No. 5 seed in the AFC. Currently, they are the 7-seed but have the highest probability of moving up to the No. 6 seed with a victory over the Jets.

A loss to NYJ and the Bills will stay at 7 with no chance of hosting a playoff game. A jump to 5 or 6, and there's a small chance to host the AFC Championship should the top seeds falter.

As Buffalo begins its Week 18 prep, one of the key decisions from the team will be how they approach resting players while balancing the effort of trying to win and potentially improve their seed. The Bills coaching staff is still sorting through that process, including at quarterback.

""We talked a little bit (Sunday) night,"" McDermott said. ""Haven't had a lot of time just to isolate those situations — Josh Allen included.""

McDermott added that he anticipates having a clearer picture later in the week when practice resumes.

Injury Updates going into Week 18

Speaking of Allen, the quarterback had X-rays on his right foot following Sunday's defeat to the Eagles as he deals with soreness. The X-rays were negative and McDermott shared that Allen appears to be in a better spot physically the day after Week 17 than after the Browns Week 16 game.

""Maybe in a slightly better spot than the early part of last week, like he was. We'll just take it one day at a time and see how he does here through the week,"" McDermott said.

Buffalo released kicker Michael Badgley from the practice squad Monday afternoon with the anticipation of getting back Matt Prater who has been out the last two games with a right quad injury.

""Prater seems to be moving in the right direction. Don't know for sure yet, but feel like we're heading in the right direction there, and he should be back this week,"" McDermott said.

LB Terrel Bernard left the first half of the Eagles game with a calf injury and did not return. He has been ruled out by McDermott for the Jets game.

‘Best in the world’: Byron Murphy II shining for Seahawks’ defense

Trailing 27-10, the Raiders were driving in Giants territory when Smith threw a pass to Tyler Lockett, but was intercepted by safety Dane Belton.

In pursuit of Belton, Smith was inadvertently undercut by teammate Atonio Mafi, who started at left guard in place of Dylan Parham. Smith was helped from the field and went straight to the locker room.

“It looks like he does not have a high ankle sprain, but he sprained his ankle, and so we’ll see what that means,” Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said Monday. “I don’t know right now, but it’s significant, though. … We’ll just go day-to-day and see what’s happening, but it’s going to be hard for him to play, I think. It’ll be a challenge.”

Carroll, Smith and Lockett all reunited with each other in Vegas this year after departing from the Seattle Seahawks since the end of 2023 season.

The Raiders lost 34-10 on Sunday and fell to 2-14 with their 10th consecutive defeat. With the worst record in the NFL and one week remaining, Las Vegas is now in position to land the No. 1 draft pick in 2026.

Smith, who was 20 of 28 for 176 yards with one touchdown and a 69.9 rating, was sacked three times and hurried nine times. Smith has thrown a league-high 17 interceptions this season.

Las Vegas has already shut down defensive end Maxx Crosby, tight end Brock Bowers and safety Jeremy Chinn, and considering this is the second time Smith has left a game this month, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the 35-year-old done for the season.

The Raiders also lost defensive lineman Adam Butler to a biceps injury during the game.

Up next Rams: The Rams will try to build on their 6-1 home record when they play the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday in their final regular-season game.
Falcons: Atlanta closes its season at home on Sunday against New Orleans.","ATLANTA -- — A Los Angeles Rams team that spent most of the season competing for the best record in the NFL now is third in its division, saddled with a two-game losing streak and bound to open the playoffs on the road.

“This is a humbling league and we got humbled tonight,” Rams coach Sean McVay said after a 27-24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night.

Bijan Robinson rushed for 195 yards, including a 93-yard touchdown, and Zane Gonzalez kicked a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds remaining as the Falcons recovered after blowing two 21-point leads.

Robinson's 93-yard touchdown run was the longest in Atlanta history and Jessie Bates III scored on a 34-yard interception return. Bolstered by those big plays, the Falcons led 21-0 at halftime and 24-3 early in the second half.

Matthew Stafford recovered from throwing three interceptions to help the Rams (11-5) pull even at 24. Stafford's 11-yard touchdown pass to Puka Nacua with 2:46 remaining tied the game.

“I love the way that we found a way to get back in the game, but we weren't able to close it out,” McVay said.

The Falcons (7-9) extended their winning streak to three games as Robinson also set the team record for most scrimmage yards in a season.

The Rams began the week leading the NFL in scoring and yards and were shut out in the first half. After trailing 21-0 at halftime, the Rams were kept out of the end zone until Stafford's 27-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Ferguson late in the third quarter.

Los Angeles cut Atlanta's lead to 24-17 when Jarred Verse blocked a 37-yard field goal attempt by Gonzalez and returned the recovery 76 yards for a touchdown. It was the Rams' first blocked kick returned for a touchdown since 1986.

Stafford's second interception, on a throw picked off by Atlanta rookie Xavier Watts, gave the Falcons the ball at their 7 in the second quarter. Robinson broke through the line and took off down the sideline, outrunning the Los Angeles defense for the NFL's longest run of the season.

“He’s a special player,” Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said. “What he can do in both the run game and pass game is very unique.”

Watts' second interception, the third thrown by Stafford, stopped the Rams on a fourth-down play from the Atlanta 27 with 9:04 remaining.

Falcons coach Raheem Morris credited cornerback A.J. Terrell and the defense for limiting Nacua to five catches for 47 yards.

“I think the defensive staff did a great job again, limiting a great football player,” Morris said.

Scrimmage yards record

Robinson needed 151 rushing and receiving yards to break William Andrews’ team scrimmage yards record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson had five catches for 34 yards, including a 4-yard touchdown reception, to finish with 229 scrimmage yards in the game and 2,255 for the year.

Sudden surge of interceptions

Stafford, who earned his third Pro Bowl honor this season, began the week leading the NFL in touchdown passes and passing yards. He had thrown only five interceptions before his turnover-plagued effort against the Falcons.

Stafford completed 22 of 38 passes for 269 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions. He has a career-best 42 touchdown passes this season.

It was his first three-interception game since Week 1 of 2022.

“It boils down to execution every week, right?” Stafford said. “Either you execute and make the throws or you don’t. And I didn’t do that tonight, so it hurt us and we weren’t able to overcome it.”

Credit to the blockers

Robinson gave thanks to his line and wide receiver Drake London for the key blocks on his 93-yard scoring run. London had a downfield block on a defensive back to help clear Robinson's path.

“It takes everybody for those kind of runs to happen,” Robinson said.

Rams starters will play

McVay didn't hesitate when asked if his starters would rest in Sunday's final regular-season game against Arizona.

“No, we're playing,” McVay said. “We were playing anyway. We need to play.”

The Rams will open the playoffs on the road, an outcome that was set after NFC West rivals Seattle and San Francisco both won on Sunday. They entered the night as the No. 5 seed.

As teams prepare for Week 18, health has become just as decisive as matchups, altering postseason positioning and forcing difficult decisions across both conferences. This Week 17 injury roundup highlights the most impactful situations and examines how the latest injury developments could influence playoff momentum heading into January.

Several contenders absorbed major blows over the weekend, while others watched key contributors fight through injuries in games that carried significant stakes. As playoff-related injuries continue to mount, coaching staffs are now walking a fine line between urgency and preservation. The final Sunday of the regular season will test not only roster depth, but judgment.

Luther Burden III delivered another statement performance for the Chicago Bears before suffering a frightening injury late in a loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The Bears wide receiver went down with a quadriceps injury on the final play of a 42-38 loss to the 49ers and was carted off after finishing with 138 receiving yards and a touchdown. Burden has already shattered multiple franchise rookie records and remains the focal point of Chicago’s offense. Early indications suggest the injury may not be severe, but his status for the Week 18 matchup vs. the Detroit Lions remains uncertain. With playoff seeding and divisional positioning at stake, his availability could significantly impact the NFC North race.

Trent Williams suffered one of the most unusual injuries of the weekend. The 49ers left tackle strained his hamstring on the opening play while chasing down a defender following an interception. Despite scoring 38 points without him, San Francisco’s offensive structure changes dramatically when Williams is absent. Hamstring injuries are particularly troublesome for linemen, and any missed time would leave Brock Purdy exposed on his blindside during a critical push for the conference’s top seed.

Jordan Love continues to shape the Green Bay Packers’ postseason outlook without taking a snap. The Packers quarterback missed Week 17 while recovering from a concussion sustained the previous week, with a lingering shoulder issue further complicating his recovery timeline. Without Love, Green Bay’s offense struggled to maintain rhythm and sustain drives, placing additional stress on its defense. Week 18 carries major playoff implications, and Love’s clearance through protocol could determine whether the Packers can truly compete or simply attempt to survive.

Geno Smith suffered what appears to be a season-ending injury for the Las Vegas Raiders. The Raiders quarterback sustained a high ankle sprain late in a loss to the New York Giants after his foot was stepped on during an interception attempt. High ankle sprains typically require an extended recovery period, effectively bringing his 2025 season to an end. With Smith sidelined, Las Vegas shifts fully into evaluation mode, using Week 18 to assess younger players and begin shaping offseason plans.

Sauce Gardner attempted to return for the Indianapolis Colts but exited early after re-aggravating a calf injury. After missing three games, Gardner returned only to experience tightness in the same leg, prompting Indianapolis to remove him as a precaution. Soft tissue injuries often linger, and with playoff hopes still alive, the potential loss of the Colts’ top cornerback would be a significant setback. Indianapolis’ defensive scheme relies heavily on Gardner’s ability to neutralize opposing top receivers.

Amon-Ra St. Brown appeared on the injury report as a day-to-day concern after exiting late in the Detroit Lions’ Week 17 clash with the Minnesota Vikings due to a knee issue. St. Brown remains the engine of the Lions’ passing attack and Jared Goff’s most trusted option on third down. Detroit hosts the Chicago Bears in Week 18 with division implications looming, and any limitation would force the Lions to adjust their offensive approach against a Bears defense built on consistent pressure.

Several other injuries quietly reshaped rosters across the league. Darnell Washington suffered a broken arm for the Pittsburgh Steelers, ending his season and weakening their run-blocking packages. Davante Adams aggravated a hamstring issue for the Los Angeles Rams, raising the possibility of rest as Los Angeles shifts its focus toward the future. Marvin Harrison Jr. played limited snaps for the Arizona Cardinals due to a lingering heel injury, suggesting another reduced role in Week 18.

Rashid Shaheed entered concussion protocol for the Seattle Seahawks, placing his availability in doubt at a critical time. Noah Sewell tore his Achilles for the Chicago Bears, delivering a devastating blow to linebacker depth and special teams contributions. Terrel Bernard’s calf injury now places the Buffalo Bills’ defensive communication at risk entering the postseason, where cohesion and timing become increasingly vital.

As the NFL approaches its final Sunday, injuries may shape outcomes more than matchups. The Bears and Lions prepare to face off while carefully managing star receivers. The 49ers’ pursuit of the top seed hinges on protection up front, while the Packers and Colts wait anxiously on medical updates that could ultimately determine their playoff fates.

The Rams concluded a long week of prep with multiple starters still in flux: Davante Adams (hamstring) is listed as doubtful after missing last week; right guard Kevin Dotson (ankle) has been ruled out; and defensive back Josh Wallace is out, while Alaric Jackson and Braden Fiske are questionable. Sean McVay also indicated that Roger McCreary could be activated off IR to help in the slot.

Meanwhile, the Falcons enter with a sizable injury list but received encouraging updates on Drake London (knee), with head coach Raheem Morris saying he feels “great” about London’s chances to play.

The Rams will lean on Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams, and Puka Nacua to sustain drives behind a reshuffled offensive line with Kevin Dotson out and Alaric Jackson questionable.

With Davante Adams unlikely to play, expect increased usage for Tutu Atwell and tight end Colby Parkinson, with formation variety to protect the right side and maintain timing routes. Defensively, the Rams’ interior, Kobie Turner, and the edge group must compress lanes against Bijan Robinson while keeping Kirk Cousins in structure.

Atlanta’s outlook improves materially if Drake London plays; his presence enhances spacing for Kyle Pitts and opens quick-game rhythm for Cousins. With multiple Falcons corners out (Mike Hughes, Clark Phillips), the Falcons’ secondary depth will be tested, placing a premium on pass rush and tackling at the catch point.

“We’re playing to win this week,” Johnson said on Monday.

Not that the Bears should be coasting yet, even against Johnson’s former boss Dan Campbell and a Lions team now out of the playoff chase. The Bears still have the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs to lock up with a win, and with it home field for the divisional round should they win their wild-card round playoff game at Soldier Field.

It will be difficult to do with defensive production like they had in Sunday night’s 42-38 loss at San Francisco.

Although they gave up a season-worst 496 yards, Johnson almost seemed to be trying to lift the confidence of the defense.

They did get a pick-6 on the game’s first play from scrimmage by linebacker T.J. Edwards, the first time this happened in an NFL game since Week 2 in 2023. They also forced the first punt by the 49ers since the end of November.

“It always comes back to fundamentals and so it’s gap integrity in terms of the run defense,” Johnson said of stopping the 49ers. “You know, we were playing a really good offense right now. So I think that needs to be stated because they’re averaging 35 points over the last five weeks. And so they’re hot.

“I didn’t feel like our offense did our part in the first half. We did not possess the ball. We had a couple three-and-outs. You look at our defense and they got a pick-6, they got a couple punts, and if we bow up in the red zone I think we feel better about (the defense’s) performance and that’s not to take anything away from San Fran, they did a great job, but there are certainly things fundamentally that we can improve on and we’re going to look to address this week.”

Maybe the most troubling aspect for the Bears was red zone defense.

Green Bay went 0-for-5 at scoring touchdowns in the red zone in Week 16. The 49ers went 5-for-5.

“Each week is a little bit different,” Johnson said. “Every offense has a different red zone story to them. They simply executed better than we did with their plan.”

They’ll hope to improve this plan Sunday or they could wind up with a third seed in the playoffs.

What’s working

Passing. Caleb Williams’ 330 passing yards Sunday were a season high and the Bears accomplished this despite a foot injury that kept receiver Rome Odunze sidelined, and an illness that kept receiver Olamide Zaccheaus from playing. Their pass blocking held up despite tackle Darnell Wright playing with an illness that kept him from taking a Saturday flight with the team to California.

Wright flew in by himself on Sunday, the day of the game.

What needs help

Run defense. They gave up 200 yards rushing, 8 more than when they struggled the previous week, and this looked much worse. Christian McCaffrey had runs of 41, 17 and 16 yards in a season’s best 140-yard effort, but the 49ers had been struggling to run all season. They came into the game averaging 3.6 yards per carry, which ranked next to last in the NFL.

Stock up

WR Luther Burden. The rookie shook off an ankle injury that sidelined him against Green Bay and had career highs of eight receptions for 138 yards while also catching a TD pass. He only was on the field for 38 of the 66 offensive plays.

Stock down

WR DJ Moore. He went from being the star against Green Bay with a spectacular 46-yard TD catch in tight coverage for the overtime win to making only one reception for 7 yards against San Francisco. In Moore’s defense, he was a late addition to the injury report with an illness sweeping through the team, but gutted out the game and participated in 92% of offensive plays.

Injuries

Linebacker Noah Sewell suffered an Achilles tendon injury Sunday but Johnson did not update its severity. An NFL Network report said Sewell suffered a torn Achilles tendon. ... Defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka is in the NFL concussion protocol.

Key number

23 — After Sunday’s game, Williams has 23 games in his career when he hasn’t thrown an interception. No starting NFL quarterback has done this in his first two NFL seasons. Williams broke the mark held by Dak Prescott of 22 games without one in his first two seasons.

Next steps

The Bears try to avenge a 52-21 loss they had in Week 2 at Detroit against the Lions (8-8), who have lost three straight.

Micah Parsons injury update

Parsons had surgery 15 days after going down with a torn ACL in the Packers' Week 15 game at the Denver Broncos.

He sustained the noncontact injury while running after Broncos quarterback Bo Nix late in the third quarter, ending his first season with the Packers in crushing fashion.

Parsons waited to have surgery following the birth of his third child in the Dallas area.

A player is typically out with an ACL injury between nine and 12 months. Parsons has implied on social media that his goal is to return by the start of next season in September and defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley predicted the All-Pro player will come back better than ever and break the NFL sack record in 2026.

Parsons understands the long road ahead.

On Christmas, Parsons said he had ""accepted the pain and the reality of this journey.""

""Some days are heavy, some days aren't but every day brings its own fight,"" he added. ""My courage, my strength, and my mind have all been tested. Still, I won't stop. I won't quit until I'm back. I'm grateful God chose me.""

As the playoffs loom, the Packers (9-6-1) are hurting without Parsons. Green Bay hasn't won a game since Parsons' injury and their defense was just smacked around and steamrolled by Derrick Henry and the Baltimore Ravens in a 41-24 loss on Dec. 27.

Micah Parsons reflects on first sack as a Packer

Before his surgery on Dec. 29, Parsons was reminiscing about his electric start as a Packer.

Parsons was on a snap count after he missed training camp with a back injury, but he made his presence felt late in a Week 1 win against the Detroit Lions at Lambeau Field when he chased down Jared Goff for his first sack wearing a Packers uniform.

Matthew Stafford’s Rams no longer have an NFC West title or a No. 1 seed to chase, and they've already locked in a wild-card spot. But Monday's game will be the final chance for a 17-year quarterback to make a statement on national TV in an attempt to win his first MVP award.

Stafford leads the NFL with 40 touchdown passes and has thrown just five interceptions to lead the Rams to an 11-4 record. New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is hot on his tail in this race. Stafford will have to play without the NFL's leader in touchdown catches, Davante Adams, as well as his left tackle, Alaric Jackson. If Stafford can put up a big performance on primetime despite that, it could become the final statement in this tight race.

Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is second in the league in receiving yards (1,592) and third in catches (114), and Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said his full value to Los Angeles doesn’t show even in those impressive numbers.

“He’s such an energy giver to them,” Ulbrich said. “You can see the collective energy he brings. When he makes a play, every single offensive player acknowledges him and he acknowledges them.”

Ulbrich compared Nacua to Arizona’s Trey McBride in that regard. McBride leads the league with 119 catches but had only three for 27 yards last week against the Falcons. Stopping Nacua will be a much tougher task, though. While Atlanta safeties Jessie Bates and Xavier Watts could handle McBride, the Falcons’ cornerbacks will have to take the lion’s share of the job against Nacua, and that’s unlikely to turn out as well for Atlanta.

What I’ll be watching when the Falcons host the Rams tonight:

Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford will be making just his third professional start in Atlanta tonight. Stafford, the top pick in the 2009 draft, played collegiately at Georgia. His last appearance against the Falcons in Atlanta came in 2020 when he was with the Lions.

Stafford, who is 3-3 all-time against Atlanta, has a history with the Falcons’ coaching staff as both head coach Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson were with Los Angeles before going to Atlanta.

What Morris and Robinson know about Stafford does not make them eager to face him.

“He’s playing at a completely different level than anybody in the league,” Robinson said. “He’s arguably the most natural and talented thrower in the history of the game. He’s unbelievable in every aspect in life. Can’t say how much I learned from him as a coach.”

Stafford enters the game in the MVP race. He leads the NFL with 40 touchdown passes (along with just five interceptions) and is fourth in EPA per dropback (.20). Morris refers to the quarterback as “Weapon X.”

“You are left in awe a lot,” Morris said.

Stafford has eight touchdowns and four interceptions in his career against the Falcons.

Falcons rookie edge rusher James Pearce Jr. will be in the spotlight tonight. Atlanta drafted Pearce with the 26th pick, which it acquired from the Rams in a trade that included the Falcons’ 2026 first-round pick. Atlanta believed at the time that this season would go much differently than it has and that 2026 pick would be in the 20s. However, Atlanta would be picking 12th if the season ended right now, and the Rams can improve the deal even more by beating the Falcons tonight.

“I think (the media) are the only guys that care about that,” Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said of tonight’s impact on the trade. “We gave up our first round pick, went and got James Pearce who we felt like would be a first-round pick for us this year. I like James a lot.”

Pearce leads Atlanta with 8.5 sacks and has had at least half a sack in seven straight games. He is the third-betting favorite for defensive rookie of the year and could become a serious contender for the award with a big game tonight in primetime.

Pearce has helped the Falcons completely revamp their pass rush, which has been the league’s worst for the past 20 years. Atlanta is third in the league in sacks this year with 50. Five more would tie the franchise record of 55 set in 1997.

The Falcons are stuck right in the middle of mediocrity. They are going to miss the playoffs for the eighth straight season (their last trip coming in 2017). They went 8-9 last season, and that is the best they can do this season, sitting at 6-9 with two games left.

Before that, the Falcons had three straight 7-10 seasons. So what will this offseason bring? It seems like team needs big changes in the coaching staff and the front office if it’s going to get back to the playoffs any time soon.

Does owner Arthur Blank have that in him to make those changes? That’s going to be the storyline of the Falcons’ offseason.

Here are the Los Angeles Rams’ inactive players against the Atlanta Falcons: WR Davante Adams, OT Alaric Jackson, OG Kevin Dotson, CB Josh Wallace, CB Darious Williams and RB Jarquez Hunter with Stetson Bennett as the emergency quarterback.

Adams was listed as doubtful for a second straight week with a hamstring injury, so it’s no surprise the NFL’s leader in touchdown receptions is out with the Rams out of contention for the NFC West and No. 1 seed.

But Jackson’s absence will be his first of the season. He is dealing with a knee injury. It’s a significant loss against a Falcons team that ranks third in the league with 50 sacks. Falcons defensive end James Pearce, whom Atlanta selected in the first round this spring through a trade with the Rams, will be a difficult matchup.

Los Angeles also made Williams a healthy scratch, pulling the veteran cornerback out of the rotation he’d been playing in on the outside with Cobie Durant and Emmanuel Forbes Jr.

This game will mark the return of Roger McCreary from injured reserve. With Wallace out, McCreary figures to get his first real action in the slot for the Rams since their midseason trade to get him from the Tennessee Titans.

Los Angeles Rams star receiver Puka Nacua ran a deep post route from the slot into free grass in zone coverage, hopped to catch a pass from Matthew Stafford and raced 41 yards to the end zone.

It should have been the finishing touch on a monstrous performance and the game-winning touchdown in overtime in a battle for the NFC’s No. 1 seed. But the Seattle Seahawks came back, scored and went for two and the win. And then he sent a tweet.

The questions began from there, both to coach Sean McVay and within the Rams’ organization after a game and a week from Nacua that packed so many highs and lows into one. A fantastic player remains completely unpredictable from snap to snap, stream to stream and tweet to tweet.

It leaves a question that many are left to ponder: Who exactly is Puka Nacua?

As the Atlanta Falcons settle into their spot on the Mercedes-Benz Stadium sideline before Monday night’s matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, Raheem Morris is hoping owner Arthur Blank will like what he sees enough to be patient.

In his second year as the Falcons’ head coach, Morris has been transparent about his desire to copy-and-paste much of the Rams’ system on the East Coast. But he enters the penultimate game of the season uncertain if he’ll be retained for a third year.

“We have definitely mimicked a lot of things that they do and want to continue to do that,” Morris said this week. “It’s done the right way, and being a part of it is a lot of fun.”

Matt Ryan is the greatest Atlanta Falcons player, but what could he do to help the team’s front office? We may get a chance to find out.

Our Dianna Russini and Josh Kendall had a story yesterday about the team being in discussions with its former quarterback to join the front office. With the Falcons being mediocre for so long, you have to wonder: Could it hurt?

Four years after being selected with the fourth pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Kyle Pitts Sr. is beginning to produce in a manner that matches the potential his selection came with.

During his past four games, Pitts is averaging 98.8 receiving yards per game with four touchdowns, three of which came in Week 15 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has shown a rapport with Kirk Cousins, which was on display last week as he caught seven passes for 57 yards and a score.

This season, Pitts has 80 receptions for 854 yards with five scores.

Still early in his NFL career, Bijan Robinson already has proven to be one of the most complete, dynamic running backs in the NFL. This versatility was on full display against the Cardinals last week.

He got 16 carries for 76 yards, averaging 4.8 yards per attempt, and added seven catches for 92 yards with a touchdown. The week prior, he caught eight passes for 82 yards against Tampa Bay and rushed for another 93 yards with a touchdown.

Robinson is on pace to comfortably clear 2,000 scrimmage yards this season.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/tv63HgvSdw1d_ym1KJgvJWBO0_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 19:57:52.256833

London was officially listed as ""questionable"" for the Falcons' ""Monday Night Football"" matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. Atlanta has already been eliminated from postseason contention and is merely looking to play spoiler down the stretch, which led many to wonder whether the Falcons would actually allow London to suit up for the game.

Will London play in Week 17? Here are the latest updates on his status.

Is Drake London playing today?

London is active for Atlanta tonight and is expected to play. He was officially listed as ""questionable"" on the team's official injury report after being limited at each of Atlanta's practice sessions because of a knee injury but he was not listed among the inactives released 90 minutes before kickoff.

Drake London injury update

London is dealing with a lingering knee injury that kept him out of the Falcons' lineup for four games. He was able to return in Week 16 but recorded a season-low 27 yards on three catches in Atlanta's 26-19 win over the Arizona Cardinals.

London had been listed as ""questionable"" ahead of his Week 16 return and earned the same designation in Week 17 after being ""limited"" at each of Atlanta's practices ahead of the game.

That said, London's entirely limited participation was actually an upgrade over his Week 16 status. Before that game, the 24-year-old wide-out was limited at the team's first two practices of the week before being a non-participant in the team's final session.

Perhaps that's why Falcons coach Raheem Morris said he felt ""great"" about London's chances of playing against the Rams despite his questionable designation.

London is one of seven wide receivers on the Falcons' 53-man roster. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Drake London

Darnell Mooney

David Sills V

Casey Washington

Dylan Drummond

Deven Thompkins

Malik Heath

If London can't play, Mooney and Sills would rack up most of the snaps at wide receiver while running back Bijan Robinson and tight end Kyle Pitts would see an increase in targets.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/USAT/87950953007-usatsi-26857155.jpg?crop=5261,2961,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 19:57:56.303856

I salute all you east coasters. And I hope everyone has a happy New Year!

Here are my thoughts from the past week:

Injury roundup

We had some big ones recently. The injury gods need to provide us with a sacrifice list, like reverse Santa Claus.

Ivica Zubac suffered a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and will miss several weeks. Brook Lopez has filled in admirably, averaging 32 minutes over three games and providing plenty of points, treys and blocks. The Clippers have won three straight with Lopez starting, and they weren’t cheapies either — Houston, Portland and Detroit. The sample size is small, but the Clippers are first in offensive rating and ninth in defensive rating over that span. The ability of Lopez to space the floor has been a boon for both James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, who just dropped 55 points on Sunday. If Lopez is somehow available, you scoop him up for sure. There have been tons of trade rumors regarding Zubac, so it’s within the range of outcomes that Lopez is a thing for the remainder of the season, but I wouldn’t put too high of a probability on it. Just something to make us go hmmmm …

Cameron Johnson hyperextended his right knee and is expected to miss 4-6 weeks. Playing alongside Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, much was expected from Johnson from a fantasy perspective, but he has disappointed. Johnson is still converting 42% of his attempts from downtown, but the overall shooting volume is way down. Last season, he attempted 13.1 shots per game and is down to 8.8 this season, the lowest mark since 2020-21. We always have to give players a grace period when they move to a new city and join a new team, and Johnson looked to have been starting to get comfortable at the end of November, but alas, here we are. Tim Hardaway received the start in the past two games without Johnson, with Bruce Brown coming off the bench. Hardaway averaged 37 minutes, 15 shots and 19.5 points. Brown averaged 27.5 minutes and provided some rebounds, assists and steals. If only we could combine the two! If you want points, Hardaway is your guy, but he’s not going to contribute much else.

Whichever way you go, it will only be a short-term bandage because both Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon could be returning within a week. Yippee! It may take a minute for both to get ramped up, but if you have the roster spot, I’d scoop up both right now.

Anthony Davis suffered a groin injury and is out for a few games, which could mean the rest of the season. I kid, I kid… but not really.

It’s a shame the above Twitter account deleted all the posts because I enjoyed seeing how far I could scroll down seeing the same answer. With Davis out on Saturday, Daniel Gafford received the start and played 23 minutes, while Dwight Powell played 19 minutes off the bench. Moussa Cisse soaked up the remaining six minutes. Gafford is a per-minute beast, averaging 1.13 fantasy points per minute, but he likely won’t play more than 24 minutes a game. If you need rebounds, blocks and field goal percentage, Gafford will provide a short-term boost. And that fling could turn into a long-term commitment if Davis is out for an extended period of time or gets traded with no center coming back to Dallas.

Austin Reaves suffered a calf injury and is out for at least a month. He was having a fantastic start to the season, garnering a usage rate of 28 while posting top-25 fantasy numbers on a per-game basis. The 50 percent shooting on over 16 field goal attempts is chef’s kiss. In the first game without Reaves, Marcus Smart got the start and played 21 minutes. Interestingly, Nick Smith received 24 minutes off the bench and poured in 21 points. Smith is known as an inefficient bucket getter and converted 39 percent of his shots during his first two seasons in the league, but through 13 games with the Lakers, he’s at 45 percent from the field and 42 percent from downtown. He garnered a 24.8 usage rate on Sunday. Unfortunately, he doesn’t provide much else, but if you need points, he’s not a bad option. Just know the ride will be a bumpy one.

Speaking of turbulence, if you like to live dangerously, Smart could be an option. While there are so many empty games littered on his ledger, he’s scored double-digit points nine times, dished out at least five dimes seven times and has a seven-steal game this season. By the way, in the month of December, teams have played 10-12 games. The Brooklyn Nets have the best defensive rating, while the Los Angeles Lakers are 29th.

Kon Knueppel suffered an ankle injury and will be out for a few games. Thank goodness it’s not anything serious because it’s been a joy watching Knueppel play and provide the goodies for my fantasy teams. Charles Lee said Josh Green and Tre Mann will likely see more minutes with Tidjane Salaun in the mix as well.

I’ve written about Salaun in the past and the positive momentum continues. Salaun has played 22 minutes in each of the past three games and contributes points, rebounds and treys. He’s a streamer for me right now, but I’ve been keeping my eye on him for a while. I have no interest in Josh Green for fantasy but I’ve always been a sucker for Tre Mann. I don’t think he gets the necessary minutes to be fantasy relevant, but if he gets at least 24 minutes, then I’d be interested because he has the skills to stuff the stat sheet.

Random thoughts

Tre Johnson got the start on Sunday for Kyshawn George. He started four games in early November, but has primarily been coming off the bench for Washington, filling the microwave scorer role. At some point, I think Johnson enters the starting lineup for good. Watching him play, he just looks so comfortable out there and the stroke is pure. He’s also shown some playmaking chops. CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton are unrestricted free agents after this season, so it’s highly likely they get shipped off in the next month or so. I’m thinking of a Wizards starting lineup consisting of Bub Carrington, Johnson, George, Bilal Coulibaly and Alex Sarr to end the season. I wouldn’t add Johnson or Carrington yet, but the time could be coming soon.

Both Lauri Markkanen and Michael Porter have been great to start this season, delivering top-25 per game fantasy value, but I’d look to sell both if possible. Granted, it may be difficult because many will be thinking the same thing, but always shoot your shot. The risk of shutdown is high for both, as Utah has a top-eight protected pick that could go to the Thunder, while the Nets reacquired their 2026 first rounder. There is no way either team forgoes the chance to select high in a draft class considered to be one of the best in a while. Let’s say Markkanen and Porter get traded. Well, the most likely destinations would be on contending teams which means the usage rate would take a dip.

Sam Merrill missed 14 games due to a right hand injury. He’s back and has started three of Cleveland’s past four games. While Merrill is only playing around 26 minutes a night, he’s providing points, treys and assists. He’s shooting 43 percent from downtown on the season and the 2.7 assists are a career high. He’s around a top-100 player on a per-game basis and I’d scoop him up if you’re interested in those things.

Fantasy playoffs are still a ways off, but they are on the horizon. It’s not too early to start checking the schedules in your leagues and mapping out contingencies. I wouldn’t make moves now, but would have situations assessed so I won’t be caught off guard if certain opportunities present themselves.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/29122229/GettyImages-2250223588-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 02:59:08.982025

Sage Ennis officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft on Monday via an Instagram post.

Following four years in the Clemson football program from 2020-23, Ennis transferred to play for Virginia and former Clemson assistant Tony Elliott ahead of the 2024 season.

“I would like to specifically thank Coach Elliott for providing me with the opportunity to be a part of this program,” Ennis wrote as part of his Instagram post. “Thank you Coach [Des] Kitchings for the development and belief in me. Thank you to the rest of the coaching and support staff for the dedication in aiding me to become a better person and player.”

In 2024, Ennis appeared in the Cavaliers’ first four games and caught a pass for 2 yards before suffering a season-ending knee injury.

This season, Ennis played in 13 of UVA’s 14 games, starting 12 of them. The 6-foot-4, 245-pound graduate student recorded career-highs with 23 receptions, 214 receiving yards and five touchdown receptions.

His five TD catches tied for the team lead, and he finished the year by recording his best numbers with five catches for 35 yards in UVA’s 13-7 win over Missouri in the Gator Bowl this past Saturday.

Ennis caught six career passes for 77 yards in 449 offensive snaps over 41 games (two starts) during his four years at Clemson. In his final year with the Tigers in 2023, he had three receptions for 52 yards in 171 snaps over 10 games (one start). He was also a trusted blocker in the running game prior to suffering a season-ending knee injury vs. Georgia Tech.

With Burden avoiding a serious injury, the expectation is the Bears will rest him for their regular-season finale against the Detroit Lions with the hopes of him returning in the wild-card round of the playoffs.

This marks the first time that the Ravens (8-8) and Steelers (9-7) will play for the AFC North title in a season finale.","OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Monday that ""it's to be determined"" whether quarterback Lamar Jackson can play in Sunday night's game at the Pittsburgh Steelers, which will crown the AFC North champion.

Jackson sustained a back contusion on Dec. 21 and didn't play in Saturday's 41-24 victory at the Green Bay Packers.

""He's coming off a very serious injury and he's working at it,"" Harbaugh said. ""I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday [when the Ravens return to practice].""

Jackson was injured when he got kneed in the back during a 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. He didn't practice last week with what Harbaugh described as a ""painful"" injury.

There is hope that the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player can return because there were signs of progress with the back injury.

""It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on,"" Harbaugh said. ""That was cause for optimism.""

Jackson has led Baltimore to four AFC North titles -- the Ravens have won the division the past two seasons. But Jackson has dealt with a handful of injuries this season -- hamstring, knee, ankle, toe and back -- that have resulted in one of the most challenging seasons of his eight-year career.

In 12 starts this season, Jackson has a 6-6 record and has thrown for 192.6 yards per game, which ranks 24th among quarterbacks with at least 10 games played. His 340 yards rushing are a career low.

In filling in for Jackson, Tyler Huntley has won both of his starts this season, beating two playoff teams in the Chicago Bears and Packers. In those starts, Huntley has completed 78.6% of his passes (33-of-42) for 293 yards, throwing two touchdowns and no interceptions. He has also run for 113 yards in those starts.

""I think the fact that we have a lot of confidence in Tyler is a real big positive and real plus, but it doesn't factor into whether Lamar plays,"" Harbaugh said. ""If Lamar's ready to go, he's playing. That's it for sure.""

This marks the first time that the Ravens (8-8) and Steelers (9-7) will play for the AFC North title in a season finale. The winning team captures the No. 4 seed in the AFC, which means hosting a wild-card game. The season is over for the losing team.

Asked if this game could serve as a ""referendum"" on the job securities for Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and himself, Harbaugh said, ""There's always pressure, but I think it was Billie Jean King who said, 'pressure is a privilege,' right? That's something that is earned. So, we feel like it's something very worthwhile to be in games like this. And, if those are the things that are being talked about along with that, that's OK. That's a privilege, too.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1229%2Fr1594826_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 22:58:23.295241

Doing whatever it takes to win includes Schwesinger playing through injury and not missing a defensive snap.
Beating the Bengals would also result in the Browns splitting the season series with the Steelers and Cincinnati, capping off the season with momentum.","With the Browns going into halftime up 10-6 against the Steelers, Cleveland needed to maintain the same fight it had in the first half to finish off its division rivals.

The Browns shut out the Steelers for the next 30 minutes of playing time, including stopping Pittsburgh on three consecutive plays to the end zone to win 13-6 in Week 17 at Huntington Bank Field. Now the Browns look to ride the momentum they created against Pittsburgh into Week 18 and their final game of the season against the Bengals.

""Really proud of those guys in that football game to be in that fight for 60 minutes and come out on top,"" head coach Kevin Stefanski said. ""Some really great efforts in that game. Some guys stepping up into roles that they haven't played in previously, which I was really proud of those guys as well. So, need to build off of it. Wanted to split that series with the Steelers last week. We have an opportunity to split a series with the Bengals this week, so that'll be our sole focus.""

Here are the main pieces of news heading into the Browns' final game of the 2025 season.

Updating the injury report

TE Harold Fannin Jr., RG Wyatt Teller and LB Carson Schwesinger all dealt with injuries over the course of the game against Pittsburgh. Stefanski said that all three players are rehabbing and progressing, not ruling any of them out yet for Week 18.

Fannin left the game in the first quarter with a groin injury, an injury he first sustained during practice on Dec. 26. The injury occurred on his second catch of the game, a 28-yard touchdown reception from QB Shedeur Sanders. Fannin went to the sidelines after the score and didn't return to the game.

Teller reaggravated a calf injury that forced him to miss Week 14, 15 and 16 on the Browns' first drive of the game. G Teven Jenkins took over Teller's duties at the position, playing until the third quarter when he was ruled out after entering the concussion protocol. G Zak Zinter played the remainder of the game at guard.

Schwesinger played 100 percent of the defensive snaps against the Steelers, navigating through an injury. As a result of his determination to not come off the field, Stefanski gave Schwesinger a game ball following Cleveland's win. Schwesinger finished the game with nine combined tackles.

""I watched it during the game and making plays and pushing himself and trying to get loose in between series and that type of thing,"" Stefanski said. ""It's emblematic of the effort out there and I appreciate that and I think it speaks well about him. It speaks to his teammates as well.""

Browns highlight the impact of the 2025 rookie class

The Browns 2025 draft class features seven players who are playing key roles for Cleveland this season.

RB Quinshon Judkins, DT Mason Graham, RB Dylan Sampson, Schwesinger, and Fannin have all played in 14 or more games. Judkins leads all rookies with 59.1 rushing yards per game while Fannin has recorded 72 receptions, the most among rookies in the NFL. Schwesinger leads all rookies with 146 combined tackles, also tied for the seventh among all players in the NFL.

QB Dillon Gabriel and Sanders have each started six games this season. Gabriel has appeared in 10 total games this season, throwing for 937 passing yards with seven passing touchdowns and 86 rushing yards. Sanders made his first regular season appearance when he started the second half of Week 11 against the Ravens after Gabriel entered the concussion protocol. Sanders has started in every game since Week 11, passing for 1,289 yards for seven passing touchdowns while also being a ground threat with 143 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.

""This is – forget how good of players they are – this is as diligent of a group of workers that I've ever been around,"" Stefanski said. ""I think that's a testament to these players. I think it's a testament to (Executive President of Football Operations and General Manager) Andrew (Berry) and crew identifying these players. I think it's a testament to their coaches and how they develop them. But, at the core of it, this is a group that loves to work, loves to compete, loves to be out there with their teammates, and is willing to do anything that they have to do anything that the team needs them to do in order to win.""

Doing whatever it takes to win includes Schwesinger playing through injury and not missing a defensive snap. That mentality also includes Sampson returning after missing two games due to a hand injury and leading the Browns in rushing yards and carries against the Steelers. Sampson and rookie RB Raheim Sanders helped fill the absence of Judkins, who is out for the season due to a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula he sustained in Week 16.

""We took measures to kind of go out there and protect it, but everything went well and came out of the game feeling healthy,"" Sampson said. ""I never take playing this game for granted so anytime just going out there, being able to just play this game and then getting a win against a division team like that, that's the way you want to end it regardless of how the season has been.""

Cleveland aiming to finish strong in Week 18

After spoiling the Steelers' chances to clinch the division in Week 17 in Cleveland, the Browns aim to finish the season with the same juice in Week 18 in Cincinnati.

The regular season finale is another chance for Cleveland to build momentum and reinforce the identity they have worked to establish this season. The Browns are looking to close the year by setting the tone for the offseason and next season.

""We're not going out there on that field to go and lose, like we're trying to win every game,"" Sampson said. ""At the end of the day, it just boils down to individually, what do each of us care about, why we started to play this game in the first place. So, you can look at the circumstances and they're not that favorable, but we signed up to play this game and to give our all for it, so I think that's what we did yesterday and that's what we're going to continue to do.""

A win against the Bengals would close out the season with two consecutive wins. Beating the Bengals would also result in the Browns splitting the season series with the Steelers and Cincinnati, capping off the season with momentum.

""I think it sets the tone going into the offseason for us and it kind of develops the mindset that we want to have and when you're going to be a team that's playing meaningful games in December, these are games that you're going to have to win,"" Schwesinger said. ""So, taking these seriously and approaching these games how we are I think is important and it prepares us well for the future.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/hacetf6cwzhsubpt6og0,N,,2025-12-29 19:58:06.029614

The action concluded with ""Sunday Night Football"" showcasing a high-scoring battle between the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears. San Francisco prevailed 42-38 in a shootout at Levi’s Stadium, led by Brock Purdy’s 303 passing yards and five total touchdowns, while Bears quarterback Caleb Williams threw for 330 yards and two touchdowns in a losing effort.

The win positioned the 49ers for a winner-take-all Week 18 finale against the Seattle Seahawks, with the NFC West title, the conference’s No. 1 seed and a first-round bye all on the line.

Social Media Erupts Over NFL Week 18 Schedule

Following Sunday’s slate, the NFL released its Week 18 schedule, which immediately drew scrutiny. The league announced a Saturday doubleheader featuring the Carolina Panthers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers at 4:30 p.m. ET and Seahawks-49ers at 8 p.m. ET, followed by a Sunday schedule that culminates with Ravens-Steelers on ""SNF.""

That decision sparked swift backlash from fans, many of whom believed Seahawks-49ers, a division rivalry with top-seed implications, was the most compelling game on the board. Social media reactions poured in, criticizing the league for passing over a matchup that would determine the NFC West champion and the conference’s top seed.

“THE SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAME LMOOOOO 🤡,” one fan wrote.

“How’d yall [expletive] up the most obvious Sunday Night Football decision ever?” another fan questioned.

Las Vegas (2-14) now has an 80 percent chance of landing the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, according to ESPN. The Raiders would be guaranteed the No. 1 pick with a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 18. A Jets win over the Bills would also clinch the first overall selection for Las Vegas.

A Giants loss would have guaranteed them the No. 1 pick. With a loss to the Dallas Cowboys next week and a Raiders win over the Chiefs, New York (3-13) will get the first draft choice.

Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart had two rushing touchdowns, pushing his season total to nine. The rookie finished 22-for-30 passing for 207 yards, adding 48 yards on the ground. Las Vegas had 231 yards of total offense.

Geno Smith finished 20-for-28 passing for 176 yards. After two more interceptions, Smith has a league-leading 17 picks this season. He exited the game early in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury and did not return. Raiders coach Pete Carroll said after the game that Smith had suffered a high-ankle sprain and would have an MRI on Monday.

“That’s pretty hard to bounce back (from),” Carroll told reporters. “That might knock him out of next week, we’ll have to wait and see.”

Late in the third quarter, Deonte Banks put the game away for good with a 95-yard kickoff return touchdown, extending New York’s lead to 27-10.

Giants wideout Wan’Dale Robinson caught 11 passes for 113 yards, surpassing 1,000 receiving yards in a season for the first time in his four-year career.

Smith leaves with injury

Smith barely put weight on his ankle when the Raiders quarterback walked into the locker room on his own. Smith suffered the injury on the same play he threw an interception on a pass intended for Tyler Lockett. Instead, Dane Belton picked off the pass, Smith’s second interception of the day. Smith struggled against the Giants’ pass rush, and the Raiders’ offense couldn’t get much going until late in the third quarter. Kenny Pickett came in to replace Smith when the offense finally got the ball back nearly nine minutes later. At that point, the game was all but over. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer

Rookie responds after struggles

Dart had a bounce-back day after the worst performance of his young career in Week 16. After throwing just 33 passing yards last week, Dart came out looking much more like the first-round pick whom Giants fans have come to love over his rookie season. Dart now has nine rushing touchdowns after adding two Sunday. On his first score, Dart powered into the end zone on a designed run, taking a massive hit as he went for the score. The second rushing touchdown came late in the fourth quarter after he led a nearly nine-minute drive to tick time off the clock and help secure the win. Dart showed personality and swagger that were missing last week, and he also showed growth when he ran out of bounds on runs — an evolving part of his game. — Carroll

Great season for Robinson continues

Robinson surpassed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career, and it couldn’t have come at a better moment. The 2022 second-rounder has played a stellar season as he’s set to hit free agency this offseason and command a nice payday. After top receiver Malik Nabers suffered a season-ending torn ACL in Week 4, Robinson moved into the No. 1 role. The move paid off with Robinson’s best year. — Carroll",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/28171212/GettyImages-2253855689-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 21:13:42.671921

Harbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.","The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) will be a part of that effort remains up in the air as Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday that the team will have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice.

""It's to be determined,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.""

Jackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.

""It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,"" Harbaugh said.

NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason

Tyler Sullivan

After Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson.

Furthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.

Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.

""A+,"" Harbaugh said after the game. ""A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.""

Hollins hadn’t practiced throughout the week, but he did finish last week’s game against the Ravens. Head coach Mike Vrabel said Monday that the injury did occur against the Ravens.

Hollins can’t return until the AFC Championship Game at the earliest. It sounds like the 32-year-old wide receiver could potentially be available by that time, however.

“We won’t be able to see him for another three weeks, so at that point in time, then we would make a decision, and I hope that’s one that we could make,” Vrabel said. “But right now, I don’t think I can predict anything.”

Hollins finishes the regular season with 46 catches for 550 yards and two touchdowns. He’s also contributed as the Patriots’ best blocker in the run game and on special teams.

With Hollins and Kayshon Boutte (concussion) out Sunday, rookies Efton Chism and Kyle Williams took on bigger roles in the 42-10 win over the Jets. Chism caught two passes for 40 yards and a touchdown, while Williams hauled in three passes for 20 yards.

Unfortunately, Chicago didn't make it out of the game unscathed as rookie wide receiver Luther Burden III suffered an injury on the final play of the game.

Burden suffered an apparent left leg injury on the Bears' final play, where they were attempting to complete their seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season. Unfortunately, the comeback attempt fell short, and Chicago lost Burden in the process.

With Rome Odunze sidelined, Burden was the top receiver for Williams, and he didn't disappoint. After missing last week's game with an ankle injury, Burden returned and had a career outing with eight catches for 138 yards and one touchdown against the 49ers. He played a key role in the offense's powerhouse performance.

Luther Burden injury update

Burden suffered an apparent left leg injury on the final play of the game, where quarterback Caleb Williams was attempting a pass on fourth-and-2 with the game on the line. Burden tried to walk off the field but fell to the ground. After attempting to walk off the field with trainers, Burden was carted to the locker room. According to ESPN's Courtney Cronin, Burden was seen grabbing his left hamstring making his way in for an X-ray after the game at Levi's Stadium. On Monday morning, ESPN's Adam Schefter provided an update saying Burden suffered a quad injury that isn't thought to be serious. He'll undergo additional testing today.

What Ben Johnson said about Luther Burden's injury

Head coach Ben Johnson met with the media shortly after the Bears' loss to the 49ers. He didn't have an immediate update on Burden's leg injury. But Burden did speak to media in the locker room after the game and didn't mention the injury, which is encouraging. When asked how he was feeling, Burden said: ""I gave it my all out there. Tired as hell.""

How much time could Luther Burden miss?

Burden likely will be sidelined for the Bears' Week 18 game against the Detroit Lions, as the No. 1 seed is no longer in play. We'll see specifically what injury Burden suffered and whether he'll be good for a playoff return in two weeks, alongside Rome Odunze.","https://bearswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/SBRS/87941693007-2253869100.jpg?crop=4667,2625,x0,y243&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 18:59:52.796036

Perhaps Metcalf would've made a big play there.
* Otherwise, my gut tells me that Metcalf would've just been frustrated by the excellent Browns corners and probably would've been hit with a 15-yarder at a critical juncture.
I came away even more impressed by the Browns defense and the way they played the Steelers' short passing game.
But if Rodgers, MVS, Thielen, and Miller learned anything this week, perhaps it shows next.","From the notebook of a sportswriter who expected to re-watch the film of Browns 13, Steelers 6 and count the tragic and countless instances of A.) the lack of an outside playmaker, and B.) a poor performance by Aaron Rodgers.

* I saw neither.

* My lede prior to the re-watch was to pin this on two visions that carried over from last week in Detroit. One was the haunting image of DK Metcalf upon realizing that the whole world had just watched what he had done to the fan hanging over the railing.

* I don't know about you, but I was looking into a mirror there and felt myself at my lowest life moments upon the realization that something was about to change, and change very badly for me.

* That was an image that I believed, before the re-watch, was hanging over the loss to the Browns, as the Steelers wide receivers combined for only 60 yards with Metcalf on suspension.

* But upon the review, I'm really not so sure Metcalf would've made a difference. Not with Denzel Ward playing this week after sitting out their last game with an injury.

* Of course, Metcalf usually works the other side of the field, but I was very impressed with the other Browns cornerback, Tyson Campbell. I thought he was their Player of the Game.

* There was one play that maybe Metcalf would've hit early in the game, the one in which Marquez Valdes-Scantling had Campbell by a step and Rodgers just missed him. I thought that was due more to mistiming and lack of working together than it was a mistake by either Steelers player. Perhaps Metcalf would've made a big play there.

* Otherwise, my gut tells me that Metcalf would've just been frustrated by the excellent Browns corners and probably would've been hit with a 15-yarder at a critical juncture.

* Campbell made another great play on an otherwise decent back-shoulder pass to Adam Thielen on a third-and-6 play soon after the aforementioned throw to MVS.

* The other image from the game in Detroit, which still stands strong for me, can be construed as whining. But whine I must. The image of the huddle by the officials after the final play in Detroit did drive me crazy because of the allowed pitch following a clear stop of forward progress. But I'm just talking about the huddle itself. It occurred because those officials had the guts to call an obvious pass interference on a final and game-deciding play. The officials in Cleveland did not have such courage. Ward clearly interfered with MVS in the end zone on the final and game-deciding play.

* This lack of guts from an officiating crew that called more pass interference penalties than any crew heading into the game.

* As for Rodgers, I expected to re-watch a poor game by him, but I didn't. I came away even more impressed by the Browns defense and the way they played the Steelers' short passing game. Yes, Rodgers could've focused more on beating the limping Browns middle linebacker, but he clearly went at him on the final drive with the game on the line. Should he have gone at him again on the final three plays inside the 7? Maybe. But I doubt a slowed linebacker was much of a factor down close.

* Perhaps just going to Pat Freiermuth because of his guts and hands was the call. I'd love to see that last pass headed in his direction on a do-over. But even game analyst Tony Romo called out MVS in one-on-one coverage with Ward, after earlier in the game saying ""MVS is the one"" who'll step up in place of Metcalf.

* I actually thought he was going to be the one, too. Last week I wrote that the loss of Metcalf could turn into a blessing in disguise since it would force Rodgers to work for two weeks with MVS and Thielen. And when Mike Tomlin mentioned Roman Wilson in the middle of the week as a key replacement, I was dumbfounded. I've seen absolutely zero from Wilson and would've gone with what Rodgers did down the stretch.

* And I lost. So there's that. But I'm only giving my first-take perspective instead of looking into the rearview mirror. I just have no respect for Wilson. Sorry, gang.

* Is Tomlin to blame? That question will go over like a Led Zeppelin in this town, of course, but I saw a team that was totally prepared and played extremely hard. Go through the tape and tell me otherwise.

* Just-missed blitzes. A dropped pick six. A potential pick six had Jack Sawyer not cut inside and stayed down the sideline. A weak roughing call on Cam Heyward, who played extremely well and with urgency all game.

* The Browns hit two big plays on their only touchdown drive. The 42-yarder beat reserve safety Chuck Clark and then a ball was lost by safety Kyle Dugger on the 28-yard TD pass to Harold Fannin. Those were the Browns' biggest plays of the game. On the second drive. Otherwise, I thought the Steelers defense played very well, and once again without well known game-wrecker TJ Watt.

* We know about the Steelers' problems on offense, and in this game they were without their two downfield crushers in Metcalf and Darnell Washington. The second-ranked defense in the NFL had little trouble stopping the Steelers, who'll no doubt draft a wide playmaker early.

* How early depends on whether they sign QB Malik Willis in free agency. But that's a Scott Mitchell-type story that begs more research in the offseason.

* Did the Steelers run the ball enough in Cleveland? I thought so, and particularly at a most critical moment. After Scottie Miller returned a punt 25 yards (team's longest of the season) to the Pittsburgh 43 with 7:03 left, Jaylen Warren gained 7 on first down. On second-and-3, I was expecting offensive coordinator Arthur Smith to get cute. But he didn't. The problem was the Browns. A handoff to Warren lost 1. And on third-and-4, no doubt looking at four downs, Smith ran Kenneth Gainwell and he gained only 1.

* I thought Jonnu Smith played well and got his runs and targets. I thought Freiermuth was covered well on the third-and-mediums. I thought the line played well enough to win, both as run and pass-blockers.

* I've seen criticism of the lack of ""tush push"" on a third-and-1 early in the fourth quarter, when Dylan Cook moved ever-so-slightly to draw a penalty. But without Washington to push from behind, I had no problem with the handoff to Gainwell, who cut back through a massive hole before the play was blown dead.

* The fourth-and-1 go ball to Miller early in the game? I probably wouldn't have called that, but it was a first-half shot at a touchdown. I trust Rodgers, particularly in the first half. It's my same lack of criticism I witheld from the Lions coach last week.

* And I lost, just as the Lions coach lost.

* The Steelers lost, of course. They were beaten on the road by a 4-point underdog of a division rival playing its Super Bowl. Such is life in the NFL.

* Can the Steelers recover to beat the Ravens? I wouldn't bet on it. This is one game in particular in which Metcalf would be a difference maker. But if Rodgers, MVS, Thielen, and Miller learned anything this week, perhaps it shows next.

* We'll all be up late on the edge of our seats once again. It's what this team has given us all season.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/883/517/13517883.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 17:59:12.464394

The Browns beat the Steelers on Sunday afternoon, making the Ravens’ trip to Pittsburgh next week the biggest game of the year. Despite the history of this rivalry, it is the first-ever matchup with these exact stakes, per CBS Sports’ Doug Clawson. The winner takes the AFC North crown and the No. 4 seed in the AFC playoff picture. The loser goes home.

Unsurprisingly, the NFL opted to schedule this de facto divisional championship for Sunday Night Football in Week 18, the last game of the regular season. It will be the Ravens’ third primetime game in a row and their seventh this season. In their first six, they went 2-4.

Intense does not begin to describe what the atmosphere in Pittsburgh will be on Sunday night. Heinz Field (now known by the far inferior Acrisure Stadium) will be filled to the brim with rabid Steelers fans waiving Terrible Towels. It will probably be the toughest environment the Ravens have played in all season.

The biggest factor in this matchup will be who is and isn’t playing, mostly on Pittsburgh’s sides. D.K. Metcalf is suspended for another game. T.J. Watt has not played since the first Ravens-Steelers matchup in Week 14 due to a freak lung injury. Darnell Washington broke his arm in Sunday’s loss to the Browns.

But the Ravens have the biggest potential absence of them all: Lamar Jackson, who missed the Ravens’ win over the Packers with a back injury. He did not practice at all last week, meaning there is a very real chance that Baltimore’s season will be on the line with Tyler Huntley under center.

The game will be broadcast on NBC/Peacock on Sunday, January 4 at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Many people will use that phrase as the calendar flips to 2026 and plenty of them won't follow through on that resolution.

Josh Allen is hoping that he won't be part of that group. The Buffalo Bills' star quarterback has been here before with big dreams and even bigger expectations.

Without playoff nemesis Patrick Mahomes looming in the bracket this season, Allen doesn't have to worry about leaping over that impossible hurdle. However, an injury is threatening to impact the Bills' playoff run before it even gets started.

Here's the latest on Allen's foot injury.

Josh Allen injury update

Allen aggravated the right foot injury that he suffered in Week 16, but X-rays were negative after the Bills' Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Head coach Sean McDermott told reporters after the game that Allen was sore and the X-rays were just to make sure nothing else was wrong.

Allen said after the loss that his foot had zero impact. When asked if he aggravated anything, Allen simply said, ""I'm good.""

The quarterback was limited in practice on Dec. 24 and Dec. 25 before being upgraded to a full participant on Dec. 26. Allen was able to play in Week 17, but did appear to be limited throughout. He wasn't moving around with his typical mobility, although the heavy rain and slick field might've played a part in that.

Buffalo was eliminated from AFC East contention with their loss to the Eagles, meaning the Bills will be a wild-card team when the playoffs begin.

They still have multiple seeding possibilities on the line in Week 18 against the New York Jets.

It's unclear if the team will rest starters in advance of the playoffs or elect to play its stars in the regular season's final week.

There is some added intrigue considering Week 18 will be the Bills' last at the current Highmark Stadium. Their new home, New Highmark Stadium, will open in time for kickoff of the 2026 NFL season.

Bills QB depth chart

Josh Allen

Mitchell Trubisky

The Bills only carry two quarterbacks on their active roster. Notably, they do not have a practice squad quarterback either.

If Allen can't go or is limited, Trubisky projects as the one the step in.

After Trubisky, however, it's unclear what the plan would be.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/USAT/87944922007-josh-allen-122925.jpg?crop=2503,1408,x920,y82&width=2503&height=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 14:59:27.805623

Malik Willis, QB Green Bay Packers

Injury: Right AC Aggravation

Projected Timetable: Week 18

Initial Thoughts:

Willis aggravated his right AC sprain but it was likely due to his throwing volume and weather related, with his ligaments eventually having enough and causing pain towards the end of the game. Early reports indicate he should be able to suit up week 18. I would feel good about picking him in DFS entries or any week 18 matchups that you might have.

Josh Allen, QB Buffalo Bills

Injury: Right Foot Aggravation

Projected Timetable: Week 18-TBD

Initial Thoughts:

Allen was spotted heading into the X-Ray room at the end of the game after limping through a good chunk of the second half of the game. The hope is he did not worsen the midfoot sprain that he is likely playing through. Imaging from last week ruled out fracture, but recent imaging would still be helpful to rule out any secondary concern after playing through the injury. They might wind up shutting him down for week 18 to ensure that he is fully healthy for playoffs, but we should hear more as the week goes on.

Geno Smith, QB Las Vegas Raiders

Injury: Right High Ankle Sprain

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

He performed his job admirably in landing the first overall pick for the Raiders. The high ankle sprain will keep him out of the last game of the season, leaving it up to Kenny Pickett to crawl through the last 60 minutes of football of their pitiful season.

Javonte Williams, RB Dallas Cowboys

Injury: Shoulder/AC Sprain

Projected Timetable: Week 18-TBD

Initial Thoughts:

Suspecting reinjury of his prior AC sprain that he was attempting to play through. If the team shuts him down, Malik Davis could wind up being an intriguing cheap DFS selection, assuming they role with him ahead of their other backs.

Rashid Shaheed, WR Seattle Seahawks

Injury: Concussion

Projected Timetable: NFL Playoffs

Initial Thoughts:

Average miss at least one week due to concussion protocol, which has huge implications on the Seahawks special teams ability versus the 49ers and secondarily as a WR. Likely leads to a bump to AJ Barner in the pass game if Shaheed cannot suit up in week 18.

Marvin Harrison Jr, WR Arizona Cardinals

Injury: Heel Aggravation

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

Per a few pieces on intel on X, he only played a handful of snaps and then did not return. The team likely shuts him down for week 18, leaving it up to Michael Wilson as the lead receiver. Great DFS option.

Devonta Smith, WR Philadelphia Eagles

Injury: Left Side/Oblique

Projected Timetable: Week 18

Initial Thoughts:

Smith was able to return after missing just a few snaps after favoring his left side after twisting awkwardly while trying to come down with a catch. He did not seem limited rest of game, so as of right now I expect him to be able to suit up for week 18.

Harold Fannin Jr, TE Cleveland Browns

Injury: Groin Reinjury

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

Fortunately he paid off with two catches and a touchdown before being unable to return to the game due to an aggravation of a groin injury that he suffered in practice on Friday. I would anticipate him missing week 18.

Ja'Tavion Sanders, TE Carolina Panthers

Injury: Ankle Fracture

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

With his 2025 season over due to season-ending surgery to address the broken ankle, Mitchell Evans becomes an intriguing dynasty TE stash if your waivers are still open. The Panthers will likely have a hard time trusting Sanders and Tommy Tremble due to their injury histories.

Darnell Washington, TE Pittsburgh Steelers

Injury: Forearm Fracture

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

This should not negatively impact him into the 2026 season if you were to acquire low in dynasty, though his usage is inconsistent. Forearm fractures do not come with a negative production dip long-term.",https://www.4for4.com/sites/default/files/articles/USATSI_27896588%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:59:07.264396

,,2025-12-29 17:01:51+00:00,The Athletic,"What we learned in NFL Week 17: 49ers, Seahawks set up clash for NFC's top seed",Zak Keefer,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6924181/2025/12/29/49ers-bears-brock-purdy-caleb-williams/,"That would give the Panthers the edge in a decisive tiebreaker — division win percentage — even if they lose to the Bucs next week.
For a team that slogged through a 10-game losing streak last season, it’s hard to think of a more stunning about-face.
With a win next week over the lowly Titans, the Jags would have the second-best regular-season record in franchise history.
A win next week over the 49ers and Macdonald will have delivered the Seahawks the NFC’s No.
A win next week would tie the franchise record for regular-season wins, set in John Elway’s final season (1998).","For the second straight year, we’ll have a winner-take-all showdown in the final week of the regular season that will not only decide a division title but also the NFC’s No. 1 seed.

It’ll be the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks meeting Saturday at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., with the NFC West crown and the conference’s top seed on the line (the Detroit Lions defeated the Minnesota Vikings under similar stakes in January).

Credit Kyle Shanahan and his staff: Sunday night’s 42-38 win over the Chicago Bears was the 49ers’ sixth in a row. That’s how a team that sat in third in the NFC West for most of the season has climbed within 60 minutes of a playoff bye. Not only that, but also a win next week would mean the 49ers wouldn’t have to leave their home stadium the rest of the way — and that includes a potential Super Bowl LX appearance.

With just one weekend left in the regular season, all but two playoff spots have been clinched. The AFC North and NFC South winners will claim those next weekend.

In the AFC, three teams still have a shot at the No. 1 seed, though it’s the Denver Broncos’ to lose.

Behind the 49ers’ win over the Bears, the second-best finish of Sunday’s slate came in Orchard Park, N.Y., where Josh Allen battled through a foot injury to lead the Buffalo Bills back from a 13-0 fourth-quarter deficit to the Philadelphia Eagles. But after a 1-yard touchdown run from Allen cut Philly’s lead to 13-12 with five seconds left, Allen missed wideout Khalil Shakir in the end zone on what would’ve been a game-winning 2-point conversion. With that, the Eagles celebrated their 11th win of the season, and the Patriots celebrated their first AFC East title since 2019.

That’s because earlier in the afternoon, Drake Maye played as close to a perfect game as you’ll see in a 42-10 romp over the lifeless New York Jets. The second-year starter finished with five touchdowns and just two incompletions. In a little over a month, Maye — just 23 — could become one of the youngest league MVPs ever.

We’ll have a winner-take-all game next Sunday night in Pittsburgh, where the 9-7 Steelers will host the 8-8 Baltimore Ravens with the AFC North on the line. Pittsburgh coughed up a chance to wrap up its first division title in five years by losing 13-6 to the Cleveland Browns, keeping the Ravens’ playoff hopes alive for another week. Cleveland’s Myles Garrett, still a sack away from breaking the single-season record, suggested after the game that the Steelers’ priorities might’ve been skewed. “I feel like they were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron (Rodgers) than getting the win, and I think that’s what came back to bite him,” Garrett said. He’ll try to chase down Joe Burrow in Cincinnati next week for the record.

The Ravens, who rolled the Packers 41-24 Saturday night behind 216 rushing yards and four touchdown runs from Derrick Henry, could have Lamar Jackson back and will be shooting for a third straight division crown — an impressive feat for a team that stumbled to a 1-5 start.

It’s essentially the same scenario in the NFC South, albeit with a minor wrinkle. The division will most likely be decided Saturday afternoon in Tampa, Fla., where the reeling Buccaneers — who fell 20-17 to the Miami Dolphins on Sunday and are now 7-9 after a 6-2 start — will try to avoid putting the finishing touches on an unthinkable late-season collapse. They’ll host an 8-8 Carolina Panthers team that fell 27-10 at home to the Seahawks. A win for the Panthers would clinch the franchise’s first division title in 10 years. A loss would deliver the Bucs their fifth straight crown.

The only caveat is if the Atlanta Falcons win their final two. That would give the Panthers the edge in a decisive tiebreaker — division win percentage — even if they lose to the Bucs next week. After seeing the Rams on Monday night, the Falcons will host the Saints, winners of four straight, to close the season.

The AFC South remains up for grabs, and Jacksonville has the inside track. A 23-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday means all the Jaguars have to do is beat the 3-13 Tennessee Titans at home next week to end Houston’s two-year reign atop the division. The Texans, winners of eight straight after Saturday’s 20-16 victory over the Chargers, need a Week 18 win over the Colts and a Jags loss to the Titans to make it three AFC South titles in a row.

The Colts, meanwhile, have dropped six straight and will become the first team in 30 years to start 8-2 and miss the playoffs. After dropping his third game in a row as a fill-in starter, 44-year-old Philip Rivers offered no regrets. “Other than us not winning … it’s been an absolute blast for three weeks,” he said. “If I go back and say, ‘All right, now you know everything’s going to happen, what are you going to do?’ I’d do it all again.” The Colts are considering starting rookie Riley Leonard in Week 18.

Here’s what we learned from Week 17 in the NFL:

It’s SF-Seattle for the NFC’s top seed

A game that featured two Coach of the Year candidates, 11 touchdowns and 80 points came down to one throw. And for a moment there, it looked as if Caleb Williams was about to do it again.

Why not? It would’ve been Williams’ seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season, and it would’ve kept the Bears’ hopes alive of earning the NFC’s No. 1 seed. Instead, Chicago’s final drive Sunday night — after 15 plays and 58 yards — came up short when Williams’ last pass fell incomplete in the end zone.

For San Francisco, Brock Purdy shook off an early pick-six to play one of his best games as a pro: He led six touchdown drives, including one that pushed the 49ers in front for good with 2:15 left. That’s now back-to-back games for Purdy with five touchdowns. Christian McCaffrey was again a workhorse, with 27 touches, 181 all-purpose yards and a touchdown.

Williams finished with 330 yards and two touchdowns for Chicago.

For the Seahawks, it doesn’t get any simpler: Beat the 49ers next week and the NFC playoffs will run through Seattle for the first time since the Legion of Boom Days. Sunday’s win over the Panthers moved them to 13-3, meaning Sam Darnold is now the first quarterback in history to win 13 games or more in consecutive seasons with two different teams. (Darnold led the Vikings to a 14-3 finish last season after dropping that Week 18 showdown with the Lions.)

AFC to run through Denver?

The Broncos’ 20-13 win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, coupled with the Chargers’ loss to the Texans on Saturday, clinched Denver’s first division title in a decade. The last time the Broncos were on top of the AFC West, Peyton Manning was their quarterback and Von Miller was about to lead them to a championship.

Now the Broncos can set their sights on the AFC’s top seed and lone playoff bye. A win next Sunday over the Chargers would do it.

In the event the Broncos lose, the Patriots would have to beat the Dolphins to earn the top seed. The Jaguars can earn the No. 1 seed only if they beat the Titans and both the Broncos and Patriots lose.

Raiders might soon be on the clock

A year ago, a two-win Giants team rolled the Colts in a Week 17 game that cost New York the No. 1 pick. On Sunday, a two-win Giants team rolled the Raiders in a Week 17 game that could end up costing New York the No. 1 pick.

But it’s hard to blame them — especially rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart — for snapping a nine-game losing streak with a 34-10 victory on Sunday. This team needed a win. Dart threw for 207 yards and ran for two touchdowns in the Giants’ first victory since Oct. 9.

The Raiders, meanwhile, have all the makings of a team deserving of the No. 1 pick. This season has been an utter disaster. Geno Smith has regressed. The defense has been atrocious. A report trickled out this week that the team is beefing with its best player, Maxx Crosby. And Pete Carroll — lured out of retirement to steady a sinking ship of an organization — hasn’t found any answers.

Las Vegas’ reward, with a loss next week to the Chiefs, will be the franchise’s first No. 1 pick since 2007. The Raiders will hope for a better outcome this time. That year, Al Davis used the pick on JaMarcus Russell.

Who’s your coach of the year?

The 2025 season has more worthy candidates than any in recent memory. One could make a legitimate case for seven coaches.

All Shanahan has done in San Francisco is lead the 49ers back to the playoffs — with a shot at the No. 1 seed — despite losing Pro Bowlers such as Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, George Kittle and Purdy for long stretches this season. On Sunday night, Kittle was out and All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams was lost early in the game. San Francisco still found a way, thanks in large part to Shanahan’s play calling late.

Ben Johnson not only unlocked Caleb Williams in Year 2 but also flipped a franchise that hadn’t won double-digit games in any of the past six seasons. Most impressive, perhaps, is how disastrously it all started: The Bears, if you’ll recall, blew an 11-point second-half lead in their season opener to the Vikings, then were routed 52-21 in Detroit a week later. It wasn’t just bad, it was ugly. “It’s a kick in the teeth,” Johnson said that day, fuming at the postgame podium. It looked like the start of another long year in Chicago.

The Bears have won 11 of 14 since. Seven wins have come in one-score games. For a team that slogged through a 10-game losing streak last season, it’s hard to think of a more stunning about-face.

Then again, the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel has a case. From 4-13 to 13-3, Vrabel has accomplished the same thing in New England, changing the entire outlook for a franchise in a matter of months. The Patriots became a bottom dweller in Bill Belichick’s final few seasons, then Jerod Mayo’s lone year, winning just eight combined games from 2023 to 2024. New England was picking in the top five of April’s draft. Heading into Week 18, it’s in contention for the AFC’s top seed.

In Jacksonville, Liam Coen is now just the 11th coach since 1970 to win 12 or more games in his first year as a head coach. He’s done a remarkable job — much like Vrabel — flipping a team that won just four games last season into a Super Bowl contender. And he did so without the 2025 No. 2 draft pick, wideout/cornerback Travis Hunter, who’s missed most of the season due to injury. With a win next week over the lowly Titans, the Jags would have the second-best regular-season record in franchise history.

In Seattle, it took only two years for Mike Macdonald to take what he built in Baltimore as the Ravens’ defensive coordinator and do the same with the Seahawks. A win next week over the 49ers and Macdonald will have delivered the Seahawks the NFC’s No. 1 seed and the franchise’s first NFC West title since 2020. That’s no small achievement any year, but especially this one, with Sean McVay and Shanahan at the top of their games.

The job Sean Payton has done in Denver has probably been taken for granted, partly because the Broncos showed so much promise last season, winning 10 games and making the playoffs with a rookie quarterback. But his three-year body of work has been tremendous: Payton climbed out of $85 million in dead cap money — what the Broncos paid to move on from Russell Wilson — and built his team into a Super Bowl contender in two short seasons. A win next week would tie the franchise record for regular-season wins, set in John Elway’s final season (1998). Payton is now one of two coaches in NFL history — Belichick is the other — to win at least 13 games in a season five times.

DeMeco Ryans, a candidate for this award each of the last two seasons, also deserves mention. He’s built the best defense in the league and lifted Houston from an 0-3 start to 11 wins and counting, plus an outside shot at a third straight division title. The Texans are now the fifth team since 1990 to begin a season 0-3 and make the playoffs.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/29005634/GettyImages-2253870968-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 14:59:44.845849

LOUIS — St. Louis Blues forward Pius Suter suffered a right ankle injury Saturday against the Nashville Predators and will be re-evaluated in four weeks, the club announced Monday.

Suter left the Blues’ 3-2 win over the Predators in the third period after he was tripped by the Predators’ Michael McCarron. He returned to finish the game, but afterward, Blues coach Jim Montgomery was still concerned about the play.

“We were worried because it looked like a slew foot from where we were,” Montgomery said. “I don’t think it was intentional, but it looked like (a slew foot). A lot of times that can be a bad injury.”

Suter didn’t practice Sunday with the Blues, and the update was that he’d be receiving an MRI in the afternoon.

“Not able to practice today; too sore,” Montgomery said. “He’s going to have an MRI later this afternoon and we’ll have more information for you. Day to day, I would rule him out for (Monday’s game against the Buffalo Sabres).”

The MRI results showed the injury to the right ankle, and now Suter becomes the latest Blues forward to be out long-term with an injury.

The 29-year-old has played in 37 games this season and has 14 points (seven goals, seven assists).

“We’re going to miss him,” Montgomery said. “Just his steady influence of being in position, penalty kill, defensively … as a low center or wing, he’s always in the right spot. We haven’t had enough forwards taking ownership of being reliable, trustworthy and really good at their habits and details defensively.”

What does this mean for the Blues?

Suter has come as advertised when he signed a two-year, $8.25 million free-agent contract with the Blues last summer. He’s in the middle of the pack in scoring with seven goals while averaging 16.5 minutes of ice time and he’s been plugged in on multiple lines at wing and center. His absence for the next four weeks leaves the club without a reliable veteran.

Unfortunately for the Blues, this is not new territory. They’ve been without Jordan Kyrou, Dylan Holloway, Jimmy Snuggerud, Jake Neighbours, Nathan Walker, Alexey Toropchenko and Nick Bjugstad up front this season.

Fortunately for the Blues, they’ve gotten a few of those players back recently with Kyrou and Snuggerud returning on Saturday and they’ve found a few replacements in recent weeks.

The Blues signed Robbi Fabbri to a one-year, free-agent contract and claimed Jonatan Berggren on waivers. They also called up Otto Stenberg, a first-round pick in 2023 (No. 25), and he has fit in nicely.

There’s enough depth that for Monday’s game against the Sabres, Fabbri and Mathieu Joseph will return to the lineup and Berggren will be a healthy scratch.

Here’s a look at the lines:

Neighbours-Thomas-Buchnevich

Stenberg-Schenn-Kyrou

Fabbri-Dvorsky-Snuggerud

Toropchenko-Sundqvist-Joseph

The loss of Suter isn’t ideal, but the Blues could perhaps get a couple of other injured players back before he returns. On Sunday, Montgomery said Bjugstad’s return from an upper-body injury remains uncertain, but out of Bjugstad, Holloway and Walker, he’s the closest to coming back.

The Blues announced on Dec. 15 that Holloway was out with a high-ankle sprain and would be re-evaluated in six weeks, putting his return toward the end of January. On Dec. 2, the club announced that Walker was out with an upper-body injury and would be re-evaluated in eight weeks, also putting his timeline toward the end of January.

In the immediate future, it means that Stenberg has even more of a guarantee that he’ll remain in the NHL, and that Fabbri will not be placed on waivers, which might have happened if everyone were healthy.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/29113957/USATSI_27892149-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 13:59:14.675220

The Raiders shut down Crosby due to a knee injury, placing him on injured reserve. However, this was a decision with which the five-time Pro Bowler ""vehemently"" disagreed, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. Crosby argued he is healthy enough to play, and wanted to finish out the season. This decision will cause Crosby to evaluate his future with the Raiders organization, according to NFL Media.

Crosby is set to have a meniscus trim, which is not a major procedure. On Saturday, he posted pictures and videos of him playing basketball and on a trampoline to his social media, which showed that he's not in debilitating pain that would force him off the field. The Raiders even felt the need to release a statement explaining their decision to place Crosby on injured reserve:

Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season.

In 15 games played, Crosby recorded 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss, 20 QB hits, 10 sacks, six passes defensed and his first career interception. Just nine months ago, Crosby signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension that includes $91.5 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time.

McBride's total also is a franchise record for catches in a season, toppling the 115 of wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in 2020.
But that wasn't nearly enough for the Cardinals (3-13) against the Bengals (6-10) to snap what is now an eight-game losing streak.
Gannon acknowledged he was down about the loss but added he was proud of McBride and his records.","THE STORY: CINCINNATI – Trey McBride leaped for the ball, a Jacoby Brissett fourth-down pass that had been tipped at the line and popped high in the air.

The tight end grabbed it for an impressive four-yard gain. The problem was it had come on fourth-and-7.

The play was a microcosm of another frustrating afternoon for the Cardinals, who despite beautiful temperatures at Paycor Stadium couldn't get much working in what turned out to be a 37-14 loss to the Bengals Sunday in their next-to-last game of the season.

""When you're on a team like this, you're playing to be an NFL football player,"" defensive lineman Calais Campbell said. ""Teams want winners. You've got to sign your work and show you belong in the NFL. Young guys are learning how to play football, and that's good for them, but overall, it's got to mean something to you.

""The message is simple.""

McBride ended up being the silver lining of a game once again. He had 10 receptions for 76 yards. His last catch was a touchdown, his 119th reception of the season. That total set the NFL record for tight ends in a season, snapping Zach Ertz's mark of 117 set when Ertz played for the Eagles in 2017. McBride's total also is a franchise record for catches in a season, toppling the 115 of wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in 2020.

But that wasn't nearly enough for the Cardinals (3-13) against the Bengals (6-10) to snap what is now an eight-game losing streak.

""It's really cool, and thankful for my teammates and coaches,"" a quiet McBride said. ""It's cool to get it in 16 games too – I didn't want anyone to give me a hard time about that.

""But honestly, it doesn't really matter. I would've loved to have won the game, loved to have played better as an offense. Just wasn't there today.""

Coach Jonathan Gannon said third downs were the biggest culprit; the Bengals were 10 of 15 (and 9 of 12 at one point) and the Cardinals 3 of 13. The Bengals had scoring drives of 12, 12, 10, 11 plays; the Cardinals' first seven possessions only exceeded three plays twice, and both were five plays long (albeit a Michael Wilson touchdown catch finishing one of those.)

Quarterback Jacoby Brissett didn't surpass 100 yards passing until a 23-yard fourth-down completion to Xavier Weaver in the first minute of the fourth quarter, although a late flurry got him to 212 yards passing total.

""You've got to earn the right to stay on the field,"" Brissett said.

""It's not rocket science. We just have to get out of our own way.""

The Cardinals were only able to gain 42 yards rushing, while Bengals QB Joe Burrow threw for 305 yards and two touchdowns before essentially taking the fourth quarter off. Bengals running back Chase Brown had 101 yards rushing and two touchdowns.

Gannon again emphasized he believed the effort was there from his team.

""I feel good about the guys going out there,"" Gannon said. ""We've got to coach better so they play better.""

When it came to the end of the game, the eyes were on McBride. That was all that was left to determine, and he grabbed everything that came his way. Gannon acknowledged he was down about the loss but added he was proud of McBride and his records.

""I don't want to overlook that,"" Gannon said.

McBride didn't want to either. But in the losing locker room minutes after a game, statistical marks always feel hollow.

,,2025-12-29 10:55:48+00:00,www.panthers.com,Tight end plan took a hit with Ja'Tavion Sanders injury - Carolina Panthers,Darin Gantt,,,,,https://www.panthers.com/news/tight-end-plan-took-a-hit-with-ja-tavion-sanders-injury-broken-ankle-mitchell-evans-sneak,"CHARLOTTE — The Panthers have used multiple tight ends all year long in a lot of different ways, and they continued to add to that Sunday.
That emphasis lasted exactly one play, as second-year tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders was injured on the first play from scrimmage and did not return, in the 27-10 loss to the Seahawks.
""We're going to miss him a lot because he's been so versatile, a guy that we can really count on,"" Canales said of Sanders.
""I mean, that stuff is tough, man,"" veteran tight end Tommy Tremble said.
Even without Sanders, the Panthers continued to expand the way they use their tight ends.","CHARLOTTE — The Panthers have used multiple tight ends all year long in a lot of different ways, and they continued to add to that Sunday.

But when they lined up with three tight ends for the first play of the game, it was a statement of intent, particularly with the way recent opponents have tried to load up and lean on the Seahawks defense.

That emphasis lasted exactly one play, as second-year tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders was injured on the first play from scrimmage and did not return, in the 27-10 loss to the Seahawks.

He had his right leg in a cast in the locker room and was already on a scooter, and Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he suffered a broken ankle and would have surgery tomorrow.

""We're going to miss him a lot because he's been so versatile, a guy that we can really count on,"" Canales said of Sanders.

The 2024 fourth-rounder had 29 receptions for 190 yards and a touchdown this season — last week's on-on-knee job, which helped them beat the Buccaneers.

""I mean, that stuff is tough, man,"" veteran tight end Tommy Tremble said. ""He's a good player, works hard, and so to see him go down, that was really tough for us as an offense. He's a good kid, good player, and so his going down was hard for all of us, but we've got to learn how to do the next-man-up mentality.

""We're praying for him to be healthy as soon as possible and get back to being right.""

Without Sanders, they weren't able to run some of the stuff they wanted to against the Seahawks, though they mixed backup offensive lineman Jake Curhan in as an eligible receiver on four plays.

""Yeah, it definitely took some of our game out of there,"" Canales said.

But they continued to lean into Tremble and rookie Mitchell Evans as they have all season, particularly on a day when they didn't get a lot going in the passing game (just 54 yards through the air).

""It definitely was a good little emphasis for us, that we were doing that with all of us out there,"" Evans said. ""But when that kind of happens, I think sometimes that happens, and you've got to be able to figure out how to adapt, when something like that happens, and we still have to be able to execute whatever this call and whatever we need to do.""

The Panthers have veteran tight end James Mitchell on the roster, and he appeared in four games this year when Sanders was out with an ankle injury (Weeks 4-6), as well as the Rams game when they were hit with injuries across the roster.

Mitchell has three catches for 28 yards in those four games and has appeared in 34 games over four seasons here and with the Lions.

""There's the utmost faith in James,"" Evans said. ""He's played a lot of ball, honestly. He's played a long time, so he knows his stuff. He knows the offense. He's always in there paying attention when we do our game plan. There's going to be no slouch off with that, and he's already up.""

Even without Sanders, the Panthers continued to expand the way they use their tight ends.

Faced with a fourth-and-1 in the second quarter, they put Evans under center to take the snap and sneak for the conversion. Using the 258-pound Evans instead of the 204-pound Bryce Young makes sense, especially since Evans (a former high school quarterback) did it at Notre Dame as well (where he had eight carries for 13 yards and a touchdown rushing).

""We've had it in for a couple of weeks now,"" Evans said. ""So, the first week when we put it in, we were just practicing it, getting ahold of it, getting that confidence. That's always a little frightening when somebody else is taking on a snap besides the quarterback, which I could see why, from a coach's perspective.

""But now that's on film, so the teams are going to have to prepare for that, have to keep that in their mind.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/v1766961841/panthers/hcabqcb6chndy7ftwt9n,N,,2025-12-29 11:01:21.713164

It was Gardner's first time on the field since Week 13, when he left the Colts' game against the Houston Texans with a calf injury, and he was making the sort of impact the Colts needed from their All-Pro corner.

But with just under six minutes remaining in the third quarter, Gardner left the field of play and was seen speaking with trainers on the sideline. He was not ruled out -- instead, his return was questionable due to a calf injury -- but he did not come back in the game.

Head coach Shane Steichen said after the game that Gardner felt tightness in the same calf he had been rehabbing for the last four weeks, but holding him out was more of a precaution than anything.

""(His) calf was just tight, so we just played it safe,"" Steichen said.

""It was tightening up on me a little bit,"" Gardner said. ""I told him not to rule me out because I was just going to try to just do my thing. But it was tightening up on me, especially when I would get blocked and try to put my weight back against it. But I don't think I've restrained it or nothing crazy.""

Gardner was a full participant in the Colts' Friday practice prior to Sunday's game, and said there was no hesitation in trying his best to get back on the field, regardless of where the Colts stood in terms of making the playoffs.

""That ain't how I operate,"" he said. ""I got so much gratitude for this game, it's a blessing to just be able to go out there and play. It's not just about the playoffs. I don't play this game solely for the playoffs, I play this game because this is my dream, I got a passion for this game.

Is he going to play on ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Chicago Bears? Here's the latest on Kittle and his status for Week 17.

George Kittle injury update

Kittle is inactive for ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Chicago Bears in Week 17.

He was considered ""highly unlikely"" to play, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

The tight end is dealing with a sprained ankle that forced him out of action at the end of the 49ers' Week 16 contest. He exited on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Indianapolis Colts and did not return for the fourth quarter.

Kittle was unable to practice all week, putting the 32-year-old's status in doubt for Week 17.

He is expected to test the ankle prior to the game, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.

If Kittle is ruled out, expect Jake Tonges to receive the majority of the receiving workload. Kittle missed five games earlier in the season with a hamstring injury, allowing Tonges to take over as TE1 in Kyle Shanahan's offense.

“To play that whole game and to not be an issue -- I think we only talked about him on one third down — my sense is he played real good,” Shanahan said.

The focus now turns to how long Williams will be out, if at all. The 49ers face the Seahawks for the NFC West title and No. 1 playoff seed this Saturday at Levi's Stadium, then begin a potential Super Bowl run in the weeks that follow.

Tight end George Kittle, who didn't play Sunday due to an ankle sprain, missed five games earlier this season with a severe hamstring injury. For those counting at home, Super Bowl LX is at Levi's Stadium in six weeks, on Feb. 8, while the NFC Championship Game is scheduled for Jan. 25, in four weeks.

As Shanahan said, the severity of Williams' injury is not yet known. He could miss one week, two weeks or no time at all -- making the No. 1 seed all the more important, which would give San Francisco a bye week before their playoff run begins.

AROUND THE SHIELD — Fred Warner's gruesome season-ending ankle injury may not have ended his season after all.

The former BYU star linebacker revealed during Sunday night's pregame promo of the 49ers' game against Chicago on NBC's Sunday Night Football that he's well ahead of schedule in his recovery from a dislocated and fractured right ankle in Week 6 of the 2025 regular season.

""I've got a chance,"" the 29-year-old said before he was shown in the stands with his wife, Sydney, and the couple's young son. ""That's the plan. So we're going to take this thing one day at a time. There's a whole lot of different steps, and T's got to be crossed, I's got to be dotted, in order to get there. But we're on track.""

San Francisco general manager John Lynch even floated the idea during a radio interview that the team is exploring the return of Warner during a potential playoff run.

""It would be well ahead of the original timeline we were given,"" he said, ""but Fred has the ability to move the doctors because they're going to put objective measurements out there where, 'Hey, if you can reach these, you can get there.' And Fred has continually done that. I think it's made a lot of people kind of re-examine: 'OK, would this be possible?' And I think that's a great thing. So I'm watching him.

""I've consistently said it,"" he added, ""I won't put anything past him.""

Of course, part of the calculation will include consideration of Warner re-aggravating the injured ankle. That may be why NFL.com projected a potential Warner's return to potentially come in spot duty no earlier than the NFC championship game — or even Super Bowl LX, which is scheduled to be held at Levi's Stadium.

Since the three-time All-Pro linebacker's gruesome ankle injury in a 30-19 loss to the Buccaneers on Oct. 12, San Francisco has improved to 12-4 after Sunday's 42-38 twin over Chicago. The 49ers are second in the NFC West, one game back of the division-leading Seahawks' 13-3 with one game remaining.

The two teams conclude the regular season next Saturday in Santa Clara, California (6 p.m. MST, ABC/ESPN).

Allen said the injury did not affect him, but he attempted 35 passes (with 23 completions for 262 yards) from inside the pocket.
With five sacks by the Eagles, Allen has been sacked 40 times this season, the most in his career.","ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Before Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen could take his usual moments to sit in the locker room and process Sunday's loss, he had to take a short walk.

Allen, accompanied by head athletic trainer Nate Breske, limped out of the locker room and across the hallway into the X-ray room.

The good news for Allen and the Bills is that his X-rays came back negative, according to coach Sean McDermott, who also said of Allen's health, ""Nothing new has popped up to this point.""

The bad news is that Allen's right foot, which he injured in a Week 16 win over the Cleveland Browns, became sore once again on Sunday during the Bills' 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles after that had subsided during the week.

Asked how much he felt the injury affected him during the game, Allen said, ""Zero.""

The defeat cost Buffalo any remaining chance at claiming the AFC East title -- the New England Patriots clinched the division, ending a five-season title streak by the Bills -- and put on display an offense that remains inconsistent amid Allen's injury.

""Coming into the game, I'd be lying if I didn't say I had my eyes on Josh,"" McDermott said. ""Just because of how important he is to us. And we're in the playoffs. But I also know who he is. And he's as competitive as there is, and as good as there is, but I also have a responsibility to protect him to make sure he's as healthy as possible for us as we move into the playoffs.

""You've got to know, to get [No.] 17 off the field, you're gonna have to ... I'm gonna have to wrestle him.""

On the field and in the playcalling, the Bills were inconsistent and had a variety of miscues. The team did not score until 5:11 remaining in the fourth quarter. Then they came up just short of rallying to win on a 2-point conversion attempt with seconds left when Allen missed on a pass intended for wide receiver Khalil Shakir.

""Yeah, I just missed,"" Allen said of the play. ""Rolling left, got to get him a better ball.""

McDermott emphasized that he would make the decision to go for the win again and that he trusts Allen.

""Obviously, a play that we've been working in. It was there,"" Shakir said. ""I mean, me personally, I feel like maybe I could have came out, break a little faster and help 17 out and just make myself a little more available.""

Sunday's outing was Allen's second straight game without a passing touchdown, something he hadn't done since 2020. The team punted six times, lost a fumble by Allen just outside the red zone and had one turnover on downs that ended at the Eagles' 3-yard line. That all came despite the downfield passing game getting going via wideouts Brandin Cooks (four receptions for 101 yards) and Tyrell Shavers (two catches, 36 yards), while the Eagles stifled the league's rushing leader in James Cook III to 74 yards on 20 carries.

Allen said the injury did not affect him, but he attempted 35 passes (with 23 completions for 262 yards) from inside the pocket. It was the first time in his career he attempted 20-plus passes in a game all from inside the pocket.

His scrambling was diminished, as he rushed just two times for 8 yards and zero first downs after entering the contest with the second-most scramble yards (413) in the NFL. He did have two tush push rushing touchdowns.

With five sacks by the Eagles, Allen has been sacked 40 times this season, the most in his career.

There are now decisions to be made by Buffalo in terms of giving players rest, as the team's regular-season finale versus the New York Jets next Sunday will be only for playoff seeding but likely will mark the final game at the Bills' current stadium.

Buffalo starting linebacker Terrel Bernard left in the first half against Philadelphia with a calf injury, while right tackle Spencer Brown took a hit to his left eye -- with jawing between the Bills' offensive line and Eagles' defensive line extending to the walk to the postgame locker room -- that he said needed further examination.

""We've got a lot of things we need to discuss as a leadership group,"" McDermott said. ""You've got the last game in Highmark Stadium here; that's important to me. It'll be important to our guys, to our staff. There are other things that come into consideration. It won't be easy, but it is important that we have a good week here.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1229%2Fr1594595_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 01:58:14.642917

Will Darnell Wright play vs. 49ers?

Right tackle Darnell Wright was a late addition to the injury report on Saturday afternoon. Wright, like several other Bears players, has been battling an illness. He did not travel with the team on Saturday, but he's officially questionable. It sounds like Wright could travel separately, to avoid infecting other players. But his status for Sunday night's game against San Francisco is up-in-the-air at this point.

Will Rome Odunze play in Week 17?

The Bears will be without star wide receiver Rome Odunze for the third straight game as he continues to nurse a lingering foot injury. Odunze didn't practice all week, and it sounds like Chicago might be content with resting him the remainder of the regular season before bringing him back for the playoffs. But the good news is that rookie wideout Luther Burden III will make his return to the lineup on Sunday night.

Will Nahshon Wright play vs. 49ers?

Cornerback Nahshon Wright has been a revelation for the Bears this season, and he leads the league with eight takeaways. Wright was limited for the first two days of practice with a hamstring injury and battling an illness that appears to be going around Halas Hall. Wright is officially questionable after not practicing on Friday, and the hope is he'll be good to go. If not, Tyrique Stevenson will see more playing time opposite Jaylon Johnson, who's working his way back to 100 percent.

Will T.J. Edwards play in Week 17?

Linebacker T.J. Edwards once again popped up on the injury report this week with a glute injury suffered during last week's win over the Packers. Edwards didn't practice for the first two days before being a limited participant on Friday. He's officially questionable for Sunday night's game against the 49ers. If Edwards can't play, D'Marco Jackson will slide back into the starting role (where he thrived) alongside Tremaine Edmunds.","https://bearswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/05/SBRS/87113328007-usatsi-25132842-168403263-lowres.jpg?crop=2243,1262,x0,y0&width=2243&height=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 12:00:32.882963

Williams was initially listed as questionable after leaving in the first quarter. The 49ers ruled him out at halftime.

Williams sustained the injury on San Francisco's first drive. He was noticeably limping on the sideline and removed his gear to have a seat on the bench after spending several minutes undergoing evaluation in a sideline medical tent.

The injury, if significant, has the potential to impact the 49ers not just for Sunday's game but as they attempt to secure the No. 1 seed in the NFC and into the playoffs. The severity of Williams' injury wasn't initially clear, but hamstrings have the potential to linger as multi-week injuries.

A four-time All-Pro, Williams is one of the best to ever play his position. He earned his 12th Pro Bowl selection this season and remains one of the game's best at 37 years old. He's critical to San Francisco's success in both the run and pass games.

San Francisco entered Sunday's game already down a key offensive player with All-Pro tight end George Kittle sidelined by a sprained ankle. Kittle sustained the injury in Monday's win over the Indianapolis Colts and was questionable on Sunday before being ruled out prior to kickoff.

The 49ers have plenty at stake over the remainder of their season. They entered Sunday's game at 11-4, having already clinched a playoff berth. But with wins over the Bears Sunday night and next week against the Seattle Seahawks, they'd clinch the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs that comes with it.

Williams was away from the play when it began but attempted to chase down Edwards to prevent the score before pulling up and reaching for his right hamstring. He immediately went to the medical tent where he stayed for San Francisco's ensuing drive.

When Williams emerged a few minutes later, he took off his gloves and tape, a sign that he was unlikely to return. Williams was named to his 12th Pro Bowl last week, the most ever for an offensive tackle, and he had not sat out a game this year after an ankle injury cost him the final seven games of the 2024 season.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1229%2Fr1594560_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 23:59:45.677235

However, Gardner found himself back on the sidelines mid matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The cornerback has suffered another calf injury and is now questionable to return, the team announced. Already into the fourth quarter, it seems unlikely that Gardner will return for the Week 17 matchup.

If he remains out for Week 18, Gardner's debut with the Colts will end on a whimper. Indianapolis invested heavily into the cornerback, trading a pair of second-round picks to the New York Jets for his services. However, injuries have held Gardner back since his arrival.

Overall, he managed to appear in four games with the Colts, including the Jaguars battle prior to his departure. The defensive back made 16 tackles and three passes defended. Over his entire 10-game season, Gardner earned a 75.1 grade from Pro Football Focus, ranking 14/111 cornerbacks.

Entering the offseason, the Colts will be looking to get Gardner fully acclimated into their defense. He won't be swapping teams in the middle of the year. He'll be able to soak in exactly what Indianapolis wants to do and put himself in a position to make a considerable difference come 2026.

But that can't happen if Gardner isn't healthy. The first order of business will simply be getting past his calf ailment. With the Colts already eliminated, the cornerback will have plenty of time to do so.

Indianapolis sunk plenty of resources bringing Gardner to the Colts. They'll hope the results are much stronger, and healthier next season.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sauce-Gardner-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 23:59:49.010751

The timing of Croby's posts should raise a few eyebrows from Raiders fans, given the team placed Crosby on injured reserve Saturday, citing his need to undergo knee surgery.

Earlier in the week, however, Crosby seemed like he was ready to keep playing in 2025. With the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft potentially on the line Sunday, Crosby told reporters he didn't care about the pick and wanted to win.

The Raiders lost, 34-10, and are now in control of the No. 1 pick with one game left in the season against the visiting Kansas City Chiefs.

The Raiders felt differently, and officially shut down Crosby on Saturday. Once informed of the decision, the star said he wanted to leave the team's facility, which the Raiders allowed. He wasn't the only big-name player shut down by the Raiders ahead of Sunday's defeat against the Giants. Tight end Brock Bowers, who has battled injuries all season, was also placed on IR ahead of the matchup.

The Leeds United centre-back had to limp off in the 31st minute after awkwardly bending his right ankle twice.","Whatever Daniel Farke said to his players at half-time at the Stadium of Light, he should try to repeat the trick.

Within two minutes of the restart, Leeds scored a quite sublime team goal, with all 11 players involved in a 12-pass move that was deftly guided home by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Of course.

The striker scored for the sixth Premier League game in a row as Leeds came from behind to earn a point at Sunderland.

It could so easily have been more, too: Calvert-Lewin brought the ball down beautifully to feed Brenden Aaronson in the first half, only for his shot to be cleared off the line, and Jayden Bogle and Calvert-Lewin collided in their bid to add a second.

Simon Adringa had put Sunderland ahead after 28 minutes, dispatching Granit Xhaka’s delightful pass with a right-foot curling finish, and Joe Rodon was forced to come off in the 31st minute after two challenges on his right ankle.

Following a draw that puts Leeds United seven points ahead of 18th-placed West Ham United, Beren Cross analyses the key talking points…

A Leeds goal for the ages

Dominic Calvert-Lewin kept himself in the national headlines (and the conversation for a place in England’s World Cup squad) with his seventh goal in six matches, but the build-up to that strike is what should stick in the memory. All 11 Leeds United players touched the ball in a 12-pass move from one end to the other before their No 9 applied the finish.

Jaka Bijol got things moving a couple of yards away from the right side of the away penalty area. There was a small triangle of passes from him to Ethan Ampadu, to Ao Tanaka, to Jayden Bogle, who then went longer to Bijol, back towards the centre.

The Slovenian then went back to Lucas Perri inside the six-yard box. The goalkeeper moved it wide left to Pascal Struijk, who exchanged a one-two with Gabriel Gudmundsson before driving the ball forward to Noah Okafor.

Okafor was still in the Leeds half, but space had begun to open up as he then moved it inside to a marauding Anton Stach. The German had arguably the most important pass in the move as he drove the entire team upfield with a ball into space for Brenden Aaronson.

Aaronson, between the halfway line and the Sunderland area, held off a challenge to carry into the box before slipping a low pass into the six-yard area for another Calvert-Lewin special from close range.

What did this result mean for Leeds?

On another day, Leeds United win this game. After an even first half, they utterly dominated the second period, fuelled by the early equaliser Calvert-Lewin squeezed home in the 47th minute.

By full time, Farke would have wondered how his team were not taking another three points from this excellent run of form they have found. They are now unbeaten in five matches and, most importantly, an extra point away from the drop zone.

Sixteenth place continues to sound precarious, but United are now seven points clear of West Ham United in 18th and only two points behind Bournemouth. An away draw, especially as a new face in the division, is never a bad result, but Farke and his charges will be ruing what could have been.

Furthermore, the character shown to respond again to going behind was admirable. Sunderland have, rightly, been lauded for their performances this season and have been very strong at the Stadium of Light. United would have been forgiven by neutrals for collapsing after falling behind here.

As it was, they stabilised in an even first period before putting their foot on the home throat in the second half. They just couldn’t find that slice of luck, quality, or refereeing decision to tip it their way.

How did Rodon’s injury change the game?

After receiving so many plaudits for breaking the 100 barrier for consecutive league starts, Joe Rodon must have known an unexpected issue would be around the corner. The Leeds United centre-back had to limp off in the 31st minute after awkwardly bending his right ankle twice.

Within the game’s opening five minutes, Rodon was left in a heap after a challenge by Brian Brobbey. Television replays showed the Wales international’s right ankle hyperextended, and he took a little while to gingerly get to his feet.

The 28-year-old did not quickly run it off either. It took several minutes for him to look like he was running anything like comfortably when, unbelievably, he bent the same ankle in the same place.

Adingra challenged Rodon and when he went down, he repeatedly punched the turf, doing several half-rolls in pain, too. Treatment did come from the club’s medical staff this time, but he again hobbled back on to continue.

Rodon struggled on through the throw-in, which eventually saw Sunderland take the lead. He was marginally playing Adingra onside when the pass was threaded to him for a finish.

As the hosts celebrated, Rodon went down and Ao Tanaka came on, switching Leeds back into the 4-3-3 we have seen for so much of this season. It didn’t see much of a change in momentum for the rest of the first half, but the second period started with a United transformation as Rodon watched from the bench with his right ankle in a protective boot.

What was said after the game?

Speaking to Sky Sports, Calvert-Lewin discussed his knack for scoring goals from the centre of the pitch: “I think it’s something that, when you find a good rhythm and good momentum, the timing seems to come with it. As a centre-forward, you can make a lot of runs sometimes and not get the ball, and you need a lot of things to come together for it to be a goal, so thankfully at the moment my form is good and I’m getting in the right places and I’m scoring goals.”

The forward also praised his team-mates for providing those chances. “Everything feels quite fluid at the moment,” he said. “I’m getting in the right areas and people are finding me. I think it’s taken a little bit of time for players around me to maybe learn my game and what I’m good at, but I like to think when I get service and the ball comes to me, I’m lethal in the box.”

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said following Pittsburgh's 13-6 loss that Washington has broken his arm.

Washington was seen after the game wearing a cast and sling over his injured arm. His availability moving forward is not currently known. The Steelers host the Baltimore Ravens next week in a game that will determine which team will win the AFC North and the playoff spot that comes with it.

Washington caught both of his targets for 15 yards prior to exiting Sunday's game. A former third-round pick, the 6-foot-7 Washington was in the midst of his most productive season to date with a career-high 31 catches through 16 games.

""Yeah, Darnell is a big part of what we do,"" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said when asked about how Washington's absence impacted the offense.

If Washington is out for a significant portion of time, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth would likely have a bigger role in the offense. Neither player, however, is as good as a blocker as Jones, who is often used in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's offense as a pseudo tackle.

Along with Washington, the Steelers played the entire game without DK Metcalf, who also won't face the Ravens next week as part of his two-game suspension stemming from last week's altercation with a Lions fan. The absences of both players clearly had a negative impact on Rodgers, who threw for just 168 yards on 21 of 39 passing.

""We didn't execute very well on third downs,"" Rodgers said. ""I didn't have a very good game. Didn't run the ball early like we wanted to. Pretty bad on third down.""

One Steelers offensive player who did have a good game Sunday was Jaylen Warren, who rushed for a game-high 64 yards on 12 carries. Warren is among Pittsburgh's skill players who will have to pick up the slack even more next week with Metcalf out and Washington's status in question.

""Nobody's panicking,"" Warren said after Sunday's game when asked about Pittsburgh's current predicament. ""I'm not worried.

The Ravens entered Saturday needing three things to happen over the next two weeks to win the AFC North and qualify for the playoffs. They took care of the first part with their victory over the Packers. Now comes the most unlikely step. The Ravens need the last-place Browns to beat the Steelers on Sunday for the Week 18 Baltimore-Pittsburgh matchup to have any playoff ramifications.

If the Steelers win, the Ravens are eliminated from playoff contention. If the Browns pull off the upset, next week’s Ravens-Steelers game will be for the AFC North crown. At least, the Ravens have forced the Steelers to win it outright.

Micah Parsons and Devonte Wyatt aren't coming back to save this Packers run defense. In their first game without Parsons last Saturday, the Packers surrendered 150 rushing yards on 26 carries (5.8 YPC) against the Bears before allowing a whopping 308 yards on the ground from 52 carries (5.9 YPC) against the Ravens.

Derrick Henry ran all over Green Bay's depleted front for 216 yards on 36 carries (6.0 YPC). Not having their two best defensive linemen is only so much of an excuse, though, and the Packers will have to be far better up front against whoever they face in the first round of the playoffs. With a loss on Saturday, the Packers locked up the No. 7 seed for the third consecutive season.

Ravens coach John Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Todd Monken listened to questions all week about why Derrick Henry did not see the field in the final two drives of the 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. They seemed determined not to make the same mistake again. Henry had 15 carries with less than two minutes elapsed in the second quarter. He had five games this year in which he didn’t get 15 carries.

He had 21 carries at halftime, just four off his season high. He had 27 through three quarters, two over his season high. It’s easy to question why the Ravens haven’t leaned harder on Henry all year, but for one night, they did — and the Packers struggled to stop him.

As if the Packers hadn't suffered enough injuries this season, five more players suffered injuries Saturday and were ruled out for the remainder of the game. Backup safety and ace special teamer Zayne Anderson (ankle), reserve defensive tackle Jordon Riley (Achilles) and backup cornerback Kamal Hadden (ankle) were all carted off. Cornerback Nate Hobbs (ankle) and wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) also went down and didn't return.

Add that group to the list of defensive end Micah Parsons, tight end Tucker Kraft, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, center Elgton Jenkins and tight end John FitzPatrick already out for the season.

There has been plenty of talk in recent weeks about how much money Malik Willis is earning himself in the offseason. But Tyler Huntley, the Ravens’ No. 2, is doing pretty well for himself, too. Starting in place of Lamar Jackson, Huntley ran Baltimore’s offense beautifully, leading the team to its most points since Week 2. Every chance he’s gotten to play this year, he’s handled himself really well, and he’s played a key role in arguably Baltimore’s two most impressive wins this season, against Chicago and Green Bay.

Huntley had to wait around a long time this summer to get a job offer from the Browns. He probably won’t be waiting that long this coming summer.

Malik Willis is going to get a hefty bag this offseason and deservedly so. The Packers' backup quarterback continued to look like an NFL starter in completing 18-of-21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown against Baltimore while running nine times for 60 yards and two touchdowns before re-injuring his right shoulder midway through the fourth quarter.

The Packers' acquired Willis for a seventh-round pick on the eve of the 2024 season and the deal has been a bargain. After crashing out in Tennessee, Willis has proven himself as a thrower and a runner.

Tyler Huntley also spoke after Baltimore's win: “It was a must-win and we got it done.”

Huntley says he wants to get out of his news conference so he can give his old teammate Shedeur Sanders a call and offer him encouragement. Sanders is starting for the Browns against the Steelers tomorrow, and the Ravens need Cleveland to win to remain in contention for the playoffs.

John Harbaugh speaking after Baltimore's victory: “A heart-defining win is what that was.”

He says that Derrick Henry authored one of the greatest performances he’s ever seen. He also adds that Tyler Huntley couldn’t have played any better, calling him “A plus.”

Finally, Harbaugh explains that he took the ball to start game rather than deferring because of wind considerations and he wanted to play with the lead.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/7PwzAFeNg2PQ_7CScNNeTk3lz_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 21:57:53.866649

""Because we've done it all season,"" Rodgers said, explaining the root of that confidence.","CLEVELAND -- Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Darnell Washington sustained a broken arm in Sunday's 13-6 loss to the Cleveland Browns, coach Mike Tomlin said.

He added he doesn't know Washington's timeline to return.

Washington exited late in the first quarter as the Steelers' leading receiver at that point with 15 yards on two catches on two targets. His longest catch went for 11 yards on third-and-16. Though Washington was short of a first down, the Browns were flagged for taunting at the end of the play to continue the Steelers' drive for an eventual field goal.

""Darnell is a big part of what we do,"" said quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who completed 21 of 39 attempts for 168 yards.

Washington's absence was especially significant for an offense that also played without its top two wide receivers in DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin III (hamstring).

The Steelers will be without Metcalf, who had a season-high 148 receiving yards in the first meeting with the Baltimore Ravens, for the Week 18 de facto AFC North title game as he serves the second game of a two-game suspension for an altercation with a fan in Detroit, and now they also could be without Washington.

""It was an impact,"" Tomlin said of missing Metcalf against the Browns. ""But we certainly got capable men, and we expect those guys to make necessary plays, and we certainly didn't make enough today.""

Washington, who has 29 receptions for 349 yards and a touchdown this season, is also instrumental in the Steelers' tush push play, often the primary pusher behind tight end/fullback Connor Heyward. The Steelers lined up for only one tush push against the Browns in a play that turned out to be a fake and a 29-yard gain by Heyward.

""We get challenged with the attrition component all the time,"" Tomlin said, explaining the impact of Washington's absence on his short-yardage decision-making. ""We make no excuses regarding that. We got capable men. We adapt, adjust, and we keep moving.""

With the trio of pass catchers out, the Steelers turned to a collection of midseason pickups and under-the-radar receivers to fill the void. The group was largely ineffective as the Steelers averaged only 3.9 yards per completion and failed to score a touchdown for the first time all season.

Facing fourth-and-1 from Cleveland's 22-yard line as the Steelers trailed 10-3 late in the second quarter, Rodgers opted to take a deep shot to receiver Scotty Miller in the end zone. In the past, the Steelers have utilized the tush push in those situations. This time, though, Rodgers' 50-50 ball to Miller was too high, and the Steelers squandered a scoring opportunity created by rookie Jack Sawyer's interception of Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders.

Rodgers also targeted wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling, his former Green Bay teammate who was signed from the Steelers' practice squad to the active roster earlier this month, nine times, including three in a row from Cleveland's 7-yard line with seconds left in the game.

""[Rodgers] had eligibles on the play, and certainly [Valdes-Scantling] was one of them, and he's a capable guy,"" Tomlin said. ""I got no qualms about us playing to win the game in the way that we did.""

Rodgers and Valdes-Scantling didn't appear to be on the same page for his second-and-goal throw with 24 seconds left, and Rodgers was nearly picked off by Denzel Ward in the end zone. He went back to the receiver on the next play, but again, Valdes-Scantling wasn't where Rodgers anticipated him to be. This time, Rodgers threw inside, but the receiver stayed wide on the right side of the end zone.

With one final shot to tie the score, Rodgers again looked for Valdes-Scanting, but this time he was blanketed by Ward, and the pass fell incomplete.

""That was definitely interference,"" Rodgers said of the fourth-down play by Ward on Valdes-Scantling.

Asked about the play, Valdes-Scantling said, ""The ball went up, and [Ward] did a good job of playing through me. I thought I could've got a call, but no call was made. That's what it was.""

Tight end Pat Freiermuth finished as the Steelers' leading receiver with 63 yards on three receptions in five targets.

With the loss, the Steelers enter Week 18 facing the highest stakes of the season. A win against the Ravens would send Pittsburgh to the postseason. A loss ends the Steelers' season and gives their rival the AFC North title and playoff berth.

Rodgers, though, expressed confidence in his team to bounce back.

""Because we've done it all season,"" Rodgers said, explaining the root of that confidence. ""We've handled adversity well, and when we had to play our best ball, we did -- other than today.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594453_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:57:48.424133

“Looking forward to see the game plan the Pats come up with today with the injuries they’re dealing with,” Hoyer wrote on X before Sunday’s game. “Losing Hollins crushed my soul!”

Hoyer won a Super Bowl with the Patriots in 2018. Hoyer played in 30 games for the Patriots over the course of eight seasons, serving as a backup for most of his career. He played more games for the Patriots than any of the other seven teams he played on in his 15-year career.

Hollins has been a phenomenal addition to the Patriots. He was third on the team in receptions and receiving yards. He had played 68% of the Patriots’ snaps on offense this year, which is more than any other receiver.

The biggest reason Hollins stays on the field is because of his ability as a blocker. At 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, his size plays a huge role in the run game. He is an important part of what the Patriots are trying to achieve in the ground game, but his build makes him different than the other receivers on the team.

Story continues below advertisement

Hollins has been a great presence in the middle of the field, catching balls in traffic, but he is also a real deep threat that challenges defensive backs in the air. The Patriots do not have a direct replacement for his size in the receiver room, so younger players will need to step up in their own way.

Hollins could return at some point this season, but it will take a deep run in the playoffs. He could be eligible to return in the AFC Championship Game or the Super Bowl.

Several of their key players will be unavailable as their disappointing years wind down. Both teams are in last place in their divisions and completely out of the playoff race.

What’s the New York Giants Injury Report for Week 17?

The Giants will enter Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season with just a 2-13 record as they have lost each of their past nine consecutive games. Their focus can now turn to the future, especially continuing to develop promising rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, but they will be without several of their key players when they take on the Raiders this week.

Star offensive tackle Andrew Thomas, an important protector of Dart, has officially been ruled out with a hamstring injury. He was unable to practice at all this week, so his injury designation doesn’t come as much of a surprise, but his absence is surely notable.

New York will also be missing other key offensive linemen in John Michael Schmitz and Evan Neal, so their protection will be compromised against Las Vegas. They will also be without starting tight end Theo Johnson, further weakening their offense as a whole. He was a late addition to their injury report with an illness that resulted in him being inactive for this contest.

Their defensive secondary will be missing safety Tyler Nubin, who was held out of practice all week with a neck injury. On the positive side, cornerback Deonte Banks does not have a designation on the final injury report, despite being limited at practice with a shoulder injury.

The Raiders will also enter this game with a 2-13 record amid their disappointing 2025 NFL season in their first year with head coach Pete Carroll. They have several key names on their injury report as well, including some of their best overall players on both sides of the ball.

Brock Bowers was put on the injured reserve list this week with a knee injury, which officially ends his year. He was having another strong campaign as the eighth-ranked tight end in PFSN’s Impact Rankings for this season, but will now be unavailable for their final two games.

He is joined by their superstar edge rusher, Maxx Crosby, who has also been ruled out with a knee injury of his own. He reportedly wanted to play in this game against the Giants, despite not practicing all week, but Las Vegas still decided to rule him out when they take on New York.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28104925/giants-raiders-injury-report-12-28-25-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:58:12.347968

At halftime, with the Colts leading 10-7, Thomas hasn’t been too involved and also suffered an injury

What’s Happening With Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr.?

In that second quarter, Thomas spent time on the Jaguars’ sideline getting checked out.

According to a report from ESPN Jaguars reporter Michael DiRocco, Thomas was being checked out for an ankle injury.

“Trainers were looking at Brian Thomas Jr. left ankle/foot,” DiRocco wrote. “He’s on the sideline now, walking around.”

Thomas only has one catch for four yards and has only been targeted by Lawrence on that one play. Thomas did return to the game, but his injury situation will be worth keeping an eye on as the game progresses.

Thomas was a first-round draft choice (No. 23 overall) by the Jaguars in the 2024 NFL Draft. He played his college ball at LSU.

According to the PFSN NFL WR Impact metrics, Thomas has an impact score of 71.1 and grades out to a C-. So far this season, Thomas has 41 catches for 619 yards and two touchdown receptions. He’s averaging 15.1 yards per catch for Jacksonville this season, which has really helped Lawrence and the Jaguars’ offense.

In almost two seasons with Jacksonville, Thomas has 128 catches for 1,901 yards and 12 touchdown receptions. His career-long reception is an 85-yarder, which came in his rookie season. One thing that Thomas has going for him is ball control. He’s not fumbled once while playing with the Jaguars.

Is Thomas an option when the Jaguars look to run the ball? It’s a rather small sample size, but he has nine carries for 69 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown.

While Thomas has returned to the game against the Colts, a big one for Jacksonville, head coach Liam Coen and the team’s medical personnel will closely monitor him. Jacksonville really needs all hands on deck against Indianapolis and quarterback Philip Rivers.

But the Jaguars are going to have to come back in the second half after going into halftime down three points. Let’s see if Thomas has a bigger role in the Jaguars’ offense.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28141439/auto-draft-12-28-25-9-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:01.948806

“Steelers TE Darnell Washington has a forearm injury and is questionable to return to today's game,” Lauten wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

The news didn't get any better as Washington was later ruled out for the game. It was a big development for the Steelers, as they're already without DK Metcalf after he was suspended for the last two games of the regular season because of the incident he had with a Detroit Lions fan last week.

Aaron Rodgers now has to find a way to spread the ball around to his other receivers, and he may have to rely on the run game, which has not been that effective this season. Nonetheless, the Steelers have found ways to win with less this season, and as long as Rodgers is playing, they have a chance.

The offense is the only group for the Steelers who is missing key players. TJ Watt has missed the past few games because of a lung injury, but he should be back on the field. Despite the injuries, the Steelers are still at the top of the AFC North, and the Baltimore Ravens are creeping right behind them. A win or a tie against the Browns will help them clinch the division.

On the other hand, if they were to lose, then it would come down to the final week of the season to decide who will win the division. between them and the Ravens.

Sorry 9ers we’re going to make your whole team sick for next week.

Of fucking course. At least they'll all be recovered by the playoffs.

Unfortunately, it appears the team may have lost a top pass catcher on the first play of the game due to an injury.

Running back Rico Dowdle made a great play for a gain of about 11 yards. However, as he was brought down, he landed on the back of Ja'Tavion Sanders' leg, according to Joe Person of The Athletic. The Panthers' starting tight end needed help walking to the sidelines with trainers before being carted off the field to the locker room.

“Ja'Tavion Sanders is down after Rico Dowdle landed on the back of his leg.”

The Panthers quickly ruled Sanders out of the contest, per DaShawn Brown of WSOC-TV. The 22-year-old tight end will have to be replaced by Tommy Tremble and Mitchell Evans for the remainder of Sunday's contest against the Seahawks.

“Ja'Tavion Sanders will not* return. He's out with an ankle injury.”

Carolina will have to evaluate Sanders' status moving forward. Ideally, it's nothing too serious, and he can return to action by Week 18.

Jacksonville are chasing a 12-win season for the third time in franchise history. They will not be able to match the 14 wins of 1999, but can level the 12 wins of 2005. Jacksonville have won six in a row with Indianapolis losing their last five. After locking up a playoff place, a win will keep Jacksonville on top of the AFC South after Houston’s win yesterday.

Trevor Lawrence is humming - he has 10 touchdowns in his last two games (eight passing and two rushing) - and the passing game is one of the league’s most productive and varied, with five different leading receivers in their last five games. But the ground game has stalled somewhat. In their last four games, the Jags average 90.5 rushing yards per game, fewest in the NFL. No one has scored more touchdowns than Travis Etienne since Week 11 (9), but he is without a 100-yard rushing game since Week 4’s win over the 49ers.

And the offensive line has been in a constant flux all season, a trend that continues. Right guard Patrick Mekari (back) and center Robert Hainsey (groin) miss today’s game.

Without the ball, Anthony Campanile’s unit is still the NFL’s No 1 run defense, with Jacksonville allowing 81 rushing yards per game in their last six games. With 28 takeaways, second-most in the NFL, Jacksonville have scored 100 points off takeaways, the highest in the league.

How many yards will Joe Burrow and the Bengals passing attack be able to put up today? The Cardinals defense is beat up and has not played well. Their injured corners were listed as questionable and are active on Sunday, but it still presents a significant mismatch against a full healthy Bengals passing attack. They showed off where they are at least week ripping off 45 points against the Dolphins, Burrow throwing for four touchdowns and 309 yards. The potential exists for this game to go in a similar fashion. Expect the Cardinals to bring pressure early and often to try to cause disruption, which opens up the possibility of Burrow finding explosive plays to Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, among others.

A true win for the Bengals on Sunday would involve Burrow and the receivers staying healthy considering neither team has anything to play for, but adding one more dominant offensive performance wouldn't hurt considering nearly the entire offense is back under contract next season.

Defensively, seeing production from Shemar Stewart would go a long way. He's finally back playing and healthy but wasn't much of a factor last week against the Dolphins coming back off IR. He's one player that could use positive momentum to help launch him into a critical offseason after what feels like a wasted rookie year.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The Patriots are entering Sunday’s game here against the Jets with only four wide receivers active since their top two receivers (in terms of playing time) are sidelined.

So without Mack Hollins (abdomen) and Kayshon Boutte (concussion) a bigger role is going to fall on rookie receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism.

Williams, a third-round pick in April, has played better of late after a slow start, but still has just seven catches this season, though he’s turned those receptions into 189 yards and three touchdowns. Chism was a training camp standout, but has been a healthy scratch in nine of 15 games this season and doesn’t yet have a reception.

Stefon Diggs will be the team’s no-doubt top receiver on Sunday. But if he draws extra attention from the Jets’ defense, Williams or Chism may need to step up. So it’ll be interesting to see how the rookie receivers respond on a day the Patriots enter with a banged-up roster, hopeful some of their young players will aptly fill the void.

The Browns will have their leading receiver, tight end Harold Fannin Jr. available for today's game vs. Pittsburgh despite a late-week injury scare.

Fannin has been targeted by Shedeur Sanders 42 times in Sanders' five starts, and Fannin's 70 receptions this season are a franchise single-season record for a rookie. Fannin was listed as questionable after he suffered a groin injury in practice on Friday, but the Browns went through their weekend activities believing Fannin would be able to play.

Sanders, Fannin and Myles Garrett remain the primary reasons Browns fans might still be watching as their 3-12 team tries to play spoiler against a Steelers team that clinches the AFC North with a win. Garrett has 22 sacks and is just a half-sack short of the single-season record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt, who won't play today due to injury.

With No. 1 wide receiver D.K. Metcalf serving a two-game suspension, expect the Steelers to focus on the run and a quick pass game focused on their tight ends and running backs. That might or might not also include an extra emphasis on avoiding and minimizing Garrett, which is something the Browns see almost every week. The last time Garrett didn't have at least a half-sack in a game was Week 6 in Pittsburgh, and Garrett has never sacked Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

Sanders is trying to play his way into the team's future plans, and he'll have to operate today without primary running back Quinshon Judkins, who suffered a season-ending leg injury last week. Running back Dylan Sampson returns from a hand injury and figures to lead a running back committee that will also include Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams. Sanders has thrown six touchdown passes and eight interceptions and today faces a veteran Pittsburgh defense that wants to force turnovers on its way to clinching the division.

The Browns have Pro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward back from a two-game absence. Slot cornerback Myles Harden will not play today due to a shoulder injury.

Dillon Gabriel, the Browns' usual backup quarterback, is inactive today due to a shoulder injury. The Browns promoted Bailey Zappe from the practice squad to be Sanders' backup. Besides Gabriel, and Harden, the Browns' other inactives are tight end David Njoku (knee), defensive tackle Sam Kamara (elbow), wide receiver Jamari Thrash and backup offensive linemen Jerremiah Byers and Kendrick Green.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The Patriots probably aren’t going to lose to the Jets, but this is a surprisingly big test for them as the playoffs loom.

That’s because the Patriots are dealing with a lengthy injury report that could linger into the postseason. So Sunday’s matchup against the Jets, while not expected to be a nailbiter, could be revealing about how ready the Patriots are.

There are two especially interesting positions to follow.

The first is wide receiver. The Pats placed Mack Hollins, who has played more at receiver for them than anyone else, on injured reserve Saturday due to an abdomen injury. They’re also without Kayshon Boutte (concussion), who has played the second-most snaps for them at wide receiver. They only have four healthy wide receivers entering Sunday’s game here, so expect plenty of jumbo formations from them with a focus on running the ball.

The second spot is defensive tackle. While Milton Williams, the team’s highest-paid player, was cleared to return to practice this week, he was not activated off injured reserve before the game. Additionally, Khyiris Tonga (foot) was ruled out of Sunday’s game, so the Patriots will enter with an inexperienced rotation of Cory Durden, Eric Gregory, Jeremiah Pharms Jr., and Leonard Taylor III. There’s opportunity there for the Jets to run the ball on this D-line.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/h6xAKkNbrCFg_Yt7BFCFJxQKR_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 12:58:51.254177

George Kittle, TE, SF (ankle): The fantasy playoffs and Sunday night game-time calls do not go well together, but here we are.
Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): He's not traveling to Vegas, so either Daniel Bellinger or Chris Manhertz could collect his targets.
Mason Taylor, TE, NYJ (neck): Stone Smartt and Jeremy Ruckert will split the TE duties, with Smartt more likely to end up in the box score.
Tetairoa McMillan, WR, CAR (illness): McMillan was added to the injury report Sunday morning, which certainly raised a lot of red flags.","Rome Odunze, WR, CHI (foot): Odunze was ruled out early in the week, but Luther Burden III (ankle) was removed from the team's final injury report. Burden may be the most reliable option at receiver because both DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus were added to the Bears' injury report on Sunday morning due to illness. Those receivers are now both questionable.

George Kittle, TE, SF (ankle): The fantasy playoffs and Sunday night game-time calls do not go well together, but here we are. It's best to have Jake Tonges available for a potential pivot, because reports from Sunday morning seem to indicate that Kittle is unlikely to play.

Ricky Pearsall, WR, SF (knee): If the injury-plagued receiver can't go, then Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson would likely get some extra looks. However, as of Sunday morning, it was looking likely that Pearsall would play.

Matt Prater, K, BUF (quad): Michael Badgley gets another opportunity to prove he still belongs on an NFL roster.

Anthony Richardson Sr., QB, IND (eye): He's not going to be activated from IR this week, so both Philip Rivers and Riley Leonard will be active for the Colts. Houston won on Saturday, eliminating Indianapolis from playoff contention, so aside from ""nostalgia,"" it makes little sense to start Rivers anymore -- but that won't stop it from happening.

Jason Sanders, K, MIA (hip): Sanders continues to practice with the team, but he is clearly not yet ready to be activated from IR. Riley Patterson continues to handle kicking duties.

Kayshon Boutte, WR, NE (concussion): There are only three fully healthy WR options for the Patriots: Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III.

Mack Hollins, WR, NE (abdomen): Hollins goes on IR. DeMario Douglas (hamstring) is active, but we still may see a little extra work for No. 2 TE Austin Hooper.

Alvin Kamara, RB, NO (knee): Audric Estime and jack-of-all-trades Taysom Hill will likely split backfield duties.

Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): He's not traveling to Vegas, so either Daniel Bellinger or Chris Manhertz could collect his targets.

Mason Taylor, TE, NYJ (neck): Stone Smartt and Jeremy Ruckert will split the TE duties, with Smartt more likely to end up in the box score. As expected, QB Tyrod Taylor is also inactive.

Calvin Austin III, WR, PIT (hamstring): The unlikely combination of Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen will lead the way in the Steelers' WR room, with DK Metcalf serving the first of a two-game suspension.

Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, ARI (heel): He was limited in practice again this week but is active. While we'd expect him to play at least a little bit Sunday, Michael Wilson should be the WR1 for the Cardinals, with Xavier Weaver also likely to get more looks.

Joshua Karty, K, ARI: If you're one of the 3% of ESPN fantasy managers with Karty still in your lineup this morning, get him out of there. He's a healthy inactive as the Cardinals have opted to stick with Chad Ryland at kicker this week.

Tetairoa McMillan, WR, CAR (illness): McMillan was added to the injury report Sunday morning, which certainly raised a lot of red flags. He is active, but you may have to hold your breath while watching.

Dylan Sampson, RB, CLE (hand): He's active and likely to handle lead back duties. Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams should work in tandem as backup options.

Harold Fannin Jr., TE, CLE (groin): Fannin was a late-week add to the injury report, but especially given that David Njoku is still out, all signs pointed to him playing. He is active.

Bhayshul Tuten, RB, JAX (finger): Tuten has been downgraded to out in advance of Sunday's release of inactives. LeQuint Allen Jr. will back up Travis Etienne Jr. on Sunday, though there still remains a possibility we see Tuten again before the season is over.

Charlie Smyth, K, NO (illness): The Saints don't have any other kickers on the roster and made no efforts to rectify that situation in advance of Sunday, so it's no surprise that Smyth is active.

Chris Olave, WR, NO (back): Since Olave traveled with the team to Tennessee, it's not a surprise to see he is active. Mason Tipton (groin), however, is inactive.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594209_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:18.989928

Josh Allen - Bills (QB)

Josh Allen suffered a foot injury in a win against the Cleveland Browns last week. He is expected to play and not miss any time, as the Bills (11-4) look to close the gap on the New England Patriots (12-3) in the AFC East.

TreVeyon Henderson - Patriots (RB)

Henderson suffered a concussion in the win over the Ravens during Week 16. His progression through the NFL's concussion protocol has cleared him to play today against the New York Jets. The Patriots can secure the AFC East with a win and a loss by the Bills.

George Kittle - 49ers (TE)

Kittle sustained an ankle injury against the Colts on Monday Night Football. He will be a game-time decision for Week 17 in a game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football. The 49ers have earned a playoff spot already, but can secure a top seed with a win in their final two games, which means Kittle will more than likely give it a go.

Marvin Harrison Jr. - Cardinals (WR)

Harrison Jr. will play in the Week 17 matchup against the Bengals after returning last week from missing two games. He may be limited in this one, so he would be more of a (sit) option this week to be on the safe side.

Injuries are playing a major part of the Week 17 schedule, and bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 17 need to know the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title.

Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.

Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes.

The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 44.5

Patriots at Jets (1 p.m. ET)

NE RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion, available)

NE WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

New England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson has cleared concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion.

The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, available)

CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, available)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

The Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is the team's RB1 this week. He's active after missing the last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is good to play. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest.

Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.

Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, available)

The Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who will return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday.

Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.

Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, available)

The Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is good to go after being listed as questionable.

The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.

Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)

ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, available)

Both teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week and he's active again this week despite battling a heel injury.

The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.

Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)

LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)

LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)

Star Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.

New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.

Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)

BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)

Buffalo's tight end depth may get tested here with both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox questionable with knee injuries in this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.

Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

This potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year.

San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.

Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, doubtful)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)

All eyes are on the status of two star receivers as Davante Adams, who leads the NFL in touchdown receptions, is doubtful for the Rams after missing last week's loss to Seattle while Drake London is questionable for Atlanta as he continues to battle a nagging knee injury. The Rams can help themselves in two ways on Sunday as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.

Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/01/af98ef3e-bf37-4fb4-b709-ff1245354c74/thumbnail/1200x675/0f2b540740d60034c95d45a86cefd9cc/treveyon-henderson-new-england-patriots-imagn-images.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:28.711036

Henderson suffered a concussion in the win over the Ravens during Week 16. His progression through the NFL's concussion protocol has cleared him to play today against the New York Jets. The Patriots can secure the AFC East with a win and a loss by the Bills.

George Kittle - 49ers (TE)

A toe injury will keep him on the sideline for a critical Week 17 matchup, and undrafted rookie Benjamin Chukwuma will start in his place, protecting Baker Mayfield's blind side. It will be the second career start for Chukwuma, who was impressive in his debut against the New Orleans Saints in Week 14.

The Buccaneers ruled out Wirfs and outside linebacker Anthony Nelson (knee) on Friday but otherwise didn't have any question marks headed into the weekend. With Nelson out, Jason Pierre-Paul will likely see more playing time after being elevated from the practice squad for the second week in a row. The Buccaneers need a win on Sunday to ensure that they will be playing for first place in the NFC South in Week 18 against Carolina.

Veteran linebacker Anthony Walker, who played for the Dolphins in 2024, will be active for the first time as a Buccaneer after re-signing with the team on December 15. Walker originally signed with the Buccaneers during the 2025 offseason but spent training camp in the reserve/NFI list and was released in the roster cutdown to 53 in late August. He was on the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad for the balance of the season before the Buccaneers brought him back. Walker has played in 99 NFL regular-season games with 83 starts, including 14 games and eight starts last season for Miami.

The Buccaneers and Dolphins submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 17 meeting at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. The Buccaneers elevated Pierre-Paul from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Dolphins had 52 players on their active roster after a series of moves on Saturday and elevated linebacker Derrick McLendon and offensive lineman Josh Priebe from the practice squad to get to 54. That meant they also had to name six players inactive before the game.

The Dolphins will be without starting safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who is dealing with a calf injury. Miami also had listed cornerback Isaiah Johnson, defensive lineman Benito Jones and wide receiver Dee Eskridge as either out our doubtful on their Friday injury report, but all three were subsequently placed on injured reserve.

If Kittle doesn't take the field against Chicago on Sunday night, the 49ers will have to rely on Luke Farrell, Jake Tonges and practice-squad callup Brayden Willis at tight end.","https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/01/SNIN/87547572007-2249214609.jpg?crop=5852,3295,x9,y198&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-28 11:59:49.112736

Unfortunately, his exceptional performance today might wind up being in vain.

Against the Lamar Jackson-less Baltimore Ravens at Lambeau Field, Willis was doing a pretty good job of moving the ball. He completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown while running the ball nine times for 60 yards and two more touchdowns. The rest of the Packers backfield had just nine yards combined.

Throughout the game, fans were gushing over Willis' performance with many remarking that he might have played himself into a massive free agent contract and possibly even a starting job somewhere in 2026.

Sadly, Willis' heroic effort ended on a sour note. He suffered a shoulder injury in the fourth quarter which knocked him out of the game. Backup Clayton Tune came in but threw an interception on his first pass, which the Ravens then used to start a sustained drive that helped them seal the game.

Bad Timing

The game itself didn't matter to Green Bay other than playoff seeding and when Love returns he'll be the one leading the team's postseason push.

As for Willis, the injury might be costly to his own future if it's bad. He was already playing through the game with the shoulder slightly injured but decided to fight on.

The Ravens killed most of the clock in his absence and rolled to the 17-point win, which kept their playoff hopes alive. Tune finished the game in the final seconds.

Willis got the start Saturday night in place of Jordan Love, who was ruled out with a concussion he suffered last week in Green Bay's loss to the Chicago Bears.

But the Green Bay Packers have failed to overcome them in the last three games.

From losing star defensive end Micah Parsons to a season-ending ACL tear two weeks ago in Denver to quarterback Jordan Love missing the second half of the Chicago Bears game and the entire matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, this team has had its share of bad luck with injuries, but they refuse to use it as an excuse.

“Guys going down all over the league, that ain’t just happening to us, you know what I mean?” Packers nickel back Javon Bullard said. “No matter how we put it, we’ve got to ball. We get paid to ball. We’ve got to go out there and execute. We’ve got to trust what the coaches are telling us. We’ve got to execute at a high level. We didn’t do that tonight. Injuries ain’t got (expletive) to do with it. Ravens played like they wanted to win and they did that.”

Here's an update on the Packers injury situation as they head into the final week of the regular season:

Jordan Love didn't clear concussion protocol

The Packers announced the day before kickoff of their Week 17 game against the Ravens that Love was downgraded from questionable to out, giving Malik Willis the nod to start. Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Love didn’t clear the concussion protocol to play.

“There’s a lot of tests you’ve got to pass,” LaFleur said. “Unfortunately, he just – I think he’s feeling physically good, but they have those measures in place obviously to protect our players, and he didn’t pass the necessary tests to clear the protocol.”

In addition to Love, starting right tackle Zach Tom (knee) missed his second straight game.

Willis, who was dealing with a shoulder injury he suffered in Chicago, exited the fourth quarter of the Ravens game, but LaFleur said he could’ve returned if necessary.

The Packers were shorthanded coming into the Ravens game and had several players drop out during the contest, but they'll be counting on their depth to contribute.

""When you come in, we expect you to play at the same standard that everybody else is playing – that Packers standard,"" Packers defensive end Lukas Van Ness said. ""Injuries are tough, but it's an unfortunate part of the game. We'll have to find ways for whether it's first, second or third string to rally and play up to the standard, because we're going to need everybody going into the postseason and this last game.""

In-game injuries pile up vs. Ravens

Zayne Anderson

A backup safety and key member of the special teams, Zayne Anderson limped off the field after a first-half kickoff return and was carted back to the locker room. He was ruled out the rest of the game with an ankle injury.

Jordon Riley

The Packers were already thin on the defensive line and missed productivity from Parsons and Devonte Wyatt when they lost another defensive tackle. Jordon Riley was ruled out with an Achilles injury during the game. Riley joined the Packers earlier this month off the New York Giants’ practice squad. He had two solo tackles in four games played.

Nate Hobbs

Packers cornerback Nate Hobbs has had knee injuries throughout his debut season in Green Bay and suffered another setback against the Ravens. Coming off one of his best performances last week against the Bears, Hobbs left the second quarter of the Ravens game due to a knee injury. It happened when Hobbs collided with Ravens receiver Zay Flowers in the end zone.

Dontayvion Wicks

Wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks missed the second half after being evaluated for a concussion.

Kamal Hadden

Backup cornerback Kamal Hadden had a tough break. Getting some snaps in place of Carrington Valentine, Hadden suffered an ankle injury while being part of a tackle on Derrick Henry. He was carted off the field. LaFleur said he had no updates on injuries, but did say Hadden’s ""didn’t look good.""

“I feel terrible for him,” LaFleur said. “It’s one of those unfortunate things that happens in football.”

LaFleur says it's too early for decision on playing Jordan Love in Minnesota

When the Detroit Lions lost to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas, the Packers clinched a playoff spot.

The team now will have to decide if they want to play starters for the regular-season finale in Minnesota or rest guys before the wild-card playoff round.

When it comes to Love playing next week, LaFleur is taking it day by day.

“I don’t want to speak too soon on that,” LaFleur said on Love’s availability. “We just want to get him through the protocol and then we’ll have a decision to make.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/28/PAPN/87932305007-apc-packers-vs-ravens-50713-122725-wag.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y37&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-28 12:59:22.784300

The mobile threat also led the Packers in rushing with nine carries for 60 yards and two rushing TDs.

That was until Saturday night, when the Green Bay Packers lost to the Baltimore Ravens.

Per Dubow, only two other teams in the Super Bowl era have lost two of these games in a single season: the 2021 Los Angeles Chargers and the 2024 Cincinnati Bengals. I’m sure this will increase with the amount of fourth-down attempts that teams are taking now, but for right now, Green Bay has pulled off an NFL first.

Here is the Packers’ path to their unique season.

Carolina Panthers @ Green Bay Packers

The Packers had two turnovers in this game, a Savion Williams fumble on the 15-yard line on the team’s opening drive of the game and a Jordan Love interception. Between those two drives, the Packers attempted three field goals and hit two of them.

In the fourth quarter, though, Green Bay turned it over on downs on the 13-yard line. They responded on the next drive by scoring their lone touchdown of the day, giving them a 13-13 tied score, before the Panthers drove 40 yards to kick the game-winning field goal as time expired.

Green Bay Packers @ Chicago Bears

The only true turnover of this game was Josh Jacobs’ fumble near the goal line. With that being said, the Packers were particularly bad in the red zone in this game, as they went into the red zone five times but never came away with a touchdown.

Green Bay turned the ball over on downs on the first drive of the game and the lone drive in overtime. They also allowed the clock to expire in both the first and second halves of the game.

Baltimore Ravens @ Green Bay Packers

Despite Malik Willis playing well as Jordan Love’s replacement starter, Green Bay just wasn’t able to stop the Baltimore rushing offense. Even though the team scored 24 points, which usually is enough to be at least competitive in most NFL games, the Ravens dropped 41 on the Packers.

Green Bay turned the ball over on downs twice, once in garbage time when Clayton Tune was already under center, fumbled once when the snap from Sean Rhyan came too early while Willis was attempting to audible, Tune threw an interception and the Packers also ran out the clock to end the first half. But no punts!

The defeat marked the end of an era for the Bills, who had dominated the AFC for years.

Dec. 28, 1996 - Jaguars 30, Bills 27

One of my most indelible moments that occurred at One Bills Drive actually did not take place inside the stadium, but over at the adjacent fieldhouse where 36-year-old Jim Kelly announced his retirement on Jan. 31, 1997.

It was a massive event with hundreds of people in attendance, all of the Buffalo TV stations as well as ESPN interrupting their morning programming and broadcasting live, just as they’d done back in August 1986 when Kelly first arrived in Buffalo.

There were plenty of teary eyes that day as the best quarterback to ever play for the Bills -- at least before Josh Allen came along -- bid farewell.

""To leave and not be a part of this football team is something that will be very difficult to swallow, but I also know in my stomach and in my heart, it's time for Jim Kelly to move on,"" Kelly said, pausing occasionally as the weight of the words overcame him.

And one of the deciding factors for Kelly had happened a little more than a month earlier when the Bills were upset by the two-year-old Jacksonville Jaguars in an AFC wild-card game, a 30-27 defeat that was the first postseason loss in the history of the stadium.

That day the upstart Jaguars -- coached by Waterloo native Tom Coughlin -- stunned NFL nation as Natrone Means ran for 175 yards and a touchdown, Mark Brunell threw for 239 yards and a TD, and the Jacksonville defense knocked Kelly out of the game with a concussion midway through the fourth quarter.

On that play, with the score tied at 27 and the Bills at midfield, Kelly got drilled by safety Chris Hudson and lost a fumble that Hudson also recovered at the Jaguars 42. Eight plays later, with 3:07 left to play, Mike Hollis kicked a 45-yard go-ahead field goal. With Todd Collins forced into action as Kelly was being carted into the locker room, the Bills were done.

I’ll never forget the silence that enveloped the stadium that day as more than 70,000 fans could not believe that a Jaguars team that had just entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1995 had beaten Buffalo.

But in reality you could see it coming as the Bills were a team that had started to age and had finished 10-6 and in second place in the AFC East. And Kelly, ravaged for so many years by injuries, was clearly in decline as his 73.2 passer rating was the lowest of his career; he threw just 14 touchdowns compared to 19 interceptions.

Center Kent Hull, who announced his retirement almost immediately after the game, put it into perfect perspective as he always did when he said of the young and hungry Jaguars, “They seemed like the team that we used to be. They were an opportunistic team that made plays when they had to have them and that’s the reason they won.”

In that locker room, you could sense the Bills knew their glory years -- six AFC East titles, four AFC championships between 1988-95 -- were behind them. Thurman Thomas sat at his locker silent and dazed for about 10 minutes after the media was allowed in.

Linebacker David White said, “It’s a shock.”

Yeah, it was.

Everything seemed fine early as the Bills opened a 14-7 lead on a pair of Thomas TDs, one on a pass from Kelly, the other a short run. But the Jaguars were even at 17 by halftime, and still even at 20 late in the third quarter when the play that felt like it would finally turn the game in Buffalo’s favor happened.

White tipped a Brunell pass that Jeff Burris intercepted on the second play of the fourth quarter and returned 38 yards for a touchdown.

Said Hull: “The trait of this team in the past is that when we had to make a play, someone always found a way to make one. I thought that play was the interception for the touchdown.”

Instead, Jacksonville put together a 65-yard drive that was extended by a Means fourth-down run and was capped by Brunell’s tying two-yard TD pass to Jimmy Smith.

Barely a minute later, Kelly was down on the field, the Jaguars were celebrating a fumble recovery and you knew it was slipping away from the Bills.

With an expiring contract, Kelly’s future in Buffalo with the franchise he essentially saved and drove to unprecedented heights was already in doubt, but the concussion seemed to bring clarity to both him and the organization. This was certainly not the way a future Hall of Famer’s career should have ended, but sometimes you can’t go out on your own terms.

Eleven years, 35,467 passing yards, 237 touchdown passes, eight playoff seasons, four Super Bowls and countless thrills along the way, it was quite a ride for Kelly.

""This is going to be one tough act to follow,"" Marv Levy said. Sure was as it took Buffalo more than 20 years to find Kelly’s rightful successor in Allen.

Myles Garrett resumes his quest to break the NFL’s single-season sacks record Sunday when the Cleveland Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Garrett has 22 sacks on the season and stands a half-sack short of the record shared by Michael Strahan and the Steelers’ T.J. Watt, who won’t play Sunday due to injury.

With a half-sack last week versus Buffalo, Garrett became just the sixth player to reach 22 in a season. On Sunday, Garrett will try to break the record while recording his first career sack against a player with whom he’ll almost certainly one day share space in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

“(Rodgers) is legendary himself, and it’s a legendary record I’m here chasing,” Garrett said. “That’d be a great one to put a picture on the wall with.”

Garrett has not sacked Rodgers in two previous games, one earlier this season and one in 2021 when Rodgers was with Green Bay. But Garrett has recorded at least a half-sack in every game after the first Cleveland-Pittsburgh meeting, in Week 6. Sunday brings Garrett a chance to break the single-season record in his home stadium.

Earlier this season, Garrett passed Lawrence Taylor to become the first player with at least 12 sacks in six consecutive seasons. With 124 1/2 sacks in 132 games, Garrett holds the NFL record for most sacks recorded before a player’s 30th birthday. Reggie White was the record-holder at 108. Only White (137) had more sacks in his first nine seasons.

“That is something that I had in my mind coming into the league, being talked about among those greats,” Garrett said. “So, I just want to continue to just put myself into that conversation.”

Garrett, who turns 30 on Monday, has totaled five sacks in the Steelers’ last two visits to Cleveland, both Browns victories.

“We understand the gravity of what we’re going into and how they engineer victory and who’s significant in doing so,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said last week. “(Garrett) is at the doorstep of history, and so we certainly have respect for that.”

Garrett is a four-time first-team All-Pro and was the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, but he’s never won a sack title. With two games remaining, he’s seven sacks clear of the nearest pursuer, the New York Giants’ Brian Burns (15).

This season, Hollins has played 68% of the Patriots' offensive snaps, which is more than any receiver.

Hollins hadn't practiced all week after landing on the injury report because of his abdomen. Hollins, 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, was coming off a seven-catch, 69-yard performance in last Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens that clinched a playoff berth for New England (12-3). He presumably was injured in the game at some point, although he didn't leave the game early and played 49 of a possible 74 snaps.

This season, Hollins has played 68% of the Patriots' offensive snaps, which is more than any receiver. His size and catch radius (especially on deep crossing routes) have helped quarterback Drake Maye complete a league-leading 70.9% of his passes (minimum 150 attempts). The Patriots also relied on Hollins to bring a physical edge in the running game.

On Friday, coach Mike Vrabel lauded the 32-year-old Hollins, who has generated headlines for his preference to arrive to games barefoot, for his team-first approach.

""He has an energy to him,"" Vrabel said. ""And seeing him on Sunday night with the passion he had to help us win; we'll obviously miss him. I've always appreciated his willingness to learn what we're doing but also be a leader for some of the younger guys.""

The Patriots don't have another receiver on their roster with Hollins' physical makeup. Veteran receiver Stefon Diggs leads the team with 76 catches for 869 yards. Third-year players Kayshon Boutte (inactive Sunday because of a concussion) and DeMario Douglas and rookies Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III round out the receiver depth chart.

Hollins must miss at least four games, which means he wouldn't be eligible to play until deep in the postseason, if at all. The Patriots visit the New York Jets on Sunday, then finish the regular season at home against the Miami Dolphins.

If the Patriots win their final two games, and the Denver Broncos lose their season finale at home against the Los Angeles Chargers, New England would earn the AFC's No. 1 seed.

The Patriots signed defensive tackle Jeremiah Pharms Jr. from the practice squad to the 53-man roster to fill Hollins' place on the roster. They also elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and cornerback Kobee Minor from the practice squad for Sunday's game.

In a related note, rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson has been cleared from the concussion protocol, the Patriots announced.

Booker flew into the backfield and drilled Love directly in the helmet as he brought him down for a sack in the second quarter of that contest at Soldier Field. He was immediately penalized for the hit.

Love remained down after the hit and eventually walked off into the blue medical tent. He didn't return, and was replaced by Malik Willis. Love is still in concussion protocol and has been ruled out of Saturday night’s game against the Baltimore Ravens.

Willis went 9-of-11 for 121 yards with a touchdown in Love’s absence against the Bears, though Chicago rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to grab the win in overtime. That extended the Bears' lead in the NFC North. They’ll win the division if the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night, which will secure the team’s first division title since 2018.

The Raiders are placing Crosby on injured reserve to begin the process of getting him healthy for 2026.

Crosby was shut down during a week in which the Raiders already placed Pro Bowl tight end Brock Bowers on injured reserve -- and the same week Las Vegas plays the New York Giants in a game that could decide who gets the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.

Some around the league speculated that competitive balance could be the impetus for these decisions, but the Raiders have stated that the moves are rooted solely in medical purposes.

""We have made the decision to place Maxx Crosby on the Reserve/Injured list for the remainder of the 2025 season,"" the team said in a statement Saturday. ""After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season. We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field -- we look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.""

Crosby initially injured his left knee Oct. 19 at Kansas City and has rarely participated in a full week of practice since. On Tuesday, Crosby underwent an additional MRI that revealed the injury had persisted and could present long-term concerns should it not be addressed.

The Raiders shared those concerns with Crosby on Tuesday, along with the belief that the potential long-term risk was not prudent.

""Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play, and he's been able to,"" Raiders coach Pete Carroll said Friday. ""But after an evaluation we did Monday or Tuesday, whenever it was, it just looks too bad.""

Crosby wanted to finish out the season because it is what makes him the high-energy, high-performance player that he is. When the Raiders overruled him, Crosby went home Friday, disappointed and upset, but Carroll told reporters that he and Crosby had spoken ""four times"" that day.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

This marks the second straight year that Crosby did not finish the season -- last year he suffered a high ankle sprain that required surgery -- and Crosby does not like missing time.

But the Raiders did for Crosby, their best defensive player, what they did for Bowers, their best offensive player, who didn't need surgery on his bruised knee. Bowers has been playing with a PCL injury and bone bruise in his left knee since Week 1.

There are no plans for the Raiders to shut down any other players; the rest are healthy enough to play and are expected to do so Sunday against the Giants. Quarterback Geno Smith, running back Ashton Jeanty and wide receiver Tre Tucker will play Sunday, according to sources, as the Raiders play in a game that -- even if they don't want to admit it -- would be winning for losing.

The loser of the Giants-Raiders game will have the inside track on the No. 1 pick in next year's draft. The winner will be thrust into the mix of a group of teams with three wins and could fall out of the top five picks.

When Crosby was asked earlier in the week about the Raiders potentially securing the top pick in the draft, he said, ""I don't give a s--- about the pick. I don't play for that.

""My job is to be the best defensive end in the world, and that's what I focus on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence,"" Crosby said. ""That's [the front office's] job. But that's got nothing to do with me.""

The Raiders felt it was most important to protect their two greatest contributors, Crosby and Bowers, leading them to make the decisions they did.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0414%2Fr1478704_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 06:57:39.265314
