This column is coming out on December 6th and mostly being read on the 7th, and my brain immediately goes to “6-7.” Blame the little boy who sat behind me in church recently. The priest said, “Open to hymn 678,” and before anyone could open a hymnbook, this very well-behaved boy blurted out, “Six … seven …”

His dad shot him a look and muttered, “Jesus Christ.”

In church!

It’s not the kid’s fault. The trend is everywhere, and apparently it’s immortal, harder to avoid than a Jerry Jones radio interview.

Another trend I truly cannot figure out?

Drake “Drake Maye” Maye. That’s the New England Patriots quarterback’s nickname, to the confusion of almost anyone who’s not obsessively online, including Maye’s teammate, Kayshon Boutte.

But if you’re worried this is just about the stage of life I’m in, I do remember the 21st night of September.

That was the last time the Patriots lost a football game. It came against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and everything for New England (and Pittsburgh!) has looked different since. Who saw that coming?

And here’s something else I do know: Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson were the names every owner wanted last offseason. Now? Those two have their new teams leading their conferences, and one of them will probably win NFL Coach of the Year. (I have a vote. I’m undecided. Still plenty of time.)

The Patriots are on their bye, but Bears-Packers? This is the biggest game those two franchises have played since the end of the 2013 regular season. The NFL’s oldest rivalry is back and actually meaningful.

And that’s just one of three games this week featuring two teams with at least eight wins. My football family, Week 14 is a monster.

Here’s what I’m hearing about:

Lost Vegas

From dorm room to division race

Coaching contenders

Postgame speeches

Slay’s situation

Kyler’s future, Herbert’s status and record watch

A reset on the reset

This was supposed to be the Tom Brady turnaround in Las Vegas: the greatest quarterback of all time stepping in and shaping an aimless organization, with a blueprint straight from the mountaintop of champions.

“I really don’t know what the plan is. I don’t think anyone knows,” one Raider said this week when asked if he felt good about the future of the team. At 2-10, the Raiders sit at the bottom of their division again.

So much was said about what Brady would actually be doing as a minority owner, and I can tell you that teams around the league were watching nervously, worried the Raiders might get the full benefit of the “Brady Way.” The first sign of that new order? The arrival of Alex Guerrero. Yes, that Alex Guerrero — Brady’s longtime trainer and business partner. Guerrero, the Raiders’ wellness coordinator, isn’t just a confidant; he’s the minority owner’s eyes and ears in the building when Brady is working for Fox or back in Florida with his kids.

Brady hasn’t been in the facility more than a handful of times this season, but he is involved every day, communicating with Guerrero, owner Mark Davis, GM John Spytek, coaches and players.

Inside the building, people believed Brady would lure the hottest coaching candidates on the market, like Johnson or Vrabel — names every owner coveted last offseason. They landed instead on 74-year-old Pete Carroll, who brought along his sons Nate and Brennan, both offensive assistants.

Players thought Brady would deliver Matthew Stafford after a long ski-slope conversation last offseason.

He missed.

Then Brady shot down Sam Darnold as an option.

Another miss.

Brady pushed for offensive coordinator Chip Kelly to inject pace and creativity into the team’s play calling. They made him the highest-paid offensive coordinator in football. He’s no longer with the team. The rookie class isn’t carrying its weight. Nothing has landed the way it was sold.

So what exactly are the Raiders building?

That’s the question bouncing around the facility and being whispered across the league. And the people who’ve lived it aren’t sugarcoating a thing. Former Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce, who felt the churn from the inside, unloaded on national TV with a level of honesty you almost never hear from a former coach:

“They might need decades to fix this bad boy. I’m just saying,” Pierce said. “One and done, one and done, one and done … is there another coach gone? Another coordinator? Listen, there’s gonna be something I talk about a little later where everybody’s pointing fingers. But at some point, point there and the thumb points back.”

One current Raiders staffer texted me: “It’s hard to argue with him.”

And the numbers don’t lie. Since Mark Davis took over in 2011, the Raiders have cycled through seven full-time head coaches, tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars for the most in the NFL. They are one of four teams since then without a playoff win, and they have the league’s worst point differential over that stretch.

Many around the league — and even some inside the building — are wondering if Carroll will survive this season. If the Raiders do move on from him, this isn’t a reset. It’s a reset on the reset. Tom Brady, the player, needed a little time to learn the job. Tom Brady, the owner, may require the same grace.

The Duke guys keeping Daniel Jones protected

When Daniel Jones started taking first-team reps as a sophomore at Duke, his teammates gave him a nickname.

“The Future.” (Much better than Danny Dimes, right?)

With Jones now playing professionally for Indianapolis, where he’s steadied the franchise, that nickname is starting to feel familiar. And here he is, trying to play through a fractured fibula for the third straight week, this time against the Jaguars, who are tied with the Colts atop the AFC South.

To do it, Jones will again be wearing a custom hybrid thigh pad/shin guard on his left leg. And those Duke teammates who once christened him “The Future?”

They’re the ones who built it.

About three weeks ago, when the Colts discovered the crack in Jones’ leg, athletic trainer Stephen Galvan called Kevin Gehsmann, CEO of Protect3D, the North Carolina startup that builds custom 3D-printed braces and orthotics. Gehsmann also happens to be Jones’ former Duke teammate and senior-year roommate.

Jones hopped on FaceTime with his old friend from the Indianapolis training room while the Colts used an app to scan his leg. The image traveled from Indy to Durham, where Protect3D printed the brace in under 48 hours.

Since it was a late-week order, delivery required a hand-delivered drop-off in Kansas City the night before the Colts’ Week 12 matchup against the Chiefs. Jones made sure his old roommate got tickets to the game.

“Before the game, I had breakfast with his parents and brother and then sat with his brother, who was there with a couple of Duke basketball guys. We had a good time,” Gehsmann told me over the phone Friday morning while headed to work.

Jones’ injury isn’t so much about severe pain, but rather about the stability of the quarterback’s leg, meaning that in a sport that emphasizes “get-off” speed, it’s been harder for him to fully push off. Jones, whose well-earned reputation for toughness was known even during his New York Giants days, loves the feel of his new leg pad. And the Colts need this to be successful; they’ve lost three of four games and are drifting down in the standings.

Gehsmann, a former linebacker, and fellow Blue Devils football alum Clark Bulleit, both engineering majors, first helped Jones with their tech when he was dealing with a collarbone injury in 2018.

Since then, the company has grown from a garage-and-engineering-lab experiment to an operation that outfits athletes across the NBA, MLS and even WWE, with most employees being former college athletes with engineering or medical degrees.

“This was a full-circle moment to help Daniel again, and we went out of our way to do everything we could,” said Gehsmann, who has continued to check in with Jones to make sure the pad is working out.

And yes, for the record: Jones was a relatively clean roommate … by college football standards, anyway.

Prove-it time for coaching candidates

Expect these assistant coaches to garner serious looks in the upcoming coaching cycle: Chiefs OC Matt Nagy, 49ers DC Robert Saleh, Colts DC Lou Anarumo, Broncos DC Vance Joseph, Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver, Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak, Rams DC Chris Shula, Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury, Packers DC Jeff Hafley, Bills OC Joe Brady and Jags DC Anthony Campanile.

Since 2011, at least five head-coaching vacancies have popped up each cycle. Right now? Only two teams have openings: the Giants and Titans. That number will go up. There are no guarantees these jobs will come open, but many around the league are asking questions about the Atlanta Falcons, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals and Cincinnati Bengals, in addition to the Raiders.

Coaches have about a month left, maybe through the playoffs, to prove they can handle the big seat.

Bonus coach coverage

Those candidates interviewing for head coaching jobs should have to audition with their postgame locker room speeches. I touched on team sayings and slogans in my last column, but it got me thinking: How much are coaches actually thinking about these speeches, the ones plastered all over the internet after every win? New York Jets coach Aaron Glenn? Really good. “Who wants to fly with the f—– Jets.” Dan Campbell? I’ll run through a wall for ya’ from my kitchen!

But the undisputed champion of locker room celebrations? Ben Johnson, with or without his shirt.

One head coach told me he even finds himself thinking about his potential postgame messaging on the drive to the game. “Honestly, I never really thought this much about it, but now with all the cameras, it’s no longer a private moment with my team. It’s for the world, and I feel like it’s getting competitive!”

A sloppy situation in Buffalo

What’s Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane going to do? His team claimed cornerback Darius Slay after he was waived by the Steelers, but the veteran then said he would not report to Buffalo as he considered retirement.

The Bills retain Slay’s playing rights after he was placed on the reserve/retired list. As of now, his future remains uncertain.

In late February, while still under contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, Slay appeared on the “St. Brown Podcast” and said that he wanted to play one more year and that “the two spots I would love to always be at is Philly or Detroit.”

Less than a month later, Philadelphia released him and Pittsburgh quickly signed him. For now, I’m told that Slay will remain on the sidelines. With the Bills facing the Eagles in Week 17, it will be interesting to see what Buffalo decides to do. Slay is repped by superagent Drew Rosenhaus, so Buffalo may want to play nice.

Before you go

• It wouldn’t surprise a lot of league executives if the Cardinals decide to move on from 28-year-old Kyler Murray after this season. His contract complicates things because he’s still owed $36.8 million in fully guaranteed salary and bonuses for 2026. But even before his current foot injury, things weren’t clicking. The Cardinals could try to trade him or simply release him. Either way, after coach Jonathan Gannon said Murray is done for the season, the sense is change is coming in the desert.

• The Eagles are trying to shake off that ugly Black Friday loss to the Bears. I’m told this week, the team had a series of “no-BS discussions” ahead of a “Monday Night Football” meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers. The message? Stop pointing fingers. “We are all done with the finger-pointing,” one Philly player told me. “It’s not just one thing that’s in our way. It’s not just Jalen (Hurts), it’s not just Saquon (Barkley), it’s not just (OC Kevin) Patullo, it’s not just the offensive line. … It’s a little bit of everyone.”

• Speaking of the Chargers, I’m told QB Justin Herbert is trying to play despite undergoing surgery to repair a fractured left hand on Monday. Given his track record of playing through injuries, it would not be surprising. Players I spoke to on the Chargers are expecting him to go.

• A battered Chiefs offensive line already without rookie left tackle Josh Simmons (who was placed on IR earlier this week) is expected to also be missing RG Trey Smith (ankle) and RT Jawaan Taylor (triceps, knee) when they face the Houston Texans on Sunday.

• The Denver Broncos are the first team since the 1986 Giants to win four straight games by 3 points or less. I’m sure Sean Payton sent that stat to Bill Parcells, the coach of the Super Bowl XXI champions and Payton’s mentor. Those Giants finished that season 14-2 and beat, you guessed it … Denver in the Super Bowl.

• Cleveland’s Myles Garrett is 3.5 sacks shy of the single-season record, jointly held by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021). His next opponent? Titans rookie Cam Ward, who has taken more sacks than any other quarterback in the league (48). Keep in mind, Garrett already has two games this season in which he registered four-plus sacks.

• Finally, you might recall NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth raising some eyebrows with his distinctive pronunciation of Washington’s backup quarterback’s name last week. Turns out, he had it right.

“Mar-ee-o-ta,” Marcus Mariota told reporters this week, with a well-enunciated T. “I think it’s been said over the years like Mary-ota, which is incorrect. It’s pronounced Mar-ee-o-ta.”

But don’t feel bad if you’ve been saying it wrong. I got a text message this week from a loyal reader who happily told me he listens to WFAN, where hosts say they won’t believe NFL rumors “until I hear it from Diana Russini.”

Like many of you, this reader spelled my first name incorrectly. Unlike many of you, this reader was my father. Thanks for reading, Dad, and as always, thanks for spelling my name this way because you wanted me to be different.

Questionable: S Marcus Epps (shoulder), OT Myles Hinton (back)

The Chargers, meanwhile, have listed starting quarterback Justin Herbert (non-throwing hand) as questionable. Herbert had surgery on that left hand earlier in the week. While reports out of LA suggest Herbert will play, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said they have been preparing for either quarterback. The Chargers’ backup is Trey Lance.

NFL

Both Epps and Hinton (listed as questionable) are still on IR but have been practicing after having their practice windows opened. It’s expected that Epps will be activated and all signs are pointing toward him starting against the Chargers.

The three players who were limited on Thursday — Jaelan Phillips (concussion), Zack Baun (hand) and Jahan Dotson (toe) — were all full participants on Friday and are good to go. Phillips has cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Landon Dickerson returned to practice on Saturday as a full participant after getting a rest day on Friday. Dickerson, 27, has battled through several different injuries this season and has started 11 of 12 games.

“I think he's done a really nice job,” Sirianni said on Saturday. “Landon's so powerful of being able to move people off the spot. He’s so critical for our offense to be able to help identify defenses and different things like that. And so I think he's had a lot of good moments in the season and has played good football. Obviously as an entire offense, we want us all to be more consistent as coaches and players, so there's going to be plays everybody wants back, but Landon's done a nice job.”

Defensive end Tyquan Lewis has been downgraded to out. Kicker Blake Grupe and defensive tackle Chris Wormley have been elevated from the practice squad.

Carlies suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him in late-summer following the Colts' preseason opener against Baltimore, holding back a player who was expected to take over a starting role after the team let E.J. Speed leave in free agency. Carlies was placed on IR in late-August and initially wasn't expected to miss much more than the requisite four weeks, but the organization only opened his 21-day practice window on Nov. 19 ahead of the team's Week 12 clash with the Chiefs.

The team was required to activate Carlies by this weekend's game, or he would be sidelined for the rest of the season. He was a full participant in all nine practices or walk-throughs he's participated in since his 21-day window opened up.

In the wake of his injury, the Colts signed veteran linebacker Germaine Pratt in October following Pratt's release from the Raiders and Indianapolis cycling through a slew of replacement options at the weakside linebacker position. It's not immediately clear what role -- or how much of one -- Carlies will play in his return.

The injury-plagued fifth-round pick out of Missouri missed seven games as a rookie with a broken fibula before undergoing shoulder surgery in the offseason, forcing him to miss the entire spring installation of new defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo's scheme.

The former safety has shown a particular strength in coverage when he's been on the field, following a college career as a safety before transitioning to linebacker as an NFL rookie a year ago. Carlies made 36 tackles and a sack in 242 defensive snaps a year ago.

Other Colts players' injury statuses ahead of Jacksonville game

Colts rotational defensive end Tyquan Lewis is out for Sunday's game with an ankle injury that landed him on the injury report starting with Wednesday's walk-through. Lewis was estimated to have not participated Wednesday, was limited in Thursday's practice and then missed Friday's.

Cornerback Sauce Gardner, who suffered a calf injury early in Sunday's game against the Texans, is the only Indianapolis player already listed as 'out' for Sunday's road game in Jacksonville, though Gardner did avoid landing on IR, opening the possibility for him to return sometime in the next couple weeks.

Here’s the full Bears injury report for Sunday’s game at Lambeau Field:","LAKE FOREST, Ill. — Rome Odunze has been on Bears participation reports for weeks. He’d miss practices because of heel and ankle injuries, then not receive a designation on Chicago’s injury report, and play the following Sunday.

The pattern ended a few weeks back, without mention of an injury. That changed heading into Week 14. A foot injury prevented Odunze from practicing in each session leading up to Sunday’s clash with the NFC North rival Green Bay Packers.

That led the Bears to rule out their top receiver versus the Packers.

Odunze might be out longer than that. According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Odunze has been playing through a stress fracture in his foot and is now considered week-to-week, but it’s nothing that would end his season when the Bears need him most. He could miss a few games, though that’s ultimately uncertain.

Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson and linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II also were ruled out.

Linebacker T.J. Edwards (hand/hamstring) will return after practicing all week following a four-game absence.

The Bears will have Noah Sewell (elbow) back after two weeks out, though. That will offer linebacker stability that has been missing in recent weeks, even with fill-ins D’Marco Jackson and Amen Ogbongbemiga playing well. As a reminder, Tremaine Edmunds remains on injured reserve.

Running back Kyle Monangai was absent from the team’s first practice and was a DNP on a Wednesday practice estimation, but he was limited Thursday and a full participant Friday. The productive rookie wasn’t given a designation and will play.

Per the Athletic’s Dianna Russini, Justin Herbert is expected to play against the Eagles on Monday Night Football after the surgery on his non-throwing hand.

The veteran quarterback underwent successful surgery Monday to stabilize a fractured bone in his left non-throwing hand. The team currently lists him as day to day, but Herbert has made it clear he is preparing as if he will suit up.

The injury happened late in the first quarter of the Chargers’ recent win over the Las Vegas Raiders when a hit to the hand forced Herbert to leave briefly.

He returned with a protective cast and glove and finished the game while the offense shifted to more shotgun and pistol formations. That toughness drew praise from coaches even before the surgery.

Herbert suffered a metacarpal fracture in his left hand, serious enough to need surgical stabilization. If there was any hidden ligament damage or if his grip strength did not return fast enough, his ability to handle snaps or take contact could have become a major issue for Herbert.

In the 2025 season, Justin Herbert has thrown for 2,842 yards this season with 21 touchdowns, 10 interceptions, and a 66.9 percent completion rate, giving him a 94.9 passer rating. He is averaging roughly 237 passing yards per game as he continues to anchor the Chargers’ offense.

In short, Herbert’s push to play in Week 14 shows exactly why the Chargers still believe they have a shot to steady their season. If his hand holds up and his production stays on track, Los Angeles at least knows its franchise quarterback is willing to fight through anything to keep them competitive.

Ostly mocks Love at No. 8 as the first running back taken in the first round.

Love has been one of the best running backs in college football this season, rushing for 1,372 yards (4th in the nation) and 18 touchdowns (3rd), while catching 27 passes for 280 yards and three scores. Through 41 games in his college career, the junior running back has rushed for 2,882 yards and scored 42 total touchdowns.

While the Cardinals could go several different directions in the first round, including quarterback and offensive tackle, running back could be an option for Arizona as the running back room has been hit hard by injuries in 2025.

Veteran James Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3 against the San Francisco 49ers, while second-year halfback Trey Benson has been out since Week 4 due to a knee injury. Emari Demarcado has also missed the last two games due to an ankle issue.

Bam Knight has been the Cardinals leading halfback this season with 255 rushing yards and four touchdowns in 10 games played.

Ostly said Love could give the Cardinals a legitimate RB1 and a potential receiving threat out of the backfield if the team moves on from Conner. Conner has one year remaining on a two-year contract extension he signed toward the end of last season.

Love is the ideal modern running back and would be a seamless transition away from James Conner if the team wants to move on. Arizona went all-out on defense in the 2025 NFL Draft and would swing the other way with the home-run hitter and receiving threat Love.

As part of Ostly’s first round mock draft, he had Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson going to the New York Giants with the No. 2 pick.

The three Week 14 first-place showdowns are the Chicago Bears (9-3-1) at Green Bay Packers (8-3) in the NFC North, Indianapolis Colts (8-4) at Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4) in the AFC South and Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6) at Baltimore Ravens (6-6) in the AFC North.

How critical are these divisional games? Since 2002, of the 159 teams that were leading their division through Week 14, when the NFL went to eight divisions, 139 of them won their division. That's 87.4%.

It's also worth noting that all three of these games will have rematches in the coming weeks. The Packers and Bears have their second meeting within a three-game span in Week 16. The Jaguars and Colts play again in Week 17, and the Ravens face the Steelers in the regular-season finale.

PIT-BAL | IND-JAX | CHI-GB

AFC North: Steelers at Ravens (1 p.m. ET, CBS)

Pittsburgh Steelers

Overall record: 6-6

Division record: 2-1

AFC North position: Tied for first place with Ravens

Odds: Win division (+285), make playoffs (+260)

FPI with win: Win division (63%), make playoffs (64%)

FPI with loss: Win division (17%), make playoffs (17%)

How did the Steelers get here? Thanks to a hot start and injuries for the rest of the AFC North teams, the Steelers appeared to be running away with the division, holding a 2½-game lead going into the Thursday night game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7. But Ja'Marr Chase and Joe Flacco picked apart the Steelers' defense and handed Pittsburgh a loss, kicking off a stretch during which the Steelers have lost five of their past seven games. In that span, the Steelers' defense has allowed an average of 122.7 rushing yards per game, while the offense has struggled to move the ball consistently with Mason Rudolph or Aaron Rodgers at quarterback.

QB situation: Rodgers fractured his left (non-throwing) wrist late in the first half during the rematch with the Bengals three weeks ago and was sidelined for the subsequent six quarters. Rudolph took his place in the second half and started against the Chicago Bears. During that stretch, Rudolph completed 36 of 47 attempts for 298 yards with 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. Rodgers, meanwhile, started struggling even before his wrist injury, beginning with a dismal night in the loss to the Chargers on Nov. 9, when he completed 51% of his attempts and took a sack for a safety. Coming off another subpar outing against the Bills on Nov. 30, when he completed just 47% of his attempts and split the bridge of his nose on a strip-sack, Rodgers is in line to start his second straight game with the fractured wrist Sunday.

Injury update: Not only have the Steelers been managing Rodgers' wrist injury, but they also enter Sunday's game without rookie first-round pick Derrick Harmon. Harmon is missing his second consecutive game because of a knee injury sustained in Chicago. The Steelers' defense has dealt with injuries throughout the season, including a season-ending hyperextended knee to safety DeShon Elliott and ACL tears to veteran depth defensive linemen Dean Lowry and Daniel Ekuale.

Key to winning Sunday: It all comes down to stopping the run. The Steelers didn't do that in their wild-card loss to the Ravens last season, allowing Baltimore to rush for 299 yards as Derrick Henry exploded for 186. The Steelers' run defense has been inconsistent this season, giving up a season-worst 249 rushing yards to the Buffalo Bills in its last game. But there is some reason for hope: Earlier this season, the Steelers' run defense held Jonathan Taylor, the NFL's leading rusher, to 45 yards on 14 carries in the win against the Colts. -- Brooke Pryor

What they're saying: Cameron Heyward on the late-season grind and what the team has left in the tank: ""A lot left in the tank. You sign up to play football. You don't sign up to count heartbeats. We got to do whatever it takes to get the job done. You've seen teams, you look at that Super Bowl [the Steelers won at the end of the 2005 season, beating Seattle], they had to have a string of games late to really qualify for the playoffs. So, one, you got to get off the field when you can, but two, whatever comes in front of you, you got to go out and attack it.""

Baltimore Ravens

Overall record: 6-6

Division record: 2-1

AFC North position: Tied for first place with the Ravens

Odds: Win division (-240), make playoffs (-220)

FPI with win: Win division (75%), make playoffs (75%)

FPI with loss: Win division (31%), make playoffs (31%)

How did the Ravens get here? The preseason betting favorite to win the Super Bowl, the Ravens have yet to produce one complete game this season in which every unit was clicking. The Baltimore defense struggled mightily during a franchise-worst 1-5 start, giving up an NFL-high 32.3 points per game. When the Ravens rebounded to win five of their next six games, their offense sputtered repeatedly on third down (34.7%) and in the red zone (48%), both of which rank in the bottom quarter of the league. With game changers such as quarterback Lamar Jackson and do-it-all safety Kyle Hamilton, the Ravens' players said this week that they feel there is still time for this team to hit its stride and live up to its championship potential.

QB situation: Lamar Jackson hasn't looked like Lamar Jackson. After throwing 15 touchdown passes and one interception in his first six starts, Jackson has hit the worst slump of his career, producing zero touchdowns in three straight games. Injuries and indecision have led to the two-time NFL MVP putting up some uncharacteristic numbers. He hasn't completed more than 60% of his passes in four consecutive games for the first time in his eight-year career, and he's averaging a career-low 29.3 yards rushing per game. The Ravens need Jackson to flip into MVP mode if they want to win a third straight AFC North title.

Injury update: Jackson is dealing with an ankle injury after getting stepped on during Wednesday's practice, but he is set to start Sunday. This marked the fourth straight week that Jackson has missed a practice because of an injury. He has had injuries to his knee, ankle and toe over this span. The only other injury concern was top cornerback Nate Wiggins, who missed the second half of Baltimore's last game because of a foot injury. But Wiggins practiced all week and will play against Pittsburgh, according to coach John Harbaugh.

Key to winning Sunday: Ball security. Jackson and the Ravens can't afford to give away another division game, as they did in a 32-14 loss to the Bengals on Thanksgiving night, when they turned the ball over five times. That's a strong lesson going into Sunday's game against Pittsburgh because mistakes have defined Baltimore's success against its biggest rival. Since 2022, the Ravens are 3-1 against the Steelers, including the playoffs, when they turned the ball over no more than once. Over that same span, Baltimore is 0-3 against Pittsburgh when it has committed multiple turnovers. -- Jamison Hensley

What they're saying: ""If you can't get up for this one, I think that shows something about your character [and] about your will. And honestly, I think that just shows if you are a Raven or if you're not a Raven. They say that there's no must-win game, but this is definitely a must-win game,"" cornerback Marlon Humphrey said.

AFC South: Colts at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, CBS)

Indianapolis Colts

Overall record: 8-4

Division record: 2-1

AFC South position: Tied for first with Jaguars

Odds: Win division (+145), make playoffs (-310)

FPI with win: Win division (61%), make playoffs (88%)

FPI with loss: Win division (19%), make playoffs (57%)

How did the Colts get here? Indianapolis got off to a sizzling start, with a league-best 7-1 record through eight games. The Cots' offense was on a historic pace, leading the league in several categories. Even after consecutive subpar performances, the Colts remain the league's top-scoring team. Jonathan Taylor leads the NFL with 1,282 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns, though he has been quiet the past two games. Taylor's 244-yard performance against the Atlanta Falcons last month was the biggest single-game rushing effort this season. Likewise, his 83-yard touchdown in that game was the longest run of 2025.

QB situation: The Colts believe they've found a potential long-term solution in Daniel Jones after years of flailing at quarterback. Jones, who signed a one-year free agent deal in March, won an offseason position battle with Anthony Richardson Sr. for the job and helped power Indianapolis' historic offensive start to the season. But the Colts will need Jones to come through when it matters most. They have five games remaining, all against teams with winning records. Whether Jones comes through will set the tone for offseason decisions regarding his future.

Injury update: Jones will need to perform well in spite of a small fracture in his left fibula. The issue was discovered two weeks ago and, in the two games since, Jones has posted his lowest passing yards and completion rates of the season. He has consistently said the condition is improving. Meanwhile, the Colts are still without standout defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), who isn't eligible to return from injured reserve until next week. They're also likely to be without new cornerback Sauce Gardner, who sustained a calf injury Sunday and could miss multiple games.

Key to winning Sunday: The Colts have to regain the upper hand on offense by being more consistent on early downs and, thereby, keeping Taylor involved. Indianapolis was 3-of-10 on third downs in its loss to the Texans on Sunday, in part because of long down-and-distance situations. Of those 10 third downs, seven were third-and-7 or longer. Staying ""on schedule"" on offense with better production on first downs has been a key for the Colts all season. But they've dropped from 7.2 yards per play on first downs to 6 yards per play in the past two games. -- Stephen Holder

What they're saying: ""We're playing really good teams now. So, we've got to be more on point with some of those things than maybe we did earlier in the season. We've got a hard stretch coming up. We got a big game this weekend, so perfect time to get back on track,"" Josh Downs said.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Overall record: 8-4

Division record: 32-1

AFC South position: Tied for first with Colts

Odds: Win division (+145), make playoffs (-550)

FPI with win: Win division (64%), make playoffs (96%)

FPI with loss: Win division (19%), make playoffs (75%)

How did the Jaguars get here? They've won four of their past five games despite a slew of injuries that led to 10 starters missing games over that stretch: WR/CB Travis Hunter (knee, done for season), DE Travon Walker (knee), CB Jourdan Lewis (neck), S Eric Murray (neck), RG Patrick Mekari (concussion), LG Ezra Cleveland (knee), WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle), TE Brenton Strange (hip), DT Arik Armstead (hand), and LB Devin Lloyd (calf). Their depth has held up, though, and they won two OT games on the road by making plays late. The one constant has been RB Travis Etienne Jr. and the run game.

QB situation: Trevor Lawrence has been up and down all season, as evidenced by his past two games: Four turnovers against Arizona, followed by none and his highest passer rating (111.5) of the season against Tennessee. However, that's partly due to coach Liam Coen encouraging Lawrence to ""let it rip."" The addition of Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline has given Lawrence a sure-handed receiver and he has become the receiver Lawrence trusts the most in just four games (18 catches on 21 targets).

Injury update: Lewis (their top cornerback), Lloyd, Cleveland, Thomas and Strange are back, and Murray is likely to return Sunday. WR Parker Washington (hip) and LT Walker Little (concussion) were hurt last week and their availability is in doubt. Walker hasn't practiced since getting hurt Nov. 16, so he might not play, either. Armstead is a question, too. Those last two are some of the Jaguars' better pass rushers, but also critical players on the run defense tasked with limiting Taylor.

Key to winning Sunday: It starts with keeping Taylor in check. The Colts are 3-4 in games in which Taylor has rushed for fewer than 100 yards, including the past two (losses to Kansas City and Houston). Surprisingly, Taylor has not had much success in Jacksonville. In four games at EverBank Stadium, he has failed to rush for more than 77 yards, and the Colts -- who haven't won in Jacksonville since 2014 -- are 0-4 in those games. -- Michael DiRocco

What they're saying: ""We come back, we prepare the same way that we always have, especially this last couple of weeks, keep our focus internally, go out there and play our brand football, we'll win this game,"" defensive end Josh Hines-Allen said.

NFC North: Bears at Packers (4:25 p.m. ET, Fox)

Chicago Bears

Overall record: 9-3

Division record: 1-2

NFC North position: First

Odds: Win division (+175), make playoffs (-270)

FPI with win: Win division (59%), make playoffs (92%)

FPI with loss: Win division (20%), make playoffs (67%)

How did the Bears get here? The Bears have won five straight, including a defining 24-15 win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Black Friday that legitimized their résumé. Chicago is built on the NFL's No. 2 rushing offense (153.8 yards/game), an opportunistic defense that leads the league in takeaways (26) and turnover margin (plus-17, no other team is better than plus-9). Caleb Williams' growth under coach Ben Johnson was clear as Williams led five game-winning drives in the fourth quarter/overtime. It's a critical part of why the Bears have pulled off several late-game rallies to boast a 6-1 record in one-score games.

QB situation: Johnson clarified his comments about the Bears ""winning in spite of our passing game, not because of it,"" so it wouldn't be construed that he's unhappy with Williams' play. Johnson was pleased with how Williams managed the game against Philadelphia, but the quarterback's accuracy issues are concerning. Williams is last in completion percentage (58%) and completion percentage over expectation (-9%), and his five interceptions have come against zone coverage. The Packers' defense has run zone on 69% of opponents' dropbacks this season (third highest in NFL).

Injury update: The Bears' defense will get a much-needed boost at linebacker. T.J. Edwards was back at practice this week for the first time since breaking his hand against the Bengals on Nov. 2 and does not carry an injury designation for the Packers game. The Bears will also have linebacker Noah Sewell back in the fold, which will go a long way toward how the Bears can scheme against Josh Jacobs and the Packers' run game. Wide receiver Rome Odunze will miss the first game of his NFL career because of a foot injury that he's been dealing with throughout the season.

Key to winning Sunday: Chicago's run game has been at its best on the road, with season highs in rushing at Cincinnati and Philadelphia. After dual 100-yard rushing performances from Monangai and D'Andre Swift, the Bears should lean heavily on their ground attack to set the tone and control the clock the way they did against the Eagles. With injuries along Green Bay's defensive line, notably to tackle Devonte Wyatt, the Bears' offensive line comes to Lambeau Field with the edge up front. -- Courtney Cronin

What they're saying: ""The significance of it at the moment isn't much,"" tight end Cole Kmet said of the Bears currently being the NFC's No. 1 seed. ""Look, I know how this all is. We're on the so-called mountain top right now, but those things change quickly week to week. ... It's on us to stick to our process on stuff. But to see where we've gone as a team, specifically offensively from Weeks 1 and 2 to now, it's really cool to see and see our identity take shape, especially in the run game.""

Green Bay Packers

Overall record: 8-3-1

Division record: 3-0

NFC North position: Second

Odds: Win division (-140), make playoffs (-900)

FPI with win: Win division (70%), make playoffs (95%)

FPI with loss: Win division (25%), make playoffs (76%)

How did the Packers get here? Unlike last season, when they went 1-5 in NFC North games -- with the only win coming on a last-second blocked field goal attempt in Chicago -- the Packers have taken care of business in the division. The Thanksgiving win at Detroit gave them the season sweep of the Lions for the first time since 2020. This is the end of a three-game stretch of all division games, which started with the Week 12 win over the Vikings. After consecutive home losses to the Panthers and Eagles in which they combined to score only 20 points, Packers coach Matt LaFleur found something on offense. In the three games since those two losses, they have the fourth-most offensive points per game in the league.

QB situation: This is Jordan Love's time of the year, and his four-touchdown game against the Lions last week might be the start of another strong stretch to close the season. In his three seasons as the Packers' starter, Love has played some of his best football when the calendar turns to November. In 24 career regular-season games in November or later, Love has combined for 37 touchdowns and six interceptions while completing 65.8% of his passes. Love has the NFL's highest Total QBR (73.3) in games played in November or later over the past three seasons.

Injury update: The Packers have lost three starters to season-ending injuries: tight end Tucker Kraft (knee), center Elgton Jenkins (leg) and, most recently, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt (ankle). They could get a boost from the return of receiver Jayden Reed, their leader in the past two seasons in catches and receiving yards. Reed hasn't played since Week 2 because of collarbone and foot injuries.

Key to winning Sunday: The Packers have a top-10 run defense, but it will be tested mightily by the Bears' running back duo of Monangai and Swift, who each rushed for more than 100 yards in last week's win over the Eagles. Wyatt's injury against the Lions won't help, but the Packers will have to keep the Bears from running all over them. ""It's going to be a great challenge,"" LaFleur said, ""because they're the best in the league right now in doing it."" -- Rob Demovsky

What they're saying: Packers WR Christian Watson on the magnitude of the Packers-Bears game: ""It's huge, it's huge. I said it earlier in the week, it's a chance for us to take the top spot in the NFC North, and that's step one for us in terms of our goal for this season. So it's big-time for us.""

After dislocating his elbow in Week 9, Daniels finally seems to be in the clear for the Commanders. He was a full practice participant on Thursday for the first time since his injury, and has officially been cleared for contact.

Rome Odunze, WR, Chicago Bears - Out

The Bears haven't been known for their passing offense this season, but wideout Rome Odunze has been the top target when the Bears have to move the ball through the air, hauling in 44 catches for 661 yards and six touchdowns. He has been dealing with heel pain, but has yet to miss a game. That will change this week against Green Bay, as Odunze missed practice all week with a foot injury and will not be available for the Bears-Packers clash.

Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers - Expected To Play

Herbert underwent surgery just earlier this week for a fractured left hand, but is reportedly still preparing to play against the Eagles on Monday Night Football. Herbert was limited in practice both Thursday and Friday, but Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh is expecting Herbert to suit up per usual. Herbert disclosed on Thursday that doctors inserted a plate and screws into his hand to stabilize it, and that he will likely be in a hard cast during Monday's game.

Mike Evans, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers - Out

Since breaking his clavicle on October 22, Evans has been out of action. This week, he was designated to return from injured reserve, and his 21-day practice window opened, but head coach Todd Bowles made it clear he will not return this weekend. Evans' absence could bring his 11-season streak of 1,000-or-more receiving yards to an end.

Tee Higgins, WR, Cincinnati Bengals - Expected To Play

After missing the Bengals' last game with a concussion, Higgins was a full participant in practice on Thursday and has officially been cleared of concussion protocol entering Week 14

Sauce Gardner, CB, Indianapolis Colts - Out

After Gardner was seen on crutches and donning a walking boot following last week's loss to the Texans, the good news for fans of the Colts is that his injury isn't quite as severe as initially expected. The bad news, however, is that he will be unavailable against the Jaguars this week.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tc9l1zwAa2cSaUQvsi121g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/touchdown_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_829/abadca8f2491bbe1663fe7072c3057ac,N,,2025-12-06 18:01:10.143539

“J-Reed should be good to go, which is exciting, and Julian is planning on playing,” Macdonald said. “We’re gonna play it accordingly. We have a plan and we’ll see how the game goes. But excited to have those guys back.”

Huard: This is the best defensive front in Seahawks history

Neither Love (hamstring) nor Reed (wrist, thumb) were given a game status designation on Friday’s injury report. Both players are still on injured reserve, but the Seahawks have two open 53-man roster spots to activate them off IR ahead of Sunday’s game.

Love has missed nine of Seattle’s 12 games with a hamstring injury, including each of the past eight games. Reed has missed the past four games after undergoing surgery to repair a wrist/thumb injury. Both players returned to practice this week.

With Love set to return, the Seahawks are on track to have their entire starting secondary on the field together for the first time since the opening defensive series of Week 1.

In addition to Love, two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Devon Witherspoon missed five games due to injury earlier this season, rookie safety Nick Emmanwori missed three games, and cornerbacks Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe each missed one game apiece. Safety Coby Bryant is the only starter in Seattle’s secondary to play all 12 games.

The only two Seahawks with game status designations on Friday’s injury report were wide receiver/kick returner Dareke Young (quadricep) and rookie defensive end Rylie Mills (knee). Young is on IR, while Mills has spent all season on the non-football injury list while rehabbing from a torn ACL that he suffered last December.

That means every other player who appeared on Seattle’s injury report this week is considered healthy enough to play on Sunday. That includes running back Kenneth Walker III (glute), right guard Anthony Bradford (elbow, calf), tight end AJ Barner (knee, shoulder), wide receiver Cody White (abdomen) and safety Ty Okada (oblique).

As is the case every week in pro football, the injury report provided good news and bad news.
Here's a closer look at the injury report for the Packers entering Week 14: Good news -- Linebacker Quay Walker has no status designation and will return to the field after missing back-to-back games with a stinger.
During each of the last two weeks, the Packers ruled out Reed on the final injury report.
Packers Week 14 injury report","The Green Bay Packers released their final injury report of Week 14 on Friday afternoon. Matt LaFleur's team ruled out five players and listed five others as questionable before playing the Chicago Bears on Sunday at Lambeau Field.

As is the case every week in pro football, the injury report provided good news and bad news.

Here's a closer look at the injury report for the Packers entering Week 14:

Good news

-- Linebacker Quay Walker has no status designation and will return to the field after missing back-to-back games with a stinger. Isaiah McDuffie played exceedingly well as the ""Mike"" linebacker in wins over the Vikings and Lions, but the Packers will need Walker's speed and toughness against quarterback Caleb Williams and the Bears run game on Sunday.

-- Receiver Jayden Reed was listed as questionable, which keeps the door open to him being activated Saturday and then becoming available on Sunday for the first time since Week 2. During each of the last two weeks, the Packers ruled out Reed on the final injury report. This time around, Reed has a chance. Matt LaFleur said he ""hopes"" Reed can play Sunday, but the Packers slot receiver still needs to get medical clearance to go.

-- The Packers are getting back Karl Brooks, who has no status designation after missing last week's win with an ankle injury. Expect Brooks to be the new starter at defensive tackle with Devonte Wyatt out for the season. Brooks was first injured in New York and then played only four snaps against the Vikings before missing last week in Detroit. While he'll likely be less than 100 percent on Sunday, the Packers need him to stand tall against a very good interior offensive line for the Bears.

-- Running back Josh Jacobs was upgraded to a full participant at practice on Friday, suggesting the knee injury he suffered in New York three weeks ago is no longer a major concern. Jacobs played 34 snaps last week against the Lions, but that number could rise on Sunday.

-- Defensive end Brenton Cox Jr. was listed as questionable, so he's nearing a return after having his 21-day practice window opened on Monday. He could provide a spark for the backup edge rusher rotation, especially with Lukas Van Ness out. Last season, Cox had 4.0 sacks and seven quarterback hits in only seven games. He hasn't been available since Week 1.

Bad news

-- Javon Bullard's status is ""up in the air,"" per Matt LaFleur. He missed back-to-back practices on Thursday and Friday due to the lingering effects of an ankle injury he previously suffered. Bullard has been excellent in the Packers' zone coverage scheme and is an impact slot defender against the run. Nate Hobbs is a potential replacement in the slot, but he hasn't played since Week 9. If both are out, the Packers will have to get really creative in nickel personnel.

-- Lukas Van Ness will miss his seventh game in eight weeks with a foot injury. He's played all of six snaps since suffering the injury on a sack of Joe Flacco in Week 6. The 2023 first-round pick is missing important snaps, and his breakout season was stopped in its tracks. Can Van Ness eventually return and help supercharge the pass rush at some point over the final four weeks? Losing Devonte Wyatt and not having Van Ness available in the same week is a tough blow to the defensive front.

-- Rookie receiver and returner Savion Williams is out for a second straight game. He's ""battling through"" a foot injury that has lingered for over a month. The Packers are hoping the time off will let the injury heal, and he can contribute later this season. Bo Melton will likely be the kick returner on Sunday.

-- There are still question marks at receiver. Jayden Reed (collarbone/foot) and Matthew Golden (wrist) are both questionable, and Savion Williams is out again. Saturday is going to be an important day for understanding who will be available come Sunday. If the Packers don't activate Reed from injured reserve, he'll be out again. And if Golden can't go, the Packers will likely have to elevate a wide receiver from the practice squad. If both are good to go, the Packers passing game could get a huge boost before a matchup against an increasingly stingy Bears secondary that recently returned Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon.

McAvoy has missed the last nine games since the injury and remains without a timeline for return to action but spent Friday’s practice at Warrior Ice Arena discussing the horrifying events of three weeks ago.

“I knew we were in trouble there,” McAvoy said of the incident. “I’d never taken one before, but you don’t take a slap shot to the jaw — I knew right away I was in some trouble.

The team’s alternate captain has been skating while wearing a red, non-contact sweater and detailed his stunning 20-pound weight loss amid a liquid-only diet. McAvoy said the drop in weight came in the first week and a half after the injury.

“It’s tough. I tried to give it a go. If you’re blending up solid food — it’s not enjoyable. … I tried chicken and vegetables and, like, that was just a non-starter,” McAvoy said. “I tried. It’s terrible. So soups have really been my go-to and smoothies to try and get protein, because food that’s blended up? It’s not meant to be eaten that way.”

According to a report by Boston.com sports writer Conor Ryan, McAvoy won’t be cleared to eat solid foods until he’s six weeks removed from the injury.

The 2016 first-round pick had played in 19 of Boston’s first 20 games prior to the injury, posting no goals and 14 assists.

While both teams might be tanking for the best position pick in the 2026 NFL draft, the players on the field will not be doing so on Sunday.

The problem is that quite a few will not be on the field.

The Browns will be without two starters on the offensive line, while the Titans will be lacking their center and cornerback. Seven other players are questionable for the game.

Kansas City can win this game at home even with its problems on the offensive line and on defense.","The AFC South has garnered a rather unfavorable reputation over the years as an afterthought among NFL divisions.

Maybe that isn’t so heading into Week 14 this season, when the Indianapolis Colts attempt to defeat the Jaguars in Jacksonville for the first time since 2014. Both teams are 8-4 but can’t get too comfortable with the Houston Texans (and their stingy defense) on their heels. Houston is on the road Sunday night against the Kansas City Chiefs, whose dynasty inches closer to crumbling with another loss.

Another sight not often seen in December — high stakes in a Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers game. The rivals meet with the NFC North lead on the line.

Our NFL writers Zak Keefer, Jeff Howe and Mike Sando discuss all things Week 14 in The Athletic’s latest roundtable.

The Colts have lost their grip on the AFC South, haven’t won in Jacksonville in a decade, and Daniel Jones is dealing with a fibula injury. Can Jonathan Taylor solve all their problems, or is there a bigger issue at play here? Have the Jags earned our trust yet, or do we need to see more?

Keefer: The Colts might be the most tenuous 8-4 team in recent memory. All the momentum they built during their 8-1 start has fizzled in a matter of weeks; suddenly, the talk shows in Indianapolis are bringing up the team’s recent late-season collapses — and there are plenty to choose from. Jones is playing hurt, and the fibula is preventing Shane Steichen from opening up the playbook with his quarterback’s running ability. Steichen had all the answers early. He seems to have none of them lately. If the Colts drop this one in Jacksonville — where they haven’t won since Andrew Luck’s third NFL season — their chances at a playoff spot will dwindle. Just weigh their last four games: at the Seattle Seahawks, vs. the San Francisco 49ers, vs. Jacksonville, at Houston. That’s a brutal stretch.

Howe: Aside from Jones’ injury, the Colts’ slide coincides with a turn in the schedule, and I don’t like their chances of holding it together to make the playoffs. Not only do they have to find their way through that closing gantlet, but they’ve got to withstand the surging Texans and lurking Chiefs. With the Jaguars, I trust their ability to make the playoffs, and I think they’re dangerous enough to beat just about anyone on any given week. But they also make a few mistakes each week to make life harder on themselves than necessary. I’d take the Jags to win the division and the Texans to steal the Colts’ wild-card spot.

Sando: The Jaguars have not earned my trust because their offense is not consistent enough. This Colts team is better than the ones that fell apart in previous seasons, so I’ll (tenuously) take them to win this game at Jacksonville despite the Jones injury. Houston feels like the top team in the AFC South. The Jaguars and Colts need the Chiefs to beat Houston at Arrowhead.

Bears-Packers matters in December for the first time in some years. The Bears seem to be winning “in spite of their passing game.” Do you agree, or is Caleb Williams better than the stats suggest? Stinkers versus the Carolina Panthers and Philadelphia Eagles seem like a lifetime ago. Has the Packers offense figured it out yet?

Keefer: Williams has improved this year, but his completion percentage (58.1) remains a concern. It ranks 33rd among quarterbacks to start a game this season. The impetus behind the Bears’ stunning revival has been the run game and the defense’s ability to take the football away. I like Green Bay in this one — that receiving group can be lethal when Matt LaFleur calls an aggressive game, as he did last week at the Detroit Lions. Christian Watson’s return has lifted that unit to a different level.

Howe: Ben Johnson has done wonders for Williams, but he’s still very much a work in progress. Johnson has shrunk the field to limit Williams’ reads, allowing him to break from the pocket to create off schedule, so there’s a mix of the best of both worlds. But yeah, the offense is driven by its physicality on the ground, which was Johnson’s intention in the spring. It’s impressive to see it come together. The Packers are figuring it out, but I want to see them handle this upcoming stretch before I’m ready to feel more comfortable with them going into the playoffs. Their offensive injuries, which always seem to follow them, are a concern, too.

Sando: The Bears are definitely winning despite their passing game. That is better than losing because of their passing game, however. Williams’ sack avoidance this season is the difference between those two things. Chicago will stumble some down the stretch because of the schedule, but this is already a solid first season under Ben Johnson. Williams is learning how to play in a structured offense and will have to stick with it to succeed long-term.

The Buffalo Bills are coming off a win at the Pittsburgh Steelers but have been anything but consistent this season. Joe Burrow sounds like he wants to play spoiler down the stretch. Should Buffalo be worried, or did last week’s historic rushing performance against the Steelers convince you the Bills figured something out?

Keefer: Sunday’s win in Pittsburgh was more about the Steelers’ issues — and there are a lot of them — than the Bills’ finding something. Maybe I’m wrong, but Buffalo isn’t good enough to relax down the stretch, as in years past. The defense is leaky against the run, and without a dominant rushing attack, Buffalo remains eminently beatable. Another upset by the Cincinnati Bengals wouldn’t stun me.

Howe: The Bills have been far too inconsistent for two months to think they got right against the reeling Steelers. And the Bills better be worried about the Bengals because Burrow is absolutely capable of dicing them up. The Bills will win a high-scoring one-possession game.

Sando: Buffalo is not what it used to be, no matter what happened in Pittsburgh. The team no longer has a defense that serves as a safety net for those days when the offense is not firing. Buffalo is 0-4 this season and 1-7 over the past two when finishing games with below-average offensive output (negative EPA on that side of the ball). The team had a 14-16 record in those games from 2019 to 2023. The margin for error is smaller as a result.

Texans-Chiefs highlights Sunday night. Which team’s postseason chances are we more confident in right now and why?

Keefer: I’m taking Houston here, and it wasn’t a difficult decision. Have you seen this defense? It’s menacing at all three levels, and Will Anderson Jr. would be getting more Defensive Player of the Year chatter if it wasn’t for Myles Garrett’s historic season. My bet is the Chiefs’ offense won’t be able to move the ball consistently against a Texans defense that has allowed 20 points just twice this season. Houston stays hot. KC’s playoff hopes fade.

Howe: The Texans have five wins against teams that are in the playoff field, which is noteworthy because none of the seven AFC playoff teams has more than two such victories. They’re well tested, and their defense is a consistent strength. The Chiefs looked like they were ready to go on a run entering their Week 9 game against the Bills, but they instead lost three of four. All were high-stakes games, none on a bigger stage than the Thanksgiving showdown in Dallas, and they just haven’t been able to get it done. The Chiefs need far too much help in too short a stretch to feel good about their chances.

Sando: I lean toward Houston but think this game against the Chiefs will be pivotal one way or another. I’m conflicted. Kansas City can win this game at home even with its problems on the offensive line and on defense. I’m reluctant to pick against the Chiefs in this game even though Houston should win. That’s why it’s a tenuous lean toward Houston.

Nick Sirianni backs Kevin Patullo, his offensive coordinator. Eagles fans clearly do not. Is this the right move for Sirianni, or is it time for a change in play calling? Meanwhile, Justin Herbert’s injury history is getting lengthy at this point, but he hasn’t missed many games in his career (four). Should he really try to play through this left hand injury Monday night versus Philadelphia?

Keefer: I picked the Eagles last week, believing in the champs’ ability to find some offensive cohesion against a Bears team I wasn’t totally buying. I was dead wrong. This Philly season is starting to feel a lot like 2023. The vibes aren’t right. The frustration is building. The offensive creativity, let alone cohesion, simply isn’t there. It starts on early downs, where the Eagles consistently find little success. Patullo is an easy scapegoat, but there’s more to this. Maybe Lane Johnson’s eventual return will save them, but I wouldn’t be stunned if the Chargers hand them another loss Monday — assuming Herbert makes it back.

Howe: The offensive line isn’t as dominant as it’s been in past years, and it’s causing issues everywhere else. That’s not on Patullo. Herbert’s injuries are definitely part of his story at this point, but so is playing through them. No one with the Chargers questions his toughness. And as long as Herbert is confident in his ability to protect himself if he falls on his left side, he should play.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/05181530/Week-14-roundtable-Saturday-NFL.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-06 15:01:16.977152

Every Raven on the 53-man roster is healthy enough to play against Pittsburgh.

Jackson missed Thursday's practice due to an ankle injury. He confirmed that his foot was stepped on during Wednesday's practice and said he's doing ""pretty good"" now. Jackson declined to say who stepped on him.

Jackson hasn't had a full week of practice in a month due to knee, ankle, and toe injuries. He's hoping to come out sharper against the Steelers after he had three turnovers in the Ravens' Thanksgiving loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.

The Ravens offense has been sluggish in recent weeks and Jackson hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in the last three games. The Steelers defense, which ranks 28th in the league, could give Jackson and the Ravens another chance to get on the right track offensively.

Top cornerback Nate Wiggins will play against the Steelers after suffering a foot injury against the Bengals on Thanksgiving. Wiggins returned to full practice on Friday.

Wide receivers Rashod Bateman (ankle) and Devontez Walker (groin) both also returned to full practice Friday and will play against the Steelers.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley was the only other Ravens player missing from Friday's practice, but that was only a rest day. Defensive tackle Travis Jones, who missed Thursday's practice due to personal reasons, returned a day later.

Ravens Rule Out Ar'Darius Washington After First Week of Practice

Ar'Darius Washington's return will have to wait at least another week, as he has been ruled out for Sunday's game.

Washington returned to practice this week after suffering an Achilles tear in May. The fact that he had a chance to play against the Steelers, according to Harbaugh, was an impressive feat already.

Washington did log a full practice participation Friday after being limited in his first two days, which means he's closer to being ready for game action with the rematch against the Cincinnati Bengals next on the schedule.

Outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot) has also been ruled out for Sunday's game. He was limited throughout the week in practice.

Patrick Queen Will Play, But Steelers Rule Out Starting Safety

Former Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen will play against the Ravens after exiting Sunday's loss to the Buffalo Bills early with a glute injury.

He was a limited practice participant on Thursday and Friday but doesn't have an injury designation entering the game.

The Steelers will be without starting safety Kyle Dugger, who has been ruled out due to a hand injury. Dugger has given the Steelers defense a spark since being acquired via trade about a month ago. Former Raven Chuck Clark or Jabrill Peppers is expected to start.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers (left wrist) was a full participant on Friday.

“I hope so,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said.

Reed hasn’t played since the Week 2 game against the Washington Commanders after having collarbone and foot surgeries. His 21-day practice window opened Nov. 21, and he hasn’t missed a day of practice since. The Packers have until next Friday, Dec. 12 to activate him.

“We’re still kind of going through that process of being fully cleared medically,” LaFleur said during his Dec. 5 pre-practice news conference.

If Reed is able to go, he could be a big boost against a surging Bears team in a highly anticipated NFC North matchup.

Reed’s game status and a few other players still are up in the air as four players on the active roster were sidelined during the Dec. 5 practice.

Here’s the latest:

Packers injury report: five questionable, five out vs. Bears

On the final injury report of the week, Jayden Reed (shoulder/foot), Matthew Golden (wrist), Javon Bullard (ankle), Nate Hobbs (knee) and Brenton Cox, Jr. (groin) are questionable to play against the Bears.

Savion Williams (foot), MarShawn Lloyd (calf), Lukas Van Ness (foot), Devonte Wyatt (ankle) and Collin Oliver (hamstring) are ruled out.

For the Bears, their leading receiver, Rome Odunze (foot), is out along with linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II and cornerback Tyrique Stevenson.

Javon Bullard injury update

Packers nickel corner Javon Bullard has missed the past two days of practice due to an ankle injury.

LaFleur said his injury came in the Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions and it’s unclear if he’ll play against the Bears.

“Just was having some lingering effects,” LaFleur said. “So, we thought it would be best to shut him down and see how he progresses throughout the course of the week.”

Quay Walker injury update

Packers linebacker Quay Walker did not have a game status on the injury report, meaning he'll play against the Bears.

Walker, who missed two games due to a stinger in his neck, was a limited participant in practice on Dec. 3, but was upgraded to a full participant the last two practices.

Savion Williams injury update

Packers rookie receiver and return specialist Savion Williams missed practice all week.

He did not play in the Lions game.

“It’s definitely not a setback,” LaFleur said. “It’s more or less just battling through and what we think Is best for the long-term.”

Lukas Van Ness injury update

Packers defensive end Lukas Van Ness missed practice all week.

Van Ness missed five games due to a foot injury, and returned in Week 12 against the Minnesota Vikings, but played just six snaps. He did not play in the Lions game

Nate Hobbs injury update

Packers cornerback Nate Hobbs practiced all week, making it possible he’ll play for the first time in four games. He’s been battling a knee injury

Coaches said he’s practiced well this week.

“Dealing with his injury, we want him to have confidence in himself where he can go and have success,” Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley said Dec. 4. “And I think he’s really close to that point.”

Matthew Golden injury update

Packers receiver Matthew Golden practiced every day this week giving him a positive sign that he’ll play against the Bears.

The rookie receiver missed the past two games dealing with injuries to his shoulder and wrist.

“He’s gone out there and caught some balls in practice,” LaFleur said. “Another guy I think that will be questionable leading up to game time, depending upon how he’s feeling.”

Karl Brooks injury update

Packers defensive tackle Karl Brooks, who missed the Lions game due to an ankle injury, practiced all week.

Brooks didn't have a game status on the injury report meaning he will play against the Bears.

Devonte Wyatt injury update

Packers defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt is not on injured reserve yet, but LaFleur confirmed this week that Wyatt would be out for the rest of the season due to an ankle injury he suffered at the end of the game against the Lions on Thanksgiving.

Update on injured-reserve players

Reed, MarShawn Lloyd, Brenton Cox Jr. and Collin Oliver practiced all week.

Aaron Glenn made the announcement before Friday’s practice in advance of Sunday’s game against the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium.

The coach added that rookie Brady Cook will serve as the backup to Tyrod Taylor, and they would see how Fields’ knee progresses to determine his status going forward.

But with just five games remaining on the schedule, there’s a decent chance Fields has played his last game for the Jets.

And he could soon end up on the growing list of quarterbacks who have come to the Jets and flopped before leaving town — a list that includes Aaron Rodgers, Zach Wilson and Sam Darnold in just the past six seasons.

Having already lost his starting job, Glenn said Fields’ knee injury “popped up in practice” Wednesday.

It limited Fields on Thursday, and he was held out Friday.

Regardless of how Fields might recover from the knee soreness, it’s hard to see how he can make anything out of what’s been a failure in his first season with the Jets.

Signed after a bumpy and disappointing year with the Steelers after his time with the Bears came to an end, Fields was brought in to bring some life to the Jets offense under Glenn in his first year in Florham Park.

Instead, it has been a mess, and while he showed some solid play in a handful of games, the 11th-overall pick in 2021 seems to be on his way out of a third franchise.

After opening the season as the starter — and starting the first nine games of the season — Fields hasn’t played since Nov. 13 against the Patriots, having been benched in favor of Taylor.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND JETS STATS

The Jets went just 2-7 in those games after signing Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal, with $30 million guaranteed, in the offseason.

He’s guaranteed $10 million for next year and said after being benched he wants to be a starter again somewhere.

Though Taylor figures to run the offense for most of the rest of this lost season, Glenn said he’s liked what he’s seen from Cook, who has yet to appear in an NFL game.

Cook, 24, was signed by the Jets as an undrafted free agent coming out of Missouri in May.

He was signed to the practice squad in August and has been active against Cincinnati and Tampa Bay due to injuries to Fields and Taylor.

“The one thing that we do quite a bit in practice is we have a number of competition periods, and you see exactly how he goes about his business when his time comes up to really be in that situation to compete. He looks forward to it,” Glenn said of Cook. “He’s going to be a quarterback in this league. I do know that. I can’t tell you when, but he’ll be a quarterback in this league.”

And with the Jets, anything is possible when it comes to quarterback turmoil.

They have the draft capital to get a top pick in the draft, so regardless of how this season ends, they will have someone else under center in 2026 after another unsuccessful attempt at landing a franchise quarterback.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-51dd2rslm-1764954794447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764936811&w=1200,N,,2025-12-06 14:02:38.602649

And the rookie defensive tackle knows he’s ready.

While the fourth-round pick out of Nebraska has played a total of just 35 defensive snaps all season, he does go against the Eagles’ offensive line in practice. So he has been able to track his progress.

“One of the best O-lines in the NFL,” Robinson said on Friday. “I think it’s a pretty good gauge. If I’m having a good day against them, things are going in the right direction.”

While the 24-year-old rookie said the Eagles haven’t yet talked to him about what his role might look like against the Chargers on Monday night, it seems likely he’ll have one. Carter is the Eagles’ top defensive tackle so it’ll be an all-hands-on-deck approach to replace him.

Obviously, that will start with Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo and Byron Young. But Robinson will likely see some playing time too. He’s excited for this opportunity.

“I think just be able to show and prove myself to the organization and prove myself that I’m able to go out there and compete with the guys,” Robinson said. “I’m just excited for whatever they’re willing to give me.”

Robinson has played just 35 snaps all season and 19 of them came in the first Giants game when Carter was held out with a foot injury. Robinson played a smattering of snaps earlier in the season too.

But we’re now in Week 14 and Robinson feels way more prepared for his opportunity this time around.

“Definitely,” he said. “I didn’t know nothing coming into the season, right? But being around the guys halfway through the season, I definitely feel like I’ve grown as a player. And obviously I feel a little more ready. But it’s a challenge. I’m not going to back away from a challenge. I’m going to take what I can with it.”

Robinson hasn’t been playing on game days but he has been improving behind the scenes with the help from the Eagles’ player development team. Robinson credited that group with helping him to set goals and Robinson sets some for himself too.

He gave an example of focusing on his strikes one week and then his feet the next, and then working to combine them the following week. He has been taking incremental steps to make himself a better overall player and that improvement has been seen by his teammates in practice.

That’s how they know he’s ready.

“Practice reps,” Jordan Davis said. “Going against the ones on offense. Just the reps he’s getting against Landon (Dickerson) and against Jordan Mailata and against Cam (Jurgens), all those kind of compound and add up.

“When he gets his opportunity to go against a former Eagles player, Mekhi Becton, or somebody that’s on the Chargers’ line, we have full confidence in him that he can go out there and execute. It’s more about the mindset that he has preparing out there and understanding that he is meant to be here. He is here for a reason.”

Like most players coming from college, Robinson was used to a heavy workload at Nebraska. After being inactive each of the last four weeks, Robinson admitted it is “definitely a strange feeling” to not play very much.

But Robinson also said he’s a realistic person and he knows this is a violent game. He motivated himself by understanding that injuries happen and he had to be ready for his opportunity.

That opportunity is finally here.

“I understood when I came here that I was going to be around a bunch of dudes,” Robinson said. “I knew that I was going to have to work even harder to have this opportunity to get on the field. Obviously, the Eagles believed in me and being able to do that. I just have to do the same thing.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/09/Robinson-T-USATSI-26306803.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-06 14:02:50.787735

Coach Sean McDermott said Friday morning that Palmer has not practiced all week and he would be listed as doubtful for the game, which is all but a guarantee that he will be on the sidelines.

Joey Bose, Terrel Bernard out in Bills injury report

As for players already ruled out, there are two - edge rusher Joey Bosa and linebacker Terrel Bernard. Bosa suffered a hamstring injury in the victory over the Steelers last Sunday, while Bernard will miss his second straight game after suffering a dislocated elbow in the loss at Houston on Nov. 20.

McDermott said that edge rusher AJ Epenesa, who did practice Thursday because of a foot injury, was back to work Friday and he’ll be fine for the game, obviously a good piece of news with Bosa already out.

Will Dalton Kincaid play vs Bengals?

Tight end Dalton Kincaid’s situation, though, remains murky. He has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury and Thursday was wearing a brace on the knee that he hurt last season. McDermott said that it was more of a precautionary thing with the brace, but still, it’s not great for his potential to play in a game where the Bills could really use his presence in the sagging passing game.

There was more good news as offensive tackle Dion Dawkins has officially cleared concussion protocol and will be good to go for the game. The other offensive tackle, Spencer Brown, has been limited in practice with the shoulder injury that forced him to miss the Pittsburgh. His status will likely be questionable and if he can’t play, the Bills have several choices to replace him including Ryan Van Demark, Alec Anderson or Tylan Grable.

Joshua Palmer's frustrating season continues

Palmer has endured a frustrating season. The free agent signee started slowly and had minimal impact in the first five games, then suffered an ankle injury in Week 6 at Atlanta which knocked him out for three games.

He played in two games and again had very little impact, then reaggravated the injury in practice last week and was inactive for the Steelers game.

Fortunately for the Bills, they will be able to overcome his absence with Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman, Tyrell Shavers, Gabe Davis and newcomer Brandin Cooks available to play.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/16/PROC/87308192007-20251116-t-192016-z-1326800549-mt-1-usatoday-27605322-rtrmadp-3-nfltampabaybuccaneersatbuffalobills.JPG?crop=3957,2226,x0,y206&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-06 12:04:41.891012

Murray hasn't taken a snap since Oct. 5 due to a mid-foot sprain, and he hasn't made sufficient progress in his recovery, Gannon told reporters.

Gannon said Murray sought a second opinion regarding his injury, and the foot isn't healing fast enough for him to get back on the field in 2025.

""Kyler will not play again this year,"" Gannon said. ""He had some more tests done this week. Went out of state and got another opinion on it. It's not progressing where it's gonna make sense that he can go. He's gonna be done for the year.""

Even before the injury, there was already speculation that Murray may be playing his last season with the Cardinals. Now, it seems like a possibility that Murray has played his last game with the franchise that selected him at No. 1 overall in 2019.

Asked whether Murray would be the Cardinals' starting quarterback in 2026, Gannon deflected focus to the team's Week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams.

""I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly,"" Gannon said.

Kyler Murray shut down for rest of 2025: Potential landing spots if Cardinals trade veteran QB

Tyler Sullivan

Murray was initially injured in the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans and was put on injured reserve Nov. 5. When Murray was put on IR, Gannon said he hoped Murray would be able to return this season.

Without Murray behind center, the Cardinals have gone 1-6 with Jacoby Brissett as the starter and have fallen to 3-9 on the year. However, that record conceals the fact that Arizona's offense has been better in a number of areas with Brissett at the helm.

Prior to his injury, Murray was completing 68.3 of his passes while averaging 192.4 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and three interceptions. He was also rushing for 34.6 yards per game with one touchdown.

Meanwhile, Brissett is averaging 243.1 passing yards per game with 13 touchdowns to four interceptions while connecting on 67.5% of his throws.

There hasn't been much of a drop-off at quarterback with Murray out, and that has created big questions about his future in Arizona. It may be tough for the Cardinals to find a trade partner next offseason, thanks to Murray's massive contract, but they still have some options at their disposal.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/05/f51c1ba0-643e-475d-9717-d1630be159e3/thumbnail/1200x675/e7898d8d91c178d33101dd599ce4448d/gettyimages-2242098375-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:02:40.118100

Arizona Cardinals remaining schedule","Year 3 under Jonathan Gannon hasn't gone as planned for the Arizona Cardinals.

In 2024, the team went 8-9 behind an improved defense. Investments on that side of the ball via free agency and the draft had the team poised to make another jump in a competitive NFC West.

Instead, the team sits 3-9 and firmly last in what's been the most competitive division in the league. Injuries have taken a toll on the team – especially on offense. James Conner, the team's leading rusher in each of the last four seasons, suffered a season-ending injury in Week 3. Franchise quarterback Kyler Murray's foot injury in Week 5 kept him out of the starting lineup and eventually caused a move to injured reserve (IR).

Gannon revealed today Murray won't take the field again this season.

“(Murray) had some more tests done this week,” Gannon said. “Went out of state, got another opinion on it. It's not progressing where it's gonna make sense that he can go. So he's gonna be done for the year.”

Week 14 was the earliest he could return from IR. Veteran Jacoby Brissett's started in Murray's place this season and performed well. In seven starts, he's averaging 312.6 passing yards per game – up from Murray's 192.4 in five starts.

Brissett's gone 1-6 as a starter with the lone win coming against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 9. Arizona's lost close battles to Jacksonville and Tampa Bay in Week 12 and Week 13, respectively, despite Brissett's production.

Gannon was asked about Murray's future and if he expects the former No. 1 overall pick to be the team's starting quarterback in 2026.

“I’m worried about the Rams right now,” Gannon said. He did add that he feels bad for Murray in this situation.

""He got hurt and he wasn't healthy enough to play. That's first and foremost. That's where I would leave it right now.""

Arizona hosts Los Angeles this week for the first of their two divisional games against the team. The Cardinals are 0-4 in NFC West play this year with two losses each to the 49ers and Seahawks. They're already eliminated from playoff contention in the NFC ahead of the final five games of their season.

When will Kyler Murray return?

There are no signs this foot injury will be a multi-year injury so Murray should be healthy for the 2026 season. Whether he remains with the Cardinals or ends up elsewhere is yet to be determined.

Murry has three years left on his current contract extension. It'd cost the Cardinals $54.718 million in dead cap space to release him this upcoming offseason, per OverTheCap. That number balloons to $80 million if the team waits until 2027 to release him.

A trade seems more likely if the team decides to move on from him but that could get tricky with his contract as well. A potential team would likely negotiate a certain amount of the contract to be split between them and the Cardinals for Arizona to move off from their starting quarterback.

Odunze started appearing on Chicago's injury report before Halloween with what was initially classified as a heel injury. The wide receiver said the injury was ""not a simple fix"" but one he would be monitoring along with the Bears' training staff. The team managed Odunze's injury throughout November by having him sit out at least one practice each week last month, though he did not show up on the injury report last week ahead of the Eagles game.

Odunze was targeted six times and had two catches for eight yards in Chicago's 24-15 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. He showed no signs of injury during the game and played 80% of offensive snaps.

Earlier this week, coach Ben Johnson lamented that the Bears are winning ""in spite of our passing game, not because of it,"" and will look to get on track without the team's leading receiver. Odunze's absence could mean more targets for rookie Luther Burden III or Olamide Zaccheaus. DJ Moore, Colston Loveland and Cole Kmet could also see a production spike with Odunze sidelined.

Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson (hip) and linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II (shoulder) were also ruled out against the Packers.

But they might’ve lost one of their key defenders in the process.

Pro Bowl safety Brian Branch is feared to have suffered an Achilles injury, a league source told The Athletic’s Dianna Russini.

Branch exited the game in the fourth quarter, walking gingerly off the field with the assistance of athletic trainers. When he returned to the sideline, a cart was brought out to escort him to the locker room. He was spotted with crutches and a walking boot after the game. The Lions are still learning more about the severity of Branch’s injury.

“I don’t know,” Lions head coach Dan Campbell said postgame, when asked about Branch’s status. “I’ll know more tomorrow.”

Losing Branch would be a major blow to a secondary that’s already shorthanded. A 2023 second-round pick out of Alabama, Branch is one of the most versatile DBs in the league — capable of providing sticky coverage against receivers and tight ends alike. He’s instinctive, physical and fearless. His ability to play in the box or back deep allows defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard to get creative elsewhere. He’s also been a mainstay in an ever-changing secondary.

All-Pro safety Kerby Joseph (knee) has missed the last seven games. If he returns to action this year, he won’t be 100 percent. Cornerback D.J. Reed missed six games this season recovering from a hamstring injury, while fellow corner Terrion Arnold has missed five with varying injuries. Arnold will miss the rest of the season after opting for season-ending shoulder surgery.

If Branch is added to that list, the Lions will need to rely on the likes of Thomas Harper, Avonte Maddox and Daniel Thomas at safety. The Lions have four games remaining, and likely need to win three to give themselves a shot at the playoffs. That will be harder without Branch. Not to mention the timing of this injury, depending on its severity, could keep him out for part of the 2026 season, in what could be a contract year for Branch.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/05095431/USATSI_27743388-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-06 11:05:37.807620

Phillips, 26, began the week listed as limited with that concussion so it’s a good sign that he got through that first day of practice. He was limited again on Friday but appears on track to play against the Chargers on Monday night.

Having Phillips for this game is big because the Chargers have given up a ton of pressure this season after losing both of their starting tackles. Not only that but Justin Herbert is expected to play this game after having surgery on his non-throwing hand earlier this week. Herbert has been pressured more than any other quarterback in the NFL this season.

Eagles left guard Landon Dickerson was not at practice because he got a rest day. His absence was not injury-related. Brett Toth filled in at left guard.

Here's the full injury report from Friday:

Did not practice: DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), G Landon Dickerson (rest), T Lane Johnson (foot)

Limited: LB Zack Baun (hand), WR Jahan Dotson (toe), OLB Jaelan Phillips (concussion)

NFL

Full: S Marcus Epps (shoulder), WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder), T Myles Hinton (back)

DT Jalen Carter (shoulders) and RT Lane Johnson (foot) both missed practice again on Friday. Carter has already been ruled out this week after having a procedure Monday on both of his shoulders. Carter is considered week-to-week. Johnson suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions and has missed the last two games. Fred Johnson is expected to make his third straight start.

In addition to Phillips, the other three Eagles who began the week listed as limited — LB Zack Baun (hand), WR Jahan Dotson (toe), WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder) — were practicing again on Friday. Gipson missed last week with that injury he suffered against the Cowboys but was upgraded to a full participant on Friday. Britain Covey was promoted to the 53-man roster to return punts in his place.

Both players who were full to start the week — S Marcus Epps (shoulder), T Myles Hinton (back) — were back on the field Friday. Both Epps and Hinton have been on IR and are practicing after the team opened their respective practice windows.

If Epps looks good during this week of practice, there’s a good chance he’ll be a starting safety next to Reed Blankenship on Monday night. Sydney Brown got a start last week in place of rookie Drew Mukuba, who is on IR with an ankle fracture, and had some ups and downs. There’s a chance Epps could stabilize the position.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/Phillips-J-USATSI-27622884.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-06 03:59:28.373792

Among the players referenced were defensive back Javon Bullard, cornerback Nate Hobbs, receiver Jayden Reed, receiver Matthew Golden and receiver Savion Williams.

The injury updates from LaFleur's Friday press conference:

-- On slot cornerback Javon Bullard, who missed Thursday's practice: ""Just having some lingering effects, so we thought it would be best to shut him down and see how he progresses over the course of the week."" He's been playing through an ankle injury. LaFleur said Bullard would NOT practice on Friday, but he hasn't been ruled out for Sunday. ""It's up in the air.""

-- On Nate Hobbs, who has missed four straight games with a knee injury: ""He's looked good, but we'll see where he is. How he goes out there today and performs. But he's made progress."" The Packers could use his return this week if Bullard can't go. Hobbs has slot experience.

-- On if Jayden Reed will return and play Sunday: ""I hope so, but we're still going through the process of being fully cleared medically."" Reed broke his collarbone in Week 2 and has missed 11 weeks. It's possible he needs one more scan to show the collarbone is healed enough to play in a game. Or the Packers already did the scan and are trying to weigh the risk and reward of him playing if the collarbone isn't 100 percent healed. Reed remains on injured reserve, and the Packers have until Saturday to activate him.

-- On Matthew Golden, who has missed two straight games with a wrist injury: ""He's done a nice job. He's gone out there, caught some balls in practice. Another guy who will be questionable leading up to game time depending on how he's feeling."" Sounds like the first-round pick will be a game-time decision for Sunday.

-- On Savion Wiliams, who is now missing games with a lingering foot injury: ""Definitely not a setback, it's more or less battling through. What we think is best for the long term."" Expect Williams to be ruled out on Friday's final injury report.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/21/SPAC/87398508007-2235795113.jpg?crop=4213,2370,x0,y140&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-06 01:00:10.737981

Trossard has been absent since being subbed off late into the first half of Arsenal’s victory over Bayern Munich on November 26.","Arsenal fear that Cristhian Mosquera could miss up to six weeks after suffering an injury this week.

Manager Mikel Arteta said the defender is set for another medical test on Friday after a “more complicated” injury than that affecting Declan Rice, who was also forced off during the midweek 2-0 victory over Brentford.

Mosquera, 21, went down on 41 minutes during the Brentford win and received treatment from Arsenal’s medical staff, after appearing to land awkwardly on his left foot when jumping for a header. The centre-back walked off unassisted but hobbling slightly and was replaced by Jurrien Timber.

Before his side’s trip to Villa Park on Saturday, Arteta said: “Let’s see (on Rice). We have another training session in the afternoon. Every hour is going to be important. Mosquera (ankle) is the one that is more complicated. We have another test today. (William) Saliba and (Leandro) Trossard are a matter of days.”

Sources briefed on Mosquera’s injury, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to do so publicly, later told The Athletic they fear the Spaniard could miss up to six weeks with the problem.

Arsenal’s squad has been hit with repeated injuries this season, and with Arteta’s first-choice centre-back pairing (Gabriel and Saliba) sidelined on Wednesday, Timber was the only player on the bench with experience playing at centre-back.

Arteta said ahead of the Brentford match that Saliba had picked up a “little niggle” and that it would be a “matter of days” until he could return. Gabriel, however, is still recovering from a longer-term muscular injury to his right thigh, which The Athletic reported on November 18 could keep him out for up to two months.

Mosquera has impressed when called upon for Arsenal, who have the best defensive record in the Premier League and Champions League. The centre back, who joined from Valencia in a deal worth an initial £13million (€15m) in the summer, has made 16 appearances this season.

Trossard has been absent since being subbed off late into the first half of Arsenal’s victory over Bayern Munich on November 26.

Specifically, all eyes are on the quarterback position with two of the game's more dynamic talents, Lamar Jackson and Jayden Daniels. Jackson missed practice on Thursday, which has clouded his status for a pivotal AFC North contest with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Meanwhile, Jayden Daniels is remarkably in play to suit up after suffering a gruesome elbow injury earlier this year that was initially thought to sideline him long-term. Along with answers on both of those signal-callers, we'll also have updates on Tee Higgins, Sauce Gardner, and other key contributors.

Note: New England, New York (Giants), San Francisco, and Carolina are on bye.

Seattle has a relatively clean injury report for Week 14. Safety Julian Love (hamstring) has no game status, so he appears ready to go for Sunday.

Atlanta will continue to be without its No. 1 wideout, as it has ruled out Drake London as he continues to deal with a knee injury. Meanwhile, James Pearce Jr. was added to the injury report with a back injury and is now questionable.

It's another week without Trey Hendrickson for the Bengals as the star pass rusher deals with a hip injury that has kept him out of practice all week. On a more positive note, wideout Tee Higgins practiced fully Thursday and Friday, and carries no injury designation, so he will make his return to action after missing Week 13 due to a concussion.

Buffalo will not have Bernard and Bosa on Sunday after the two defenders were unable to practice this week due to various injuries. Meanwhile, the club is holding out hope with Josh Palmer by not ruling him out, despite not practicing all week. As for Brown and Kincaid, they both practiced on a limited basis throughout the week.

Cushenberry was able to practice on Friday on a limited basis, but Tennessee still ruled him out for Week 14 due to his foot injury. Meanwhile, Brooks and Tuttle both practiced fully throughout the week, giving them each a good chance at playing Sunday.

With Conklin and Teller both ruled out for Week 14, the Browns will lean on KT Leveston at right tackle and Teven Jenkins at right guard. As for rookie defensive lineman Mason Graham, head coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters that the team will evaluate him in the next two days before Sunday.

The Dolphins have three players listed as questionable, but they may all be moving in different directions. Brewer was limited for the second straight day, while Melifonwu was a full participant Friday, which is encouraging. However, Campbell did not practice Friday after being limited Thursday, so he has a downward trajectory.

Justin Fields will be sidelined yet again due to his knee injury, which only makes the decision to continue rolling with Tyrod Taylor easier. Safety Tony Adams missed Wednesday and Thursday but returned Friday as a full participant.

Despite practicing on a limited basis throughout the week, Mike Evans will not make his return to the Buccaneers offense in Week 14. The club has ruled him out for this matchup against New Orleans.

Jacksonville will be down its starting left tackle, ruling out Walker Little due to a concussion. Washington, Armstead, Walker and Murray were able to practice in some capacity Friday, keeping the door open for them to play Sunday.

After missing Thursday's practice due to an ankle injury, Lamar Jackson was back at practice as a full participant Friday and carries no game designation.

He has no game designation, so he appears good to go.

For Las Vegas, all eyes will be on Maxx Crosby, who is questionable for Week 14 due to a knee injury. He was limited at the beginning of the week, but did not participate on Thursday or Friday.

Arizona will be without Marvin Harrison Jr. as he deals with a heel injury that kept him out of practice all week. It'll also still be missing rookie defensive lineman Walter Nolen, as he did not practice due to a knee injury.

After further tests ""out of state,"" the decision was made that Murray would be shut down.
As for Murray's status as quarterback of the Cardinals in 2026, Gannon declined to address it.
""Kyler puts in a lot of work and is a valuable piece to this team and this organization,"" Wilson said.
""That's the job,"" Gannon said about the injuries.","Kyler Murray's season is over.

Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said Friday the quarterback, who has been on Injured Reserve after suffering a foot injury in Week 5, will not play again in 2025 because the foot has not healed. After further tests ""out of state,"" the decision was made that Murray would be shut down.

""He wasn't progressing in a way that we wanted, so we went and got a different opinion, some different people, and (the foot) is just not right,"" Gannon said.

Jacoby Brissett has been the starter since Week 6.

As for Murray's status as quarterback of the Cardinals in 2026, Gannon declined to address it. ""I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly"" he said.

Murray played in a career-low five games this season, completing 110 of 161 passes for 962 yards, 6 touchdowns and 3 interceptions for a passer rating of 88.6. He rushed for 173 yards on 29 carries with 1 touchdown.

Murray has not spoken to the media since postgame against the Titans Week 5. He missed three games before being placed on IR, and there had been hope in those three weeks he might return. He posted on social media on Thursday a picture of himself, James Conner, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Michael Wilson during an offseason workout with the title ""Weird Year"" and added a caption that said, ""Never again.""

""Kyler puts in a lot of work and is a valuable piece to this team and this organization,"" Wilson said. ""Him not being to able to be back in the saddle is a tough blow because I know for him and for us, we had a lot of expectations and high hopes and conversations prior to this year about what we could accomplish as a team.

""They paid him as a franchise guy and he's shown he can be that guy, and so I do feel deeply for him.""

The Cardinals will also be without Harrison against the Rams Sunday. Harrison suffered a heel injury last week. Gannon added that he wasn't sure if running back Trey Benson, who is on IR with a knee injury, is going to be able to return this year.

Wide receiver Greg Dortch (chest) and defensive tackle Walter Nolen III (knee) are among those who are also out Sunday.

""That's the job,"" Gannon said about the injuries. ""I appreciate the staff, because I am the one who tells them, 'Here's who is up, here's who is down, this is what you're going to have.' And there is no negativity, there is no 'poor little old me' ... there is none of that. Because that's the job.

""You have to figure it out. Our job is to have solutions and be a part of the solution, not part of the problem.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cardinals/oqx8b0u0nkgxsfi6omgm,N,,2025-12-05 21:59:18.916599

Given how late in the season this injury is, Branch is extremely unlikely to return to the field this season.","A loss to NFC North rival Green Bay on Thanksgiving put the Detroit Lions out of playoff seeding. A week later, the Lions bounced back with a crucial win over the Dallas Cowboys.

That win may have come at a cost on defense.

Safety Brian Branch tore his Achilles in Detroit's ""Thursday Night Football"" win over Dallas, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The injury happened in the fourth quarter as Branch was in coverage on Cowboys' tight end Jake Ferguson.

Branch is the latest secondary player to miss time for the Lions. Cornerback Terrion Arnold underwent season-ending shoulder surgery earlier this week and fellow safety Kerby Joseph hasn't played since Week 6 due to a knee injury.

Branch made his first Pro Bowl last season with a career-high four interceptions, one sack, 109 tackles and 16 passes defensed. He hadn't tallied an interception yet through 12 games this year but had a career-best 2.5 sacks in addition to nine passes defensed and a fumble recovery.

With Branch out, the Lions brought veteran Daniel Thomas in to finish out the game at safety. Thomas spent the last five years in Jacksonville before coming to Detroit after roster cuts in August.

The Lions get a 10-day rest before another crucial game for their playoff hopes: a Week 15 road matchup against the NFC-West leading Los Angeles Rams.

When will Brian Branch return?

Given how late in the season this injury is, Branch is extremely unlikely to return to the field this season. He should be back in time for the 2026 season depending on how his surgery and recovery go.

Players have returned less than six months after surgery – running back Cam Akers did so in 2021 for the Rams. But others have taken closer to eight months, such as quarterback Kirk Cousins.

""He's playing great football right now,"" Macdonald said.
We have to more ways to get him involved in the gameplan, but we've got a lot of great players too, so it's a great problem to have.
He's a great teammate, he's been a great teammate, he's got a great outlook on—you can spend a bunch of time on, how do the carries and the touches—he's just worried about playing great football.
""That's some of the best linebacker play I've ever seen in that game,"" Macdonald said.","1. Love and Reed are ready to return.

With Love and Reed coming back, the Seahawks will be as close to full strength on defense as they have been since early in their season-opener. The Seahawks will have to make moves to get both players back on the 53-man roster by Saturday afternoon, but they currently have two openings on the roster to fit those two if that is indeed the plan.

""J-Reed should be good to go, which is exciting,"" Macdonald said. ""Julian is planning on playing, and we're going to play it accordingly. We have a plan, we'll see how the game goes, but excited to have those guys back.""

Asked if Love, who is coming back from a hamstring injury that has limited him to three games this season, will be on a pitch count, so to speak, Macdonald said, ""We have a plan. We're going to stick to our plan.""

With Reed, Macdonald said the veteran defensive tackle will ""just be in the rotation.""

While both players have dealt with setbacks to their injuries that kept them out longer than hoped, Reed and Love have been a positive presence around the team during while unable to play.

""Both are different circumstances, and both were unfortunate, so to be able to handle those things and stay optimistic and stay positive with the guys and keep the focus on the team is pretty awesome,"" Macdonald said. ""We love them for it. You hate that they have to go through those type of things, but the team, we're better because of how they handled the whole situation. We're really appreciative for what they've done.""

2. Other injury news.

While the Seahawks have no players on the active roster with game status designations, rookie defensive end Rylie Mills and receiver Dareke Young have both been ruled out. Mills, who tore his ACL late in his senior season at Notre Dame, returned to practice from the non-football injury list last week, and is making good progress but not yet ready for game action. Mills can practice for up to 21 days from his November 26 return date before the Seahawks have to decide whether or not to add him to the roster.

""Rylie's doing a great job,"" Macdonald said. ""He's working hard. He's so strong. It's just a matter of, how many of how many great reps can we bank before it's time to come back. But he's doing a great job. I'm excited for him.""

Veteran safety Quandre Diggs, who signed to the practice squad last week, was elevated for last week's game to provide safety depth, but may not be available this weekend due to a thigh injury, Macdonald said.

Diggs is not on the injury report because teams do not list practice squad players on the report, but Macdonald said, ""Quandre's working through his thigh right now. It's going to be probably week to week.""

4. Devon Witherspoon is ""the sparkplug behind the whole thing.""

The Seahawks' captains for Week 14 are cornerback Devon Witherspoon, running back Kenneth Walker III and linebacker Patrick O'Connell, and when asked about Witherspoon and Walker, Macdonald had plenty of nice things to say about both.

On Witherspoon, Macdonald said, ""He's part of the engine that makes the whole thing go. He's probably the sparkplug behind the whole thing. He could be a captain every week.""

Much like last season, Witherspoon is playing at a very high level without always having the flashy numbers to support it, but Macdonald said that has more to do with the way he's calling games than anything Witherspoon is doing.

""He's playing great football right now,"" Macdonald said. ""Great football. He's playing three positions, and he is really the energy behind our defense on a daily basis. He's playing high-level cornerback play, and you can put the lack of production on me. We have to more ways to get him involved in the gameplan, but we've got a lot of great players too, so it's a great problem to have. But it's nothing that he's doing. He's playing really, really high-level football right now for us that's really helping us.""

On Walker, Macdonald said. ""I think he's playing his best football right now. And he's had such a great attitude throughout the whole process. He's a great teammate, he's been a great teammate, he's got a great outlook on—you can spend a bunch of time on, how do the carries and the touches—he's just worried about playing great football. He's excited about where we're going and you can see his personality shine through, so I'm happy for Ken.""

5. Ernest Jones IV impressed Macdonald with his play last week.

Ernest Jones IV has done a lot of impressive things in a little over a year with the Seahaws, but his game last week really stood out, with Jones earning NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors after recording 12 tackles and a pair of interceptions, one of which he returnd 85 yards for a touchdown.

""That's some of the best linebacker play I've ever seen in that game,"" Macdonald said. ""The way he played the run, the way he played the pass. All the things you have to do at linebacker—he erased some bigtime plays—I'm really happy for him. He's been working his tail off. That's the EJ that we know and we expect. We love him.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/f9ej5dmy53a6j6zdkznb,N,,2025-12-05 21:59:22.387832

Wide receiver Tee Higgins has cleared the concussion protocol and will be fully available for Cincinnati's road game against the Buffalo Bills, he said Friday.

Higgins has been out since he suffered a concussion in the team's Week 12 loss against New England on Nov. 23. After clearing that hurdle Friday, Higgins is eager to suit up again -- especially with Ja'Marr Chase and quarterback Joe Burrow.

""It's been a minute, man,"" Higgins said. ""I'm definitely looking forward to it. It's going to be great.""

Higgins acknowledged how scary the injury has been. Against the Patriots, Higgins went up for a deep pass down the right sideline. Higgins' head smacked against the turf at Paycor Stadium as he was unable to make the catch. He was on the turf for several minutes before being carted back into the locker room.

""Any head injury is scary for anybody,"" Higgins said. ""Thank God I'm able to play again this weekend and keep playing for the rest of the season.""

The sixth-year player out of Clemson ramped up his progression over the course of the week. He was a limited participant Wednesday before having a full slate of practice reps Thursday. Higgins detailed the protocol process as he worked his way back.

""It was just getting through concussion protocol, seeing how I'm feeling with working out, running routes and things like that,"" Higgins said. ""So it's basically all just on me, see how I'm feeling and then passing those tests as well.""

After Friday's practice at the team's indoor bubble, Higgins said he felt great.

He'll give the Bengals (4-8) a boost ahead of Sunday's critical showdown against Buffalo (8-4). Cincinnati is currently two games back of the Pittsburgh Steelers for the division lead and will likely need to win out to have a shot of clinching the AFC North title and the automatic playoff berth.

Sunday will mark the first time Higgins, Chase and Burrow will be on the field at the same since Week 2, when Burrow suffered a turf toe injury that sidelined him for nine games. In Burrow's first contest back, the Bengals beat the Baltimore Ravens to end a four-game losing streak and keep their playoff hopes mathematically afloat.

The Bengals have made a significant long-term investment into that trio. In March, Chase and Higgins inked long-term deals with the club. Chase signed a four-year deal worth $161 million, which is the NFL record for a wide receiver. Higgins earned a three-year deal worth $115 million.

The research team set out to answer a simple but important question: Do career length or playing position predict long-term health in former NFL athletes? Their findings show they do not. Although these measures are often used as stand-ins for head injury exposure, they didn’t help identify which players experienced worse mental or physical health later in life. The study suggests that future research and potentially future health guidelines in sports should rely on confirmed concussion history rather than assumptions based on position or years in the league.

“It is often thought that certain positions are at higher risk of sustaining concussion, which may be related to shorter playing careers and worse long-term health outcomes, but that’s not what we found,” said Wesley Cole, co-investigator and first author on the paper.

This study is part of the multisite NFL-LONG project and is one of the largest and most detailed examinations of former professional football players to date.

Murray got another opinion on the injury Wednesday. Gannon said it took place out-of-state, which caused the quarterback to be away from the facility for the day. Murray also had more tests done, which factored into the decision for him not to return.

""It wasn't progressing in a way that we wanted, so we went and got a different opinion, some different people and kind of looked at it, and it's just not right,"" Gannon said.

Gannon also said that wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. will not play Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams because of his heel injury.

Murray suffered the injury in the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans, and after several weeks of uncertainty about whether he could play, he was put on injured reserve Nov. 5. Wednesday was the first time he was eligible to have his three-week practice window opened, but Gannon said Monday that it would not happen this week.

""He had more tests done this week, went out of state, got another opinion on it,"" Gannon explained. ""It's not progressing where it's gonna back sense that he can go. So he's gonna be done for the year.""

Murray first suffered the foot injury in Arizona's Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans and was treated as a week-to-week matter, but as he failed to show signs of improvement in his recovery, the ailment became an on-ramp to a larger discussion regarding the Cardinals' quarterback situation.

Initially, Murray's injury-related absence felt like a bit of a soft benching. With Murray behind center, Arizona's offense struggled consistently in 2025 and was frequently behind schedule, leading to low offensive outputs that betrayed the efforts of Gannon's improved defense and led to three straight one-possession losses in Weeks 3-5. Arizona demonstrated notable offensive improvement with veteran backup Jacoby Brissett playing in place of Murray, driving calls for Brissett to replace Murray going forward.

Although the Cardinals lost two more games by a single possession with Brissett at the controls, the veteran delivered an impressive showing in a prime-time win in Dallas in Week 9, convincing onlookers that Arizona had a better chance of victory with Brissett than Murray. Murray's eventual placement on injured reserve merely solved this conundrum while also inviting a new collection of questions regarding his future with the team.

While disappointing for the former No. 1 overall pick, Friday's news doesn't change matters for the 3-9 Cardinals in 2025. Instead, it merely guarantees Murray won't have a chance to produce an on-field counterargument to the claim his time in Arizona is dwindling.

When asked if Gannon expected Murray to be the Cardinals' starting quarterback in 2026, Gannon deflected.

""I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly,"" he said, speaking of Arizona's upcoming opponent in a game that previously represented Murray's first opportunity to return from IR.

There's plenty of reason to believe the Cardinals might move on from Murray in the spring. Arizona can't quite financially justify outright releasing Murray in 2026 because it would result in a $57.7 million dead cap hit that can be split between 2026 and 2027, a significant sum for a team that would also be in the market for a replacement at the position. If the Cardinals can find a trade partner, however, they'd carry just $17.9 million in dead cap, saving $35.3 million and making a divorce much more palatable.

In order to orchestrate a trade, the Cardinals would have to earn his approval while also negotiating a competitive deal that would convince another team to agree to a trade. For now, such an effort isn't the top priority, but it won't be long before a new Super Bowl champion is crowned and the Cardinals will need to get to work.

It's been a season filled with injuries for the Commanders. How bad has it been? According to Nicki Jhabvala of the Washington Post, should Daniels play Sunday, it would mark the first time all season that they will have their starting quarterback, top three wide receivers and full offensive line on the field together.

[NFL injury updates live]

Things aren't so rosy in Tampa Bay, where the NFC South leaders will go another week without both Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan. The wide receivers were designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday with their 21-day practice windows opening, but head coach Todd Bowles said they're not ready for this week's matchup with the New Orleans Saints.

Evans has been out since breaking his clavicle on Oct. 22. His extended absence will mean his streak of never having a season of under 1,000 receiving yards will come to an end after 11 seasons.

McMillan has not played all season after suffering a neck injury during preseason.

Other notable Week 14 injuries:

Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner has been ruled out for Week 14 with a calf injury. Gardner was seen on crutches and a walking boot after Indianapolis' loss to the Texans last Sunday, but the injury reportedly isn't as severe as feared, though he won't play against the Jaguars.

Despite needing surgery earlier this week to repair a fractured left hand, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is preparing to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. Herbert was limited Thursday in practice and told reporters afterward that doctors inserted a plate and screws into his hand to stabilize it. He also said he will likely wear a hard cast should he play.

The Minnesota Vikings expect to have J.J. McCarthy for Sunday's game against the Commanders after the quarterback cleared concussion protocol on Thursday. McCarthy was injured in Week 12's defeat to the Green Bay Packers and was ruled out for last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie Max Brosmer took his place last week and threw for 126 yards and four interceptions.

Like McCarthy, Tee Higgins sat out last week's game due to a concussion. The Cincinnati Bengals receiver was a full participant in practice on Thursday and was cleared from concussion protocol on Friday.

After appendicitis knocked him out a few weeks back, now Arizona Cardinals receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. is dealing with a heel issue that will rule him out for Week 14. Harrison sat out practice on Wednesday and Thursday due to the injury that came up during last week's game against the Buccaneers.

Murray injured his foot late in Arizona’s Oct. 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans. He has not played since then, and backup Jacoby Brissett has led the Cardinals’ offense. Murray was eligible this week to come off injured reserve but the Cardinals did not open his practice window.

“He had some more tests done this week, went out of state, got another opinion on it,” Gannon said Friday. “It’s not progressing to where it’s going to make sense that he can go. So he’s going to be done for the year.”

The decision ends perhaps the most disappointing season of Murray’s seven NFL seasons. In just five games, he completed 68.3 percent of his attempts for 962 yards and six touchdowns with three interceptions. The Week 5 home loss to the Titans in which he was injured ranks among the worst in franchise history.

It’s possible Murray has played his last game in Arizona. In his absence, the journeyman Brissett has ignited the Cardinals’ passing game, putting up better numbers and getting more playmakers involved. Wins, however, have not followed. The Cardinals (3-9) are 1-6 with Brissett and have lost four in a row entering Sunday’s home game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Asked if he expected Murray to return next season, Gannon said he is “just worried about the Rams right now.”

Murray’s future has been debated locally and nationally for months, and it will likely remain a topic of discussion into the offseason. The No. 1 pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, Murray was drafted to help take the Cardinals deep into the postseason. Instead, Murray has gone 38-48-1 as a starter. He lost his only playoff game, a 2021 blowout loss to the Rams.

Murray, 28, remains under contract through 2028 but the final year is a team option. He is owed $36.8 million next season. If he is on Arizona’s roster on March 22, his $19.5 million salary for 2027 will become fully guaranteed.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/05124914/GettyImages-2242064723-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-05 16:06:00.448096

It will be Daniels' first action since he dislocated his left (non-throwing) elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks.

Daniels returned to practice in a limited fashion last week but was not a full participant until Thursday. He followed that up by fully participating in Friday's session. From there, he was cleared to play for Sunday, Quinn said. Quinn said Daniels had a ""great week"" of practice to get ready.

Daniels, 24, has played in just six of the Commanders' 13 games this season. He suffered a knee sprain against the Green Bay Packers in Week 2 and missed two games, and in Week 7, he suffered a hamstring injury against the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game due to that injury before returning against Seattle, when he suffered his latest setback.

After Daniels, the Offensive Rookie of the Year, led Washington to a 12-5 record and the franchise's first NFC Championship Game since the 1991 season last year, this season has been a difficult one for both him and the team as a whole. Washington is just 3-9 this season, with Marcus Mariota starting in the six games Daniels has missed. Washington has dealt with several injuries on both sides of the ball, and the defense has plummeted to among the NFL's worst.

Even with the team all but eliminated from playoff contention, Quinn said last week he thought Daniels could use the reps.

""I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,"" Quinn said Nov. 24.

For a team that began the season eyeing a deep playoff run, the latest setback is significant -- but not insurmountable.","Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch is expected to miss the remainder of the season after tests confirmed he suffered a torn Achilles during Thursday night's 44-30 win over the Dallas Cowboys, according to ESPN. The third-year standout limped off in the fourth quarter and reportedly left the stadium on crutches and in a walking boot.

Branch appeared to suffer an injury in the first half but continued to play until he went down following a red-zone stop late in the game. Medical staff helped him to the sideline before he was carted to the locker room. Coach Dan Campbell offered no specifics postgame.

The extent of the injury marks a major loss for Detroit, which has leaned heavily on Branch amid mounting injuries in the secondary. The 24-year-old started all 12 games he played this season, posting 75 tackles, 2.5 sacks, nine passes defensed, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Branch was a Pro Bowl selection in 2024 and has established himself as one of Detroit's most versatile defenders since being drafted in the second round in 2023.

The Lions (8-5) currently sit just outside the playoff field but remain firmly in the hunt for a third consecutive postseason berth. They now face a critical stretch without a defensive centerpiece, though they have a 10-day window before their next game against the Los Angeles Rams.

What Branch's injury means for Detroit's playoff push

Branch's expected absence exacerbates an already depleted depth chart. Starting safety Kerby Joseph has been sidelined since Oct. 12 with a knee injury, and cornerback Terrion Arnold was lost for the year after undergoing shoulder surgery. Against Dallas, Detroit briefly dropped to its fourth- and fifth-string safeties when Thomas Harper exited early with a concussion, leaving Avonte Maddox and Daniel Thomas to finish the game.

Without Branch and others, it could force Detroit to reconfigure both its personnel and identity on the back end. He has been central to the Lions' hybrid coverages, frequently aligning in the slot, deep safety and the box. Without him, Detroit loses its most reliable tackler in space and a key pressure option in coordinator Aaron Glenn's scheme.

The Lions will likely lean on Maddox, Thomas and practice squad elevations to fill the gaps until Joseph's status changes. But the ripple effects extend further: cornerbacks may face more man coverage without Branch's ability to disguise rotations and Detroit's pass rush may need to generate quicker pressure to compensate for reduced flexibility behind it.

Dallas Cowboys @ Detroit Lions

Amon-Ra St. Brown starts despite injury: St. Brown ended up not missing a game due to his ankle injury.

St. Brown played four snaps on Thanksgiving before he suffered an ankle injury, causing him to miss the rest of the game. While the injury wasn’t deemed season-ending, he still appeared likely to miss one or two games. He didn’t practice all week but was able to go through pre-game warmups without issues and was ultimately active. The NFL Network's Ian Rapoport mentioned in the pregame show that he might not see his usual number of snaps.

The Lions targeted St. Brown on their first play of the game, and he left the field after that play. He returned for the Lions' third play and ended up playing every other offensive play for the rest of the first half.

Detroit didn’t have Kalif Raymond, who missed his second-straight game due to an ankle injury. This meant Isaac TeSlaa was the third wide receiver. Half of his receptions have been touchdowns, and that continued this week with two receptions and one touchdown. Tom Kennedy, who made his first catch in three seasons last week in St. Brown's place, was the fourth wide receiver and took a few snaps from TeSlaa during the game.

Anyone hesitant to put St. Brown back in fantasy lineups this week should have no hesitation next week, considering how much St. Brown played in this game, and the extended time off Detroit has before their next game.

The Lions make a change at tight end: Anthony Firkser started his first game since 2022, while Brock Wright was placed on injured reserve.

Sam LaPorta is on injured reserve and is unlikely to return this season. Brock Wright missed last week due to a neck injury, and Detroit opted to put him on injured reserve before this game, which will keep him out for the rest of the fantasy season.

Since Wright’s injury, Ross Dwelley had been the Lions’ primary tight end. Firkser was signed to the practice squad after LaPorta’s injury less than a month ago, and he was signed to the active roster before the Thanksgiving game with Wright out. Firkser has a history as a receiving tight end, while Dwelley has traditionally been a blocker, so it made sense that Firkser would play more in a game where Detroit focused on passing. He caught a seven-yard pass while Dwelley caught a four-yard pass.

While Firkser was the starting tight end this week, his time as the starter might be short-lived. Shane Zylstra returned to practice from injured reserve on Monday. He was limited in his first practice due to a knee injury and didn’t practice the rest of the week, but he could be the Lions' starter when he returns. He’s been with the team since 2021 and notably had three touchdowns in a game in 2022.

It’s unlikely that any Lions tight end has any value for fantasy managers over the next three weeks, but on the off-chance one does, it would most likely be Zylstra.

Monitor CeeDee Lamb’s health: Lamb suffered a concussion in the third quarter and was quickly ruled out.

Lamb has put together a very successful season, catching at least four passes for 65 yards in every game, outside of Week 3, where he only played seven snaps due to injury. He had four 110-plus-yard games before this week, including on Thanksgiving. He had reached 121 yards in this game by the Cowboys' second offensive play of the second half. He suffered the concussion two plays later on an end-zone target while trying to make a catch. There were only a few minutes between Lamb going to the medical tent and getting ruled out.

George Pickens has been the other top Cowboys wide receiver, but he had a relatively quiet night with five receptions for 37 yards. Prior to Lamb’s injury, Ryan Flournoy was playing a little more than usual, and Kavontae Turpin a little less. The Lions play man coverage at a higher rate than any other defense, and Flournoy plays better against man coverage, while Turpin plays better against zone, which could have influenced this decision. After Lamb’s injury, Flournoy and Turpin were more consistently on the field. Dallas was playing behind, so the team stuck with 11 personnel. Flournoy made the most of his opportunities, catching nine passes for 115 yards and a touchdown.

The Cowboys have 10 days until their next game, giving Lamb more time to clear the concussion protocol than most players after one week. This was Lamb’s second recorded concussion, and the first came in 2021. The Cowboys face the Minnesota Vikings next week, and they have allowed the fewest fantasy points to wide receivers. Outside of leagues with 16 or more players, it’s best to leave players like Flournoy and Turpin on the waiver wire, given the matchup.

Miscellaneous Notes

Cowboys halfback Jaydon Blue was a healthy inactive, his fifth straight absence.

Dallas wide receiver George Pickens was limited in practice on Monday due to calf and knee injuries.

Cowboys wide receiver Jonathan Mingo was active this week after being a healthy inactive last week. He takes the spot of Jalen Tolbert, who was a healthy inactive. Dallas has swapped between the two in each of their last four games.

Cowboys tight end Jake Ferguson played over 80% of Dallas' offensive snaps for the second time this season. His snap rate tends to increase when Dallas is playing from behind.

Dallas kicker Brandon Aubrey made field goals of 29, 42, 55, 57 and 63 yards, giving fantasy managers who drafted him a significant advantage this week, particularly in leagues with bonuses for longer field goals.

Lions running back David Montgomery was held under 40% of offensive snaps for the fourth straight game. He averaged 41.1% of Detroit's offensive snaps over the first 10 weeks.

Jahmyr Gibbs scored three touchdowns in this game. It was his third game with three touchdowns in the last five weeks.

Detroit running back Sione Vaki was limited in practice all week due to a thumb injury and was questionable but played.

The Lions activated wide receiver Malik Cunningham from the practice squad for this game on Thursday. This was potentially a precaution in case St. Brown couldn’t play very much. The former Baltimore Ravens quarterback/wide receiver signed with Detroit before it played Baltimore but had stuck around the practice squad since that point. He played his first NFL snap since 2023 and received his first NFL carry.

The Lions claimed tight end Hayden Rucci off waivers from the Miami Dolphins earlier in the week, but he was a healthy inactive.

The wide receivers were designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday with their 21-day practice windows opening.

But that doesn't mean they'll see action this week against the New Orleans Saints. There's still work to be done and, at least in Evans' case, he'll likely have a slow roll out when he is back in action.

""Yeah, I think so,"" said Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard about a potential pitch count for Evans. ""I think the same plan we had with Chris [Godwin] and really the same thought with Buck [Irving] as well, where when these guys are back to be able to expect them to play a full game like they normally would, wouldn't be fair to him.

""But be able to bring him along and to allow his play strength to build up. Not that Mike needs confidence, but it's more of the stamina and his strength.""

Evans has been out since breaking his clavicle on Oct. 22. His extended absence will mean his streak of never having a season of under 1,000 receiving yards will come to an end after 11 seasons.

[NFL injury updates live]

McMillan has not played all season after suffering a neck injury during preseason.

Week 14 could see the possible return of Jayden Daniels under center for the Washington Commanders. The second-year quarterback was a full practice participant on Thursday, the first time he's done so since dislocating his elbow in Week 9.

Daniels returned to practice last week, but he was limited and ultimately ruled out for a ""Sunday Night Football"" showdown with the Denver Broncos.

Head coach Dan Quinn has yet to say whether Daniels will return this weekend or Marcus Mariota will get another start.

It's been a season filled with injuries for the Commanders. How bad has it been? According to Nicki Jhabvala of the Washington Post, should Daniels play Sunday it would mark the first time all season that they will have their starting quarterback, top three wide receivers and full offensive line on the field together.

Other notable Week 14 injuries:

Despite needing surgery earlier this week to repair a fractured left hand, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is preparing to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. Herbert was limited Thursday in practice and told reporters afterward that doctors inserted a plate and screws into his hand to stabilize it. He also said he will likely wear a hard cast should he play.

The Minnesota Vikings expect to have J.J. McCarthy for Sunday's game against the Commanders after the quarterback cleared concussion protocol on Thursday. McCarthy was injured in Week 12's defeat to the Green Bay Packers and was ruled out for last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie Max Brosmer took his place last week and threw for 126 yards and four interceptions.

Like McCarthy, Tee Higgins sat out last week's game due to a concussion. The Cincinnati Bengals receiver was a full participant, however, in Thursday's practice, a signal he could be back Sunday against the Buffalo Bills.

After appendicitis knocked him out a few weeks back, now Arizona Cardinals receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. is dealing with a heel issue that is threatening his Week 14 status. Harrison sat out practice on Wednesday and Thursday due to the issue that came up during last week's game against the Buccaneers. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Harrison was going to see a doctor about the injury and that he is considered ""day-to-day.""

“There was some runs out there where I got drove back where I wasn’t making no effect on the play,” Carter said afterward.
The Eagles’ defensive EPA per play changes drastically when Carter is on the field (0.12) and off the field (-0.14), per TruMedia.
The spotlight on the Eagles’ interior defensive line will be on Moro Ojomo and Jordan Davis, who are the top players with Carter sidelined.
Ojomo already plays 65 percent of the defensive snaps; Davis plays 62 percent of the defensive snaps.","Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter underwent a procedure on both shoulders and will miss Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, a league source confirmed Thursday.

Carter’s recovery is considered week-to-week, with the goal of having the defensive lineman fully healthy by the playoffs.

Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio confirmed Tuesday that Carter had been playing through shoulder ailments.

Carter was self-critical of his play in last week’s loss to the Chicago Bears, in which D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai helped combine for the most rushing yards against the Eagles since 2015 (281).

“There was some runs out there where I got drove back where I wasn’t making no effect on the play,” Carter said afterward.

Carter, a 2024 Pro Bowl player, is the fulcrum of Philadelphia’s defensive front. His absence is significant. The Eagles’ defensive EPA per play changes drastically when Carter is on the field (0.12) and off the field (-0.14), per TruMedia.

The Eagles use their interior linemen as leverage to generate backfield pressure. Carter’s one-game suspension in Week 1 against the Dallas Cowboys contributed to their defensive struggles in that game (the Cowboys averaged 5.4 yards per rush).

Byron Young, a three-year veteran, is in a position to backfill Carter’s snaps. Ty Robinson, a fourth-round rookie, could also contribute.

Who will be asked to fill the void?

The spotlight on the Eagles’ interior defensive line will be on Moro Ojomo and Jordan Davis, who are the top players with Carter sidelined.

Ojomo has been one of the Eagles’ most productive pass rushers this season and is tied for the team lead with four sacks. Davis is known mainly for his run-stopping, but he’s also raised his performance against the pass rush.

Although Byron Young and rookie Ty Robinson will take on bigger roles, the key for the Eagles will be Ojomo and Davis. Ojomo already plays 65 percent of the defensive snaps; Davis plays 62 percent of the defensive snaps.

Don’t be surprised to see the Eagles bounce Brandon Graham inside on passing downs. It hasn’t been a staple of Fangio’s defenses because of the depth at defensive tackle, but they’ve tinkered with it in recent weeks, and it would make sense given the presence of Jaelan Phillips, Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Graham has had success in his career as an interior rusher.

“We could play him in there more,” Fangio said two weeks ago after he was used in that role against Dallas. “He can rush pretty good from in there. We were playing a lot of plays, and guys needed a break.” — Zach Berman, Eagles senior writer",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/19002319/USATSI_27425678-scaled-e1763529820750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-05 11:09:04.148243

His mindset is just he refuses to fail,"" Campbell said of St. Brown.
I'm thankful,"" St. Brown said.","DETROIT -- Unable to walk just last week because of an ankle injury, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown said he was willing to do ""whatever it takes to be out there"" against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday night.

St. Brown, who was officially ruled active in the hours leading up to kickoff, finished with six receptions for 92 yards, including a crucial fourth-quarter catch that helped seal the Lions' 44-30 win against the Cowboys while keeping their playoff chances alive.

He said he didn't know until Wednesday whether he was going to play through his ankle sprain.

""No matter what our record was, whether we were undefeated right now or didn't have a win, I was going to do everything to be out there,"" St. Brown said. ""Just to be out there for my guys.

""I feel like availability is your best ability at the end of the day, so my job is to go out there and make plays and be on that field. It's what they pay me to do, so I was going to do whatever it takes to be out there.""

St. Brown didn't practice in the week leading up to Thursday night's pivotal game, which matched two teams battling for playoff contention with five games left in the season.

""I just rested it, honestly. Those types of injuries, you can't really do much,"" St. Brown said. ""You've got to rest it. I was in the training room a lot. The training did a great job doing all different types of modalities and things like that, but, yeah, [last] Friday after the game, I couldn't move.""

St. Brown hurt his ankle during the opening quarter of Detroit's 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day and didn't return. Initially, Lions coach Dan Campbell said he thought St. Brown could be out for a week or two, but the receiver progressed quicker than expected with the help of the team's training staff.

""He's rare, man. His mindset is just he refuses to fail,"" Campbell said of St. Brown. ""Nothing is going to dictate where he goes, what he does, how it's going to be. He will dictate to himself what he's going to do.""

After Thursday night's win, St. Brown exited the locker room with a commemorative game ball after establishing a new record for the most receptions (511) through five seasons in NFL history, a mark that previously belonged to Michael Thomas (510).

""I'm happy for this. I'm thankful,"" St. Brown said. ""Thankful to all the guys ... Jared [Goff], coaches, O-line, just everyone. I couldn't do it without them.""

Detroit's odds to make the playoffs improved from 43% to 56% with the win, according to ESPN Analytics. It remained in eighth place in the NFC.

The Lions have won 15 consecutive games following a loss, which is tied for the longest streak in NFL history, also done by 1984-88 Broncos and 2009-12 Ravens. They haven't lost consecutive games since a five-game losing streak in 2022.

""I think it is a kind of culmination of who we are. I don't think that happens on accident,"" said Goff, who went 25-for-34 with 309 passing yards and a touchdown. ""It's who we are, it's what we believe in.

""I think when those losses happen, they suck, but we do as good a job as any team of learning from that and coming back the next week and putting our head down.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1205%2Fr1585063_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 07:01:46.947269

The research team set out to answer a simple but important question: Do career length or playing position predict long-term health in former NFL athletes? Their findings show they do not. Although these measures are often used as stand-ins for head injury exposure, they didn't help identify which players experienced worse mental or physical health later in life. The study suggests that future research and potentially future health guidelines in sports should rely on confirmed concussion history rather than assumptions based on position or years in the league.

It is often thought that certain positions are at higher risk of sustaining concussion, which may be related to shorter playing careers and worse long-term health outcomes, but that's not what we found.""

ESPN was the first to report the news that Carter is having a procedure, not surgery, on both of his shoulders. It is an injury that has plagued Carter since the beginning of training camp.

An NFL source confirmed Carter's injury.

It's not known how long Carter will be out, but the report indicates that Carter won't be placed on injured reserve, meaning that the Eagles could get him back before the end of the regular season.

Still, Carter could miss more than one game.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

Carter missed the first three days of training camp in July because of the shoulder. He missed a game against the Giants on Oct. 9, but that was because of a heel injury.

For the most part, he was playing his usual allotment of about 85-95% of the defensive snaps.

That is, until the Eagles' most recent game, on Nov. 28 against the Bears. Carter only played 70% of the snaps in that game.

Carter did not have one of his better games as the Bears rushed for 281 yards, the most the Eagles had allowed in 10 years.

""There were some runs out there I got drove back and wasn’t able to have an effect on the play,"" Carter said after the game. ""We kind of made an adjustment, if you saw who was playing first and second down then third down, and we just went from there.""

Later, Carter said: ""It’s my problem to deal with. I won’t tell you what I’m going through.""

Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, however, admitted on Dec. 3 that Carter was dealing with a shoulder injury.

""He does have a shoulder issue,"" Fangio said. ""He has been playing with it. Late in the game, he had a great play with it, but it's definitely something there.""

The Lions will get some extra days off before a massive showdown against another NFC West playoff hopeful next week...

The playoff window is not closed, but it took a major hit Thursday night. A win would’ve pretty much allowed the Cowboys to control their playoff hopes. After this loss, their chances drop to 40 percent — if they win their remaining four games. This loss shouldn’t completely take away from what they’ve accomplished over the previous three games, beating the Chiefs and Eagles.

But it does show that there’s still a lot that needs to be cleaned up. Special teams was subpar, particularly in their kickoff coverage. The Detroit starting field position average was pretty much midfield. The run defense was the worst it has been since adding Quinnen Williams. Defensive help is obviously still needed, particularly on the back end. But there also wasn’t nearly enough pressure on Jared Goff. I do wonder how the game would have gone if CeeDee Lamb didn’t exit with the concussion.

If the Lions lost this game, their playoff hopes would’ve fallen from 30 percent to 12 percent. Dallas would’ve passed the Lions in the standings. The Lions are now 8-5 and the playoff push is very much alive. The Athletic’s playoff simulator gives the Lions a 45 percent chance at the moment. If the Lions can win three of their final four games, it should be enough to get them in. Easier said than done, and there’s still work to do, but this was a huge step in the right direction.

The Cowboys were heating up at the right time, winning three of their previous four games. Their offense was already among the best in the league. Their defense had tightened things up after some high-quality deadline additions. They looked like a dangerous team, while the Lions were limping into Week 14 — losing three of their previous five contests.

But there’s something about this team when pushed to the brink. They tend to hunker down and rise to the occasion. We haven’t seen it much this season, but we did tonight. This was a gutsy performance by the Lions, in a game they absolutely needed. The offense was brilliant, en route to a 44-point outing. The defense got home five times, and recorded three turnovers. It wasn’t always pretty, but they took care of business.

As Saad alludes to below, the numbers on The Athletic’s NFL Playoff simulator really aren’t in the Cowboys’ favor after tonight’s loss.

A win would have punctuated Dallas’ late-season surge by boosting the Cowboys’ playoff chances all the way up to 41 percent. The loss, however, tumbles them down to 9 percent. Another loss would essentially end what faint postseason hope the Cowboys still have, diminishing those odds down further to just 1 percent.

Tonight was a season-saver for the Lions. Don’t take my word for hit — ask The Athletic’s NFL Playoff Simulator.

Detroit entered tonight with just a 30 percent chance to return to the postseason. A loss to the Cowboys would have dimished those odds to just 12 percent. But the Lions’ win has boosted their playoff chances to 45 percent, nearly a coin flip. Detroit does have a tough schedule to close out the season, including games against the Rams, Steelers, Vikings and Bears.

Jahmyr Gibbs entered tonight’s game tied with Hall of Famer Randy Moss for the second-most touchdowns in NFL history before his 24th birthday (44). The only name ahead of Gibbs on that list? Another Hall of Famer, legendary Lions running back Barry Sanders — who, as he often is, was in attendance at Ford Field tonight.

And all Gibbs did in front of the Lions’ biggest icon was score three touchdowns to surge past Moss and tie Sanders for the record. Barring injury, he’s a good bet to break that mark very soon.

After suffering a sprained ankle one week ago on Thanksgiving, which made him a game-time decision tonight, Amon-Ra St. Brown showed no ill effects of that injury. St. Brown had 92 receiving yards on six catches, punctuated by two chunk plays — both massive catch-and-runs off intermediate slant or post routes.

One was a 26-yard catch-and-run in the first quart. The other was a 37-yard catch-and-run that effectively iced the game in the fourth quarter. Both set up Jahmyr Gibbs touchdowns, the first and last Lions scores of their 44-point night.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/09njoQZnCm6o_rqaxGCEBA0Kh_1440x960.png",N,,2025-12-05 02:58:33.321847

Trailing 27-9 in the third quarter, the Cowboys were driving and hoping to get back into the game. Dak Prescott lofted a pass up for CeeDee Lamb in the end zone, but the receiver wasn't able to brace his fall.

Lamb was down on the field for a few extra moments before getting up. He received some help from the trainers, bracing his left arm.

He also hit his head on the turf, which proved to be the injury that forced him out. After being checked out on the sidelines, Lamb headed off to the locker room, and was quickly ruled out after that.

Here's the latest on Lamb.

CeeDee Lamb injury update

Lamb has been ruled out with a concussion.

It initially appeared that Lamb was dealing with an arm injury, but it was his head hitting the turf that proved to be the problem.

He appeared to be favoring his left arm after falling in the end zone. Lamb remained down for a few moments, but did walk off the field with trainers holding his arm.

Lamb was evaluated by doctors for about three minutes before quickly being ruled out and taken to the locker room, per the Prime Video broadcast. It was a quick diagnosis from the Cowboys, who will be without Lamb for the remainder of the game.

What is concussion protocol in the NFL?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player has to clear before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia and more, in addition to history of concussions, other signs/symptoms and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.

That's why Daniel Jones has consulted with a pair of his college teammates who have created a special 3D-printed pad to better protect his injured leg.

“I’m lucky to have smart friends,” Jones joked to reporters on Wednesday. “It’s pretty low-profile and fits to my leg pretty well. I don’t really notice it.”

Clark Bulleit, a former Duke center, and Kevin Gehsmann, an ex-linebacker for the Blue Devils, have helped Jones before in a similar situation. In 2018, they created a pad for Jones after he fractured his collarbone during a game against Northwestern.

Bulleit and Gehsmann majored in mechanical and biomedical engineering and now run Protect3D, a company that makes custom-printed 3D braces and orthotics. After Jones suffered the fracture in his lower leg last month, his former Duke teammates created a thin pad that goes under the left leg of his football pants. He's worn it in each of the past two weeks.

All Bulleit and Gehsmann needed to create the pad was a 60-second scan that led to a 90-minute design process. A day and a half later, the pad was delivered to Jones the night before the Colts’ 23-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

“I think they had the idea before [the collarbone injury], but I was the first pad that they printed that was played with,” Jones said Wednesday. “They were starting up that business and had had the idea about it my last year at Duke.

“And since then, they’ve built a pretty good business, 3D printing those devices and pads. Kinda funny that I’m using one of them again, but they’re smart guys. I’m lucky to have smart friends.”

The Colts have five games remaining in the regular season, three of them against AFC South foes — two against the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Houston Texans in Week 18.

Tied with the Jaguars atop the division at 8-4 and just ahead of the 7-5 Texans, earning one of the AFC's top four seeds will be a tough assignment. Missing out on a division crown could result in missing the playoffs entirely.

He compared to the testing that has led to new standards for helmets.“It’s sort of a red, yellow, green effect, where we’re obviously trying to phase out fields that we have determined to be less ideal than newer fields coming into the industry,” he said. “This is a big step for us. This is something that I think has been a great outcome from the Joint Service Committee of the work, the deployment and development of devices determining the appropriate metrics, and ultimately providing us with a way to substantiate the quality of fields more so than we ever have in the past.”Pappas said fields have been tested in labs and on site using two main tools with one called the BEAST that is a traction testing device that replicates the movements of an NFL player and another called the STRIKE Impact Tester that helps determine the firmness of each field.The goal of the league is to find fields that are as consistent as possible across all 30 NFL stadiums, as well as at each stadium throughout the season. Pappas said the “key pillars” for a field are optimized playability, reducing injury risk and player feedback.The NFL has no plans to require natural grass fields across the league with the league's chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills saying there is no “statistically significant differences” in lower extremity injuries or concussions that can be attributed to the type of playing surface or a specific surface despite widespread preferences from players for grass fields and complaints about surfaces such as the one at MetLife Stadium where the New York Giants and Jets play.“The surface is only one driver of these lower extremity injuries,” Sills said. “There are a lot of other factors, including player load and previous history and fatigue and positional adaptability and cleats that are worn. So surfaces are a component, but it is a complex equation, and so I’m excited about where we are in the work because I think we’ll get away from a very crude measurement of artificial here and the grass here, and now we can say for any individual surface, let’s look at the biophysical properties of that surface. How might those correlate with injury? And then, obviously, how do we optimize them?”Pappas also shared plans for the Super Bowl to be held on Feb. 8 at the San Francisco 49ers home at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The field has been growing at a sod farm about two hours east of the Bay Area with Pappas making several visits over the past 18 months to monitor the field.The league will plan to install the field around the third week in January — or later if the 49ers could be hosting playoff games.

This is something that I think has been a great outcome from the Joint Service Committee of the work, the deployment and development of devices determining the appropriate metrics, and ultimately providing us with a way to substantiate the quality of fields more so than we ever have in the past.”

Pappas said fields have been tested in labs and on site using two main tools with one called the BEAST that is a traction testing device that replicates the movements of an NFL player and another called the STRIKE Impact Tester that helps determine the firmness of each field.

The goal of the league is to find fields that are as consistent as possible across all 30 NFL stadiums, as well as at each stadium throughout the season. Pappas said the “key pillars” for a field are optimized playability, reducing injury risk and player feedback.

The NFL has no plans to require natural grass fields across the league with the league's chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills saying there is no “statistically significant differences” in lower extremity injuries or concussions that can be attributed to the type of playing surface or a specific surface despite widespread preferences from players for grass fields and complaints about surfaces such as the one at MetLife Stadium where the New York Giants and Jets play.

“The surface is only one driver of these lower extremity injuries,” Sills said. “There are a lot of other factors, including player load and previous history and fatigue and positional adaptability and cleats that are worn. So surfaces are a component, but it is a complex equation, and so I’m excited about where we are in the work because I think we’ll get away from a very crude measurement of artificial here and the grass here, and now we can say for any individual surface, let’s look at the biophysical properties of that surface. How might those correlate with injury? And then, obviously, how do we optimize them?”

Pappas also shared plans for the Super Bowl to be held on Feb. 8 at the San Francisco 49ers home at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The field has been growing at a sod farm about two hours east of the Bay Area with Pappas making several visits over the past 18 months to monitor the field.

The league will plan to install the field around the third week in January — or later if the 49ers could be hosting playoff games.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ap26931f1a8805d4.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.847xh;0,0.153xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-05 02:58:39.372247

The Washington Commanders, meanwhile, could be in position to see their starting quarterback return on Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings, as Jayden Daniels was a full participant in Thursday's practice as he recovers from a gruesome elbow injury suffered in Week 9. Washington is hoping to end a seven-game losing streak dating back to Week 6.

Elsewhere, Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans returned to practice Wednesday after breaking his clavicle in October. Evans reportedly healed faster than expected and will have his 21-day practice window opened, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

The Cleveland Browns, meanwhile, are designating Deshaun Watson to return to practice. This designation opens Watson's 21-day window for the team to decide whether or not he's healthy enough to be activated. Since being traded to Cleveland from Houston, Watson has played in just 19 games, primarily due to an 11-game suspension handed down by the NFL following multiple sexual misconduct allegations and injuries.

The Kansas City Chiefs revealed some rough news Wednesday as left tackle Josh Simmons is going on injured reserve after having surgery on his left wrist, head coach Andy Reid told reporters. Simmons, whom the Chiefs selected in the first round of this year's draft, previously missed four games this season because of an undisclosed family matter.

Lamar Jackson has started five consecutive games for the Ravens since being knocked out three weeks by a hamstring injury. However, the 28-year-old quarterback has been dealing with nagging leg injuries in recent weeks, and he has missed practice as a result of them.

Jackson's practice routine changed ahead of Week 14, as he missed Thursday's session because of an ankle problem. Does that signal a change in his status moving forward?

Here's what to know about Jackson's latest missed practice session and where the team would turn if he can't play in Week 14.

Will Lamar Jackson play Week 14?

Jackson's status for the Ravens' Week 14 game against the Steelers remains unclear. He was a limited participant in practice before being downgraded to a non-participant in Thursday's session, per multiple reports, casting doubt about his ability to suit up for the rivalry contest.

It's worth noting that Jackson has missed at least one practice session per week dating back to Week 11. Each time, he has been listed on Baltimore's practice report with a knee or ankle problem but has not carried any injury designation into game day.

That said, Jackson's absences from practice have typically come during the team's first session of the week. He missed the Ravens' Wednesday practices in Weeks 11 and 12 before being a full participant at the Thursday and Friday sessions. The two-time MVP followed a similar pattern ahead of Baltimore's Thanksgiving game against the Cincinnati Bengals, earning a non-participation tag Monday before returning fully Tuesday and Wednesday.

So, at the very least, the change in Jackson's practice pattern is notable. It will also make his status at Friday's practice worth watching, as what he's able to accomplish will be the best barometer of whether he will be able to play Week 14 against the Steelers.

Who is the Ravens' backup quarterback?

Tyler Huntley is the Ravens' backup quarterback and would get the nod if Jackson isn't able to play in Week 14.

Huntley, 27, won his lone start of the 2025 NFL season, which came in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears. He has completed 27 of 37 passes (73%) for 254 yards and a touchdown across two appearances while adding 92 rushing yards on 11 carries.

Huntley has posted a career record of 6-9 across 15 starts while completing 65.2% of his passes for 3,040 yards, 12 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The 27-year-old – nicknamed ""Snoop"" – spent the 2025 NFL preseason with the Cleveland Browns before rejoining the Ravens for his third stint since signing in Baltimore as an undrafted free agent in 2020.

Ravens QB depth chart

The Ravens have three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. Below is the pecking order within the unit:

Lamar Jackson

Tyler Huntley

Cooper Rush

The Ravens signed Rush to a two-year, $6.2 million contract during the 2025 NFL offseason to back up Jackson. The longtime Dallas Cowboys backup started two games in place of Jackson after the star quarterback's hamstring injury and struggled, completing 65.4% of his passes for 303 yards, no touchdowns and four interceptions.

Rush's struggles allowed Huntley to leapfrog him for the backup role. The 32-year-old has a 9-7 career record and has completed 61.1% of his career passes for 3,766 yards, 20 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/04/USAT/87607623007-lamar-jackson-ravens-120425.jpg?crop=5104,2873,x0,y56&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-04 20:01:43.377307

The Lions (7-5, 3rd in NFC North) are taking on the Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1, 2nd in NFC East) on Thursday, Dec. 4, at Ford Field in Detroit with big NFC playoff implications potentially on the line. The Lions have had a tough week with center Frank Ragnow's re-retirement and cornerback Terrion Arnold's addition to the injured reserve list, and major questions about whether the Lions will make the playoffs (they're currently out).

St. Brown, who didn't practice this week as he recovered from an ankle injury suffered in the Lions' 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day, is ready to play after a good pregame workout.

However, the Lions will be without starting left guard Kayode Awosika, who was downgraded from questionable to out hours before kickoff.

With the Lions likely needing to win at least four of their last five games to make the playoffs, they probably can't afford many more injuries if they want to see the postseason, much less make a run toward Super Bowl 60.

We'll have all the live injury updates from the Lions-Cowboys game below.

Cowboys inactives

The Cowboys listed six players on their inactives list, most notably defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, who has four sacks over nine games so far in 2025.

Lions inactives

The Lions have six players listed on the inactive list, including safety Kerby Joseph and offensive lineman Kayode Awosika. It's unclear who will start in Awosika's place, though offensive lineman Trystan Colon could be an option now that starting center Graham Glasgow will be returning.

As previously reported, Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is active and expected to play.

I see a guy that's battling little nagging injuries, things that are stopping him from being able to get out there every day and practice.""

Jackson was limited on Wednesday and then didn't participate Thursday, which is three days from the Ravens' battle with the Steelers for first place in the AFC North.

This marks the fourth straight week where Jackson has been sidelined for at least one practice. During that stretch, Jackson has been mired in a career-worst worst slump by going three straight games without producing a touchdown.

In Jackson's last game - a 32-14 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving night - Jackson committed a season-high three turnovers and completed a season-low 53.1% of his passes (17-of-32).

Monken said it's ""hard to judge"" how much the missed practice time has impacted Jackson's recent performances. This season, Jackson has dealt with a growing list of injuries: hamstring, knee, toe and ankle.

Ravens tight end Mark Andrews indicated he's there for Jackson during his struggles but added that Jackson doesn't really need anyone's support.

""He is Lamar Jackson. He is that great of a player,"" Andrews said. ""I have full confidence in him always and forever.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1030%2Fr1568505_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 20:02:13.739379

Two of the Eagles' All-Pro linemen did not participate in Thursday's practice ahead of the Monday night showdown with the Los Angeles Chargers.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter was sidelined with injuries to both shoulders. Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio noted that Carter was dealing with the injury during his Wednesday press conference.

""He does have a shoulder issue. He has been playing with it. Late in the game (against the Bears), he had a great play with it, but it's definitely something there,"" Fangio said.

Fangio added that rookie defensive tackle Ty Robinson may factor more into the line rotation due to Carter's injury. The third-round pick has been on the field for 35 defensive snaps this year.

Offensive tackle Lane Johnson was the only other Eagle to miss practice on Thursday. He has missed the past two games with a foot injury. Fred Johnson started in Johnson's absence.

Safety Marcus Epps returned to practice for the first time since being placed on Injured Reserve with a shoulder ailment on November 1. The seventh-year veteran played in eight games this season, but was previously a starter for the Eagles in his first tenure with the team. From 2020-23, Epps started in 28 games, including playoffs. Epps would need to be activated off Injured Reserve by Monday at 4 PM in order to be eligible to play against the Chargers. The Eagles elevated Andre' Sam from the practice squad last week with safety Andrew Mukuba going on Injured Reserve.

Wide receiver/punt returner Xavier Gipson returned to practice in a limited capacity for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury against the Cowboys on November 23.

What's the latest on Justin Herbert?

Quarterback Justin Herbert was limited in practice on Thursday as he recovers from surgery to stabilize a fracture in his left (non-throwing) hand that took place on Monday. Herbert suffered the injury during the first quarter of Sunday's win over the Raiders. He exited the game for eight plays, but returned after the hand was placed in a cast with a glove over it. The Chargers protected Herbert by only running plays for him out of the shotgun and pistol formations.

Trey Lance replaced Herbert for the brief period on Sunday. He is taking the first-team reps in Herbert's absence.

Despite the limited designation on Thursday, the Chargers have expressed optimism that Herbert will play Monday night against the Eagles.

""Yeah, that's the plan. To prepare as if I'm going to play,"" Herbert said on Wednesday, according to Chargers.com. Head Coach Jim Harbaugh and Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman have expressed similar sentiments in press conferences this week.

It remains to be seen whether rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton will return to action against the Eagles. Hampton was a limited participant on Thursday. Reports indicate he was wearing a non-contact jersey at practice. Hampton was placed on Injured Reserve on October 8 after fracturing his left ankle against the Washington Commanders. His 21-day practice window opened on November 25. Hampton has 314 rushing yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.8 yards per carry, this season. He also has 20 catches for 136 yards through the air.

Wide receiver Quentin Johnston was limited with a shoulder injury. He was seen at practice with a non-contact jersey. He leads the Chargers with seven touchdown receptions this season.

Pivotal night for the NFC

Barring a tie, the result of “Thursday Night Football” will drastically shape the remainder of 2025 for both teams.

If Detroit wins: Its playoff odds jump to 46 percent, while the Cowboys’ chances fall to 9 percent, all but eliminating them.

If Dallas wins: Its odds bump up to 41 percent, and the Lions drop to a nearly elimination-level 13 percent.

Campbell’s Lions are three-point home favorites in the game beginning at 8:15 p.m. ET on Prime Video. Here’s what I’m watching for:

Detroit’s high-powered offense, sans stars. Tight end Sam LaPorta is on the IR, while star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) missed every practice this week and likely sits. Expect the Lions to lean heavily on Jahmyr Gibbs and Jameson Williams while rookie receiver Isaac TeSlaa gets more looks.

Dallas’ passing offense. The Cowboys’ passer rating is below average against Cover 1 defenses, and the Lions lean heavily on that physical, press-heavy style due to their talented secondary, which has allowed the fewest yards of separation in the NFL. But George Pickens doesn’t need separation, and should be peppered with targets tonight.

The Lions defensive line. Detroit must get more from this group. As our Lions beat writer Colton Pouncy explained, Detroit has the slowest time to pressure in the NFL and is allowing the fifth-highest explosive pass rate for opposing quarterbacks when under pressure. Prescott has led the league in yards per dropback when pressured.

The Cowboys’ improved run defense. Defensive tackle Quinnen Williams has transformed everything. Allowing 1.83 yards before contact (29th) from Weeks 1 to 9, this group now allows a league-best 0.32, having successfully limited Saquon Barkley (2.2 yards per carry) and Ashton Jeanty (1.2). The interior of Detroit’s offensive line is its weakest link, and that’s where Dallas is strongest.

Winners of three straight, the Cowboys have the momentum and maybe the talent edge, given Detroit is also missing All-Pro safety Kerby Joseph. I’ll take Dallas by six. Let the upsets continue.

For more, my colleagues Jon Machota and Colton Pouncy, who cover these two teams, shared an insightful game preview here. Over to Dianna for a word on 2026 coaching candidates.

What Dianna’s Hearing: Few standouts so far

Last January, Ben Johnson and Mike Vrabel were at the top of every team’s head-coaching wishlist. Through 13 weeks, it’s easy to see why. Johnson and Vrabel have the Bears and Patriots atop their respective conferences in December.

So who could be the 2026 hot-shot candidate? We’re still waiting for that name to emerge.

I would expect Kansas City offensive coordinator (and former Bears head coach) Matt Nagy to garner interest.

Same for veteran defensive coordinators Lou Anarumo (Colts) and Robert Saleh (49ers).

Younger defensive names, including the Jaguars’ Anthony Campanile and the Rams’ Chris Shula, could generate buzz as well.

I’ll be interested to see if the Giants make a call to Washington, looking into whether Kliff Kingsbury wants to work with a different young NFC East quarterback: Jaxson Dart.

From what I can gather, at this point in the cycle, no candidate has separated themselves from the pack quite yet. Back to you, Jacob.

Burrow and Herbert: Tough as they come

Andrew Luck felt invincible, until he wasn’t. His shocking retirement came at age 29, after six seasons, 86 regular-season games and 174 sacks, with a swath of punishing injuries to show for it.

Could Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert relate?

The 28-year-old Burrow has taken 28 more sacks than Luck in 14 fewer games, and he’s had at least four significant injuries across six seasons, ranging from a shredded knee as a rookie to a significant turf-toe injury this year.

In six seasons with the Chargers, the (somehow still only) 27-year-old Herbert’s taken seven more sacks than Burrow, albeit in more games. Among other injuries, Herbert’s broken his collarbone, fractured a rib, broken some fingers and, just last week, broken a bone in the back of his non-throwing hand.

Yet Herbert’s only missed four games in his career (Burrow’s missed 23, though that isn’t meant to imply he should’ve played without, you know, a knee), and threw a touchdown right after the latest break. As my colleague Daniel Popper wrote in his story on how Herbert plans to play on Monday, just days after ongoing surgery to stabilize the fracture, the Chargers quarterback is a fighter.

💬 “He fractured his rib cartilage in Week 2 of 2022 and played the next week. He suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 2 of last year and played the next week. Herbert broke his left middle finger in Week 4 of 2023 and did not miss a game.”

As for Burrow, how back is he? The 4-8 Bengals’ franchise quarterback made an emotional return on Thanksgiving, winning despite completing just 52.2 percent of his passes. In Derrik Klassen’s Quick Outs column, he explains that the league’s second-highest-paid player was rusty, for sure, but was better than that completion percentage suggests.

💬 “Truthfully, I was worried that Burrow had rushed back and wouldn’t look stable in the pocket right away. That couldn’t have been further from the truth. Burrow far outplayed his simple counting stats. Maybe it’s too little, too late for that version of him to turn the Bengals’ season around, but it’s nice to see him play at that level nonetheless.”

Tomorrow, we’ll preview the weekend’s biggest games. For more on that, Austin Mock shares six games that could shape the 2025 postseason, all occurring this week.

McCarthy cleared concussion protocol Thursday, his final step in returning to the starting lineup in time for Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders.

McCarthy suffered the concussion during a 23-6 loss in Week 12 to the Green Bay Packers and missed last week's 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Speaking Thursday with local reporters, he said he couldn't specify a play that caused the injury.

""Every single game kind of feels like you get kicked in the face by a donkey,"" McCarthy said amid a season in which he has missed as many games (six) because of injuries as he has played.

The Vikings hope McCarthy can remain in the lineup for their final five regular-season games as they look ahead to 2026 roster decisions. Coach Kevin O'Connell said this week that he has abandoned his seasonlong focus on McCarthy's mechanics and instead wants him to concentrate on decision-making and avoiding the kind of open-field contact that caused his two major injuries this year -- a high right ankle sprain in Week 2 and the concussion.

""There will be time to fundamentally focus on things and continue building this layer and a foundation that will be important for him into the future,"" O'Connell said. ""But now it feels like he's got enough experience. He knows a lot of these principles that we've talked about. I want him to have a clear head and a clear mind to just go play, but play with an understanding of the decisions that I make with the ball in my hand, the decisions that I make as a passer, and as we've learned, very important as a runner to protect himself and make sure that we can keep him in there.""

McCarthy said Thursday that he's a ""natural overthinker."" While making clear that he does not blame the coaching staff for pushing him hard on mechanics and footwork during the season, he said his concern about it falls ""into the bucket"" of overthinking.

""Just worrying about things,"" he said of how the focus on mechanics might have affected him. ""Like on the 12th hole, you're not going to switch up your golf swing and stuff like that. But there's always ways to refine it. There's always little mental cues that you're going to take throughout that game. But yeah, the mechanics thing ... it's always going to be a continued process to grow and be as efficient as possible.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1109%2Fr1573232_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:05:58.643338

Carter will continue to undergo treatment on his shoulders and hopes to be as close to 100% as possible for the playoffs.

This season hasn't been as productive for Carter, though. In 10 games, Carter tallied 2.0 sacks and four tackles for loss. He has, however, batted down six passes which ties his single-season high that was set last year.

On top of the thumbs-up list is left tackle Dion Dawkins who was listed as a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice. Sure, it was a walkthrough, but he wasn’t far enough along in the NFL’s concussion protocol to even do that much last week. Technically, the nine-year veteran could be a full participant on Thursday if he’s still symptom free. Dawkins could also stay limited all week, go through a simulated practice on Saturday, and be cleared to play. No matter how it goes, Dawkins participating on Wednesday is a very good sign.

Right tackle Spencer Brown’s shoulder injury had him inactive all of last week. Like Dawkins, he’s now progressed to limited work. It’s a good sign that he won’t miss too much time, but I would be a little more cautious on assuming he will play Sunday. It would be nice to think that some light work this week coupled with a harness at game time would have him good to go — but if he’s not 100%, having Alec Anderson for a second week in there is a more-than-adequate option.

Other good news for Buffalo is that tight end Dalton Kincaid was listed as a limited participant on Wednesday. The tight end has missed the past three weeks after suffering a hamstring injury in the Bills’ loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 10. However, the positivity surrounding Kincaid’s practice participation should be hampered a little by the fact that Buffalo are now listing him with two injuries. He’s now being treated for a knee injury as well as the hamstring issues.

Not practicing for the Bills were Joey Bosa, Joshua Palmer, and Terrel Bernard. Bernard continues to deal with the elbow injury he suffered in Week 12. It would be great to see him back, but veteran linebacker Shaq Thompson is doing just fine in the MIKE position, so Buffalo taking their time with the fourth-year linebacker is warranted.

Both Bosa and Palmer have had injuries, but now each have additional ones. Palmer suffered his knee and ankle injury in Week 6 when the Bills played in Atlanta. After missing three games, Palmer was back on the field for Week 11. However, after two games, he was back out with an ankle injury again this Sunday. Now, once again, he’s listed as dealing with both the knee and ankle injury. Don’t be surprised if you see the Bills shut him down with a trip to Injured Reserve soon. Reading the tea leaves from head coach Sean McDermott don’t sound as promising as one might hope:

Bosa has had a wrist injury, and he’s played with a club-style cast/wrap for weeks. But on Sunday, while pursuing Steelers’ quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Bosa suffered a hamstring injury. When asked before practice on Wednesday, McDermott said that he would consider Bosa as week-to-week. McDermott went on to clarify that there’s “two ways” of viewing that: either 1-2 weeks, or 3-4 weeks. McDermott said he’s hoping for the former. In Bills coach speak: Don’t expect to see Bosa chasing quarterbacks Joe Burrow this weekend or Drake Maye in Week 15.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are finally seeing encouraging news on the injury front as the season reaches its critical stages. Star wideout Mike Evans and rookie receiver Jalen McMillan are making steady progress toward returning, giving the offense a much-needed boost. Their eventual comeback could be a game-changer as Tampa Bay battles for divisional relevance. With both receivers sidelined for extended periods, the Buccaneers have had to adjust their passing game and offensive schemes. The team is optimistic that the return of Evans and McMillan will strengthen Baker Mayfield’s options and add new dimensions to Tampa Bay’s attack.

Buccaneers monitor progress as Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan work toward full return

Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed that Evans and McMillan participated in Wednesday’s walkthrough, with Thursday’s practice expected to provide more clarity on their readiness. While a Week 14 return remains unlikely, their involvement in team activities signals meaningful progress and a potential impact in the coming weeks.

Baker Mayfield on Mike Evans & Jalen McMillan Returning | Press Conference | Tampa Bay Buccaneers

For Baker Mayfield, seeing Evans and McMillan back on the practice field was an exciting sight. “Mike just attracts so much attention,” Mayfield said. “His playmaking ability is great to have. I can trust him, know where he's going to be. It really affects how a defense is going to play you. For J-Mac, it’s obviously been a long time coming… he’s worked his tail off to get to this point.” Their progress, even in limited practice, is a morale boost for the quarterback and the entire team. Evans remains one of Mayfield’s most dependable targets, known for creating separation and drawing constant defensive attention, while McMillan brings a fresh, explosive element once fully cleared. Tampa Bay is taking a cautious approach to their ramp-up, ensuring both receivers regain timing, conditioning, and confidence before stepping back onto the field. Their return could rejuvenate the offense and open up new opportunities for Baker Mayfield to make big plays. Even a partial return of these key players could significantly boost the Buccaneers’ offense. While immediate impact may be limited, the team’s outlook is brighter, and Baker Mayfield now has reason to be excited about the near-future additions to his lineup. Their return also gives Tampa Bay fans hope for a stronger finish to the season.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update The Lions have not yet made a decision about St. Brown's status for ""Thursday Night Football.""","The Detroit Lions' season of injuries continues to mount up.

The Lions are set to be without multiple key contributors when they host the Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Thursday, Dec. 4. The question remaining is whether star wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown will be among them.

St. Brown exited Detroit's Thanksgiving Day game against the Green Bay Packers after suffering an ankle injury when a lineman rolled on his leg from behind. His availability has been in doubt since.

Detroit enters Week 14 with a 7-5 record – eighth-best in the NFC – leaving them on the outside looking in to the playoff picture. They are battling to stay in the race and Lions fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available today.

Here's the latest on St. Brown before ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Cowboys.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

The Lions have not yet made a decision about St. Brown's status for ""Thursday Night Football."" Detroit listed him as ""questionable"" on its final injury report and is expected to make a game-time decision about his status.

St. Brown has only before missed two games during his five-year NFL career to date. The last one he missed was in 2023 when he suffered an abdominal injury in Week 3. He played through it before missing Week 5 due to the injury. Prior to that, he suffered an identical injury to this ankle sprain in Week 3 of 2022, which saw him miss Week 4.

St. Brown failed to participate in practice this week, but the Lions have no plans to place him on IR, which would require that he be out for at least four weeks. He was initially classified as ""week-to-week"" after suffering the low ankle sprain, per NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.

Pelissero also noted the Lions will have a mini-bye because of the ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup, which allows St. Brown extra time to recover if he can't play against the Cowboys.

Detroit has been no stranger to playing without its stars on offense, with TE Sam LaPorta lost for the season.

Lions WR depth chart

The Lions have six receivers on their 53-man roster:

Amon-Ra St. Brown (injured)

Jameson Williams

Kalif Raymond

Isaac TeSlaa

Tom Kennedy

Dominic Lovett

Kalif Raymond and TE Brock Wright missed last week's game, but they may be active for Thursday's matchup against Dallas. Isaac TeSlaa and Tom Kennedy operated as the No. 2 and 3 WRs behind Jameson Williams after St. Brown exited on Thanksgiving.

Williams will be Jared Goff's top target if St. Brown is sidelined. The 2022 first-round pick went off for 144 yards and a touchdown on seven receptions and a team-high 10 targets on Thanksgiving.

TeSlaa, a rookie third-round pick this season, could be more involved. His size at 6-4, 214 pounds makes him a legitimate red-zone threat.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/03/USAT/87577186007-usatsi-27484512.jpg?crop=8185,4607,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-04 14:03:03.555500

While a calf strain will keep him sidelined for weeks, it is a preferable injury and timeline to what players first imagined when they saw Antetokounmpo go down with no one else around him.
While Antetokounmpo was able to avoid a serious injury, the Bucks will still be in a challenging position with their star forward on the sidelines.
The injury, though, comes at an opportune time for the Bucks, regarding the number of games Antetokounmpo might end up missing.
The schedule is demanding after those two weeks, with the Bucks playing nine of their 11 games on the road between Dec. 21 and Jan. 11.","Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo will be sidelined for two to four weeks with a right calf strain he suffered Wednesday night, a league source confirmed to The Athletic.

ESPN first reported the news.

Antetokounmpo suffered a calf strain in what appeared to be a non-contact injury three minutes into Milwaukee’s 113-109 comeback win against the Detroit Pistons, which pushed the Bucks to 10-13 on the season. While a calf strain will keep him sidelined for weeks, it is a preferable injury and timeline to what players first imagined when they saw Antetokounmpo go down with no one else around him.

“It’s tough. Our brains always assume the worst right away,” Bucks guard AJ Green said after the game. “You hope it’s never that, but he’ll be all right. I’m not sure exactly what it is, but he’ll be all right.”

Following the game, Bucks coach Doc Rivers told the media that the team had ruled out an Achilles injury before Antetokounmpo underwent the MRI, and that early diagnosis was confirmed Thursday. While Antetokounmpo was able to avoid a serious injury, the Bucks will still be in a challenging position with their star forward on the sidelines.

Despite pulling off a surprising comeback win on Wednesday over the Eastern Conference’s best team without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks are 1-6 this season with their nine-time All-NBA forward not playing, including losing all four games he missed in November with a left adductor strain.

Milwaukee’s struggles this season have once again embroiled the team in trade rumors following an ESPN report on Wednesday about the conversations the star and his representation have had with the organization in light of the team’s underwhelming start.

While team sources downplayed those conversations, they acknowledged frustration throughout the organization over the team’s struggles in the first month and a half of the season.

Before Wednesday’s game, Rivers took a forceful tone with the media when discussing the reporting and even attacked ESPN’s coverage of Antetokounmpo.

“For the 50th time — and clearly it’s not getting to one network, for sure — Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever,” Rivers said. “I can’t make that more clear.”

Yet, Rivers conceded that he understood why the future of the franchise’s all-time leading scorer was once again the topic of conversation around the league.

“The reason that this is out is because we’re not playing well,” Rivers said before Wednesday’s game. “So, let’s just call a spade a spade. We’re not playing well. We had a tough loss the other night, and so now this is the subject matter.

“We feel very good about this team, but we have to play better. We have to win games. And until we start winning games, this is going to be out here. We rip off 10 in a row, (and) my guess is this is magically going to disappear.”

While Rivers’ proposed plan might have worked with Antetokounmpo producing at an MVP level, it will be far more difficult for the team to win games consistently with him sidelined. It might leave the Bucks in a precarious position in the standings when their star returns to the floor.

The injury, though, comes at an opportune time for the Bucks, regarding the number of games Antetokounmpo might end up missing.

After playing 16 games in November, the Bucks play 13 games in December. Since the Bucks did not qualify for the NBA Cup quarterfinals, they will play only five games between Dec. 4 and Dec. 18, two weeks from Thursday’s diagnosis. The schedule is demanding after those two weeks, with the Bucks playing nine of their 11 games on the road between Dec. 21 and Jan. 11.

With Kevin Porter Jr.’s return from injury, Milwaukee can pair him with NBA Most Improved Player candidate Ryan Rollins and have a much better chance of winning games without their star on the floor.

However, the road ahead will be difficult, and Milwaukee will need to show its resolve to keep its postseason chances alive while Antetokounmpo is sidelined with his right calf strain.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/04121209/Gianniscalf-scaled-e1764877155214.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-04 17:05:16.809913

Understanding the players who are injured and at risk of missing Week 14 could be the difference between securing a playoff spot and playing for pride in the consolation bracket. Be sure to check in with this article throughout the week, as it will be updated with the players who are being upgraded and downgraded in practice ahead of Week 14.

Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson was listed as a limited participant at the Baltimore Ravens’ Wednesday practice due to an ankle injury. This is an upgrade for Jackson, who has missed the first practice of the week in recent weeks due to various injuries.

Unfortunately, Jackson was downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday. That is far from ideal for the veteran quarterback and puts his status in Week 14 in jeopardy. Tyler Huntley would be the starter if Jackson is held out.

Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers

Justin Herbert suffered a hand injury during the Los Angeles Chargers’ win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 13 that required surgery. Herbert had that procedure on Monday and is considered day-to-day. The initial belief is that the veteran quarterback has a chance to be ready for Week 14’s matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, especially since the game is on Monday night.

Expect Herbert to be ramped up as the week progresses to see if his hand can handle the rigors of catching snaps. If Herbert is ruled out, journeyman quarterback Trey Lance would be the starter.

Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders

Jayden Daniels began to practice last week before ultimately being ruled out for the Washington Commanders’ Week 13 matchup against the Denver Broncos. The quarterback has made it clear in interviews that when he is ready to return to the field, he wants to, regardless of the team’s record.

Head coach Dan Quinn stated that Daniels had not been fully cleared for contact heading into Week 14, but that the team would continue to ramp him up before deciding his game status on Friday. Marcus Mariota would continue to start if Daniels is ultimately unable to return.

Kyler Murray, QB, Arizona Cardinals | Out

Kyler Murray is eligible to return from the injured reserve in Week 14. However, Arizona Cardinals’ head coach Jonathan Gannon told reporters during his Monday press conference that Murray was “… not quite there yet.”

Jacoby Brissett will remain the starter in Arizona for the foreseeable future. Given how well the offense has looked with Brissett under center, it is fair to question whether the Cardinals will activate Murray at all in 2025, especially in a lost season.

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Minnesota Vikings

J.J. McCarthy missed the Minnesota Vikings’ matchup against the Seattle Seahawks due to a concussion. McCarthy has yet to clear the concussion protocol officially, but the fact that he was practicing in a limited fashion last week suggests that he will clear it in short order.

If McCarthy clears the protocol, he will be the starter against the Washington Commanders in Week 14. He logged a full practice on Wednesday, putting him on track to return.

Sam Darnold, QB, Seattle Seahawks

Sam Darnold was briefly taken into the medical tent during the Seattle Seahawks’ Week 13 win over the Minnesota Vikings due to an ankle injury. Darnold returned to the game and finished without issue. There is no reason to believe he will miss Week 14, but he will likely appear on the injury report throughout the week.

Omarion Hampton, RB, Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers opened Omarion Hampton’s 21-day practice window to return from the injured reserve before Week 13’s matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders. The team ultimately chose not to activate him from the injured reserve after a week of practice.

Reports indicate that Hampton should return in Week 14. He is likely to return to a split backfield situation with second-year runner Kimani Vidal. Hampton was averaging 15.4 fantasy points per game before his injury, so fantasy managers should be excited to play him regardless of the pending backfield split.

Aaron Jones Sr., RB, Minnesota Vikings

Aaron Jones Sr. has been navigating a shoulder injury for several weeks. The Minnesota Vikings running back aggravated his shoulder during the third quarter of the team’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks and did not return to the game. He is considered day-to-day with the injury and logged a limited practice on Wednesday.

If the Vikings choose to rest the veteran running back to allow him to heal, then Jordan Mason would take on the bulk of the backfield, with Zavier Scott absorbing some work in the pass game.

Alvin Kamara, RB, New Orleans Saints

Veteran running back Alvin Kamara suffered a sprained MCL in the New Orleans Saints’ Week 12 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. MCL sprains are usually multi-week issues, so it wasn’t surprising when Kamara missed Week 13’s game against the Miami Dolphins.

Kamra does have a chance to return in Week 14 (although he may be limited) in a difficult matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He did not practice on Wednesday, setting the stage for a second missed contest.

If the veteran running back misses the game, then rookie Devin Neal would continue to dominate touches out of the backfield. Neal had just 9.9 PPR points in the Saints’ loss to the Dolphins, but posted 14 carries for 47 yards and three receptions for 22 yards while playing 81% of the team’s offensive snaps.

Tyrone Tracy Jr., RB, New York Giants

There was initial concern that Tyrone Tracy Jr. had suffered a significant lower-body injury after he was carted off the field during the fourth quarter of the New York Giants’ loss to the New England Patriots. However, Tracy spoke with reporters on Tuesday and told them he had suffered a stinger in his hip and should be fine.

The Giants are on bye in Week 14, so Tracy can’t help fantasy managers in the short term. However, if a fantasy manager panics and drops him due to the injury and bye week, he is worth stashing, since it does not seem he will miss time.

Woody Marks, RB, Houston Texans

Woody Marks briefly left the Houston Texans’ win over the Indianapolis Colts in Week 13 with an ankle injury. He was able to return and finish the game. The rookie was listed as a non-participant in Wednesday’s practice due to the same ankle injury.

This was likely a rest day for Marks, so there is no reason for concern at this time. He was able to return to practice on Thursday, which means he is trending toward playing in Week 14.

Trey Benson, RB, Arizona Cardinals

There was hope that Trey Benson could return to the field for the Arizona Cardinals in Week 13 after the team had opened his 21-day return window from the injured reserve in Week 12. Unfortunately, Benson logged a limited practice on Wednesday before being downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday and Friday, and then ruled out.

Benson has until Dec. 10 to be activated from the injured reserve, or he will need to be shut down for the remainder of the season. In theory, that gives him one more week to ramp up and return.

The second-year running back was not spotted at the open media portion of practice on Wednesday and did not practice on Thursday, which is not a good sign for his pending return to the field.

Kyle Monangai, RB, Chicago Bears

Rookie running back Kyle Monangai was listed as a non-participant in the Chicago Bears’ practice on Dec. 3 due to an ankle injury. Monangai had not previously appeared on the injury report with an ankle issue.

Chicago has held players out of practice throughout the season on Wednesdays, so there isn’t much reason for concern at this time. Monangai was upgraded to a limited participant on Thursday and is trending toward playing Week 14 against the Green Bay Packers.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR, Detroit Lions | Questionable

Amon-Ra St. Brown suffered an ankle injury during the first quarter of the Detroit Lions’ loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day. The veteran receiver attempted to return in the second half, but ultimately was not healthy enough to return to the field. Initial reports indicated that St. Brown avoided a major injury and suffered a traditional low ankle sprain.

The Lions have another Thursday night matchup in Week 14 against the Dallas Cowboys. That means that St. Brown will get a normal amount of rest, but won’t benefit from an additional couple of days to fully heal. St. Brown has been listed as a non-participant on both Monday and Tuesday this week, putting his status for Week 14 in doubt. He enters the game against the Dallas Cowboys with a questionable tag.

Detroit is also missing Kalif Raymond from its passing attack, so rookie Isaac TeSlaa and veteran Tom Kennedy will need to step up in the passing attack to keep the Lions’ playoff hopes alive in 2025.

Drake London, WR, Atlanta Falcons

Atlanta Falcons’ wide receiver Drake London has missed the last two games with a PCL injury. Head coach Raheem Morris spoke to reporters on Monday and stated that London was considered “day-to-day” at this point and had a chance of playing in Week 14 as long as he didn’t have any issues practicing throughout the week.

London did not practice on Wednesday, which is not a great first step toward his return to the starting lineup.

The Falcons have spread their passing attack between Kyle Pitts, Darnell Mooney, David Sills, and Dylan Drummond, with London sidelined.

Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

Veteran wide receiver Davante Adams was listed as a non-participant in the Los Angeles Rams’ practice on Wednesday due to a hamstring injury. Head coach Sean McVay stated that he expected Adams to be ready to go when the Rams face off against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 14.

Tee Higgins, WR, Cincinnati Bengals

Tee Higgins missed the Cincinnati Bengals’ win over the Baltimore Ravens on Thanksgiving with a concussion that he suffered in Week 12 against the New England Patriots. According to head coach Zac Taylor, Higgins still hasn’t cleared the concussion protocol. He logged a limited practice on Wednesday, which is a positive sign.

There is still plenty of time for Higgins to complete the protocol, and his participation in practice throughout the week will indicate whether he is progressing without setbacks.

Rome Odunze, WR, Chicago Bears

Rome Odunze was listed as a non-participant during Wednesday’s practice for the Chicago Bears due to a foot injury. Odunze has missed Wednesday practices throughout the season due to a heel injury, but it is unclear if this is related to the issue.

Odunze has yet to miss a game due to this injury and, historically, is updated to a limited participant on Thursday. Unfortunately, Odunze was a non-participant on Thursday, which suggests something has changed (for the worse) with his injury.

There is still time for Odunze to upgrade to a limited participant on Friday, but for now, it appears that Odunze is trending toward missing Week 14. D.J. Moore, Luther Burden III, and Colston Loveland would absorb most of Odunze’s typical target share.

Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Arizona Cardinals

Marvin Harrison Jr. returned to the Arizona Cardinals’ starting lineup in Week 13 after missing two games due to an appendectomy. Unfortunately, the second-year receiver suffered a heel injury during the game and could not return.

Head coach Jonathan Gannon has compared Harrison’s heel injury to cornerback Max Melton’s injury, noting that it was “tricky.” That injury also forced Melton to miss Week 13’s matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

RELATED: Cardinals Playoff Hopes Fade, Attention Shifts to 2026 NFL Draft Pick Placement

Time will tell whether the heel injury sidelines Harrison. However, he was not spotted at practice on Nov. 3 or Nov. 4, which suggests that he will miss at least one game, like Melton.

If he’s out, Michael Wilson and Greg Dortch once again become fantasy viable players after dominating with their increased workload with Harrison sidelined earlier in the season.

Mike Evans, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Mike Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 7. At the time, the injury wasn’t believed to be season-ending, but there was also an expectation that Evans would miss nearly all of the regular season. Surprisingly, the Buccaneers activated Evans’ 21-day practice window this week, giving him a chance to return to the field for Week 14’s matchup against the New Orleans Saints.

The Buccaneers are currently just a half-game up on the Carolina Panthers in the NFC South, so they need all hands on deck to secure another division title. If the Buccaneers decide to give Evans a week to get his legs under him, then Emeka Egbuka, Chris Godwin, and Tez Johnson would lead the passing attack in Week 14.

Jayden Reed, WR, Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers opened up Jayden Reed’s 21-day return window from the injured reserve on Nov. 21, which allowed Reed to log limited practices ahead of the team’s Thursday matchup against the Detroit Lions in Week 13, even though the veteran receiver was not expected to play. Reed has been out since September after having surgery on a broken collarbone and an unrelated foot injury he suffered during the summer.

On Monday, Packers’ head coach Matt LaFleur stated that the Packers would continue to ramp up Reed’s workload while the team waits for medical clearance for Reed to return to the field. The team has until Dec. 12 to make a final decision on Reed’s status, but there is a chance he can return to face off against the Chicago Bears in Week 14.

Matthew Golden, WR, Green Bay Packers

Green Bay Packers’ 2025 first-round pick Matthew Golden has missed the last two games with a wrist injury. On Monday, head coach Matt LaFleur described Golden as “potentially available” for Sunday’s matchup against the Chicago Bears.

Golden has struggled to find his footing this season and could return to even more target competition if veteran receiver Jayden Reed is also cleared to return. Golden may see himself as the odd player out in a receiving group that has found its stride with Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, and Dontayvion Wicks, plus Reed.

Josh Downs, WR, Indianapolis Colts

Josh Downs was a non-participant for the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 3 with hip and knee injuries. Downs has missed practice with injuries in recent weeks, but has had no problem suiting up on Sunday.

Dalton Kincaid, TE, Buffalo Bills

Dalton Kincaid has missed the last three weeks for the Buffalo Bills, working through a hamstring injury. He was able to log limited practices last week before ultimately being ruled out on Sunday, suggesting he is close to a return. Kincaid was listed as a limited participant for the Bills’ practice on Dec. 3.

Kincaid may be in a heavier rotation than usual in Week 14, but he would still be in a smash spot against the Cincinnati Bengals if he’s able to return. Cincinnati is allowing over 15.7 fantasy points per game to tight ends in 2025. The difference between the Bengals and second place (5.4 points per game) is the equivalent of the difference between second and 31st in points allowed to tight ends per game.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03120104/week-14-fantasy-football-injury-12-03-25.png,N,,2025-12-04 17:05:20.384994

Defensive tackle Jarran Reed and wide receiver Dareke Young, who were also making their returns from IR, were each full participants.

Ernest Jones IV named NFC Defensive Player of the Week

The Seahawks have a 21-day window to activate each player to the 53-man roster or place them on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.

Head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters before practice they’ll evaluate whether each is activated for Sunday’s game against Atlanta throughout the week.

“We’ll see how it goes,” he said. “I know we have a certain amount of time to activate them, and we’ll either do it this week or we’ll do it another week.”

Macdonald did seem to indicate that Love, who has missed the past eight games with a hamstring injury, may not return this week, even if fully healthy.

“Let’s say everything went perfectly to plan, anytime you’re coming off a stretch where you’re not playing, you gotta have some sort of ramp back in,” Macdonald said of Love. “So that’s how we’re operating.”

In addition to Love, tight end AJ Barner (knee, shoulder), defensive end Rylie Mills (knee) and safety Ty Okada (oblique) were each limited participants in practice.

Seattle had five players listed with rest or non-injury related designations. Defensive linemen Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence did not practice while wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, linebacker Ernest Jones IV and backup quarterback Drew Lock were limited.

Right guard Anthony Bradford (elbow) and wide receiver Cody White (abdomen) were full participants. Bradford left Sunday’s win over Minnesota in the final minutes of the fourth quarter and did not return.

Macdonald also said veteran tight end Eric Saubert was “coming on strong” and could be a candidate to return to practice next week. Saubert was placed on IR with a calf injury on Nov. 1.

“He’s got some things he needs to hit this week rehab-wise, but optimistic that he’ll hit those things,” Macdonald said.

Carter missed the first three practices of training camp with a shoulder injury and has popped up several times on the injury report with the shoulder but hasn’t missed any games with it yet.
But even in the weeks he wasn’t on the injury report, he hasn’t seemed like quite the player he was last year.
Because they don’t play until Monday night, the Eagles won’t have an injury report this week until Thursday.
Asked how Carter played Friday, Fangio said: “Yeah, it was a lot like the rest of us, you know?","Jalen Carter hasn’t looked quite right all year, and in the loss to the Bears he played only 70.1 percent of the Eagles’ defensive snaps, his 3rd-lowest over the last two years.

Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said Wednesday the shoulder injury Carter first suffered before the start of training camp remains an issue and is affecting his play and his playing time.

Carter missed the first three practices of training camp with a shoulder injury and has popped up several times on the injury report with the shoulder but hasn’t missed any games with it yet.

He appeared on the injury report with the shoulder prior to the Cowboys opener and the Rams and Broncos games, and he was listed as limited the first day of practice before the Rams and Broncos games. But even in the weeks he wasn’t on the injury report, he hasn’t seemed like quite the player he was last year. He missed several series against Tampa with the shoulder, playing a season-low 47 snaps. He also missed the loss to the Giants with a heel injury.

Because they don’t play until Monday night, the Eagles won’t have an injury report this week until Thursday.

“He does have a shoulder issue,” Fangio said. “He's been playing with it. You know, late in the (Bears) game, he had a great play with it. But yeah, it's definitely something there.”

Carter on Friday picked up his second sack of the season as well as two tackles for loss and two pass breakups. But he was ineffective vs. the run, and the Bears rushed for 281 yards – 10th-most against the Eagles in their 94-year history.

Philadelphia Eagles

Carter, a Pro Bowler and 2nd-team all-pro last year in his first year as a starter, is down across the board in his production this year. His Pro Football Focus run defense grade ranks 94th out of 117 interior linemen who’ve played at least 200 snaps. Overall, he ranks 55th out of 117.

Asked how Carter played Friday, Fangio said: “Yeah, it was a lot like the rest of us, you know? Some good, some not good. I think we were all guilty of that.”

Overall, Carter’s snaps have dropped from last year. Carter played 79.4 percent of the Eagles' defensive snaps last year, and he's played 71.6 percent this year.

With Carter struggling with the shoulder Friday and the defense on the field for a season-high 87 snaps, Jordan Davis played a season-high 59 snaps, 2nd-most of his career; Moro Ojomo matched his career high with 62 snaps; and Byron Young played a career-high 38 snaps.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/GettyImages-2249265599.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=1669px%2C723px%2C4344px%2C2445px&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-04 13:06:56.929495

Tangible results are what impact the thing that counts – the Colts' win-loss record – and the Colts' 20-16 loss dropped them to 8-4.
But the Colts remain confident in what Jones can do behind center, and do not feel like his fibula injury is condensing what they're able to get to as an offense.
Still, Jones is battling through the injury to not only play, but play at a level the Colts believe he can reach.
I think that shows the guys how much he cares, that he wants to be out there with them and playing – still playing great ball.","Fun fact: Daniel Jones' highest-graded passing game of the 2025 season, by Pro Football Focus, came in Week 13 – when the Colts' quarterback was still dealing with a fibula injury.

Take that for what it's worth – Pro Football Focus grades don't always match how teams internally evaluate their players. But the tape matches the grade (of 83.1), with Jones standing tall in the pocket and ripping throws all over the field against the Houston Texans. Another way to look at it: The Colts' dropback EPA per play of +.130 was the highest any team has had against Houston's stingy defense all season.

It didn't result in a win, or even crossing the 20-point mark. Tangible results are what impact the thing that counts – the Colts' win-loss record – and the Colts' 20-16 loss dropped them to 8-4. But the Colts remain confident in what Jones can do behind center, and do not feel like his fibula injury is condensing what they're able to get to as an offense.

""I think he's playing well, playing efficiently, spreading the ball around to guys, managing the offense within each weekly game plan against some pretty good defenses that throw different things at you and create different problems,"" offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said. ""Doing a lot of good there. We're always conscious of all our guys, who's out there. Some guys are dealing with stuff throughout the NFL season, and we try to do what we can to put them in position to go have success.

""But like Shane said a few times, Daniel's sort of no restrictions. We're able to go out there and play ball and do whatever we can go do to beat our opponent.""

Jones on Wednesday was asked if his fibula injury was keeping him from moving outside the pocket; head coach Shane Steichen pointed out earlier this week one Jones' two touchdowns against the Texans came with him rolling to his right before connecting with tight end Tyler Warren.

""I feel good,"" Jones said. ""I think I'm feeling better every week, and continue to do more and more. I think, yeah, just being mindful of the injury and doing whatever I can to put the team in a position to win.""

Still, Jones is battling through the injury to not only play, but play at a level the Colts believe he can reach. And as the Colts look to get their 2025 season back on track for a critical final five-game stretch, Steichen also sees Jones' ability and willingness to play through his fibula injury as being inspirational to the other players on the Colts' roster.

""It's a huge impact,"" Steichen said. ""I mean, when a guy is out there dealing with an injury, it just shows the toughness and what he's willing to put on the line for the guys. I think that shows the guys how much he cares, that he wants to be out there with them and playing – still playing great ball. It's pretty impressive to watch.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/mkv5i8wh0ccyruqtvfft,N,,2025-12-04 12:02:36.824765
,,2025-12-04 09:20:26+00:00,The Athletic,"What Tyler Seguin's injury means for Stars' salary cap, approach to trade deadline",Chris Johnston,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6859215/2025/12/03/tyler-seguin-injury-salary-cap-trade-deadline/,"Another season, another unfortunate injury setback for veteran forward Tyler Seguin.
“We didn’t get great news today,” Stars coach Glen Gulutzan told reporters Wednesday.
Under the new rules, the Stars can only replace Seguin’s full cap hit if he’s ruled out for the entirety of the regular season and playoffs.
Seguin is due to consult with doctors before a firm recovery and return-to-play timeline is established, according to a league source.
“He’s a great leader for us, and he’s a great pro,” said Gulutzan, in his first year since returning to the Stars bench.","Another season, another unfortunate injury setback for veteran forward Tyler Seguin.

However, due to recent changes to the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement, how his long-term absence impacts the Dallas Stars’ salary-cap picture could be a little different from the last time Seguin missed significant time to injury.

There was a sense of deja vu when the Stars announced Wednesday that Seguin suffered a torn ACL in his right knee, because it came almost one year to the day that the team announced his 2024-25 season was in jeopardy following hip surgery.

“We didn’t get great news today,” Stars coach Glen Gulutzan told reporters Wednesday.

Seguin suffered the latest injury during Tuesday’s game against the New York Rangers, when his leg got caught up with defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov while falling awkwardly to the ice. He needed assistance getting to the visitors dressing room at Madison Square Garden.

Gulutzan indicated that Seguin will be sidelined for months — “probably the rest of the season,” he later added — and where exactly the recovery timeline ends up will have a significant bearing on what the Stars can do to make up for his loss before the March 6 trade deadline.

Either way, they’re eligible for some relief under the league’s rules covering long-term injuries. The only question is whether it’s $3.82 million or the full $9.85 million on Seguin’s contract because of a revision to Section 50.10(d)(iii) in the recent CBA extension.

Under the new rules, the Stars can only replace Seguin’s full cap hit if he’s ruled out for the entirety of the regular season and playoffs. That would require him to be moved to season-ending LTI, which is irreversible. In the event he can play again before the end of the postseason, Dallas is limited to spending an amount equal to last season’s average salary on a replacement, which would be $3.82 million.

Seguin is due to consult with doctors before a firm recovery and return-to-play timeline is established, according to a league source.

With the Stars in win-now mode and off to a solid start — they were 17-5-5 heading into Wednesday’s game at the New Jersey Devils — they are expected to again be a big player leading into the trade deadline.

Last season, they added Mikko Rantanen in a blockbuster trade with the Carolina Hurricanes on March 7, after picking up Mikael Granlund and Cody Ceci from the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 1.

Under the previous rules, they made the finances work for those trades by having Seguin, Miro Heiskanen and Nils Lundkvist on LTI.

Seguin managed to work his way back from last year’s hip surgery with a diligent recovery program, playing in the Stars’ final regular-season game on April 16 and another 18 games in the playoffs during their third consecutive run to the Western Conference final.

The early indications suggest he likely won’t be in a position to do so again.

“He’s a great leader for us, and he’s a great pro,” said Gulutzan, in his first year since returning to the Stars bench. “He’s been a guy, quite frankly, that I’ve been maybe the most impressed with, just his leadership ability, when I’ve come in here.

“This is tough news for our whole group.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/03160523/USATSI_27724861-scaled-e1764796966219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:52.838422

But even if they weren't inclined to keep Jones as their starter, the Colts' options are limited.

Anthony Richardson Sr., their 2023 fourth overall draft pick, remains on injured reserve and still is not cleared for football-related activities after sustaining an orbital fracture in his face in a freak pregame incident in October, coach Shane Steichen said Wednesday.

But Richardson is closer to gaining clearance from his doctors, and the Colts have not closed the door on him returning to the lineup before the end of the season, Steichen said.

Richardson's vision was temporarily impaired by the injury because of swelling and the resulting surgery that was required, leaving him with some blurriness in one eye that is now clearing, a source told ESPN.

There was initially serious concern about Richardson's eye in the immediate aftermath of the injury, multiple sources have said, with Richardson rushed to the hospital by paramedics. But he ultimately avoided damage to the eye and has come a long way since those initial days.

""Any time you're dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he's got full vision in that eye,"" Steichen said. ""He's resting it right now, and once he's cleared to go, I'll let you guys know.""

Steichen said Richardson is engaging in certain training activities in the weight room, a recent development. He also has returned to the team facility on a more regular basis after initially being advised by doctors to stay home and rest. He was prohibited from performing any strenuous tasks. But this week, Richardson attended his first Colts game since the injury and might travel with the team for its upcoming road games.

Richardson sustained the injury while warming up with an elastic stretch band in the locker room before the team's Oct. 12 home game against the Arizona Cardinals. The bar to which the band was strapped broke, hitting Richardson in the face and causing his injuries.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559144_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 16:04:10.231661

On Wednesday, Dec. 3, the Buccaneers opened the 21-day practice window for veteran wide receiver Mike Evans, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport. The 12-year NFL veteran broke his collarbone in Tampa Bay's Week 7 clash with the Detroit Lions, and he's missed five games since the injury.

Evans has missed a total of eight games this season with various injuries – a hamstring injury held him out for Weeks 4-6 before his more recent injury took him out for at least five games. It's unclear how much more time he'll miss, but his return to practice indicates the Buccaneers plan to activate him from injured reserve (IR) soon.

It's big news for the Buccaneers, who hold a half-game lead over the Carolina Panthers in the NFC South race. Tampa Bay just saw fellow veteran receiver Chris Godwin return in Week 12 and running back Bucky Irving return in Week 13. Evans is one of the last players the Bucs need to return to get back to full strength.

Here's the latest injury update for Evans:

When will Mike Evans return?

Evans has been on the IR since breaking his collarbone in Week 7, but the Bucs opened his 21-day practice window on Dec. 3, according to an NFL Media report. That means Tampa Bay has until Christmas Eve – Dec. 24 – to activate the veteran wide receiver or declare his season over.

Evans will return to practice in Week 14 and hope to avoid any setbacks ahead of a potential return in one of the final weeks of the regular season – just in time for a push to clinch the division and a playoff run.

Because Evans has missed so much time with his hamstring and collarbone injuries, his late-season return is too late to save his streak of consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. His run of prolific production will end after 11 seasons, leaving him tied for the all-time record.

Mike Evans stats

Unless Evans can stack together multiple games with more than 300 yards in each, his streak of 11 straight 1,000-yard seasons to begin his career will end in 2025. Here's how his stats look through 13 weeks and four games played:

Targets: 32

Receptions: 14

Receiving yards: 140

Yards/reception: 10

Touchdowns: 1

Last year, Evans reached 1,004 receiving yards in 14 games, tying him with Hall of Famer Jerry Rice for most consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in NFL history. The Buccaneers receiver is also the sole record-holder for most consecutive 1,000-yard seasons to begin a career and owns the franchise record in single-season receiving touchdowns (14 in 2021).

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle) — Not expected to play in Week 14

TE Brock Wright (neck)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 18

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Raymond was not expected to play this week, and he’ll miss his second straight game. Coach Dan Campbell said Raymond’s making progress, but the outlook on when he’ll be available again is unclear.

Wright missed practice this week as the team explored multiple opinions on his trachea injury. He’ll miss at least one more week and maybe more.

Zylstra just started his injury evaluation clock this week and missed practice on one of those days; he’s not ready to return to game action just yet.

Joseph practiced for the first time in nearly two months this week; however, the Lions appear to be taking things very slowly with him, and he’ll miss another game. Practicing is progress, but patience is necessary with this situation.

Questionable

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest) — Upgraded after a rest day on Tuesday

RT Penei Sewell (shoulder) — Upgraded to limited on Wednesday

G Kayode Awosika (foot) — Downgraded to no practice Wednesday

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

S Brian Branch (toe/ankle)

Vaki has played through his thumb injury for multiple games now, and this week should be no different.

St. Brown told the media he expected his availability to be a game-time decision. It appears we’re going to have to wait until 90 minutes before kickoff to know his injury designations. With some extra time to rest before the Lions’ Week 15 game, don’t be surprised if the Lions give him a week off. He was listed as “no practice” for Wednesday.

Decker continues to play through his season-long lingering shoulder injury, and after taking a rest day on Tuesday, he looks like he’s back on track to play this week.

Sewell spent over a month on the injury report for various ailments. Then on Monday, he was removed from the injury report entirely, only to be re-added on Tuesday with a shoulder injury. A questionable designation gives him a chance to play—and he was listed as limited on Wednesday. So there should be some optimism there.

Awosika got in a clean practice on Monday, then was added to the injury report on Tuesday with a foot injury. Most mid-week injuries are tough to recover from, especially on a short week, but a questionable designation is promising. But he, too, was a non-participant in Wednesday’s practice—so Detroit could be looking for a new left guard this week.

Glasgow has stacked a week’s worth of practices, and it looks like he’ll have a real chance to return to his starting center role this week.

Branch has had a few nagging injuries lingering over the past few weeks, but he’s managed to play through them and is expected to do the same this week.

""The plan is to prepare as if I'm going to play and see how the next couple of days goes,"" Herbert said.
Herbert stayed in the game, clearly favoring the hand, and threw a touchdown to wide receiver Quentin Johnston on the next play.
He eventually went to the locker room and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand.
Coach Jim Harbaugh said the Chargers are optimistic Herbert will play against the Eagles, but they are preparing backup quarterback Trey Lance to start if needed.","EL SEGUNDO, Calif -- Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who recently had surgery on his fractured left hand, did not practice Wednesday but said he is preparing to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles.

""The plan is to prepare as if I'm going to play and see how the next couple of days goes,"" Herbert said. ""Do everything I can to be out there for the team and the guys out there.""

Herbert said he wasn't sure of the exact surgical details, only that doctors inserted a plate and screws to stabilize his hand. Herbert kept the injured hand tucked in his hoodie pocket Wednesday and said he was wearing a cast to protect it from contact.

Herbert participated in Wednesday's walk-through, a noncontact instructional practice, but said he still hasn't gripped a football, something he plans to attempt later this week.

Reducing swelling, he said, has been the primary focus.

""It's been the most important thing the past couple of days,"" he said.

Herbert was hurt in the first quarter Sunday, when Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn hit Herbert on a scramble, and Chinn's helmet appeared to connect directly with Herbert's non-throwing hand.

Herbert stayed in the game, clearly favoring the hand, and threw a touchdown to wide receiver Quentin Johnston on the next play. He eventually went to the locker room and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand.

The Chargers didn't take a snap under center for the remainder of the game, as Herbert said he struggled to grip the ball.

Herbert said he hasn't spoken with the team's medical staff but anticipates wearing a hard cast again if he plays.

Two seasons ago, Herbert fractured the middle finger on his left hand; the Chargers primarily played out of the shotgun to manage that injury

If Herbert doesn't take any reps at practice this week, he believes he could still play Monday, noting he's done that before.

Herbert has only had two injuries that caused him to miss practice: a high right ankle sprain last season and a fractured rib cartilage in 2022. Herbert played through both.

The only games Herbert missed due to injury were in 2023, when he fractured the index finger on his throwing hand and couldn't grip a football.

""It's not ideal,"" Herbert said of potentially playing without practicing. ""It's definitely difficult in this league, but if that's the case and if Coach feels like I'll get the best shot for the team, then I trust his decision.""

Coach Jim Harbaugh said the Chargers are optimistic Herbert will play against the Eagles, but they are preparing backup quarterback Trey Lance to start if needed.

Even if Herbert suits up, Lance might handle under center situations -- typically coming in goal-line or short yardage -- if Herbert's grip remains an issue.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1204%2Fr1584532_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 01:01:19.323484
