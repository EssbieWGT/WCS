**UPDATED AS OF TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25TH AT 5 PM ET**

🏈 AFC East

◆ Buffalo Bills

Dalton Kincaid - TE (hamstring)

Kincaid emerged from the team’s Week 10 loss to the Dolphins with a hamstring injury. He remains sidelined and did not play in Week 12 against the Texans.

Fantasy Impact: Fox Sports’ Jordan Schultz reports Kincaid is labeled as “week-to-week.” Fellow tight end Dawson Knox played 77% of the team’s offensive snaps in each game Kincaid has missed this season but did not see more than three targets in either game. Fantasy managers probably are best looking elsewhere for help through byes this week.

◆ Miami Dolphins

Darren Waller - TE (pectoral)

Head coach Mike McDaniel said the team would open Waller’s 21-day practice window this week.

Fantasy Impact: Waller appears primed to return from a four-game absence due to a pectoral injury, and would likely return to a semi-featured role considering the state of the Dolphins. The time is now to take a shot on Waller off of waivers if his previous manager released him too soon.

Tyreek Hill - WR (knee)

Hill suffered a dislocated knee in the team’s Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Hill’s absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De’Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle. Malik Washington is likely to step into a secondary role and could see his aDOT improve, making him a sneaky potential FLEX option for the remainder of the season. Waddle sees the biggest boost to his fantasy value once he returns from his Week 12 bye.

◆ New England Patriots

The Patriots are now at full health following multiple injuries earlier this season.

◆ New York Jets

Garrett Wilson - WR (knee)

Wilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss “three-to-four weeks.” He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15.

Fantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson’s return didn’t last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to “return this season.”

Braelon Allen - RB (knee)

Allen suffered a “pretty serious” knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team’s Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.

Fantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall‘s upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.

Josh Reynolds - WR (hip)

Reynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.

Fantasy Impact: Reynolds’ absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.

🏈 AFC North

◆ Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson - QB (toe)

Jackson has dealt with numerous injuries during the previous four weeks, with his most recent being listed as a toe issue. He was listed as a “DNP” on Monday’s estimated practice report before practicing in full Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Jackson appears ready to rock on Thanksgiving against the Bengals, where he will be a top tier QB1.

Rashod Bateman - WR (ankle)

Bateman returned to a limited session to begin the week and appears primed to return from a two-game absence.

Fantasy Impact: Bateman should return to a low-volume, hefty red zone role against the Bengals, leaving his range of outcomes wide.

◆ Cincinnati Bengals

Joe Burrow - QB (toe)

Burrow is set to return from a nine-game absence in Week 13 after practicing in full this week.

Fantasy Impact: Burrow returns to a team fighting for their playoff lives, raising his weekly ceiling in the process. He is a locked-in QB1 against the Ravens.

Samaje Perine - RB (ankle)

Perine practiced in full Tuesday as he attempts to return from a two-game absence.

Fantasy Impact: Perine should immediately reclaim primary change of pace duties for the Bengals, limiting the volume potential of starter Chase Brown.

◆ Cleveland Browns

Dillon Gabriel - QB (concussion)

Gabriel cleared concussion protocol Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Kevin Stefanksi named fellow rookie Shedeur Sanders the starter for the Browns moving forward.

◆ Pittsburgh Steelers

Aaron Rodgers - QB (wrist)

Head coach Mike Tomlin said he has “great optimism” regarding Rodgers’ chances of playing in Week 13.

Fantasy Impact: A wrist injury held Rodgers out in Week 12 but he appears to be in line to start in a must-win game against the Bills. Treat Rodgers as a low-end QB2.

🏈 AFC South

◆ Houston Texans

C.J. Stroud - QB (concussion)

The expectation is that Stroud will return in Week 13 to face the Colts.

Fantasy Impact: Backup Davis Mills won three consecutive games for the Texans, keeping them on the fringe of the playoff picture in the AFC. It’ll be up to Stroud to continue that momentum after flailing through the bulk of the season prior to his injury. Treat Stroud as a mid-range QB2 against the Colts.

Joe Mixon - RB (foot)

Mixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.

◆ Indianapolis Colts

Anthony Richardson - QB (eye)

Richardson suffered a “freak accident” ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Richardson has been off the fantasy radar all season with Daniel Jones’ career reemergence. Backup quarterback Riley Leonard can be stashed in superflex leagues, if need be.

◆ Jacksonville Jaguars

Brian Thomas Jr. - WR (ankle)

Thomas has not played since suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 9. He was a limited participant in Week 12’s Wednesday practice but ruled out Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Thomas has already dealt with wrist and shoulder injuries in an extremely disappointing season this year. Newcomer Jakobi Meyers could continue to see his role in the offense grow as the Jaguars struggle to maintain a playoff spot in the AFC.

Travis Hunter - WR/CB (knee)

Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.

Fantasy Impact: See Thomas’ section above.

◆ Tennessee Titans

Calvin Ridley - WR (hamstring)

Ridley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.

Fantasy Impact: It’s a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.

Elic Ayomanor - WR (hamstring)

Ayomanor did not practice on Wednesday and was ruled out for the team’s Week 12 contest Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Chimere Dike suddenly finds himself atop the pass-catching depth chart and is FLEX-worthy in Week 12. The team elevated Xavier Restrepo from the practice squad, who played with quarterback Cam Ward in college.

🏈 AFC West

◆ Denver Broncos

J.K. Dobbins - RB (foot)

Dobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, which would end his season.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey would be in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.

◆ Kansas City Chiefs

Isiah Pacheco - RB (knee)

Pacheco is expected to make his return in Week 13 following three missed games due to a knee injury.

Fantasy Impact: Pacheco returns to a low-upside, early-down role for the most pass-heavy offense in the league. He is nothing more than an RB3 in fantasy circles.

Rashee Rice - WR (hamstring)

Rice emerged from the team’s Week 12 win over the Colts with a hamstring injury. He is currently expected to practice on Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Rice remains a fantasy WR1 if active in Week 13, drawing a solid matchup with the Cowboys.

◆ Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders escaped their loss to the Browns absent any meaningful fantasy injuries.

◆ Los Angeles Chargers

Omarion Hampton - RB (ankle)

The Chargers designated Hampton to return from injured reserve Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Running back Kimani Vidal‘s run as the primary runner appears ready to come to an end in Los Angeles, though it could take Hampton a couple weeks to see a full allotment of snaps.

Najee Harris - RB (Achilles)

Harris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers’ Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

🏈 NFC East

◆ Dallas Cowboys

George Pickens - WR (knee, calf)

Pickens was listed as a “DNP” on Monday’s estimated injury report but the expectation is that he will practice Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Pickens should be ready to go on Thanksgiving against the Chiefs. Continue treating him as a WR1 in a difficult matchup on paper.

Miles Sanders - RB (ankle/knee)

Sanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.

◆ New York Giants

Jaxson Dart - QB (concussion)

Dart departed the team’s Week 10 loss to the Bears with a concussion. He is expected to return in Week 13 to face the Patriots.

Fantasy Impact: Dart returns as a low end QB1 against the Patriots.

Malik Nabers - WR (knee)

Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.

Fantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers’ absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.

Cam Skattebo - RB (ankle)

Skattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team’s Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo’s absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.

◆ Philadelphia Eagles

The Eagles are healthy coming out of their Week 12 loss to the Cowboys.

◆ Washington Commanders

Jayden Daniels - QB (elbow)

Daniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He is reportedly unlikely to play in Week 13 against the Broncos.

Fantasy Impact: Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders for the foreseeable future, slightly denting the fantasy upside of all primary skill position players in the process. Fantasy managers in a bind could do worse than taking a flier on Mariota, considering his rushing upside.

Terry McLaurin - WR (quad)

McLaurin was reportedly back at practice Monday, although it was simply a walkthrough. Even so, his return to the practice field is a good sign for his potential availability in Week 13 against the Broncos.

Fantasy Impact: McLaurin would be a risk-reward FLEX in a difficult matchup against the Broncos, should he return in Week 13.

Noah Brown - WR (groin, knee)

Brown was placed on injured reserve in Week 7. He was designated to return on Monday.

Fantasy Impact: It has been nine weeks since both McLaurin and Brown were on the field together, although the team is likely to be without quarterback Jayden Daniels in Week 13. Brown is nothing more than a desperation FLEX, should he return against the Broncos.

🏈 NFC North

◆ Chicago Bears

The Bears now find themselves healthy after struggling through numerous injuries earlier in the season.

◆ Detroit Lions

Sam LaPorta - TE (back)

LaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.

Fantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.

Brock Wright - TE (neck)

Wright landed hard on his neck last week and was listed as a “DNP” on the team’s estimated practice report Monday.

Fantasy Impact: A potential absence by Wright on a short week could condense the Lions’ target dispersal even further in the absence of LaPorta. Wide receiver Kalif Raymond was also listed as a non-participant Monday, potentially paving the way for rookie Isaac TeSlaa to see increased run on Thanksgiving as a tertiary option through the air.

◆ Green Bay Packers

Josh Jacobs - RB (knee)

Jacobs departed the team’s Week 11 win with a knee injury. Initial reports indicated the knee to be “structurally sound,” while head coach Matt LaFleur followed it up by saying the veteran back is dealing with a knee contusion. He was listed as “limited” on Monday’s estimated practice report after sitting out in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Jacobs appears primed to return from his one-game absence and should immediately regain primary duties for the Packers. He is an RB2 against the Lions.

Jayden Reed - WR (collarbone/foot)

Reed fractured his collarbone in the Packers’ Week 2 game against the Commanders and was already playing through a Jones fracture in his foot. When news of the expected collarbone surgery broke, the Packers were reportedly hoping to get Reed back in November. Reed then revealed that he underwent surgery to correct his Jones fracture as well. It is unknown whether this will extend his recovery timeline. As of Week 12, he appears close to returning.

Fantasy Impact: Reed was limited in practice Monday but is not expected to make his return to the active roster on a short week.

Tucker Kraft - TE (knee)

Kraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Panthers.

Fantasy Impact: Kraft’s breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.

◆ Minnesota Vikings

J.J. McCarthy - QB (concussion)

McCarthy was placed in the concussion protocol Monday.

Fantasy Impact: McCarthy reported symptoms on the plane ride home from Green Bay and appears headed for an absence in Week 13. That could leave the team with only Max Brosmer at quarterback, denting the ranges of outcomes of all primary skill position players against the Seahawks.

Carson Wentz - QB (shoulder)

Wentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.

Fantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.

🏈 NFC South

◆ Atlanta Falcons

Drake London - WR (illness)

London reportedly suffered a PCL sprain in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. Falcons head coach Raheem Morris “hopes” London can play in Week 13. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.

Fantasy Impact: We could see the veteran alpha miss multiple games for the Falcons, which, when combined with the absence of Michael Penix, could thrust tight end Kyle Pitts into a featured role, considering the struggles of Darnell Mooney thus far.

Michael Penix - QB (knee)

Penix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.

Fantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.

◆ Carolina Panthers

The Panthers are healthy following a Week 12 loss to the 49ers.

◆ New Orleans Saints

Alvin Kamara - RB (knee)

Kamara reportedly suffered an MCL sprain in the team’s Week 12 loss to the Falcons.

Fantasy Impact: Kamara has been on the team’s injury report for most of the season, this time likely to miss multiple games. Rookie Devin Neal appears to be in line for lead rusher duties in his absence. Treat Neal as an RB2 in the coming weeks.

Kendre Miller - RB (ACL)

Miller suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller’s absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller’s departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.

◆ Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Baker Mayfield - QB (shoulder)

Mayfield injured his non-throwing shoulder in the team’s Week 12 loss to the Rams. He reportedly avoided significant damage but appears likely to miss Week 13.

Fantasy Impact: It’s terrible timing for a team that has lost three straight, likely leaving Teddy Bridgewater to start under center against the Cardinals. It’s a significant downgrade to all primary skill position players.

Bucky Irving - RB (foot/shoulder)

Irving is considered week-to-week after injuring his foot in Week 4. He returned to practice in Week 11, yet is said to be in “rehab mode.” He was seen practicing early in Week 12 but was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Irving appears set to return in Week 13 against the Cardinals after head coach Todd Bowles said the second-year back would practice all week. He could take some time to return to the same lead role he left when injured considering the exploits of Sean Tucker in his absence.

Mike Evans - WR (collarbone, concussion)

Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Lions. He is expected to miss “most of the season.”

Fantasy Impact: Evans managed to play just under two quarters before the injury after returning from three missed contests due to a hamstring injury. Considering the current state of the roster, rookie Emeka Egbuka is looking like a true league-winner.

Jalen McMillan - WR (neck)

McMillan remains on injured reserve with a neck injury suffered in the preseason.

Fantasy Impact: The Buccaneers are reeling at wide receiver with McMillan, Chris Godwin and Mike Evans out.

🏈 NFC West

◆ Arizona Cardinals

Marvin Harrison Jr. - WR (appendicitis)

Harrison was ruled out for Week 11 after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Wednesday. The team also ruled him out early in Week 12. Head coach Jonathan Gannon did not have an update to start Week 13 preparations.

Fantasy Impact: Harrison’s emergency operation leaves wide receiver Michael Wilson as the only healthy starter. Tight end Trey McBride is in line to see all the volume he can handle, while veteran slot man Greg Dortch is flirting with FLEX status after averaging over 13 fantasy points per game in games where he has seen more than 66% of the team’s offensive snaps while with the Cardinals.

Emari Demercado - RB (ankle)

Demercado suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 11 and has already been ruled out for Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: We expect Bam Knight (ankle) to be the starter until Trey Benson is ready to return from injured reserve.

Trey Benson - RB (knee)

Benson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12. He was limited on Wednesday before being ruled out for Week 12 on Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Add Benson if he is available. He should quickly work his way toward handling an RB2-level workload when active. The Cardinals enter Week 12 with Bam Knight and Michael Carter atop their depth chart in an unfavorable matchup against the pass-funnel Jaguars.

Kyler Murray - QB (foot)

Murray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals’ backup.

Fantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.

James Conner - RB (ankle)

Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.

Fantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.

Zay Jones - WR (Achilles)

Jones suffered a torn Achilles in the team’s Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.

◆ Los Angeles Rams

Tyler Higbee - TE (ankle)

Higbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team’s Week 11 win over the Seahawks.

Fantasy Impact: Higbee’s absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team’s de facto starter.

Tutu Atwell - WR (hamstring)

The Rams placed Atwell on injured reserve Monday. Head coach Sean McVay said he “hopes Atwell is ready to roll in week 13.”

Fantasy Impact: Atwell’s potential return should lessen the team’s reliance on rookie Konata Mumpfield.

◆ San Francisco 49ers

Brandon Aiyuk - WR (knee)

Head coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk’s 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are “headed for divorce” after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.

Fantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.

◆ Seattle Seahawks

Tory Horton - WR (groin, shin)

Horton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/346f9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3406x1916+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff8%2F26%2Fd035002740e9b73885d2ff63dac1%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D27667761,N,,2025-11-26 08:00:12.562838

2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule: Cowboys host Chiefs to headline huge holiday triple-header

Jared Dubin

Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions (-2.5)

Karl Brooks, Lukas Van Ness and Savion Williams were all DNPs for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Javon Bullard, Edgerrin Cooper, Matthew Golden, Nate Hobbs, Josh Jacobs, Jayden Reed, Zach Tom, Quay Walker and Dontayvion Wicks were limited for the second straight day. Keisean Nixon got in a limited practice after not practicing at all on Monday, a good sign for his potential availability.

None of Graham Glasgow, Kerby Joseph, Kalif Raymond or Brock Wright practiced for the second consecutive day. It seems unlikely they'll play. (Dan Campbell all but confirmed that Joseph, at least, will sit.) The Lions had Terrion Arnold, Taylor Decker, Tate Ratledge, Penei Sewell and Isaac TeSlaa all limited for the second straight day on Tuesday, but Brian Branch upgraded to a full practice. Campbell expressed optimism that Marcus Davenport could return on Thursday.

Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas Cowboys (+3)

Running back Isiah Pacheco is set to make his return for Kansas City and has been a full participant so far this week. He's missed each of the last three games with a knee injury. Noah Gray has a concussion and did not practice Monday or Tuesday. Neither did Trey Smith, who is dealing with an ankle injury. Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Leo Chenal were upgraded to full practices on Tuesday.

George Pickens returned to a limited practice on Tuesday after sitting out with knee and calf designations on Monday. KaVontae Turpin and Osa Odighizuwa were similarly limited after being DNPs for the first session of the week. Left tackle Tyler Guyton has been a DNP on both days and was spotted by CBS Sports' Garrett Podell in a walking boot.

Cincinnati Bengals at Baltimore Ravens (-7)

Quarterback Joe Burrow is set to make his long-awaited return for Cincinnati after nearly making the start last weekend against the Patriots. He's been out since Week 3 after having toe surgery. Tee Higgins has already been ruled out for the game with a concussion, and Trey Hendrickson will miss his fifth consecutive game.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/25/fc9bcd90-752b-48a4-b770-6c0f398e0f14/thumbnail/1200x675/8cd392b3eabe69f27471254c3c371938/joe-burrow.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 08:00:17.808187

Safety Reed Blankenship said he got kneed in the hamstring while making a tackle in the third quarter of Sunday's game in Dallas, which caused him to exit the game. Blankenship tried to build up the confidence to be able to run despite the injury, but didn't want to be a burden to the rest of the defense.

Blankenship said on Tuesday that the injury is a ""little sore, but it's part of (football)."" He would have been a limited participant if the Eagles practiced on Tuesday. The team held a walkthrough.

While Blankenship is on track to return for the Black Friday matchup against the Chicago Bears as Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio said he expects Blankenship to play, the safety will have a different tag-team partner in Sydney Brown after rookie Andrew Mukuba suffered an ankle injury on the final drive of the game. Brown entered the game after Blankenship went down.

""I'm just owning my role and doing what I need to do to be successful,"" Brown said. ""It's going to be amazing. It's what I came here to do. I'm just embracing the opportunity for what it is. I feel horrible for Drew. He's been having a great season so far. Doing a really good job in the secondary as a safety. I hate to see that as a young player. I can relate to him because I went through it. I know what he's going through is a tough process, but he's going to get through it and he's going to be back.""

Mukuba would not have practiced on Tuesday and Head Coach Nick Sirianni said on Monday that the rookie will ""be out for some time.""

Safety isn't the only position worth monitoring in the secondary.

Cornerback Adoree' Jackson would have been a full participant on Tuesday, but he's under the gameday concussion protocol evaluation. If Jackson is not cleared ahead of the Black Friday game, the Eagles have several options at their disposal. After the injury occurred on Sunday, Cooper DeJean was moved from the nickel to outside cornerback and Michael Carter II played in the slot.

Carter played his most extensive reps on defense (25) since being acquired just before the trade deadline from the Jets.

""He's very, very smart. He can play any position,"" Blankenship said of Carter. ""In the meeting room, he's asking high-level questions and that's what you want. He's only been here for a couple of weeks and it feels like he's been here for a long time just based off what he's asking and what he's doing on the practice field. If he has to play a lot, we're very confident in that.""

Four other Eagles, in addition to Mukuba, would not have practiced on Tuesday: punt returner Xavier Gipson (shoulder), defensive end Brandon Graham (groin), tackle Lane Johnson (foot), and wide receiver DeVonta Smith (shoulder/chest).

DBs Kyler Gordon, Jaylon Johnson inch closer to return

The Chicago Bears lead the NFL with 24 takeaways this season. And now, they might get two of their top defensive backs on the field for the eagerly anticipated Black Friday showdown with the Eagles.

Nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon and outside cornerback Jaylon Johnson are designated to return from Injured Reserve. They weren't activated for Sunday's win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, but would have been full participants in practice on Tuesday. The Bears held a walkthrough, so Tuesday's injury report is an estimation.

Gordon has played in just two games this season, limited by a hamstring injury earlier in the year and now a calf injury. He hasn't played since the Bears' Week 7 win over the Saints. Former Eagle C.J. Gardner-Johnson was signed to play the nickel position in Gordon's absence.

Johnson, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, has played in only one game thus far this year due to multiple groin injuries. Johnson's return comes at an opportune time as cornerback Tyrique Stevenson would not have practiced on Tuesday due to a hip injury. Nashone Wright has started in place of Johnson, while Nick McCloud came into Sunday's game after Stevenson's injury.

Another former Eagle, linebacker T.J. Edwards, has been sidelined with hand and hamstring injuries. Edwards would not have practiced on Tuesday. Edwards' replacement, Ruben Hyppolite II, exited Sunday's game with a shoulder injury and would not have practiced on Tuesday. Amen Ogbongbemiga replaced him. The Bears are already without Pro Bowl linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, who was placed on Injured Reserve before the Week 12 win over the Steelers and linebacker Noah Sewell has been sidelined with an elbow injury.

Left tackle Theo Benedet is on pace to return to the starting lineup after being inactive against the Steelers with a quad injury. Rookie Ozzy Trapilo started for Benedet. Luke Newman, who was Chicago's sixth OL in jumbo packages against Pittsburgh, did not practice due to a foot injury. He played 22 offensive snaps in the win over the Steelers.

Defensive lineman Dominque Robinson suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter of Sunday's win and is in the concussion protocol.

Because of the short week, the Eagles held a walkthrough instead of a practice on Tuesday, so this injury report is an estimation:

Did not practice: S Drew Mukuba (ankle), RT Lane Johnson (foot), WR DeVonta Smith (shoulder/chest), DE Brandon Graham (groin), WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder)

Limited: RB Saquon Barkley (groin), S Reed Blankenship (thigh), LG Landon Dickerson (knee)

Full: CB Adoree’ Jackson (gameday concussion protocol), OT Myles Hinton (back), OL Willie Lampkin (knee/ankle)

Among the non-participants on Tuesday, the one to watch is Smith with that shoulder/chest injury. Smith has been an incredibly durable player during his NFL career but there are two fewer days to heal this week.

Barkley said after the loss in Dallas that he’s healthy but he popped back up on the injury report with a groin injury. That’s obviously something to monitor going forward as well. Barkley on Sunday had 10 carries for 22 yards.

NFL

While Jackson was evaluated for a concussion on Sunday, he did not suffer one and is not in the NFL’s concussion protocol. He was kept out of the rest of the Cowboys game for precautionary reasons but should presumably be available against the Bears on Friday.

While Blankenship (thigh) was limited to start this week, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said he expects to have Blankenship available for Friday. That’s a big deal because the Eagles will be without Mukuba, who needs surgery for an ankle fracture. Mukuba might miss the rest of his rookie season.

Graham (groin) and Gipson (shoulder) are both new injuries. Gipson was in a sling after the game.

Dickerson (knee) has been on the injury report a ton this season but has been able to play through most of his injuries. The only game he missed this season was the first Giants game in Week 6. Brett Toth played left guard in that loss.

Johnson (foot) has that Lisfranc sprain but was not put on IR because the Eagles think he could return within that initial four-week window.

That means all practice participation levels are estimates based on projections from coaches, had a typical practice been held.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Brock Wright (neck)

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

EDGE Josh Paschal (back, still on NFI) — Downgraded on Tuesday — Days remaining in evaluation: 0

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Following last Sunday’s game, things didn’t look good for Raymond to play this Thursday. However, Lions coach Dan Campbell isn’t ready to rule him out just yet. While the ankle is “stiff” and “swollen,” Campbell said they’d need to see how he was doing on Wednesday before making a decision.

Wright swapped out an ankle injury for a neck injury in Week 13 and has been estimated to have missed two practices, which is not ideal on a short week. If Wright can’t go, the Lions would need to turn to Ross Dwelley, who played a TE3 role all season.

Glasgow has been dealing with a knee injury for two weeks now, so it’s not out of the question that he took Monday off as a precaution. However, a second missed practice raises some concerns. The Lions will be hoping for good news on Wednesday, or they may need to turn to Trystan Colon at center.

Paschal is on the final day of his injury evaluation window, and while he’s appeared to have made steady incremental progress, an 11th-hour downgrade raises some red flags. While he’s expected to be activated to the 53-man roster very soon, this could be an indicator that he’s not ready to return, and with no more days remaining for evaluation, he may end up being shut down for the year.

Joseph hasn’t formally been ruled out for this week’s game, but Campbell noted that he doesn’t expect him to be available for Thursday’s game. This will be his sixth game missed, but Campbell believes it’s for the best in the long term.

”To Kerby’s credit, man, he is rehabbing, he’s putting in the work,” Campbell said on Tuesday. “He knows the work he’s putting in now will hopefully keep us from having to ride this wave up and down. ‘OK, he’s back, now he’s not able to go.’ That’s kind of what all this is about, is man, getting him to a point (where) we strengthen some of these; stabilize some of this, the muscles in this area, and get him to where, ‘Alright, here we go, man.’ Doesn’t mean it’s going to alleviate some of the pain, but it’s going to make him feel a lot better, and he will be more than functional. He will be able to produce and be ready for the next week.”

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (ankle/thumb)

RB Jacob Saylors (back/knee)

WR Isaac TeSlaa (hand)

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

RG Tate Ratledge (knee)

CB Terrion Arnold (concussion)

Vaki added a thumb injury to his injury list this week, but he has been managing to play through his injuries of late and has a chance to continue that path this week.

Saylors, like Vaki, added another injury to the list this week, but he’s estimated to have been able to practice, which is a good sign for his ability to play against the Packers.

TeSlaa swapped out an oblique injury for a hand injury this week, but he’s still been estimated to have practiced, which is a good thing considering Raymond’s status is cloudy at the moment. At this time, the rookie appears in line for a WR3 role.

“He’s gotten better and better and better. And we are, we’re asking him to do more,” Campbell said of TeSlaa on Tuesday. “And so, I do believe it’s going to come. I do believe he’ll get an uptick in production; he’ll get used a little bit more here. But I like where he’s at, he’s doing a good job.”

Sewell is likely going to take things a bit slow this week, as they finally had a game without him incurring a new injury. There doesn’t appear to be any major concerns surrounding his ankle, with regard to availability this week.

Decker typically takes days off to rest his shoulder, so it’s not overly surprising to see him estimated to be taking things easy this week. A day off wouldn’t be out of the norm, even in a week of walkthroughs.

Ratledge, like Sewell, is a full week removed from his ankle injury, and he managed to play every snap last weekend, and should be on track to start on Thursday.

Arnold continues to work his way through the NFL’s concussion protocol. Campbell noted that Arnold cleared the first hurdle on Monday and can take the necessary steps to clear protocols, even without the team holding a formal practice. He still has more steps to complete, but they’re hopeful he can return.

Full practice

G Miles Frazier (knee, still on PUP) — Days remaining in evaluation: 0

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder, still on IR) — Days remaining in evaluation: 7

S Brian Branch (toe/ankle) — Upgraded from limited

Frazier is in the final days of their injury evaluation window, and a decision on his status is imminent.

He’s been estimated to have practiced fully this week, and a move to the active roster is expected.

Davenport still has a week remaining in his injury evaluation window, but Campbell continues to reiterate that there’s a chance the edge rusher can return to the field this week.

“It would be big to be able to get him back,” Campbell said on Tuesday. “He’s done a lot to get back. the amount of work that he’s put in and the amount of rehab. And look, it’s not his fault things have happened. All you can do is go back to work and do everything you can to return and get your body healed up and come back better than you were. And he’s done everything that that requires. So, we’re hopeful. He walked through yesterday, he’s going to walk through again today, and we’ll see.”

While there are still hurdles to jump through, Campbell said it will come down to how Davenport “feels” this week, and if he believes he’ll be ready to go, there’s a chance we’ll see him on Thanksgiving Day.

Of note, the Lions have reportedly already informed nickelback Arthur Maulet that they will be releasing him, with the expectation being that this will open up one of the necessary spots.

Branch had a second injury added to his ailment list this week, but he’s estimated to have been able to practice through them and was upgraded to a full practice on Tuesday, which is an encouraging sign that he’s on track to play on Thanksgiving.

It may be too little too late for the Bengals, but Burrow is going to suit up if he's able.","Joe Burrow is expected to make his return to the field this Thanksgiving when his Cincinnati Bengals travel to take on Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. Burrow suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury back in Week 2 that required surgery, but he returned to practice two weeks ago and will return to help Cincinnati dig out of a 3-8 hole.

There are plenty of people out there questioning Burrow's decision. The franchise quarterback has a history of injuries but is returning to the field for a team that is considered a significant longshot to reach the postseason (+2500 at FanDuel). But Burrow doesn't see it that way. His job is to play football, and if he gets hurt, his job is to rehab and get back to playing football.

""I understand why people feel that way, but if you look at it from my perspective, I'm a football player and if I get hurt, I'm going to go through the rehab process and then I'm going to let everybody know when I feel like I can go out there and play,"" Burrow said, via CBS Sports' John Breech. ""I don't really know what else to say about that. I'm not ever going to go to somebody and say, 'Yeah, I'm healthy, but I don't think I should go out there and play.' That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

""I'm not going to live my life and play this game scared of something happening. Like, yeah, something is going to happen, it's football. Guys are going to get hurt, guys are going to get concussions, you're going to break bones, tear ligaments, it's a physical, intense game. That's part of this. Yeah, I've had injuries, there's not a lot I can do about that. I worked really hard to have that not happen, but what I can do is when it does happen, I can control how I'm attacking my rehab and attacking practice and doing everything in my power to get back as quickly as possible and that's what I did.""

Joe Burrow injury update: Bengals coach anticipates star QB playing on Thanksgiving vs. Ravens

Bryan DeArdo

Burrow completed 58.3% of his passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns before going down with his toe injury. It was unfortunate, as Burrow had a magnificent season in 2024, leading the NFL in both passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) while winning Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career.

When Burrow went down, Jake Browning took over as the Bengals' starting quarterback. However, after a disastrous 0-3 stretch, Cincinnati was forced to consider other options. In the first week of October, the Bengals sent a fifth-round pick to the rival Cleveland Browns for Joe Flacco and a sixth-round pick. While Flacco did jump-start the offense, the fact of the matter is he's 1-5 as the starter, and the Bengals have lost four straight.

Several players went down injured during the 26-20 game, with four of them unable to finish the contest — including a pair of starters along the offensive line.

Let’s assess the damage after rewatching the game.

Patriots injury analysis: Week 12

LG Jared Wilson: The Patriots’ left guard remained down after a 3rd-and-1 conversion by TreVeyon Henderson on the third offensive snap of the day. He walked off under own power but with a noticeable limp, and after a brief stay in the blue medical tent was carted to the locker room. Originally deemed as questionable to return, he was ruled out at the half and later diagnosed with a high ankle sprain. Wilson is considered week-to-week because of the injury. | News

S Brenden Schooler: The All-Pro special teamer went down on the kickoff following Drake Maye’s pick-six in the early second quarter. Trying to sustain a block, he tripped and fell backwards, grabbing his left ankle as he went to the ground. Schooler initially remained on the sidelines and tested out his ankle, but was eventually ruled out for the remainder of the contest at the half.

RT Morgan Moses: In the early second quarter, the Patriots’ right tackle was slow to get up following a 2-yard run. Moses left for the locker room and was announced as questionable to return because of an illness, but he did manage to come back. He returned to the game later in the second quarter, having missed seven offensive snaps, and finished the contest without any clear limitations.

DT Khyiris Tonga: New England suffered another first-half loss with 8:54 to go in the second quarter. Defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga stayed down following a pass play, requiring assistance on the field. He eventually left for the sideline, where he underwent further testing, before returning to the field on the extra point after Marcus Jones’ interception return touchdown. He remained in the lineup for the next defensive drive, but took his final snap of the day with 5:12 left in the game. Tonga was listed as questionable to return with a chest injury in the third quarter, but remained on the bench after the announcement.

LT Will Campbell: Trying to block on a perimeter run, New England’s rookie left tackle was rolled up on from his right and taken down. He remained on the ground, getting immediate medical help and undergoing testing on his right knee, including an ACL check. Campbell eventually limped off the field with members of the Patriots’ staff and headed to the blue medical tent. Like teammate Jared Wilson before him, he was eventually carted to the locker room and ruled out shortly thereafter. On Monday, it was reported that Campbell had suffered a sprained MCL that is expected to keep him out multiple weeks. | News

TE Hunter Henry: The Patriots’ leading receiver on the day, Henry was slow to get up after getting gang-tackled on a 14-yard catch-and-run midway through the fourth quarter. He was back two plays later, though, and no injury was announced.

What this means for the Patriots

The biggest names on the injury list coming out of Week 12 are Will Campbell and Jared Wilson, the Patriots’ rookie pair manning the left tackle and guard spots, respectively. Both are set to miss the upcoming game against the New York Giants, and possibly time after that as well. That being said, the team is hopeful that the two of them will be able to make a comeback later in the season and potentially be available for the start of the playoffs.

With them out, the Patriots will need to rebuild the left side of their O-line. Against Cincinnati, they did so by inserted Vederian Lowe for Campbell and Ben Brown for Wilson — a group that should remain intact for the foreseeable future, even though head coach Mike Vrabel was non-committal on Monday.

The offensive line is the biggest but not the only concern heading toward Week 13. Neither Brenden Schooler nor Khyiris Tonga were able to finish Sunday’s game as well, with the former spotted in a walking boot in the locker room after the game. Tonga, on the other hand, remained on the bench and participated in postgame handshakes, which can be interpreted as a positive sign.

Vrabel was asked about both during a press conference on Monday.

“Tonga’s never going to let anybody down as long as he’s here,” he said. “These guys want to go, and I have to look at them, I’ve got to figure out if they can, if they can protect themselves, they can do their job and not make it any worse. He clearly, from what I saw, wasn’t going to be able to do most of those things. And so, we’ll just see how he progresses through the week.”

As for Schooler, Vrabel said that he had, “[n]o update there, other than we have a busy training staff this morning.”

The Patriots will return to the practice fields on Wednesday, for their lone session before the Thanksgiving break. The session will give us a first look at the team coming off what was its most attritional contest of the season so far.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/11/gettyimages-2247695011.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.39185346903351%2C100%2C69.367189708243&w=1200,N,,2025-11-26 08:01:09.317035

The Green Bay Packers' running back was forced out of the team's Week 11 contest against the New York Giants with a knee injury. At first, the news didn't seem too promising, suggesting Jacobs would miss some time going forward.

While that may or may not be the case in the immediate future, Jacobs' time on the sidelines seems to be shrinking as the days go by.

The veteran missed Week 12's contest against the Minnesota Vikings, but has been considered day-to-day, leaving his status for Thanksgiving up in the air. Green Bay is set to visit another NFC North rival, the Detroit Lions, on the holiday.

Practice reports will tell the story here, but things are getting better for Jacobs faster than expected.

Here's the latest.

When will Josh Jacobs return?

Jacobs was listed as a limited participant on Nov. 24's estimated practice report.

The Packers have a short week ahead of them, but the running back fought to play in Week 12 before being ruled out. His status wasn't determined until inactive reports were due 90 minutes prior to kickoff, meaning there should be a good chance of his participation in Week 13, barring a setback.

Head coach Matt LaFleur came across as optimistic last week, telling reporters on Nov. 19 that Jacobs was day-to-day.

""The plan is to try to get him healthy enough to go and it's just gonna be a day-by-day thing,"" LaFleur said. ""He is truly day-to-day and we'll see how he progresses as the week unfolds.""

The overall outlook remains positive for Jacobs. He has already avoided a possible season-ending injury and also won't be subjected to a stint on injured reserve.

Tests on Nov. 17 confirmed that Jacobs' knee had no structural damage, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.

Jacobs is the unquestioned workhorse in Green Bay's backfield, but all hope isn't lost if he can't play in Week 13. Wilson and Brooks are capable of handling the job for the time being.

Wilson figures to handle more of the running downs, while Brooks profiles as the better receiving option for the Packers' offense.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/USAT/87358181007-josh-jacobs-111925.jpg?crop=6249,3515,x360,y302&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-26 08:01:12.953740

The Green Bay Packers were without top RB Josh Jacobs due to a knee injury. As a result, Emanuel Wilson stepped in as the next man up and capitalized on it for fantasy managers, scoring twice en route to 25.5 fantasy points in a win over the Vikings. We'll be monitoring Jacobs' status on the short week with the Packers facing the Lions on Thanksgiving. We'll also be looking at the overall NFL injury report with fantasy analysis for key players.

Joe Burrow, QB, Bengals (toe): We came close to seeing Burrow activated off IR in Week 12. That wasn't the case and now the expectation is Burrow will try to get on the field on Thanksgiving vs. Baltimore. It's now or never for Cincinnati and its playoff hopes. If Burrow is back, it's an upgrade for all the receivers. It will be interesting to see if Chase Brown maintains his volume of carries; he has 27 combined carries over the past two games. It seems like Burrow could be without one his key weapons.

Tee Higgins, WR, Bengals (head): Higgins went down hard on a catch attempt late in the team's loss to New England on Sunday. He wasn't able to return after suffering a concussion. Head coach Zac Taylor has already ruled Higgins out when the Bengals play on Thursday night vs. the Ravens. Ja'Marr Chase returns from suspension and should go back to heavy target volume — especially with Burrow expected back. Andrei Iosivas could see more work and is an intriguing add off the waiver wire with Higgins out. Also keep an eye on TE Mike Gesicki, who could have streaming value.

Baker Mayfield, QB, Bucs (shoulder): The Tampa Bay QB was forced from Sunday Night Football vs. the Rams in the second quarter after suffering a sprain in his non-throwing shoulder. By that point, the Bucs were getting run out of the stadium in a 34-7 loss, so there wasn't much reason for Mayfield to risk further injury trying to return. Teddy Bridgewater came in relief and didn't do much with 62 yards on 8 of 15 attempts. Mayfield is set to undergo an MRI on Monday, then we'll know more about his status for Week 13 vs. the Cardinals.

Aaron Rodgers, QB, Steelers (wrist): Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin anticipates Rodgers being ready for Week 13 vs. the Bills. Rodgers was held out of Week 12's loss to the Bears due to a fractured left wrist. It's Rodgers' non-throwing hand so the team likely wanted a bit more time for it to heal. With Rodgers potentially back, it would provide a slight boost in value for receivers DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin III. Pittsburgh should continue to lean into the run game with Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, the two best fantasy starts on this team right now.

Josh Jacobs, RB, Packers (knee): As we mentioned above, Jacobs was out last week due to the knee injury. He had been getting limited practices in prior to Week 12 and Green Bay knew it had the short week with the Thanksgiving game vs. Detroit. There's a chance Jacobs could have played this week if it were the playoffs. With that said, the short turnaround could mean he sits another game to get extra rest. Wilson looked serviceable in relief on Sunday vs. the Vikings. He'll remain a very strong RB start in fantasy if Jacobs is out again.

Drake London, WR, Falcons (knee): This is rough for all parties. London missed Week 12 and there's a chance the Falcons play it safe with their top wideout. If that's the case, we may not see London back on the field in 2025. It would be a big blow to fantasy managers and Atlanta's offense. QB Michael Penix Jr. is done for the season and backup Kirk Cousins threw for two TDs and 199 yards and a pick vs. the Saints on Sunday. Darnell Mooney saved his fantasy day by catching a 49-yard TD to finish with a 3-74-1 line. There isn't much value in this Falcons passing game with London out and Cousins under center.

Alvin Kamara, RB, Saints (knee): Kamara exited in the first half of Sunday afternoon's matchup vs. the Falcons and did not return. He had five touches for 15 yards prior to exiting. Devin Neal stepped in and got the majority of the work in the backfield. He finished with seven carries for 18 yards while also catching five of seven targets for 43 yards. If Kamara misses any time, Neal would be the last healthy back left. Kendre Miller went down for the season back Week 7. Neal would have some flex value given his involvement in the passing game from Week 12 and the Saints likely needing to pass more as six-point underdogs against the Dolphins.

Jayden Daniels, QB, Commanders (elbow): We got a brief update on Daniels on Monday after the Commanders' bye week. He's a long-shot to play in Week 13 vs. the Broncos, but is expected to return to practice in some capacity. That feels encouraging for his prospects of making it back on the field again this season, though it doesn't exactly feel like a smart move with Washington sitting at 3-8 on the season. With Daniels expected out again, Marcus Mariota will start against one of the toughest matchups in the NFL.

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Vikings (concussion): The Minnesota signal caller was placed into the NFL's protocol for this week after showing symptoms following the loss to Green Bay in Week 12. With at least two interceptions in each of the past three games, McCarthy was trending down big time before the injury. Max Brosmer is taking first-team reps and is on track to face the Seahawks in Week 13. It can't get much worse for the Vikings offense with J.J. throwing the ball, so perhaps Brosmer could lift WRs Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison back to fantasy relevance.

Omarion Hampton, RB, Chargers (ankle): Hampton has been on injured reserve since Week 6 due to an ankle injury. His 21-day practice window for a return has been opened, so it appears the rookie back is close to getting on the field again. We'll have to see if the team eases Hampton back into the rotation, seemingly with RB Kimani Vidal, who has filled in admirably in a lead role.

Here is the Bills vs. Steelers injury report for Week 13:

Buffalo Bills injury report for Week 13

Dalton Kincaid, TE, hamstring

Dalton Kincaid has missed the last two games since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 10.

He hobbled off the field grabbing his right hamstring in the third quarter of Week 10 and walked to the Bills locker room with trainers. Kincaid did not return.

Kincaid, who missed Week 6 with an oblique injury, has 29 catches for 448 receiving yards and a team-high four touchdown receptions.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard walked into the locker room holding his right arm in the third quarter and returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling.

The Bills' defensive captain was injured after being in on a tackle for a 1-yard loss on Houston running back Nick Chubb. Bernard lied on his stomach in pain and rolled onto his back holding his right arm as he was tended to by athletic trainers. He got to his feet and walked into the locker room with a trainer holding his right arm.

He was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Bernard is considered week-to-week, according to Bills head coach Sean McDermott.

Bernard has 56 tackles, seven tackles for loss, one interception and two fumble recoveries in 10 games in 2025.

Spencer Brown, OT, shoulder

Spencer Brown was evaluated for an injury after grabbing his right shoulder in the third quarter and was cleared to return. Brown struggled after re-entering the game and was replaced in the fourth quarter by Ryan Van Demark.

Brown was spotted with his arm in a sling in the locker room after the game.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Nov. 21 that Brown ""potentially"" could go on injured reserve.

Maxwell Hairston, CB, concussion

Maxwell Hairston is in the league's concussion protocol after suffering a concussion in Week 12.

He was injured in the third quarter when his helmet crashed into the side of Houston running back Woody Marks. Hairston did not come back into the game.

Josh Allen, QB, shoulder

Josh Allen experienced an injury scare in the loss to the Texans in Week 12.

Late in the first quarter, Allen stepped up in the pocket and cocked his arm back to throw near the line of scrimmage when he was walloped by Houston Texans defensive end Will Anderson Jr. from behind.

Allen face-planted to the ground, kicked his legs while on his stomach and then rolled onto his back still kicking his leg in pain and holding his hands together.

The quarterback walked to the sideline and took a seat on the bench. He put his helmet on, warmed up on the sideline and returned for the Bills' next series.

""We're good,"" Allen said in his postgame press conference when asked if he was injured. He said he landed on his left shoulder and it ""went a little numb on me.""

""Josh Allen is sore, but we expect him to be fine,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Nov. 21.

Christian Benford, CB, shoulder

Christian Benford walked off the field with trainers and went into the blue medical tent late in second quarter against the Texans in Week 12. He was evaluated for a shoulder injury and cleared to return for the second half.

A.J. Epenesa, DE, neck

A.J. Epenesa was evaluated for a neck injury in the second half and was cleared to return against the Texans in Week 12.

Epenesa finished with three tackles and played 24 defensive snaps and one snap on special teams.

Connor McGovern, C

Connor McGovern went down in third third quarter on a play which Josh Allen was sacked but he did not miss any time.

Curtis Samuel, WR, elbow/neck

Curtis Samuel did not play in Week 12 due to elbow/neck injuries.

Phidarian Mathis, DT, shoulder

Phidarian Mathis was inactive with a shoulder injury in Week 11 and Week 12.

Shaq Thompson, LB, hamstring

Shaq Thompson returned in Week 12 after being out three straight games after reaggravating a hamstring in practice in the week leading up to Week 9.

Thompson posted four tackles while playing 34 defensive snaps and 11 special teams snaps against the Texans.

The 11th-year linebacker initially had a nagging hamstring injury in training camp.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Mecole Hardman, WR, calf

Mecole Hardman was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 20 after playing one game the Bills.

He was injured in Week 11 and did not return after suffering a calf injury in the third quarter. Hardman's first touch with was a 61-yard kickoff return in the first quarter. He muffed a punt that resulted in a lost fumble the third quarter, which is when he suffered the calf injury.

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which will require surgery and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and is eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

Oliver is tied for the team lead with three sacks despite only plying in three of the Bills' seven games.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp ha 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Tylan Grable, OL, concussion

The 2024 sixth-rounder has been in the concussion protocol since Aug. 7 and is on IR with a return designation.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

Pittsburgh Steelers injury report for Week 13

Aaron Rodgers, QB, wrist

Aaron Rodgers did not play in the Week 12 loss to the Chicago Bears. Rodgers suffered a broken bone in his left wrist in Week 11.

The 41-year-old quarterback came into Week 12 as questionable after logging limited practices on Thursday and Friday leading up to the game but was inactive.

""He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomin said prior to kickoff against the Bears. ""So, he won't be playing this week.""

Mason Rudolph started at quarterback and completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards with one touchdown and one interception as Pittsburgh fell 31-28 to Chicago.

DK Metcalf, WR, ankle

DK Metcalf hopped off the field with a left ankle injury in the second quarter of the loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday. Metcalf was evaluated by athletic trainers on the bench and went into the blue medical tent.

He returned to the game but exited in the third quarter when his ankle was rolled on while blocking on an end around to tight end Jonnu Smith.

Metcalf came back into the game and finished with five receptions for 22 yards and two carries for 12 yards and a touchdown.

Jackson sat out Monday's walk-through practice as the Ravens quickly turn the page to get ready for the AFC North rival Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving night at M&T Bank Stadium.

Jackson had knee soreness after the Week 10 win in Minnesota and an ankle injury last week as he got ready for the New York Jets. This week, he's listed with a toe injury.

Asked about Jackson's health, Harbaugh said, ""he's good,"" and reiterated that Jackson is doing what he needs to win football games.

Jackson refused to blame his injury for the Ravens' offensive sluggishness the past couple weeks, and wide receiver Zay Flowers said Monday that he ""can't really tell"" if Jackson is hampered by his ailments.

""I feel like he wouldn't put himself in a bad position if he wasn't healthy,"" Flowers said. ""I don't think he would jeopardize it.""

Monday's injury report is an estimation based on the walk-through, but safety Kyle Hamilton (ankle), nose tackle Travis Jones (ankle), and defensive tackle Taven Bryan (knee) were also non-participants.

Harbaugh said Hamilton, who left the game late in the fourth quarter, will ""have a chance"" to play Thursday night. Bryan could land on short-term injured reserve.

In good news, wide receiver Rashod Bateman (ankle) and cornerback Keyon Martin (rib) returned to practice for limited work. Bateman has missed the past two games and Martin was sidelined for one.

Getting Bateman back on the field could help spark the Ravens offense, which will be going against a Bengals defense ranked last in the league with 32.7 points allowed per game.

""Hopefully, we have a game that we want on offense so we can get going in the direction that we want to go in,"" Flowers said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/u92t8tk0yfkck7eblfz7,N,,2025-11-26 08:01:33.990370

Totally generational bro, for real. Those would be some seriously generational trivia answers. I don't know if I've ever heard of anything as generational as that.

Looking for the top NFL players to watch this season? Redditors have compiled a comprehensive list of the best players in the league for 2024. Here are some of the standout athletes across various positions:

Quarterbacks

Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens) - #1

""Being completely objective for a second, I think Lamar Jackson has the highest ceiling of any football player I've ever seen.""

""Lamar is number 1. All is right with the world.""

Josh Allen (Buffalo Bills) - #3

""I know some people will argue about Lamar/Allen and who deserves #1 (like the MVP race), but both are definitely deserving about being top 2.""

Joe Burrow (Cincinnati Bengals) - #5

""The breakdowns of Joe and Ja'Marr in this post are poetry, though.""

Jared Goff (Detroit Lions) - #65

""Baker over Goff is the big surprise for this section. I agree they’re both in that range of 5-10 for QB where ranking of the group is debatable.""

Wide Receivers

Ja'Marr Chase (Cincinnati Bengals) - #4

""Holy shit, that long TD against the panthers - Chase is so damn good""

Justin Jefferson (Minnesota Vikings) - #10

""There's a lot of elite players, but then there's a handful at the very top above the elite. Justin Jefferson is definitely in that conversation""

""He holds the record for receiving yards in each of his first five seasons—yes, every one of them. He is the fastest WR to ever reach 5000 yards.""

Puka Nacua (Los Angeles Rams) - #69

""Puka, Goff, and Verse. Today is a big day for my heart.""

Running Backs

Saquon Barkley (New York Giants) - #2

Derrick Henry (Tennessee Titans) - #9

""I just want to shoutout /u/broccolibolibush42 for the fantastic write-up of King Henry. Very entertaining and you did him proud.""

Defensive Players

Patrick Surtain (Denver Broncos) - #6

""As someone that was a Surtain truther based wholly on my uneducated impressions, it is nice to see the numbers showing what an absolute beast he is.""

Myles Garrett (Cleveland Browns) - #7

Xavier McKinney (Green Bay Packers) - #t-29

""NFC North Gandhi* over here trying to prevent a Lions-Packers bloodbath in the comment section with that 'T-29th' for McKinney and Joseph.""

Jalen Carter (Philadelphia Eagles) - #25

""Carter was ranked the #5 interior defender of the 2024 season per PFF... Carter is two. That’s showing up.""

Vita Vea (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) - #67

""I knew nothing about Vita Vea until the Bucs/Chiefs superbowl, and apparently him returning was a big deal. It was, in fact, a big deal. He's an actual Balrog.""

Offensive Linemen

Lane Johnson (Philadelphia Eagles) - #8

""Pave the Lane""

Trey Smith (Kansas City Chiefs) - #70

Tight Ends

George Kittle (San Francisco 49ers) - #21

""Thank god the voters had some sense and voted Kittle over Bowers. Better rate stats across the board and a much better blocker.""

Historical Significance: Redditors emphasize the unprecedented nature of the comeback:

Falcons' Play-Calling Blunders: The Falcons' decisions in the final quarter contributed significantly to their collapse:

""Proceeds to throw on first down, get sacked, hold, and then lose 30 yards of yardage just to punt. Absolute masterclass""

""Shanahan totally lost in his own genious. Run the ball three times. Take it to the two minute warning. Kick the field goal. Go to Disney World.""

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Every coach in the NFL talks about how hard it is to win games.

Mike Vrabel hopes the New England Patriots' 26-20 comeback victory over the struggling Cincinnati Bengals was a reminder to his team that even after becoming the NFL’s first team to 10 wins this season, it will need to bring its best every week to keep stacking victories.

“I think that they found a way to win,” Vrabel said. “We’ll have to kind of keep that fine balance of understanding that wins are important, but improving at this time of the year is what’s most important.”

That is especially true for a team that will likely head into a “Monday Night Football” matchup with the New York Giants without two starters on an offense line that has been one of the most stable in the league.

Left guard Jared Wilson limped off in the first series of Sunday’s win with an ankle injury, and rookie left tackle Will Campbell was carted off in the third quarter with a knee injury.

It marked the biggest shakeup this season for the starting group of Campbell, Wilson, center Garrett Bradbury, right guard Mike Onwenu and right tackle Moses Morgan that has started 11 of 12 games. The lone deviation from that quintet was in Week 4 when Ben Brown started in place of Wilson, who was inactive with ankle and knee injuries.

Vrabel said Monday that Campbell’s injury would require him to miss some games.

“He won’t be out there this week. It’s going to be a couple weeks,” Vrabel said. “We’ll have to make a decision here on the roster to see how long that will be and go from there. But it’s nothing that’s going to, hopefully, put him out for the entire season.”

The coach was a little more optimistic about the prospects for Wilson, saying his status would be dependent upon how he responds to rehab and practice.

Vederian Lowe replaced Campbell on Sunday, with Brown again taking Wilson’s spot. If Wilson and Campbell remain out for an extended period, the good news is both Brown and Lowe have ample starting experience. Lowe started 13 games at left tackle last season and Brown logged 10 starts at center in 2024 after David Andrews went on injured reserve.

What’s working

Last season, Maye struggled to find people to throw the ball to. This season, he continues to have his pick of capable pass catchers.

Following tight end Hunter Henry’s seven-catch, 115-yard performance Sunday, the Patriots have had four straight games with a 100-yard receiver. Henry joined wide receiver DeMario Douglas (100 yards vs. Atlanta on Nov. 2), receiver Mack Hollins (106 at Tampa Bay on Nov. 9) and receiver Stefon Diggs (105 vs. the New York Jets on Nov. 13. It's the first time the team has had a 100-yard receiver in four straight games since the 2018 season.

What needs help

The Patriots twice failed to score touchdowns with the ball on the 1-yard line.

Leading 17-13 in the third quarter, they had a touchdown pass to Henry nullified by an offensive pass interference call on Hollins. Two plays later, on fourth down, Rhamondre Stevenson was stopped on a run short of the goal line.

Ahead 20-13 in the fourth, Maye’s third-down quarterback sneak attempt on the goal line was stuffed, forcing them to settle for a field goal.

Stock up

Cornerback Marcus Jones, fresh off winning AFC defensive player of the month in October, returned a second-quarter interception 33 yards for a touchdown. It marked the second pick-6 of his career and second against Cincinnati. He also had an INT that he returned 69 yards for a TD against the Bengals as a rookie in 2022.

Stock down

With defensive tackle Milton Williams sitting out for the first time this season and Khyiris Tonga leaving early in the first quarter with a chest injury, the Patriots — who came in allowing an NFL-low 84.7 yards rushing per game — gave up 107 to Bengals running back Chase Brown. It was the most yards allowed by New England to a running back this season.

Injuries

Further testing was planned to reveal the severity of the injuries to Wilson and Campbell. But the extent of Tonga’s chest injury and an ankle injury to special teamer Brendan Schooler are also ones to watch heading into Monday.

Key number

4 — The Patriots have had streaks of at least nine straight wins in a season four times in team history. In addition to this season, they had a 12-game winning streak in 2003, a 16-game streak in 2007 and a 10-game streak in 2015.

Next steps

New England returns home to host the New York Giants next Monday night in its final game before its bye.

Share your views and thoughts on tonight's game at live@theathletic.com

The ""MVP!"" chants were loud and present at SoFi Stadium as Matthew Stafford was putting on the full display of what has turned his 17th NFL season into his best yet. He was lofting deep passes to Davante Adams, converting a 3rd-and-19 to Puka Nacua and tossing a no-look touchdown pass to Colby Parkinson as Todd Bowles' Buccaneers had zero answers for him, much like the rest of the NFL this season.

Stafford is up to 30 touchdowns and two interceptions, and over the past eight games, he's tossed 25 touchdowns without a single pick. He's now one of four quarterbacks to start a season with a touchdown-to-interception ratio this strong, joining a class of Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.

For as long as Stafford can be this dialed in before the snap and after, the Rams will absorb the personnel losses they're seeing around him. He took the field down three original starters in wide receiver Tutu Atwell, tight end Tyler Higbee and right tackle Rob Havenstein. But with Adams and Nacua at his disposal, everything is working for Stafford as he plays in a special kind of unison with what Sean McVay is dialing up for him.

Much of this Rams season to date has been about whether the offense and defense could be prolific enough to make up for a disastrous special teams unit. That was especially true with the field goals, as Joshua Karty missed more kicks than anyone else prior to his benching.

But not only have the Rams solidified their protection as well as their snaps with Jake McQuaide over the past few games, but they might have found a kicker, too. Harrison Mevis is now 13-for-13 on extra points, and he got to try his first two field goal attempts and knocked those through from 40 and 52 yards.

Mevis has always had a strong leg, dating back to when he set a Southeastern Conference record with a 61-yard game-winner at Missouri. But if he can add a steadiness to the operation in addition to the potential to hit from distance, he'll make this Rams team that much harder to keep from scoring with how Matthew Stafford is playing.

This week was supposed to be a major challenge for the Rams defensive backfield. They were facing Baker Mayfield, Emeka Egbuka and Chris Godwin with a group that was now down its top two players, with cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon and safety Quentin Lake on injured reserve. But all it meant was that someone other than Lake could be the star on the back end.

Cobie Durant ripped a pass out of a receivers hands and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. added his second interception in three games in addition to five pass deflections. And with Kobie Turner and Jared Verse winning in the pass rush, the group held Mayfield to his worst game of the season, as he finished 9-of-19 for 41 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions before leaving the game with a shoulder injury.

The 103 yards the secondary allowed to Mayfield and Teddy Bridgewater combined are their fewest in a game this season.

The challenges will still come in communication and alignment for younger and newer defenders as the season trudges on without Lake, who is targeting a return for the postseason. But Witherspoon could be back in the next month, which would open Durant up to slide inside and allow the Rams to continue to get playmakers on the field in their dime looks.

Above are the updated standings for the NFC West. With tonight's win, the Los Angeles Rams improve to 9-2 and are atop the NFC standings as the No. 1 seed. They are one game up on the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC West and a game ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears for the NFC's No. 1 seed.

The Rams also lead the NFC West in point differential with 127.

Above are the latest NFC South standings with Tampa Bay Buccaneers are currently tied atop the NFC South with the Carolina Panthers at 6-5.

The Panthers still have a game to play against the San Francisco 49ers on “Monday Night Football.” With a win, the Panthers could lead the NFC South.

Tampa Bay still has two games remaining against Carolina, which likely will determine the NFC South champion. The Buccaneers lead the division in point differential at -25. All four teams in the NFC South have a negative point differential.

After Baker Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury, Teddy Bridgewater was tasked with guiding the Bucs offense in the second half and it was a difficult watch.

The veteran completed 8-of-15 passes for just 62 yards and he was sacked twice while being pressured often. He also rushed once for six yards. The offense did not look good all night but looked especially clunky with Bridgewater at the helm.

It remains to be seen if Mayfield will miss time with his injury.

Colby Parkinson was the only player on the Rams offense to find the end zone tonight aside from Davante Adams.

The tight end is a quality route runner at his size and can be dynamic after the catch. He caught all four of his targets for 41 yards, including a 5-yard touchdown courtesy of Matthew Stafford in the first half.

With the attention Adams and Puka Nacua draw, Parkinson and the rest of the Rams offense will have opportunities to make plays.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/OsCJSFXZCwdz_yhAnMm04XKaU_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-11-24 06:01:16.771704

After Sunday's 23-10 win over the New York Jets, Jackson said knee and ankle injuries haven't affected his play, even though he's mired in one of the biggest slumps of his decorated eight-year career.

""I feel like we just need to execute a lot better,"" said Jackson, who finished Sunday with 12-of-23 passing for 153 yards. ""We get in great field position, but we're not pulling points on the board. That has nothing to do with an injury.""

Jackson has been held under 200 yards passing for three straight games for the first time in five years. He has also gone back-to-back games without a touchdown pass for the first time in six years.

During this rut, the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player was sidelined for one practice two weeks ago because of knee soreness and was absent from one practice last week because of an ankle injury. Jackson acknowledged last week that he might continue to miss one practice a week for body maintenance.

One of the biggest changes in Jackson's games has been a decrease in his rushing. Jackson, who holds the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback, is averaging a career-low 29.6 yards rushing per game.

""I'm out there so I feel like I should still be able to do what I do,"" said Jackson, who ran 11 yards on seven rushing attempts.

Jackson, who entered Sunday with the NFL's highest career passer rating at 102.8, has produced a 62.8 rating over the past three games. In wins over the Vikings, Browns and Jets, Jackson has completed 57.1% of his passes (44-of-77) for 522 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.

Ravens coach John Harbaugh said he has the ""utmost confidence"" in Jackson.

""He's our guy, he's our quarterback and Lamar's doing what he needs to do,"" Harbaugh said. ""He is winning football games and it's not always pretty. The pretty games will be there. They'll be there for Lamar Jackson, you can bet on that. But I'm proud of him right now. I'm really proud of him, the way he's fighting to win football games.""

The Ravens (6-5) have won five straight games to go from last place in the AFC North to a tie atop the division with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But it has been defense, which has held the past six opponents under 20 points, that has carried Baltimore.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley has talked with Jackson about how their execution needs to improve on offense to achieve their Super Bowl aspirations.

""So while winning is great, to reach our goals, we know we need to be better,"" Stanley said.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1123%2Fr1579807_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 06:01:29.637127

Rodgers will reportedly miss the team's Week 12 game against the Chicago Bears due to a fracture in his left wrist, per NFL Network.

As a result, Mason Rudolph will get the start against the Bears, with rookie Will Howard serving as Rudolph's backup. Rodgers will be inactive for the contest.

Despite sustaining the injury in Week 11, Rodgers refused to rule himself out for Week 12. The quarterback was even able to put in two limited practices during the week, receiving a ""questionable"" designation ahead of Sunday's game.

But that turnaround proved to be too quick, per Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero, who expect Rodgers will be able to return for Week 13.

With the news, Rodgers will miss Sunday's contest against the Bears. Rodgers has dominated the franchise, going 24-5 against Chicago over his career. He's thrown 64 touchdowns against the Bears in those 29 starts, his most against any NFL franchise.

Through 10 games this season, the 41-year-old Rodgers has thrown 19 touchdowns against seven interceptions with the Steelers. He's led the team to a 6-4 record.

Rudolph, 30, has appeared in three games this season in limited action. He hasn't started a game since Week 17 of last season, when Rudolph led the Tennessee Titans to a 20-13 loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

And they seemed well on their way, taking a 21-point lead in the first half. But the Eagles couldn't hold the lead as the offense sputtered in the second half, injuries mounted on defense, and the Cowboys came back.

They scored three straight touchdowns, then won the game on a last-second 42-yard field goal by Brandon Aubrey.

The Eagles fell to 8-3 on the season.

The Delaware News Journal provided live coverage of the Eagles game against the Cowboys. Here is how their loss unfolded:

Eagles 21, Cowboys 21: Dak Prescott TD erases Birds' big lead

The Cowboys overcame a 21-0 deficit and tied the game on Dak Prescott's 7-yard run with 11:40 left in the fourth quarter. The Eagles' depleted secondary, down Adoree Jackson and Reed Blankenship, couldn't stop Dallas. Prescott hit George Pickens for a 43-yard reception down to the Eagles' 11 with Cooper DeJean in coverage. DeJean was playing on the outside after Jackson left with a concussion in the third quarter.

Prescott scored two plays later.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 14: Adoree Jackson, Reed Blankenship hurt

The Cowboys pulled closer as the Eagles offense sputtered, and three defenders left a third-quarter drive with injuries. Cornerback Adoree Jackson (concussion) and defensive tackle Moro Ojomo (undisclosed) left on successive plays. Later in the drive, safety Reed Blankenship was hurt.

The Cowboys took advantage of Cooper DeJean moving to the outside, and also Kelee Ringo coming into the game after Blankenship was hurt. They scored on Dak Prescott's 4-yard pass to Brevyn Spann-Ford with 2:02 left in the third.

Halftime update: Eagles 21, Cowboys 7

The Eagles offense broke out in a big way, at least early on. That was particularly true of wide receiver A.J. Brown, who had 5 catches for 67 yards and a touchdown in the first quarter.

Not to be overlooked, DeVonta Smith had an incredible backwards flip catch that went for 42 yards setting up another touchdown.

But the Eagles also got some help by some careless play by the Cowboys to take a 21-7 lead into halftime. The Cowboys lost a fumble, threw an interception into the end zone, and were called for a roughing the kicker penalty on an Eagles punt.

The Eagles took advantage of most of that. Jalen Hurts was 13-for-19 for 164 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 2 more, one on a tush push.

The Cowboys, however, outgained the Eagles 211-195 and got on the board with 21 seconds left on George Pickens' 1-yard TD.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 0: Reed Blankenship INT on Dak Prescott in end zone

The Cowboys have been their own worst enemy. They lost a fumble, they were called for roughing the kicker on a punt. And now, with their best chance to get back in the game, Eagles' safety Reed Blankenship made a diving interception in the end zone.

The Cowboys faced a 2nd-and-goal from the 1 when Tyler Guyton was called for a false start, pushing Dallas back to the 6. That's when Prescott tried for CeeDee Lamb in the end zone. But Blankenship dove and picked it off, giving the Eagles the ball at their 20.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 0: DeVonta Smith's incredible backwards flip

The Eagles extended their lead, helped in large part by an incredible backwards flip reception by DeVonta Smith. On 3rd-and-13 from the 47, Jalen Hurts threw deep for Smith, who caught the ball falling backwards, then flipped over. He held onto the ball for a 42-yard reception to the Cowboys' 11.

Smith then went 10 yards on a jet sweep down to the 1. Hurts then finished the job with a tush push TD for a 21-0 lead with 11:32 left in the second quarter.

Eagles 14, Cowboys 0: Jalen Hurts scores, A.J. Brown big factor

A.J. Brown must be happy now, even though he had a 7-yard TD taken off the board after a replay ruled he was out of bounds. No big deal. Jalen Hurts ran a QB draw for the touchdown, giving the Eagles a 14-0 lead with 57 seconds left in the first quarter. So far, Brown has 5 catches for 67 yards.

The Eagles got a break when the Cowboys' Ryan Flournoy was called for roughing the kicker as Braden Mann punted. That gave the Eagles a first down, and they took advantage.

Eagles 7, Cowboys 0: Jalen Hurts goes to A.J. Brown for TD

The Eagles took advantage after they stopped the Cowboys on 4th-and-3 from midfield to get a quick touchdown drive. And it was Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown, the subject of controversy the past two weeks, who hooked up. Hurts went to Brown on the first two plays, connecting for 6 and 10 yards. Then they capped the drive with a 15-yard touchdown with 8:41 left in the first quarter.

This came after the Cowboys tried going for it on 4th down from midfield. Was that a sign of disrespect for the Eagles offense?

Eagles inactives: Lane Johnson is out, Cam Jurgens in

As expected, star right tackle Lane Johnson is sitting out with a Lisfranc injury. He's being replaced in the starting lineup by Fred Johnson. Lane Johnson could miss a few more games. But he did not go on IR.

But center Cam Jurgens is playing after he was cleared out of the NFL's concussion protocol. Still, Jurgens will have a brace on his knee after missing two games on Oct. 26 and Nov. 10. He returned vs the Lions on Nov. 16, but left in the fourth quarter with the concussion.

Brett Toth took Jurgens' place while he's been out.

The Eagles' other inactives are QB Sam Howell, CB Mac McWilliams, RB A.J. Dillon and DT Ty Robinson.

Lane Johnson not placed on IR. When will he return?

Interestingly, the Eagles did not place right tackle Lane Johnson on injured reserve, a sign that they expect him back within the four-game minimum that he would have to miss by going on IR. Johnson suffered a Lisfranc injury in the Nov. 16 game against the Lions. Reports indicated Johnson would miss 4-6 weeks. If he needed surgery, he'd be out for the season.

Johnson thus does not need surgery. If he had gone on IR, he wouldn't be eligible to return until Dec. 14 when the Eagles host the Las Vegas Raiders. So either that day or the Dec. 8 game against the Chargers in Los Angeles would seem to be the timetable.

Eagles vs. Cowboys prediction

Eagles 24, Cowboys 19: As much as the Eagles' offense could use a breakout game, the determining factor could be Carter's revenge game. Carter was infamously ejected for spitting on Cowboys QB Dak Prescott before the first snap on Sept. 4. Needless to say, the Eagles missed him. As well as the defense has played in the last two games, Carter has been the linchpin. No doubt, Carter is looking forward to getting within spitting distance of Prescott ... without actually spitting on him. – Martin Frank

Eagles injury updates

The Eagles originally listed C Cam Jurgens (concussion) as QUESTIONABLE, but then cleared him to play on Nov. 22. The Eagles also listed G/C Willie Lampkin (knee/ankle) and T Myles Hinton (back) as QUESTIONABLE. But both are still on IR and have yet to be activated.

Cowboys injury updates

The Cowboys listed T Hakeem Adeniji (illness) and DE Jadeveon Clowney (shoulder/neck) as QUESTIONABLE. Everyone else has been cleared to play.

Weather forecast for Eagles vs Cowboys

Normally, this would be a good day to have the roof opened at AT&T Stadium, with late fall temperatures expected in the upper-60s under partly cloudy skies at game time. But the retractable roof will likely be closed as the game goes along. While there's just a 5% chance for rain when the game starts, it increases to 70% by the end. And those are expected to be heavy rains.

It's their third loss in four games, as they continue to play without some of their top offensive contributors.

Buccaneers all-time leading receiver Mike Evans is among those playmakers who have been out of action. Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the team's loss to the Detroit Lions on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 7 and has been out since the injury required surgery.

Baker Mayfield has had to rely on tertiary options as Evans' absence has been a significant blow to the Bucs, and he'll remain out for tonight's ""Sunday Night Football"" clash against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 12.

Like many teams around the NFL, Tampa Bay is dealing with many injuries across its roster. Chris Godwin and Bucky Irving have also missed multiple games but Tampa Bay has remained in the thick of the playoff picture.

When will Evans be able to return to the field? Here's the latest on the Buccaneers' veteran:

When will Mike Evans return?

Evans' injury will keep him off the field for most of the season, but there is a possibility of a return in December.

According to multiple reports, Evans underwent surgery to repair the clavicle fracture, which the NFL Network described as a ""clean break."" This suggests that, with no setbacks, he could return in about two months.

If the eight-week timeline from the injury holds, Evans might be able to return in Week 15, when the Buccaneers host the Falcons on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Dec. 11, or in Week 16, when they play on the road against the Panthers on Dec. 21.

Evans was placed on injured reserve (IR) and has not yet been designated to return. Once the Buccaneers open his practice window, they will have 21 days to activate him.

The Buccaneers remain in first place in the NFC South entering Week 11 but the Carolina Panthers are right on their heels at 6-5. Tampa Bay can certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push as the season progresses.

Here's a look at who the Buccaneers will have at wide receiver while Evans remains sidelined:

Emeka Egbuka

Chris Godwin (injured)

Tez Johnson

Ryan Miller

Kameron Johnson

Sterling Shepard

Dennis Houston (practice squad)

Garrett Greene (practice squad)

Godwin reaggravated his fibula injury and missed Week 8, and has remained out since. Without the pair of vets, Egbuka, the team's first-round pick in this year's draft, has led the receivers and is among the league leaders in multiple categories.

McMillan remains sidelined with a neck injury, which has forced the 10-year veteran Shepard alongside rookie seventh-rounder Tez Johson into action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/USAT/87346264007-2242274598.jpg?crop=5859,3296,x130,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-24 06:01:57.098471

They have been without Bucky Irving, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin for extended periods of time, but never Baker Mayfield. The engine that powers the Tampa offense, Mayfield has been one of the only things keeping Tampa's ship afloat.

That is potentially going to be put to the test on ""Sunday Night Football,"" as Mayfield entered and exited the blue medical tent in the first half. Now, the starting quarterback will be out for the remainder of the game, and potentially beyond, depending on the results of forthcoming tests.

Here's the latest on the Buccaneers quarterback:

Baker Mayfield injury update

Mayfield suffered a left (non-throwing) shoulder sprain in Week 12 and will receive an MRI on Nov. 24, according to head coach Todd Bowles.

Bowles added that Mayfield hurt the shoulder initially earlier in the game, but reaggravated it at the end of the first half.

""Teddy [Bridgewater] will play if he's out for some time, obviously we'll bring up Connor [Bazelak] from [the practice squad] and then we'll go from there,"" Bowles said. ""Very confident in what Teddy can do with a full week of practice, taking every snap and every play, we think he'll be fine.""

Mayfield was ruled out for the remainder of ""Sunday Night Football"" in Week 12. He was spotted on the sidelines with his left arm in a sling in the second half.

Teddy Bridgewater replaced Mayfield to begin the second half, who was listed as doubtful to return with a shoulder injury, the Buccaneers announced.

His discomfort was on full display at the end of the first half.

The quarterback heaved up a pass, hoping for a last-second score, but his pass was intercepted. While Emmanuel Forbes Jr. tried to run it back for a Rams' touchdown, Mayfield was down and in plenty of pain. He ultimately walked off, but the shoulder issue is clearly bothering him and will be something to watch in the second half.

Mayfield returned to the game and didn't miss a play for the Buccaneers' offense after the initial medical tent visit.

The team said that Mayfield was being evaluated for a left shoulder injury.

The passer was seen favoring his left arm and slammed his helmet down before entering the medical tent.

NBC's Melissa Stark also noted that the independent doctor was evaluating the hit to Mayfield's head, checking for a possible concussion.

Teddy Bridgewater

The Bucs only carry two quarterbacks on their active roster, leaving the veteran Bridgewater as the backup. Mayfield's toughness is one of his best attributes, meaning there isn't normally much risk for the starter leaving the contest.

Campbell was seen walking out of Paycor Stadium with a black brace covering his leg and knee.

The injury occurred on a 4-yard run to the left side, with Campbell pulling to that side and ultimately having his leg landed on at the end of the play. Patriots players kneeled around Campbell, who had a towel draped over his head as he was carted off.

He was officially ruled out in the fourth quarter, and coach Mike Vrabel didn't have an update on him after the game.

In addition to Campbell, starting left guard Jared Wilson was carted off with an ankle injury in the first quarter -- a second blow to a Patriots team that had mostly been fortunate health-wise up to this point in the season. Wilson was seen departing the stadium with a boot on his right foot and the aid of a crutch.

Players were hoping for the best on both injuries but acknowledged the situation looked ominous.

Asked what advice he might give to Campbell after recovering from a knee injury sustained last October, receiver Stefon Diggs said: ""I hope he's back. I hope it's not as bad as we think.""

Quarterback Drake Maye's emotion was evident when asked about Campbell and Wilson.

""Shoot, I love those guys,"" Maye said. ""They're going to be all right; I think that's the big thing about those guys -- they're going to work hard and be back. They've done such a good job for us this year. Will and Jared, they mean a lot to me. I've gotten to know them in different ways. It hurts. It's disappointing, man. That's this game. That's life. They'll bounce back and help us down the road.""

Veteran starting center Garrett Bradbury added, ""It's definitely the worst part of the game. There's a lot of experience in the O-line room, and there are things we can do, put our arms around them and get them right -- whether it's certain rehab things. Hopefully they lean on us. I know the [athletic] trainers are going to do a great job and get them back out there as soon as they can.""

New England started the same offensive linemen in 10 of its first 11 games, with Maye recently referring to the unit as the ""heartbeat of the team.""

Four-year veterans Vederian Lowe (tackle) and Ben Brown (guard) were the in-game replacements for Campbell and Wilson.

Campbell and Wilson were making history of sorts this season in New England. According to Elias and ESPN Research, since 2000, they were only the second rookie tandem to open a season as starters at left tackle and left guard (joining the 2016 Baltimore Ravens with Ronnie Stanley and Alex Lewis).

Those weren't the only injuries for the Patriots on Sunday.

All-Pro special teamer Brenden Schooler injured his ankle in the first half and was ruled out of the game. Also, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga -- who was bumped up to the starting lineup this week after Milton Williams landed on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain -- injured his chest in the game.

Vrabel also didn't have an update on those players after the game.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1123%2Fr1579715_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 06:02:06.965829

The Colts are coming off a dispiriting overtime loss while the Texans have ridden their league-best defense back into playoff contention.

Colts quarterback Daniel Jones (leg) didn't appear to be 100% by the end of their loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, and wide receiver/special teams ace Ashton Dulin (hamstring) left the game early.

Houston has won three straight games with backup quarterback Davis Mills at the helm, but C.J. Stroud (concussion) could be in line to return. Here's a look at both team's injury issues.

Indianapolis Colts injuries

Daniel Jones, QB

Daniel Jones completed 19-of-31 passes for 181 yards and a pair of first-half touchdowns, and did not get sacked. He also had 3 carries for 16 yards, but he appeared to labor through a 13-yard run in the second half. Jones was on the injury report during the week but there was no thought of keeping him out of the game. He said his leg injury didn’t have an impact on him during the game.

Ashton Dulin, WR/ST

Ashton Dulin, backup receiver and key special teams performer, had one catch for 48 yards that set up a second-quarter touchdown. Dulin also had a 40-yard kickoff return and a tackle. However, he left the game with a hamstring issue.

Jaylon Carlies, LB

Jaylon Carlies (ankle) has not played this season and is in the window to return from injured reserve.

Anthony Richardson, QB

Anthony Richardson (eye) has one completion this season and is eligible to return from injured reserve.

The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback exited the Week 11 matchup vs. the Cincinnati Bengals with a wrist injury, leading to Mason Rudolph filling in for the injured passer.

Rodgers practiced on a limited basis this past week, but will he suit up on Sunday? Not this week – Rodgers is officially out on Sunday with the wrist injury.

On Nov. 21, head coach Mike Tomlin left the door open for Rodgers potentially starting against the Chicago Bears, the long-time rival of the former Green Bay Packer QB.

Still, the open door didn't mean that the future Hall of Famer would play. Here's what to know about Rodgers' availability for Sunday:

Is Aaron Rodgers playing today?

No, Aaron Rodgers will not play in Week 12 vs. the Bears, Mike Tomlin confirmed to CBS' Evan Washburn.

Rodgers was listed as a limited participant in the Friday, Nov. 22 practice and he was officially listed as ""questionable"" for Sunday's matchup. Reports indicate that Rodgers was angling to play on Sunday.

On Friday, head coach Mike Tomlin left the door open for Rodgers to potentially see the field on Sunday.

""I thought I saw a solid effort, but it's Friday, so we still got some time,"" Tomlin said. ... ""We'll see where the weekend leads us.""

NFL Media added that Rodgers would come down to a ""medical decision.""

Aaron Rodgers injury update

NFL Media's Tom Pelissero reports Rodgers has been pushing to play and can potentially play through the injury. However, there is concern that there may be further aggravation and/or damage to the left wrist should Rodgers play.

There is a possibility that the injury may require surgery if any further damage is done.

The Steelers QB injured his left wrist in Week 11 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals. He would miss the entirety of the second half, with Mason Rudolph filling in relief.

Steelers QB depth chart

Below is a look at the pecking order in Pittsburgh's quarterback room.

Aaron Rodgers

Mason Rudolph

Will Howard

Howard was a sixth-round pick by the Steelers out of Ohio State. The rookie hasn't yet played a regular-season snap for the team but completed 73% of his passes for 4,010 yards, 35 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while leading the Buckeyes to a national championship in 2025.

The Steelers also have four-year veteran Skylar Thompson on their injured reserve list. He has a 1-2 career record and has completed 58.7% of his passes for 721 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions.

After a 7-yard completion to Justin Jefferson, Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon runs into Devonte Wyatt on the sidelines and appears to be shaken up. Jordan Mason caries for four yards and a first down before the quarter ends.

The Vikings continue to put Mason to work, first with a carry of five yards and then he breaks loose for 22 yards and a first down at the Green Bay 38. Two more carries by Mason net 12 yards and another first down before he's replaced by Aaron Jones.

A fake to Jones and then a short throw from McCarthy to Josh Oliver picks up four and then Jones picks up five to set up third-and-1. A direct snap to T.J. Hockenson is stopped by the Packers, making it fourth-and-1, but the Packers stuff a fourth-down run, with Kingsley Enagbare leading the charge. The Packers take over on downs.

On second-and-6 from the 19, a short throw to Dontayvion Wicks gains 18 yards after a nice run after the catch and gives the Packers first-and -goal at the 1. Wilson is stopped initially but gets in after first contact and the Packers lead, 7-3, after the extra point by Brandon McManus.

Josh Jacobs inactive vs Vikings

Ryan Wood

With two NFC North games in five days, the second a pivotal matchup at Detroit on Thanksgiving, the Green Bay Packers are being cautious with running back Josh Jacobs.

The star tailback is inactive against the Minnesota Vikings. Jacobs left early in last week's game at the New York Giants with a bone bruise in his knee and a contusion on his thigh above his knee, and he was listed questionable on the injury report this week.

It's the first time since Jacobs signed as a free agent before last season that he will be inactive in a game. He had scored a touchdown in 18 of his past 19 games, including six straight, before that streak ended last week against the Giants. Now his touchdown drought will extend to two straight games.
