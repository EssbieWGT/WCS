The Chicago Bears enter their Week 16 game against the Green Bay Packers with running back D'Andre Swift listed as questionable.

Swift popped up on the injury report this week with a groin issue and was only able to log limited practices before drawing a questionable tag.

However, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Swift is indeed expected to suit up against the Packers on Saturday.

""Bears RB D'Andre Swift (questionable, groin) is expected to play today vs. Green Bay, per source,"" Fowler reported.

Not much of a surprise here, as it likely would've taken an act of God to keep Swift off the field for such an important game.

Swift is in the midst of what could be a career-best year in 2025.

The veteran running back enters Week 16 with 935 rushing yards, which is just 114 yards shy of his career-high. Swift needs two more rushing touchdowns and three more total scores to break his personal best marks in those areas.

Making those stats more impressive is the fact that Swift has ceded more and more touches to rookie back Kyle Monangai as the season has progressed.

Chicago and Green Bay will kick off from Lambeau Field at 8:20 p.m. ET on Saturday night. The winner will sit in first place in the NFC North.

Coach Zac Taylor has two years left on his contract, and all indications are that Taylor should return.
Burrow's injuries -- including a severe turf toe injury that required surgery in September, costing him nine games -- have been a driving force in the team's struggles.
Assuming Taylor is back, the biggest question is whether he'll make a defensive coordinator change for the second consecutive year.
No decisions have been made on the future of Kevin Stefanski, the two-time NFL Coach of the Year.","It feels like ages ago that the Cardinals started 2-0. Since then, they've lost 11 out of 12 games as the offense was increasingly decimated by injuries, including a foot sprain that has sidelined quarterback Kyler Murray since Week 5 and countless hits to receivers and running backs.

Owner Michael Bidwill has been supportive of coach Jonathan Gannon, who overachieved with a rebuilding roster in his first two seasons, jumping from 4-13 to 8-9 last season. His young staff, including offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis, has continued to grow into their roles on the job. And Gannon and general manager Monti Ossenfort have yet to pick their own QB, taking on Murray -- with a contract that fully guarantees him $36.8 million next season, plus another $19.5 million if he's on the roster March 15 -- when they were hired in 2023.

With potentially a new QB, can the Cardinals make a leap back toward contention next season in a division in which the other three teams are all currently competing for the NFC's No. 1 seed? If Bidwill decides the answer is yes, the sense is he'll stay the course. Putting all the factors together and noting the overwhelming number of injuries this year, one wouldn't expect a change in Arizona.

The Falcons got a positive jolt last on Thursday night of Week 15 when they stunned the Buccaneers. But the season remains a resounding disappointment thanks to a 5-9 record, a season-ending ACL injury to quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and no shot at the playoffs.

Owner Arthur Blank has shown patience in the past, but is it running out with a franchise that hasn't made the playoffs in eight years? He plans to evaluate the futures of coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot as the season draws to a close, as most owners do following trying campaigns.

A strong finish certainly wouldn't hurt their cause, and if Kirk Cousins finishes strong, it would justify a part of the QB decisions made last year. But people familiar with Blank's thinking expect potential changes in some form to the football operation regardless. Nothing is decided and won't be until after the season.

Coach Zac Taylor has two years left on his contract, and all indications are that Taylor should return. Burrow's injuries -- including a severe turf toe injury that required surgery in September, costing him nine games -- have been a driving force in the team's struggles. Bengals owner Mike Brown believes in Taylor, who led Cincinnati to Super Bowl LVI during the 2021 season and the AFC title game the year after, and historically has not wanted to pay coaches not to coach.

Assuming Taylor is back, the biggest question is whether he'll make a defensive coordinator change for the second consecutive year. The unit has been one of the NFL's worst this season under Al Golden, as injuries to star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson and first-round pick Shemar Stewart crippled the pass rush. But when Taylor was asked about the defense recently, he indicated beefing up the D-line to make the entire unit better was the priority, rather than wholesale changes. And there does seems to be an argument, as Cincy's defense from Weeks 11-15 gave up six fewer points per game and allowed nearly 70 fewer passing yards per game compared to the first 10 weeks. The Bengals also rank sixth in the NFL in takeaways since Week 11. Progress.

No decisions have been made on the future of Kevin Stefanski, the two-time NFL Coach of the Year. The Browns know Stefanski can coach, and he has maintained a consistent approach amid the adversity of a transition year with a young roster. But the hard reality is the Browns are 6-25 over the past two seasons, putting everything up for evaluation.

The organization has already undergone a major change this year: chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta, who presided over football matters for 10 seasons remotely from his San Diego home, left the organization last month to become the Colorado Rockies' president of baseball operations. A Harvard graduate who appeared in the book Moneyball, which was later adapted into the movie of the same title, DePodesta influenced the hires of fellow Ivy Leaguers as head coach (Stefanski) and general manager (Andrew Berry). He also built out one of the NFL's most robust data and analytics staffs -- infrastructure that will largely remain in place, though it's unclear if his old role will continue to exist.

The Browns' rookie class has been one of the NFL's best, and it'll look even better if quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders can develop into a long-term option. How Stefanski and his staff continue to bring along Sanders will be part of the evaluation over the final three games as Cleveland approaches a QB crossroads. Deshaun Watson is (finally) entering the final year of his $230 million fully guaranteed contract in 2026. And the team has significant draft capital -- including two first-round picks -- to potentially target another QB in April.

Does owner Jimmy Haslam believe Stefanski is the right coach to bring a young team and young quarterback(s) into the next phase of the Browns' build? If not, Haslam might opt to move on, and Stefanski would immediately become a top candidate elsewhere.

Legendary coach Andy Reid isn't getting fired, and people who know Reid well say he has given no indications he'll walk away at age 67. For the first time in years, he'll finally have a full offseason to recharge. As one person close to him said: ""Coach Reid ain't going out like this.""

But after seven consecutive AFC championship game appearances, five Super Bowls and three rings, the Chiefs find themselves in the unfamiliar position of playing out the string. Patrick Mahomes will spend the offseason rehabbing from ACL and LCL surgery, one that challenges whether he'll be ready to start the season. Travis Kelce could retire, though no decision has been made. Another roster reboot, as GM Brett Veach has executed adeptly in the past, could be afoot.

One situation to watch: Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy chose not to sign an extension in the offseason and is set to become a free agent. Nagy will be a top head coaching candidate and could well land a job. If he doesn't, Nagy could become a hot candidate for a play-calling job elsewhere. That would mean Reid needs a new OC, with several of his former assistants -- including Eric Bieniemy and perhaps Giants interim HC Mike Kafka -- among potential candidates.

The Raiders are 2-12. Two coordinators (OC Chip Kelly and special teams coordinator Tom McMahon) have been fired. Veteran quarterback Geno Smith, acquired for a third-round pick, has thrown 14 interceptions. No. 6 overall pick Ashton Jeanty has rushed 200 times for only 700 yards, with little running room. Superstar pass rusher Maxx Crosby, who signed a contract extension last March, appeared to hit a breaking point in last week's shutout loss to the Eagles.

It all has the fate of 74-year-old coach Pete Carroll very much in doubt. No stranger to making changes, mercurial owner Mark Davis will weigh the feedback he gets from all sides of his building as he considers the possibility of another. Meanwhile, Carroll is intent on convincing the owner he should return.

Legendary quarterback Tom Brady and his business partner Egon Durban have wielded significant influence since becoming Raiders minority owners last year. Brady is close with former Michigan teammate and current GM John Spytek, with both serving as the sounding board for one another. While Spytek was Brady's GM target last year, Brady's prime target for head coach was Ben Johnson, who took the Bears job instead. Expect Brady -- who has spent little time in the Raiders building as he balances his broadcasting duties on Fox and other business interests -- to increase his presence as the decision closes in.

Davis is his own man, though. And all the voices around him report to him. He has won three titles in four years with the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces and believes he can replicate that success with the Raiders. Whatever Davis wants to do ultimately is what will happen, and it's not yet clear what that will be.

When Miami parted ways with GM Chris Grier in October after a 2-7 start, the message publicly and privately was clear: Coach Mike McDaniel would finish the season, with hopes of the team responding and showing McDaniel is the right man for the job.

The Dolphins face major organizational decisions on several other fronts: Do they bite the bullet and release Tagovailoa, who is due $54 million fully guaranteed next season (and would count over $99 million in dead cap over two years)? Do they go into a deeper rebuild by trading other assets in the coming months? And who will take over as GM to navigate it all?

First, owner Stephen Ross must decide the fate of McDaniel, who still has a winning record (34-31) and two playoff appearances in four seasons. Ross has long been a believer in McDaniel, and last year extended his contract through 2028.

To be sure, this 6-8 season has been a disappointment. After going 14-3 last season, the Vikings have experienced a mess of injuries -- including to quarterback J.J. McCarthy, whose development was a priority after he missed his entire rookie season because of meniscus surgery. (McCarthy has played better in recent weeks and now is 4-4 as the starter.)

Aaron Glenn's first season as head coach has been filled with adversity: An 0-7 start. Trading two of the franchise's best players (Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams). Benching quarterback Justin Fields. A 3-11 record that has them in the running for the No. 1 pick.

At 4-10, the Saints are long out of the playoff chase. However, there's a case to be made that not only has Kellen Moore's first season been a success, but that New Orleans is also the hottest team in the division, with wins over the Bucs and Panthers in a five-day span.

This was never going to be a championship season in New Orleans, and Moore's work has impressed people around the league. He'll be back in 2026 with a roster that will continue to evolve as he builds the program.

That doesn't mean there won't be changes. After a brutal first half of the season on defense, Quinn took over play-calling duties from his longtime assistant Joe Whitt Jr., who seems unlikely to return as defensive coordinator.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/udgynpnb8dbfgognvncc,N,,2025-12-20 12:59:38.783746

""It's a really good football team and a really good defense,"" said Bears head coach Ben Johnson.","The Green Bay Packers' entire season is under threat after losing star pass rusher Micah Parsons to injury, believes Phoebe Schecter.

Parsons was ruled out for the remainder of the campaign this week after suffering a torn ACL in last Sunday's defeat to the Denver Broncos.

Green Bay's first test in his absence arrives on Saturday night when the Packers take on the Chicago Bears in a defining all-NFC North contest, live on Sky Sports NFL from 1.20am in the early hours of Sunday.

Parsons arrived at Lambeau Field in a blockbuster trade from the Dallas Cowboys a week before the campaign, adding an elite defensive focal point to a team deemed on the brink of Championship contention. Now, Matt LaFleur's side must do it without him.

""That changes so much,"" said Sky Sports NFL's Schecter on Inside the Huddle. ""It's pretty incredible how much can change in just a couple of weeks in the NFL.

""You go from being a team who is being compared to or being challenged to go in to make it to the Super Bowl to now, I don't know if they're going to even make it deep into the playoffs. Will they make it past a wild card weekend?

""When these two teams met last in Green Bay, an interception was the difference of winning and losing essentially, and they still had Micah Parsons. He is the fourth-quarter closer for this team.

""He allows this defense to operate at the level in which they want to. And I fear now for this team without Parsons and without Christian Watson, who is just explosive.""

Parsons has mustered 12.5 sacks since joining the Packers, while wide receiver Christian Watson, Jordan Love's chief deep threat, has been nursing injury, although looks on course to feature against the Bears.

""He takes so much attention,"" said Schecter of Watson. ""He can take the top off of defense and open it up for others. And we've seen how he's benefited Jordan Love, his quarterback rating jumps by about 25 per cent.""

The loss of Parsons has heightened the importance of pass rush partner Rashan Gary, who has 7.5 sacks on the year.

""We can still write our story,"" said Gary.

""I've just got to be myself. When guys are thinking that they need to do more than what they've been doing, you start to strain, start to try to find plays that's not there.""

The Packers were 28-21 winners when the two sides met on December 7, Keisean Nixon icing the game with an end-zone interception of Caleb Williams on fourth-and-one with 22 seconds remaining.

Both teams can secure playoff berths with a victory in addition to a loss of tie for the Detroit Lions against the Pittsburgh Steelers, while both would get in with a tie were the Lions to lose. Chicago sit top of the NFC North at 10-4 as they seek to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2020, with the Packers second at 9-4-1 having gone 4-0 against division rivals this season.

""It's a really good football team and a really good defense,"" said Bears head coach Ben Johnson. ""I know you kind of lock in on one player, because he does garner a lot of your attention when you go against that defense, and yet, they have some high-calibre players throughout, on the defensive line, the linebacking core and on the back end.

""Just because one player goes down, that doesn't mean that this is going to change a whole lot for them.""

The Bears rank second in rushing offense in the league behind D'Andre Swift, Kyle Monangai and the ground threat of quarterback Caleb Williams, while leading the NFL in turnovers on defense with a 21 interceptions and nine fumbles.

Williams has naturally warranted a more intense spotlight as he looks to live up to the billing as the eagerly-awaited No 1 overall pick from last year's Draft. He enters Saturday 266 of 459 passing (58 per cent) for 3,150 yards, 21 touchdowns and six interceptions with a passer rating of 88.8, victories, a playoff-bound season and glimpses of magic for now relaxing question marks over his accuracy.

""I still think Caleb will make some kind of inaccurate throws at times, but you see why they drafted him,"" said Schecter.

""You see that arm strength and skill and the way it kind of jumps out of his hands. He is phenomenal at what he does and as he's getting more comfortable doing a lot more of the under center work, you can see what the plan is for this offense.

""And then you've got Ben Johnson, who I feel has settled nicely into his role as head coach and understanding how to manage a whole team because there's so much learning for kind of him and Caleb on this journey.""

The Packers are 30-6 against the Bears since the beginning of the 2008 campaign, and had won 11 straight against their long-time rivals before falling to Chicago in the final game of the season last year. The Bears are on a five-game winning streak at Soldier Field since their opening-day defeat to the Minnesota Vikings, their best home streak since 2005.",https://e0.365dm.com/25/12/1600x900/skysports-micah-parsons-packers_7114982.jpg?20251219125502,N,,2025-12-20 12:00:55.683643

Saturday

RBs Josh Jacobs (knee) & Chris Brooks (chest)

RB D'Andre Swift (groin)

WRs Christian Watson (chest) & Dontayvion Wicks (ankle)

TE Cole Kmet (ankle/knee)

Jacobs didn't practice this week but said he'll play anyway. Swift also seems likely to play, dealing with the same groin injury that he's largely fought through without suffering a drop-off in performance. The other guys here are tougher to get a read on, but all practiced some during the week and thus appear at least 50/50 for Saturday's showdown.

Early Games

WR Quentin Johnston (groin)

WR Drake London (PCL)

WR Tee Higgins (concussion)

WR Mason Tipton (illness)

Higgins is in concussion protocol, which means the Bengals should know by Saturday morning/afternoon if he's able to play. I don't think he should play when he's suffered two concussions this season and his team doesn't have a shot at the playoffs, but it seems that's what Higgins and Co. want to do.

Late-Afternoon Games

RBs Woody Marks (ankle) & Nick Chubb (rib)

WRs Marvin Harrison (heel) & Xavier Weaver (hamstring)

WR Christian Kirk (illness)

Chubb was a full practice participant Thursday and Friday, while

Harrison expects to play this week, but his comments almost felt like he was setting the table for disappointment (which is probably what you want to hear if you're starting Michael Wilson).

Today, the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals both held their final practices of the week. We have been monitoring the health for both teams over the last few days, and we now have game designations to share.

Looking at the Falcons first, we received some encouraging news that receiver Drake London will likely play this week. Despite not practicing on Friday and having the questionable game designation, head coach Raheem Morris said today that he expects London to return to action this week. It’s worth noting that London has not practiced fully since he sustained his knee injury almost five weeks ago, and even this week only had a limited practice on Thursday. So him being downgraded to not practicing today is likely a precaution and rest situation.

EDGE James Pearce Jr. interestingly popped up on the injury report on Friday, after practicing normally all week. Pearce apparently has a foot issue which kept him out of Friday’s practice and has his availability for Sunday as questionable. That will certainly be something to keep an eye on, as Pearce is in contention for defensive rookie of the year due to his sack production this season. Raheem Morris did tell the Atlanta media on Friday that he feels good about the possibility of Pearce playing.

Joseph has not played since an Oct. 12 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs because of a chronic knee issue but remains on the Detroit Lions' 53-man roster.

Joseph did not practice this week and is one of two players listed as out on the Lions' weekly game participation report. Gio Manu, who returned to practice this week but remains on injured reserve from an October knee injury, also was ruled out for Sunday.

The NFL interception leader last year, Joseph has played just six games this season because of lingering pain in his knee. He first injured the knee in training camp, then suffered a bone bruise in the same spot in a Week 4 win over the Cleveland Browns.

The Lions (8-6) have been reluctant to put Joseph on injured reserve this season, hoping the pain in his knee would subside long enough for him to contribute on the field.

Joseph still leads the Lions with three interceptions this season, and has had great success against Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in his career. In 2021, Joseph had his first two career interceptions against Rodgers while the quarterback was playing for the Green Bay Packers, and picked Rodgers off a third time in the final game of the year – on Rodgers' final pass with the team.

The Lions also listed five players as questionable on their injury report: Offensive linemen Graham Glasgow, Taylor Decker, Christian Mahogany and Trystan Colon, and cornerback Amik Robertson.

Robertson said he intends to play Sunday with a club on his broken left hand. The Lions could activate Mahogany off injured reserve in his return from a broken fibula.

RB-Heavy Approach Solidify Running Backs: Focusing on strong running backs early in the draft can set a solid foundation for your team.

Hero RB/WR Strategy Single Elite RB: Taking one elite running back and then focusing on other positions can be effective.","Drafting a winning fantasy football team can be a daunting task, but with the right strategies, you can increase your chances of success. Here are some of the most discussed and recommended draft strategies from Redditors:

Aggressive QB Drafting

Early QB Selection: Many Redditors have found success by drafting a quarterback aggressively in the early rounds. ""I shifted from 'wait on QB' to 'aggressively take a QB somewhere in rounds 2-4' several years ago and that has worked out really well for me.""

High-Value QBs: Taking a top-tier quarterback early can provide a consistent stream of points. ""My strategy has been if a guy like Lamar, Josh Allen or Daniels is right there I will take him.""

RB-Heavy Approach

Solidify Running Backs: Focusing on strong running backs early in the draft can set a solid foundation for your team. ""During these zero RB years I’ve been going RB heavy to solidify some bell cows and shoot for high upside WRs after.""

First-Year RBs: Drafting rookie or second-year running backs can provide high value. ""Draft first or second year RBs. It tends to be when they are cheapest and have the most juice.""

Hero RB/WR Strategy

Single Elite RB: Taking one elite running back and then focusing on other positions can be effective. ""Using that baseline of info and running numerous mock drafts, I think the best formula for success in your ESPN home league drafts right now is what most analysts would call a 'Hero RB' approach.""

Single Elite WR: Similarly, securing a top-tier wide receiver can be a strong start. ""In PPR, WR’s will win you your league. You always want to prioritize a WR that can carry you.""

Flexible Drafting

Best Player Available: Adapting to the draft flow and picking the best player available regardless of position is a common strategy. ""No strategy. Just go with the flow. See who is there when it gets to me and pick the best player.""

Value-Based Drafting: Focusing on undervalued players can yield great returns. ""Drafting is all about taking undervalued players and avoiding over valued.""

Auction Draft Strategies

Bid High on Key Players: Aggressively bid on players you want to secure. ""I used to NEVER put up players that I wanted in the first 3-4 rounds. I would always put up the highest value player that I had no interest in first hoping that people overpay early, so I have more money than them when going for my guys.""

Late-Round Gems

Late-Round QB: Waiting until later rounds to draft a quarterback can be a successful strategy if you pick the right players. ""I've been extremely lucky waiting on qbs the past few years.""

High-Upside Rookies: Targeting rookies or second-year players in later rounds can provide significant value. ""I like targeting rookies and year 2 guys to stash on my bench.""

Avoid Key Positions Early

Tight End and Kicker: Many Redditors suggest avoiding early picks for tight ends and kickers. ""I hate playing the TE stream."" ""Literally never draft a kicker unless the platform forces me to.""

Additional Tips

Know Your League Settings: Understand the scoring rules and roster requirements of your league. ""Know your league. If your league uses PPR and your cheat sheet is for standard scoring you're putting yourself at a disadvantage.""

Use Reliable Resources: Utilize tools and rankings from reputable sources. ""I use beersheets every year.""

Barmore spent time as a limited participant, a full participant and a non-participant during Ravens preparations. Now listed with a knee injury, the interior defensive lineman carries a questionable game status along with three recent returnees to Patriots practice. Landry, Davis and Jones all missed back-to-back sessions before becoming partial for Friday’s work inside the WIN Waste Innovations Field House.

Off the edges, Landry leads New England with 10 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks and 19 quarterback hits. Jones, the former AFC Defensive Player of the Month, leads the way with 11 passes defensed and three interceptions, including a touchdown return. And also at cornerback, Davis remains second on the defense with 93.7 percent of the snaps after exiting and returning last Sunday.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2246825561.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.1399438974595%2C100%2C78.528246217928&w=1200,N,,2025-12-19 23:58:58.060934

At 6-8, the Chiefs have been eliminated from playoff contention in the AFC. Plus, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL last week to turn this Chiefs season into a true disaster. There are plenty of questions facing the Chiefs about their future and how they'll build the roster next year with Mahomes hopeful to be ready for the start of the season.

Among the biggest questions is whether Travis Kelce will be back. He continues to brush aside retirement questions, noting that will be a tougher conversation he has to have with himself and the team in the offseason, via ESPN.

""I think I'd rather just keep the focus on this team, right now,"" Kelce said. ""All the conversations that I have with the team moving forward will be with them. It's a unique time in my life. I've got three games left. Unfortunately, I've got three games left and I know when the season ends. Just trying to make sure everybody here knows that I'm focused on trying to win these last three games.""

While his long-term future remains up in the air, Kelce stated on Friday that he has no plans on sitting out any of the Chiefs' final three games despite being out of the playoff race with a backup QB.

""It's just integrity, man,"" Kelce said. ""I signed up to be a Chief, and I love doing what I do. I know I've been dreaming of being in these moments and playing for an NFL team since I was a kid. Getting back to that will give you more motivation than you could ever need. That's just how you need to go about work, whether you're in the race or not. I'm going to make sure these guys know I'm out there giving them everything I got.""

Kelce will try to help close the season out strong and provide some help for backup Gardner Minshew as he takes over the offense in Mahomes' absence. Kelce does have some individual accolades to play for. He is just 203 yards shy of another 1,000-yard season, which would make him the oldest tight end to reach that mark.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/19/3ea504e2-2e92-4507-8657-72274cf58359/thumbnail/1200x675/64a64521c918e59a08ac27ea29fc8411/kelce.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 23:59:02.499299

And, of course, at this stage of the season, injuries are piling up for some teams while others are getting healthier. For bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 16, here are the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Eagles at Commanders (5 p.m. ET, Saturday)

PHI DT Jalen Carter (shoulders, out)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (elbow, out)

The Eagles can clinch the NFC East with a win over a beat-up Washington team on Saturday or a Dallas loss on Sunday. The Commanders have officially shut down Jayden Daniels amid an injury-plagued Year 2, and Washington is just playing things out at this point with Marcus Mariota under center. The Eagles are down two key players in the trenches in Lane Johnson and Jalen Carter, though that's been the case for a few weeks now.

The Eagles are 7-point favorites, and the total is 44.5.

Packers at Bears (8:20 p.m. ET, Saturday)

GB LB Micah Parsons (knee, out for year)

GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee and ankle, questionable)

GB WR Christian Watson (chest and shoulder, questionable)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

CHI WR Luther Burden III (ankle, out)

CHI RB D'Andre Swift (groin, questionable)

This massive NFC North tilt has some major injuries on both sides. Star Green Bay defender Micah Parsons is out for the year in a major blow for the Packers' defense. Green Bay is hoping to have star running back Josh Jacobs and top receiver Christian Watson, both of whom are questionable. Jacobs didn't practice this week while Watson logged two limited practices to close things out. As for Chicago, it's down two of its top three receivers in Rome Odunze and rookie Luther Burden III while No. 1 running back D'Andre Swift is questionable here, though he was a limited practice participant Wednesday and Thursday and appears to be trending toward playing.

Chicago is a 1.5-point favorite at home. The total is 46.5.

Chargers at Cowboys (1 p.m. ET)

LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, questionable)

DAL CB DaRon Bland (foot, out)

The Chargers have listed receiver Quentin Johnston as questionable in this matchup against Dallas' struggling secondary, which will likely be without cornerback DaRon Bland for the remainder of the year. The good news for the Cowboys is neither CeeDee Lamb or Javonte Williams carry injury designations for Week 16.

The Cowboys are slight 1.5-point favorites at home. The total is 49.5.

Vikings at Giants (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are just trying to get across the finish line here, with the Vikings taking a major step back from last season while the Giants are going to have a new head coach in 2026. The Giants have a handful of players out or questionable, but no real line-movers.

Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite. The total is 43.5.

Bengals at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, questionable)

This matchup is most noteworthy for Quinn Ewers starting at quarterback for Miami in place of the benched Tua Tagovailoa as the rookie from Texas is set to make his first NFL start against Cincinnati's league-worst defense. The Bengals are hoping to have Tee Higgins back on offense as he's questionable with his second concussion of the season.

Cincy is a 4.5-point favorite, and the total is 47.5.

Buccaneers at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

This very important NFC South clash thankfully doesn't have major injuries impacting it, as the Bucs have no players listed while none of Carolina's stars, namely receiver Tetairoa McMillan, carry designations into the weekend. Both teams are 7-7, so the winner will hold the NFC South lead entering Week 17. These teams face off again in Week 18.

Tampa Bay is favored by three points. The total sits at 45.5.

Jets at Saints (1 p.m. ET)

NYJ Tyrod Taylor (groin and knee, questionable)

NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, questionable)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

NYJ WR Garrett Wilson (knee, out for season)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

Both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields are questionable to suit up for the Jets on Sunday, but whether they're active or not, undrafted rookie Brady Cook will start for New York. He won't have two of New York's top weapons, either, with receiver Garrett Wilson shut down for the year while rookie tight end Mason Taylor remains sidelined with a neck injury. As for New Orleans, the Saints are again without top running back Alvin Kamara.

The Saints are 6.5-point favorites. The total is 40.5.

Bills at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, out)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

The biggest injuries here come with Cleveland's offense, as rookie No. 2 back Dylan Sampson remains sidelined with a hand injury and veteran tight end David Njoku, who has seen his role diminish with the emergence of rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is also out.

Buffalo is a 10.5-point favorite, and the total is 41.5.

Chiefs at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

KC QB Patrick Mahomes (knee, out for season)

KC WR Rashee Rice (concussion, out)

The Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention and will be without Patrick Mahomes for the rest of the year after he tore his ACL last week. Gardner Minshew will start in his place, but for this week, he won't have No. 1 receiver Rashee Rice as he is out with a concussion for this matchup with the Titans.

Kansas City is favored by 3, and the total is 37.5.

Jaguars at Broncos (4:05 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

This AFC clash between division leaders is a potential playoff preview. The Jags have won five in a row to move to 10-4, while Denver sits atop the conference at 12-2 amid an 11-game win streak. Denver has clinched a playoff spot already while Jacksonville can clinch with a win and a loss by either Indianapolis or Houston.

Denver is favored by 3.5 while the total is 47.5.

Falcons at Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)

AZ RB Zonovan Knight (ankle, injured reserve)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, questionable)

Atlanta is hoping to have star receiver Drake London back after he's been sidelined for weeks with a knee injury. He's officially questionable for Sunday. The Cardinals are also hoping to have a top receiver back in Marvin Harrison Jr., who is questionable after missing time of late after undergoing an appendectomy and more recently a nagging heel injury. The Cardinals' running back woes also continue, as Zonovan ""Bam"" Knight is now the third back the team has lost for the year due to injury, so Michael Carter will be Arizona's lead back on Sunday.

The Falcons are favored at -3. The total sits at 48.5.

Raiders at Texans (4:25 p.m. ET)

LV QB Geno Smith (shoulder, will play)

HOU RB Woody Marks (ankle, questionable)

HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, questionable)

The Raiders will get their starting quarterback back for this tough matchup with Houston as Geno Smith returns after missing last week's loss. The Texans' backfield is a bit of a question mark, however, as both Woody Marks and Nick Chubb are questionable to play.

Houston is a 14.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.

Steelers at Lions (4:25 p.m. ET)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

DET OL Taylor Decker and Graham Glasnow (questionable)

This is a big one for both sides, with the Steelers holding a slim one-game lead over Baltimore in the AFC North race while Detroit is trying to keep pace in the NFC wild card picture. The Steelers will again be without star edge rusher T.J. Watt after he had surgery to repair a collapsed lung last week. The Lions have listed two of their five starting offensive linemen as questionable.

The Lions are favored by seven points. The total is 52.5.

Patriots at Ravens (8:20 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Sunday Night Football is a big one for the AFC playoff picture with the Ravens hosting the Patriots. New England fell to Buffalo last week and at 11-3 leads the AFC East but is behind Denver in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. The Ravens are 7-7 and are a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North race and desperately need a win to keep pace. The Pats can clinch a postseason berth with a win or if either Houston or Indianapolis lose this week.

The Ravens are -3 on the spread with the total set at 49.5.

49ers at Colts (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, TBD)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, TBD)

IND WR Alec Pierce (Achilles, TBD)

Final reports for Monday Night Football will come out on Saturday, but the three injuries worth watching are all in the passing game. Ricky Pearsall remains banged up and could be in danger of missing Monday's game for the 49ers, while the Colts are hoping for good news on top cornerback Sauce Gardner and deep-threat receiver Alec Pierce.

The 49ers are favored by 5.5. The total is 46.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/b4a13d60-f2ae-4ae6-9371-b0402a41a55b/thumbnail/1200x675/6b93ae20852564144b0b76be364a068b/mahomes-chiefs.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 20:00:15.223644

Any time a quarterback is dealing with an injury, the ripple effect is real. With Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts, it’s about more than just pain tolerance, it’s timing, confidence, and trusting your body in the pocket.

I talked about this with Tiki Barber on WFAN Sports Radio. In the NFL, if your body isn’t allowing you to move, plant, and react the way you need to, it shows. You can manage an injury, but you can’t shortcut stability and readiness at this level.

Health dictates performance, especially at quarterback.

Seahawks’ Derick Hall suspended one game for stepping on player

Here’s a look at the updates, as well as insight from head coach Mike Macdonald and additional information from ESPN NFL reporter Jeremy Fowler.

• The biggest concern for the Seahawks coming out of the game is safety Coby Bryant, who has a knee injury. Macdonald said in a press conference Friday that Bryant would “get imaged,” meaning undergo an MRI. Fowler reported on social media that, per sources, Bryant is “expected to miss ‘some time’ based on initial tests.”

• Cornerback Riq Woolen has a knee concern of his own, but Fowler reported that it’s “not considered serious” and that, per a source, Woolen “more so got ‘banged up.'”

• Versatile defensive back Nick Emmanwori was evaluated for a concussion late in Thursday’s game, but Macdonald said he cleared concussion protocol.

The Seahawks improved to 12-3 with their win over the Rams, giving them a one-game lead over Los Angeles for both first place in the NFC West and the No. 1 seed to the postseason out of the NFC. The Seahawks also clinched a playoff spot with the dramatic comeback victory.

The next Seahawks game will be at 10 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 28 on the road against the Carolina Panthers (7-7). Radio coverage on Seattle Sports will begin at 7 a.m. that day with the pregame show.

That injury occurred in the first quarter of Thursday night's game at Lumen Field in Seattle.
McVay said Dotson's status will ""be possibly in doubt for the Falcons game.""
Second-year offensive lineman Justin Dedich took over for Dotson at right guard, and what he brought ""has been consistent with what he's been about,"" McVay said.
McVay said they haven't really talked about keeping Adams out until the playoffs with a playoff spot already clinched.","Rams head coach Sean McVay on Friday said offensive lineman Kevin Dotson sustained an ankle sprain in the team's Thursday Night Football loss to the Seahawks.

That injury occurred in the first quarter of Thursday night's game at Lumen Field in Seattle. Dotson did not return after being carted back to the locker room.

Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall stomped on Dotson while Dotson was down on the ground – an act for which the NFL announced it suspended Hall one game without pay – and while McVay said the injury occurred before Hall's act, ""it certainly didn't help the matters and it was definitely not stuff we want in our game.""

McVay said Dotson's status will ""be possibly in doubt for the Falcons game.""

Second-year offensive lineman Justin Dedich took over for Dotson at right guard, and what he brought ""has been consistent with what he's been about,"" McVay said.

""This guy's always just kind of delivered, game's not too big for him,"" McVay said. ""He's tough. He plays tough, he plays physical. He's a great communicator. He understands the intent of what we're trying to get done. I thought he was really productive in both phases. If Kevin's not able to go, we'll obviously miss Kevin a bunch. But in the meantime, it's a real luxury to have a guy that's had as much experience in his first two years as as Justin has, and plays winning football for us.""

As for wide receiver Davante Adams (knee/hamstring), who missed Thursday night's game after re-aggravating a hamstring injury against the Lions in Week 15, McVay said he ""most likely"" will not be available."" With Adams out, the Rams took a committee approach to replacing him between the involvement of wide receivers Konata Mumpfield, Xavier Smith, and Jordan Whittington. McVay also praised Los Angeles' tight ends for the way they positively impacted the game.

McVay said they haven't really talked about keeping Adams out until the playoffs with a playoff spot already clinched.

""I think we really just take it a little bit at a time,"" McVay said. ""This guy's a great competitor. He wants to be out there.

If it's upheld, he'll be eligible to return to the Seahawks' active roster Monday, Dec. 29, a day after Seattle's Week 17 game against the Carolina Panthers.

Safety Coby Bryant and cornerback Riq Woolen both suffered knee injuries in the fourth quarter Thursday night and did not return.","RENTON, Wash. -- The NFL is suspending Seattle Seahawks outside linebacker Derick Hall for one game without pay for an act of unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct, the league announced Friday.

The NFL alleges that Hall unnecessarily stepped on the leg of Los Angeles Rams guard Kevin Dotson while Dotson was on the ground at the end of a play in the first quarter of the Seahawks' overtime win at Lumen Field on Thursday night. Dotson left the game with an ankle injury and did not return. He was later seen outside the Rams' locker room on crutches and with a walking boot on his left foot.

Hall ""absolutely"" plans to appeal the suspension, a source told ESPN. If it's upheld, he'll be eligible to return to the Seahawks' active roster Monday, Dec. 29, a day after Seattle's Week 17 game against the Carolina Panthers.

Rams coach Sean McVay was asked Friday whether Dotson got injured because of the stomp or was injured earlier in the play.

""I think he was injured before, but it certainly didn't help the matter,"" McVay said. ""And it was definitely not stuff we want in our game.""

A second-round pick in 2023, Hall is part of Seattle's four-man outside linebacker rotation and averages roughly 30 snaps per game. He has one sack and 10 QB hits in 13 games this season after recording eight sacks and 20 QB hits in 2024.

The Seahawks (12-3) clinched a playoff berth and took over sole possession of first place in the NFC West with their win over Los Angeles, but their defense might be short-handed next week against Carolina.

Safety Coby Bryant and cornerback Riq Woolen both suffered knee injuries in the fourth quarter Thursday night and did not return. Coach Mike Macdonald said postgame that Bryant's ""is not automatically season-ending right now.""

Sources told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Bryant is expected to miss ""some time"" based on initial tests and that Woolen's injury is not considered serious.

Nickelback Nick Emmanwori also went down in the fourth quarter Thursday night, but Macdonald said he cleared the concussion protocol and would have returned had Seattle's defense gone back onto the field.

After not practicing on Wednesday, Lamar Jackson participated fully on both Thursday and Friday, and carries no designation for Week 16.","Week 16 is already off the rails, and we've barely gotten started. The NFL is coming off arguably the game of the year on Thursday night, when the Seattle Seahawks rallied to defeat the Los Angeles Rams in overtime, not only moving to 12-3 but also controlling their destiny in pursuit of the No. 1 seed in the NFC. That baton will be passed to the rest of the slate, which includes a doubleheader on Saturday and a slew of high-stakes games on Sunday.

While the primary focus will be on how those games shape up and further clarify the playoff picture, we also need to pay attention to injuries. As is the case every week, injuries will play a big piece to how these matchups unfold, so it's important to know who is in, out, and has their status still in question.

Philadelphia will continue to be without two key figures in the trenches as both Jalen Carter and Lane Johnson did not practice at all this week. Meanwhile, after missing Tuesday's session with a stinger, Saquon Barkley logged back-to-back full practices and carries no injury designation for Saturday.

The Commanders have decided to shut Jayden Daniels down for the rest of the season, and he's since been officially ruled out. That means backup Marcus Mariota will get another start. He'll do so without his star left tackle as Larmey Tunsil is out with a strained oblique. Tunsil practiced on a limited basis on Wednesday, but was downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday.

The notable names in Green Bay's lengthy injury report come on the offensive side of the ball with Josh Jacobs and Christian Watson, who are both questionable. Watson suffered a chest injury during Sunday's loss to the Broncos and needed to be examined at a local hospital. Fortunately, he avoided a significant injury, but his status for Week 16 is up in the air. He was limited on Wednesday and Thursday. As for Jacobs, the star back did not practice at all this week.

Chicago's receiver room will be thin in Week 16 with both Rome Odunze and Luther Burden III sidelined for this matchup. Meanwhile, running back D'Andre Swift popped up on the injury report on Wednesday and logged back-to-back limited sessions due to a groin injury, which has him questionable.

The most notable development on Buffalo's injury report is who is not on it. Specifically, cornerback Christian Benford (toe) logged a full practice on Friday and carries no designation for this week, meaning he will suit up.

Jack Conklin will miss his third-straight game due to a concussion, while Njoku will be sidelined for the second week in a row with a knee injury. Rookie running back Dylan Sampson did not practice this week due to a hand injury and has since been ruled out. As for right guard Wyatt Teller, he was limited in practice this week after missing both Week 14 and Week 15 with a calf injury, and is officially questionable.

Elsewhere, pass rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux will be sidelined after missing the entire week of practice with a shoulder injury.

Christian Barmore seemed to be the most at risk of not playing after not participating on Friday. Every other questionable Patriot practiced on a limited basis to end the week.

After not practicing on Wednesday, Lamar Jackson participated fully on both Thursday and Friday, and carries no designation for Week 16. Maybe the most intriguing aspect of Baltimore's injury report, however, is Kyle Hamilton, who is questionable after popping up on the report on Friday as a limited participant with an ankle injury.

Coach Kevin O'Connell said Friday that Darrisaw has not suffered a setback or a new injury. O'Connell said it's his ""personal belief"" that Darrisaw will be able to resume a normal practice and playing routine next season. The Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention last week.

""This was a collaborative decision based upon where we're at in the season,"" O'Connell said, ""from the standpoint of Christian's workload and what these next few games and days are going to look like for our team. ... We thought this was the best decision for Christian in the short term, but at the same time, I think a lot of this can be a projection on a really positive outlook for 2026.""

Darrisaw, 26, signed a four-year contract extension worth up to $113 million in July 2024. On Oct. 24, 2024, he tore the ACL and MCL in his knee during a game against the Los Angeles Rams.

He recovered well enough to avoid the physically unable to perform list and opened training camp on the active roster, but he sat out the Vikings' first two games and later revealed he had been told it would take a full year to recover.

Even after that landmark passed, Darrisaw couldn't push beyond being a part-time player. He started 10 games this season but left five of them early. He took himself out of two of those games, Week 5 against the Cleveland Browns and Week 8 against the Los Angeles Chargers, while coaches removed him from the other three to manage his workload. The Vikings also excused him from at least one day of practice per week to give him extra rest.

Darrisaw said Thursday that he preferred not to talk about his season and wasn't able to answer a question about his availability for the Vikings' final three games.

""There's just a lot of layers to it,"" O'Connell said, ""where as coaches and as the head coach, we're just trying to defer to the medical staff and most importantly, making sure Christian's in a good place and everything. It has been just a really unique year for him and one that I think he'll be able to really grow from.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0723%2Fr1362312_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:02:12.375435

Hamilton, who is arguably the Ravens' most essential defensive weapon, was limited in Friday's practice. Playing across Baltimore's defense, Hamilton has 87 tackles, seven passes defensed, one sack, and six tackles for loss.

Ravens cornerback Chidobe Awuzie returned to practice Friday after missing the first two days, but is doubtful to play after being limited.

""I think Chido is going to be iffy,"" Head Coach John Harbaugh said. ""We'll have to see how it goes up and until the game.""

Awuzie, who injured his foot in Cincinnati last week, has been one of the Ravens' most effective defensive players this season. He has the fifth-highest Pro Football Focus grade among all NFL cornerbacks who have taken at least half their team's defensive snaps.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley (knee/ankle) is questionable after he didn't log a full practice all week. Defensive lineman John Jenkins, who has been sidelined by an illness the past couple days, is also questionable to play.

""I think [Jenkins] should be OK by gameday, but there is a little 'flu bug' going around, and he got it,"" Harbaugh said.

Rookie inside linebacker Teddye Buchanan, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Cincinnati, is still on the 53-man roster and has been ruled out. Trenton Simpson is slated to step into Buchanan's starting role and has the confidence of his coaches and teammate Roquan Smith. Rookie linebacker Jay Higgins IV (knee) returned to practice this week but has also been ruled out.

Patriots Rule Out Leading Tackler

The Patriots have ruled out linebacker Robert Spillane, who leads the team with 97 tackles. He hasn't practiced all week due to an ankle injury.

Spillane, who spent four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, also has two interceptions and one sack this season and it's a hit to the middle of New England's defense.

""He's a really good player, a really underrated player probably,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's one of those guys that people want to make assumptions about, then all he does is go out there and make every single tackle – that's kind of who he is. So, it's a factor, but they have a lot of good players on defense.""

Four other key Patriots defenders are all questionable: cornerback Marcus Jones (knee), who leads the Patriots with three interceptions, outside linebacker Harold Landry III (knee), who leads them with 8.5 sacks, fellow starting cornerback Carlton Davis III, and defensive tackle Christian Barmore.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/lx0lnfow3c5n8b910vsl,N,,2025-12-19 18:02:21.111201

Joseph has now missed five practices since coach Dan Campbell noted that the All-Pro safety had a setback last week, and he looks no closer to returning than he did two months ago. It may be just a matter of time before he is placed on injured reserve.

Glasgow was estimated to have been able to practice on Wednesday during the Lions walkthrough, but he showed up as a non-participant on Thursday, was still unable to practice on Friday, and has been listed as questionable. If he is downgraded or ruled inactive for this game, the Lions will most likely turn to Trystan Colon—as they have done previously—but he is also dealing with an injury and is listed as questionable. If Colon is unable to play, the Lions will likely turn to Michael Niese (who was the Lions’ backup center last season) or practice squader Kingsley Eguakun.

“We’ve obviously worked Colon because he’s been there. I know he’s got the wrist, but he was out there working with it yesterday,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said on Friday. “Just trying to get Graham off his feet. But I mean, we’ve worked Niese, we’ve worked Kingsley. We’ve kind of just hit all around, and we’re rolling the guards, too. So, it’s really been a little bit of a revolving door trying to get a number of guys ready because there’s a lot of flex going into this game right now.”

Decker missed practice on Wednesday and Friday, but got in a Thursday practice, which is more than he was able to do in Week 15. He’s been getting considerable rest as the season has progressed, so this pattern is not unusual, and he is expected to start at left tackle on Sunday.

Mahogany has made steady progress toward returning from injured reserve, and he’ll have a chance to see that happen this weekend. If he is activated, expect him to jump back into his starting left guard role, but there’s still a chance he will need another week before he’s ready.

“Yesterday, I thought he looked pretty good. Wasn’t perfect, but I thought he looked pretty good,” Campbell said of Mahogany. “And some of it’s going to be, I know he’s a little sore today, and how he feels in today’s practice. That’s what a lot of it’s going to come down to.”

Colon has been limited in practice this week, but he’s been present and participating in all three. If he’s able to play through his wrist injury, he’ll potentially have a chance to fill a big role against the Steelers.

Robertson has been practicing with a club/brace on his hand, and he has suggested that he will have a chance to play in this game with its protection. Robertson has previously played with a club on his hand (in college) and has noted he is familiar with its limitations.

Not listed with an injury designation

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki has been playing through a thumb injury for several weeks now, but he was fortunately able to return to a full level of participation this week, suggesting he is very close to putting the injury behind him.

Awosika missed the previous two games with a foot injury, but he’s been practicing in full this week and looks ready to return to the game day roster. Depending on how things shake out with the rest of the interior offensive line, there’s a chance Awosika could be called upon to start at left tackle this week.

Harper was unable to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols last week, but he’s been practicing in full this week and appears close to being able to return to game action. If cleared, he’ll return to the starting free safety role, likely starting alongside Avonte Maddox.

Baltimore added Kyle Hamilton to Friday’s injury report, listing the All-Pro safety as questionable with an ankle injury. He was a limited participant on Friday after fully practicing all week.

Hamilton has anchored Baltimore’s defense ever since joining the team as the No. 14 pick in 2022. The former Notre Dame star has 87 tackles, two forced fumbles and a sack this season, playing 98 percent of the defense’s snaps when active.

Hamilton missed one game earlier this year because of a groin injury. Without the two-time Pro Bowler, the short-handed Ravens allowed 417 yards in a 44-10 loss to the Houston Texans.

Baltimore’s defense hasn’t played to its usual standards this season, ranking 23rd with 344.4 yards allowed per game. The 7-7 Ravens have relinquished 22.9 points per game after shutting out Joe Burrow’s Cincinnati Bengals in Week 15, but they remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in Hamilton’s career.

Five players had their practice status changed in a negative way, and while Sean McDermott didn’t specify exactly how all of it went down, it just leaves you shaking your head this season with the amount of injuries the Bills have suffered in practice.

Defensive back Taron Johnson and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones went from full practice in Wednesday’s walk through session to limited on Thursday and McDermott said they would get veteran rest/injury management days off Friday. And defensive back Cam Lewis, offensive lineman Chase Lundt and punter Mitch Wishnowsky - yes, the punter - went from no designation to limited.

Bills injury report: Who is definitely out vs Browns

As for who McDermott said would not play Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, defensive tackle Jordan Phillips and kicker Matt Prater were already ruled out early in the week, and Lundt - a rookie who hasn’t really played this season - is going to be inactive. McDermott added that Lewis was not going to practice Friday, so that seems like a bad sign for his availability in Cleveland. He was officially listed as questionable when the final injury report was released Friday afternoon.

With Prater out, that means newly-signed kicker Michael Badgley will be elevated from the practice squad Saturday afternoon.

Dion Dawkins returns to practice

Now, it wasn’t all bad news as left tackle Dion Dawkins returned to work after missing two days with an illness. Obviously, Dawkins is a key player Sunday because he’ll be working against Browns superstar edge rusher Myles Garrett.

Linebacker Terrel Bernard and wide receiver/punt returner Mecole Hardman both improved from limited to full Thursday, and then Friday, cornerback Christian Benford was going to be a full participant which is potentially good news for his status Sunday.

Benford sat out last week’s game with a toe injury and he is perhaps the Bills’ best defensive player, so a return would certainly be nice, even though the Browns’ passing game isn’t anything to be too concerned about, even if Benford winds up not playing.

Bernard has missed the last three games with an elbow injury, and previously he was battling an ankle injury. Hardman is on injured reserve but his practice window was opened Wednesday, so there’s a chance he could be activated in time for Sunday’s game as he was officially listed for the game as questionable. If he plays, McDermott will have an interesting decision to make at receiver.

Hardman would immediately return to punt return duties, but Ray Davis has locked down the kickoff return job. He leads the NFL with a 32.4 average so taking him out of that role would not be wise. But who would Hardman replace in the wide receiver group if he’s active? Would he replace Brandin Cooks who has done nothing in three games and has not given the Bills the deep threat that is so lacking in the offense? Hardman can provide speed, and his advantage would be his contribution to special teams.

“He’s practiced this week, first week opening his window coming off IR so we’ll see how it goes,” McDermott said.

Browns will be missing several players

One of Cleveland's best players, offensive guard Wyatt Teller, may be able to return to action as he's listed as questionable with a calf injury. But overall, it's not a pretty picture for the 3-11 Browns.

Ruled out are their best cornerback, Denzel Ward, starting offensive tackle Jack Conklin, tight end David Njoku, and backup running back Dylan Sampson.

He was a limited participant in Wednesday and Thursday's practices before not participating in the team's final full practice Friday. As a reminder: London has missed each of the last four games with a PCL sprain in his knee.

He told reported Thursday that he is ""trending in the right direction"" to get the green light Sunday.

""I want to get back out there quick as possible,"" London said. ""But everything is going smoothly. I've been making good strides and leaps. That's all I can ask for.""

Despite listing him as questionable, head coach Raheem Morris said Friday that he fully expects to have London available on Sunday.

Joining London as a non-participant in Friday's practice and with a game designation of questionable was defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus (illness/shoulder) and edge rusher James Pearce Jr. (foot).

The inclusion of Pearce on the injury report was a surprise as he was a Friday add. Like what he said about London, Morris was asked about Pearce's status and said he expects him to be ready to go Sunday, too. Per Morris this week feels like the ""healthiest weeks"" the Falcons have had in a while.

Pearce currently leads all rookies — and the Falcons' team at large — with eight total sacks. He contributed two to his total last week against the Buccaneers.

Pearce's eight sacks are the most by a Falcons rookie in a single season since individual sacks were officially recorded in 1982. According to team record books, the organization recognizes Claude Humphreys as the rookie leader in sacks with 11.5. Pearce has recorded at least one sack in six straight games, tying the second-longest streak by any NFL rookie since individual sacks were officially recorded. He ties Jevon Kearse's record from 1999.

The only players the Falcons have ruled out of Sunday's game are cornerback Mike Hughes — who suffered an ankle injury early in the team's win over the Bucs last week — and wide receiver KhaDarel Hodge — who has been on and off the injury reports the last couple weeks with a shoulder injury.

Brown and DeVonta Smith, who combined for just four targets in Week 15 as Philly cruised to a blowout win.
Mariota has performed admirably in his seven starts this year with an 11:5 TD-INT ratio and a 92.7 passer rating.","The state of the Eagles offense has been a weekly focus throughout Philly's bid for a repeat. The unit's struggles hit a nadir during a horrendous Week 14 loss to the Chargers in prime time in which Jalen Hurts had five turnovers -- including two on the same play -- prompting debate on if Nick Sirianni should consider a QB change. That obviously did not happen, and the Eagles responded last week with one of their best offensive performances to date in a 31-0 win over the Raiders. Performances against Las Vegas this season should be taken with a grain of salt, but the 31 points are the most that the Eagles have scored since Week 8. Hurts wasn't asked to do too much (15 pass attempts), but he finished 12 of 15 with three TDs for a 154.9 passer rating (second career game with a 150-plus rating). His 80% completion percentage was more than 20 points higher than what Hurts posted during the Eagles' previous three-game losing streak, and he'll face another struggling defense on Saturday in the Commanders. Washington enters Week 16 with the NFL's 31st-ranked defense (382.6 yards allowed per game), 26th-ranked scoring unit (26.8 PPG) and 31st-ranked opposing passer rating (107.3). With Saquon Barkley battling a stinger during the week, Hurts could be asked to lead the offense in the potential playoff-clincher. If that is the case, expect to see a bigger role for wideouts A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, who combined for just four targets in Week 15 as Philly cruised to a blowout win.

A season that began with so much promise in Washington will end with Marcus Mariota under center as the Commanders play out the string already eliminated from playoff contention. Washington announced this week that second-year QB Jayden Daniels would sit out the final three games of the year after he aggravated an elbow injury two weeks ago. When it's over, Daniels will have missed 10 games after he led the Commanders to a stunning trip to the NFC Championship Game in his rookie season. Figuring out the best ways to keep Daniels healthy will be the the top priority this offseason. Before that, ending this season on a positive note will be atop the agenda. Washington's win last week over the New York Giants snapped an eight-game losing skid, and keeping the Eagles from clinching the division on their home turf would be a nice Christmas gift for Commanders fans. Doing so will be a tall task against an Eagles defense ranked sixth in the league in points allowed (19.4) and first in opposing completion percentage (56.0). Mariota has performed admirably in his seven starts this year with an 11:5 TD-INT ratio and a 92.7 passer rating. Veteran wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who has battled his own share of injuries this season, has two touchdowns since returning to action at the end of November. If the Commanders want to pull off the upset, a big day for No. 17 could go a long way.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/zvqy0kpfbzalr8cj6qlf,N,,2025-12-19 19:01:42.418168

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore the ACL in his left knee against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14.
ACL tears occur when too much stress is placed on the ligament.
Most ACL tears require surgery and extended physical therapy to heal.
Many athletes have been able to come back from ACL tears and experience continued success.","Knee injuries are some of the most common in sports. In the NFL, two star players saw their seasons end in a matter of hours in Week 15 due to ACL tears.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore the ACL in his left knee against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14. The injury was caused by hyperextension. Mahomes had to exit the game during the Chiefs’ final drive, and his team’s eventual loss knocked them out of playoff contention for the first time since 2014.

Green Bay Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons tore his ACL on the same day. He went down without contact while chasing Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix.

While ACL tears are all too common across the league — other prominent players such as New York Giants receiver Malik Nabers, San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz, Miami Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. have suffered them this season — what exactly is an ACL tear?

ACL stands for anterior cruciate ligament, and it is one of four main ligaments in the knee. The ACL’s primary function is to provide stability during lateral or rotational movement.

ACL tears occur when too much stress is placed on the ligament. These injuries can be contact-related or occur without any contact at all. Sudden stops in acceleration, twisting movements, hyperextension or landing awkwardly from a jump can all cause excessive strain on the ACL and result in a tear.

Recovery can take anywhere from nine to 12 months, meaning a torn ACL is almost always season-ending in the NFL. Most ACL tears require surgery and extended physical therapy to heal.

Mahomes acted quickly on his injury by getting surgery the following day, which was deemed successful. Chiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder said rehab started on Tuesday with the early goal of getting the quarterback’s muscles firing to help reduce the swelling in his knee. Mahomes will wear a protective brace as his knee heals.

Many athletes have been able to come back from ACL tears and experience continued success. Tom Brady tore his ACL in his ninth NFL season (the same as Mahomes) and came back the following year to win the Comeback Player of the Year award. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow won the same award in 2021 when he returned from a torn ACL and MCL to lead the Bengals to a Super Bowl appearance.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/18200911/AP25352566418241-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-19 13:00:35.721125

On Thursday, the Pats were dealt some concerning injury updates on the defensive side of the ball.

For much of the year, New England did well to avoid the injury bug, but it is beginning to get hit hard down the homestretch of the season. Milton Williams and Will Campbell are both on injured reserve, and it was hard not to notice Robert Spillane’s absence from the team’s Week 15 loss to the Buffalo Bills.

Besides Campbell, the Pats appear to be pretty healthy on offense heading into this one. The same can’t be said for the defense, as Spillane, Carlton Davis III, Marcus Jones and Harold Landry III all missed practice for the second straight day, throwing their status for Sunday up in the air.

It’s safe to say the concern level regarding these injuries is growing. Landry has missed multiple practices in previous weeks before logging a limited session on Friday and suiting up on Sunday, so he should be able to play if he can practice on Friday.

The rest of the guys are big question marks, though. Spillane didn’t play against the Bills, despite being active for the game, which isn’t a good sign.

The team’s concerns were put to rest on Thursday, though, as Jackson practiced fully, putting him on track to be ready to go for this game.

Watson, the receiver who was taken to a Denver hospital during last Sunday's loss to the Broncos for fear that he had sustained a serious chest injury, practiced Wednesday and Thursday and has proclaimed himself likely to play.

Jacobs, the running back who finished the game against the Broncos but has been battling a sore left knee for more than a month, did not practice all week.

They were among 10 players listed as questionable for the Packers (9-4-1) when they released their status report on Thursday afternoon.

When asked Thursday what he thought of Watson's return to practice, Packers coach Matt LaFleur said: ""Encouraging.""

As for Jacobs and starting right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), LaFleur was less certain. Neither practiced Thursday.

""It means we'll give them up 'til game time,"" LaFleur said.

Jacobs said that his knee swelled up again during the loss to the Broncos, a game in which he had both a rushing and receiving touchdown and actually implored the coaches to put him back in despite the pain. Jacobs said he will once again push LaFleur to allow him to play against the Bears. He has missed just one game this season.

""It's been a couple times since I've been here where we kind of clashed on if they was going to allow me to play or not, and every time I had a pretty good game,"" Jacobs said. ""I think he's probably to the point where he's like, 'Man, I'm just going to trust you. If you say you can do it and you believe that you can do, then I'm going to let you go.'""

Among the others listed as questionable were safety Evan Williams (knee), receiver Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), running back Chris Brooks (chest), tackle Darian Kinnard (neck), defensive end Kingsley Enagbare (illness), defensive end Brenton Cox Jr. (groin) and defensive end Collin Oliver (hamstring). Neither Cox nor Oliver was on the active roster as of Thursday, but each had begun his three-week practice window to return from injury. Of that group of eight, only Williams and Enagbare did not practice Thursday.

The Packers ruled out tight end Josh Whyle (concussion), running back MarShawn Lloyd (calf, hamstring) and guard John Williams (back).

If Watson plays against the Bears (10-4), he would do so six days after his emergency room visit.

He went to a Denver hospital because there was an initial fear that he might not be able to fly home with the team after the game. But X-rays and a CT scan did not show anything that would prevent him from doing so. Watson was injured on a deep pass that was intercepted by Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II, who fell on top of Watson.

""They had some concern right away with just like with the ribs and stuff, making sure nothing was dislocated or anything,"" Watson said. ""Didn't want to put me in a bad spot just flying back and everything.""

""It's feeling pretty good for everything considered,"" Watson added. ""So, I think it'll be all right for the game.""

Watson's injury early in the third quarter was part of a deluge of injuries in the game, including Micah Parsons' season-ending torn ACL. Evan Williams sustained his knee injury on the same play in which Parsons was hurt, although it was barely noticeable.

""I look up, thinking I'm there's going to be a couple trainers,"" Williams said. ""There's one trainer holding a water bottle. And I'm like, 'Where's everybody else?' And there's 15 in a circle all around Micah. I was like, 'Oh, damn.'""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1218%2Fr1591182_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 11:01:23.102274

THURSDAY NIGHT

L.A. Rams (+1) at Seattle, o/u 42.5 – Thursday, 8:15 p.m. EST

The Rams roll into this one with a tiebreaker-sized lead on Seattle in the NFC West thanks to a victory in their first meeting this season in Week 11, so another win here all but locks up the division title. The first clash was a defensive battle, 21-19, but that was the only time since the beginning of November that Matthew Stafford and company have been held to less than four touchdowns. Over seven games since their bye, the Rams have gone 6-1 while averaging 35.0 points and 407 yards of offense a game, and they've topped 40 points and 500 yards in back-to-back weeks against the Cards and Lions. Stafford has a 20:3 TD:INT in those seven games as he stays in the MVP conversation, but he'll likely be without his favorite red-zone target Thursday as Davante Adams nurses a hamstring strain. No worries — Colby Parkinson has been an outstanding Plan B with six TDs in the last six games, including two last week against Detroit. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum, meanwhile, have made eight trips to the end zone the last three weeks. Both these teams have strong defenses — both top four in PPG allowed and top 10 in yards per game allowed — but it's hard to overlook just how much of a juggernaut Sean McVay's offense has been while sending three TEs out there nearly a quarter of the time, forcing defenses to guess early whether they're about to have the ball run down their throat again or whether Parkinson or Terrance Ferguson or whoever is going to leak out and create a mismatch.

If the Seahawks do pull out a win, they'll be tied with the Rams atop the division standings, but they'll still have an uphill climb to take the crown — the Rams wrap up their schedule with two also-rans in the Falcons and Cardinals (combined 8-20 record), while the Seahawks get two road games against teams fighting for playoff spots in Carolina and San Francisco (combined 17-11). Still, they'll have almost no chance at all without a win Thursday. Mike Macdonald's crew has won four consecutive thanks to a defense that has been crushing inferior offenses lately, holding the Vikings, Falcons and Colts (or, more accurately, Max Brosmer, Kirk Cousins and Philip Rivers) to just 25 total points and an average of 218.7 yards per game with nine takeaways and six sacks. Needless to say, Stafford and the Rams are a bit of a step up in competition. Sam Darnold's been hit and miss lately, failing to throw any TDs at all in three of the last five games with a 5:5 TD:INT over that stretch, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba's fallen off his 2,000-yard pace as a result. (He's currently tracking to tie Julio Jones' 2015 campaign for third all-time at a mere 1,871 yards.) JSN's really the only member of the offense making a consistent impact, though, so if DC Aden Durde's unit stumbles at all, it could be tough for the Seahawks to keep up.

SATURDAY

Philadelphia at Washington (+6.5), o/u 44.5

Saturday, 5 p.m. EST

They did their best to blow it, but the Eagles find themselves on the verge of clinching the NFC East anyway — they'd have to lose out, and the Cowboys would have to run the table, for Philly to fail to become the division's first repeat champs since 2001-04, when Donovan McNabb and Andy Reid ruled the roost. Last week's rout of the Raiders snapped the Eagles' three-game losing streak, as the defense held Kenny Pickett and company to just 75 yards of offense and seven first downs in a 31-0 win. Saquon Barkley got into the end zone for a second straight game, the first time he's done that since Weeks 1-2, while Jalen Hurts rebounded from a four-INT performance to toss three TDs on only 15 attempts. The defending Super Bowl champions have only gone as far as DC Vic Fangio's unit has taken them this year, though. Philly's 6-0 when holding the opposition to 20 points or less, and 3-5 when it doesn't, with the team's last win against an offense it couldn't stifle coming against the Vikings in Week 7. The offense hasn't put together 400 yards since a Week 9 bye, and it's only hit that mark once in 2025.

Then again, if any defense can make the Eagles' offense look good, it's probably the Commanders. Last week's win over the Giants did snap an eight-game losing streak, but that was just a battle to see who was more dysfunctional now. With Washington out of playoff contention, Jayden Daniels has officially been shut down for the year, which is the smart decision. The second-year QB's difficulties staying healthy is bringing back unpleasant memories of Robert Griffin III, but Daniels' injuries seem to be more of the fluky variety. He's also hardly been the only key player sidelined for the Commanders in 2025, so running it back with Dan Quinn and a hopefully good draft class still seems like their best option.

Just one week after beating the Bears and taking over the NFC North lead, the Packers handed it right back by losing in Denver while Chicago stomped Cleveland at Soldier Field. This division could go right down to the wire, but the Pack do at least have a somewhat easier closing slate, facing the Ravens and Vikings (combined 13-15 record) instead of the 49ers and Lions (combined 18-10). The loss to the Broncos snapped a four-game win streak for Matt LaFleur's squad, but it was the defense that let it down, something that can't be surprising after Micah Parsons was lost to an ACL tear. The injury leaves a massive hole in the pass rush, and in the team's Super Bowl hopes. There'll be more pressure on Jordan Love and the offense as a result, especially with Josh Jacobs also banged up, and while Love did throw multiple INTs last week for the first time all season, that was against Patrick Surtain and an elite Denver secondary. If he does what he did against Chicago last time out — 68.0 percent completion rate, 9.4 YPA and a 3:1 TD:INT — the visitors should still be in good shape in this one.

It's really tough to get a read on Caleb Williams' development. Last week's 60.7 percent completion rate was his best mark since Week 8, but a 12:2 TD:INT over the last seven games is nothing to sneeze at. Ben Johnson's been riding his running game during that time anyway as the Bears have gone 6-1 — D'Andre Swift has 471 rushing yards, three TDs and a 5.2 YPC in the last six games, while Kyle Monangai has 495 yards, four TDs and a 4.8 YPC in the last seven. It's not quite Ram or Lion levels of production from the backfield, but it'll do. DC Dennis Allen's unit has gotten healthier, and stingier, during that span as well. Chicago's held four of the last six opponents to 20 points or less, though Green Bay was one of the exceptions, averaging 18.5 PPG allowed and 314.5 yards per game allowed with 11 takeaways and 12 sacks. With three strong teams in both the NFC North and NFC West, someone's going to get left out of the playoff picture, and from that perspective next week's trip to San Francisco might end up being more important to the Bears' postseason chances. Of course, just winning the North would make things a lot easier.

In Week 15, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL against the Los Angeles Chargers. He already underwent surgery on his knee, so his rehab is technically underway. However, there's no guarantee he'll be ready for Week 1 of the 2026 season.

""Every player is different. Every sport is different. Every position is different,"" said Rick Burkholder, the vice president of sports medicine for the Chiefs. ""[Mahomes] is so in tune to what he does, he does it a little quicker. Ballpark on this is nine months, but it could be a month or two more, a month or two less.""

On this week's episode of his ""Outta Pocket"" podcast, Griffin urged Mahomes to sit out all of next season to ensure he returns to full strength. The former No. 2 pick from Baylor suffered a torn ACL back in January of 2013.

“Is all hope lost with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs because he tore his ACL? I would say no, but I do think some changes need to be made,” Griffin said. “And the No. 1 change is not coming back too soon from injury. I believe that Patrick Mahomes should sit out the remainder — obviously the remainder of this year because he’s gonna be out — but he should sit out the entire next season because of when his injury happened.”

RG3 doubles down.

While on ""The Dan Patrick Show"" this Wednesday, Griffin said Mahomes isn't the only player who should sit out all of 2026. He wants Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons to do the same.

Parsons suffered a torn ACL while sprinting towards Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix this past Sunday.

""The No. 1 advice I would give to Micah Parsons and Patrick Mahomes right now is to not play next year,"" Griffin said. ""It's because of when they got hurt. They both got hurt in December. We've seen guys come back in six months, eight months, but you don't really feel like yourself until 15 months after the injury. Don't get me wrong - 80% of Micah Parsons is better than dang near every pass rusher in the NFL and 80% of Patrick Mahomes is better than almost every quarterback in the NFL. But I look at it from my own experience. In hindsight, I wouldn't have played in 2013 because I wasn't back to myself yet.""

Miami will be starting a rookie quarterback and both teams seem to have a fairly lengthy injury report.

For the Bengals, defensive tackles B.J. Hill and Kris Jenkins Jr. missed their second consecutive practices on the week. The interior of the Bengals’ defensive line could be extremely thin if they can’t play Sunday. We could see some defensive lineman called up from the practice squad.

Furthering the concerns on the defensive line, Joseph Ossai (ankle) also missed practice. The Bengals are already down Trey Hendrickson, so Ossai missing the game is an extra hit to the pass rush rotation.

Wideout Tee Higgins (concussion) was limited again and is still actively in the NFL’s concussion protocol. Given the severity of his first concussion and him feeling symptoms over two weeks later, the Bengals wouldn’t catch much flack for sitting him another week.

Wide receiver and return man Charlie Jones (ankle) was also out.

Several players showed on the injury report, meaning they got treatment for an injury, but practiced in full.

For Miami, safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf) missed his second-straight practice. Arguably Miami’s best defender, his absence could be an advantage for the Bengals’ pass-heavy offense.

The news comes just days ahead of the Cowboys returning cornerback Josh Butler to practice, starting his 21-day window in the process, and needing to make a decision on the status of another All-Pro cornerback, Trevon Diggs.

Diggs, whose practice window was opened on Nov. 30, must be activated to the 53-man roster no later than this weekend, or he will also revert to season-ending IR. The Cowboys could justifiably bring both Diggs and Butler up from IR, though they more time to make such a decision on the latter than the former.

For Bland, the injury becomes the latest chapter in his struggle to remain fully healthy and available, and continues the trend of Dallas being unable to consistently field both of their All-Pro cornerbacks at the same time.

Just ahead of the 2024 season, he suffered a fracture in his foot that cost him a total of 10 games. He'd return to finish the year and entered the 2025 season with hopes of regaining top form — one that earned him the title of Pick-Six King during his record-setting 2023 season, leading to a four-year, $92 million extension in the offseason that followed; and prior to the aforementioned fracture in his foot sidelining him.

Bland managed soreness in his foot that cost him a couple games to begin this season as well, however, making the latest battle with the injury that much more concerning. Should he require surgery to repair his left foot, it will mark the second time in as many seasons, and puts his availability for the offseason program and the start of training camp in question.

As it stands, no decision has been made but, with only three games left to play and Bland's injury being grave enough to consider surgery at all, it's likely he's played his last down of 2025.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/rvbkwsnbnbowc8gppyqm,N,,2025-12-18 22:01:33.918263

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

C Graham Glasgow (knee) — New injury

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Glasgow was not on the injury report on Wednesday, but was added with a knee injury on Thursday, which is a less-than-ideal situation. Mid-week injuries can often be too challenging to overcome, but with the Lions holding a walkthrough Wednesday, it may not be as bad as it appears on the surface.

It’s worth noting that until last week, Glasgow was previously listed with a knee injury, so his not practicing could mean that he either: Needed a rest day because his knee was still bothering him (a common practice with veterans), or he is dealing with a new injury/reaggravation that prevented him from practicing. Unfortunately, that leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions and a wide range of outcomes for his availability on Sunday.

Joseph continues to miss practice after suffering a setback last week, and it’s fair to wonder if he’ll play again this season, or if the Lions will consider shutting him down.

Limited practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder) — Upgraded from no practice

OL Trystan Colon (knee)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 20

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

Decker returned to practice on Thursday after taking Wednesday off to rest his shoulder. It’s common for him to miss a practice or two each week, so there isn’t anything concerning with his health at this stage of the week.

Colon is sorting through a new injury this week, but he’s practiced both days, which puts him on track to be available for the Lions this weekend. Fortunately for the Lions, Kayode Awosika and Christian Mahogany—who are both ahead of Colon on the depth chart—are practicing in full this week, helping the Lions solidify some interior offensive line depth.

Manu has officially returned to the practice field (Wednesday’s practice was a walkthrough and an estimated participation level), thus starting his injury evaluation clock. He’ll now have 21 days in the window to be evaluated by the coaching staff, who have already set their eyes on getting him ready for the 2026 season.

“I think for Gio, he needs reps,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. “Practice reps, get out there against our defense, against (Marcus) Davenport and (Aidan Hutchinson) Hutch in real-time practice. There’s not a ton of them, and it’s not like training, but he just needs reps, man. He cannot get enough reps. And if we’re able to use him or there’s something there this year, that’s a bonus. It’s really about getting him—will this set him up better for next year? Training camp, going into that next year. That’s really it.”

Robertson was practicing with his hand injury and is currently trending toward playing, potentially with a club on his hand, according to yesterday’s locker room conversation with Jeremy Reisman.

Full practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb) — Upgraded to full practice

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 12

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki continues to play through his thumb injury and has even shown a bit of a spark on special teams in recent games. This is the first full practice he’s gotten in some time, so he’s almost certainly good to go this week.

Mahogany got in a full week of limited practices and continues to make progress toward returning from injured reserve this week. The Lions are hopeful they can get him back this weekend and start him at left guard on Sunday.

“Last week, certainly was, ‘Okay, that looked pretty good.’ But also knew he wasn’t ready. So, we’re hopeful,” Campbell said of Mahogany possibly returning to game action this weekend. “It’s a good question. I mean, I’m kind of hoping. It looks pretty good. I hope he feels good, but we’ll know more really by Friday. So, full speed (Thursday), Friday he’ll go through, and then we’ll see if he can go.”

Awosika returned to practice last week but was unable to play in the game. However, he’s increased his participation levels this week, suggesting he may be on track to return and could end up starting at left guard if needed.

Harper has now stacked multiple practices, and while he wasn’t able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols last week, his chances look improved based on his participation levels. The Lions would greatly benefit if he were able to return to a starting safety role.

""We're going to do what's best for Rome first and foremost,"" Johnson said. ""I know he wants to be out there and helping. It's hard to tell him no sometimes. He just wants to be out on the field competing and contributing and helping our team win. So there may be a case where we have to protect him from himself a little bit and just make sure we get him right and he'll be able to help us down the road.""

Burden was carted back to the locker room in the third quarter of Chicago's 31-3 win over Cleveland with an ankle injury. He finished as the team's leading receiver with six catches for 84 yards.

DJ Moore paved the way for the Bears' passing attack with his two-touchdown performance against the Browns. His workload could increase even further with Odunze and Burden out, and reserve receivers such as Devin Duvernay and Jahdae Walker might get a chance to play meaningful snaps.

""I've been really pleased with that room,"" Johnson said of the Bears' receiver depth. ""I think we've got some young guys in there that we were really impressed with throughout training camp that ended up being on the practice squad. If called upon, I think they've done a great job soaking the offense in over the course of the season so far and being involved. Coach [Antwaan Randle] El has done a great job with them just keeping them engaged and walking through. They're in a great spot, and I feel that way about all the guys that are either on the practice squad or have been primarily special teams players to this point.""

The Bears (10-4) lost the first meeting between these NFC North rivals two weeks ago in Green Bay but enter Saturday ahead of the Packers (9-4-1) atop the division standings.

Running back D'Andre Swift sustained a groin injury in practice this week that led to him being limited Wednesday and Thursday. He has dealt with groin injuries throughout the season and missed Chicago's Week 9 game at Cincinnati while recovering.

Swift and tight end Cole Kmet (ankle/knee) are listed as questionable against the Packers, but Kmet said he will play.

The Bears activated linebacker Tremaine Edmunds' 21-day window to return to practice this week. He was listed as limited Tuesday and Wednesday and was a full participant Thursday. He is officially questionable.

""If we can get Tremaine back, it's a huge bonus,"" Johnson said. ""He was playing tremendous football before the injury.""

Despite missing four games with a groin injury, Edmunds leads the Bears in tackles (89), is tied for second in passes defensed (9) and is third in interceptions (4).",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0924%2Fr1550543_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 22:01:47.283139

,,2025-12-18 23:22:11+00:00,The Athletic,Travis Kelce on Patrick Mahomes' ACL injury: 'Almost like it wasn't real' - The Athletic,Jayna Bardahl,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6896858/2025/12/17/patrick-mahomes-injury-travis-kelce-chiefs/,"Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said, “It was almost like it wasn’t real” when watching quarterback Patrick Mahomes go down with a torn ACL in Sunday’s 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.
“It’s never easy seeing your guys go down,” Kelce said on Wednesday’s episode of his “New Heights” podcast.
Kelce, along with several other disappointed Chiefs players, did not speak to the media in the postgame locker room.
In opening up about Mahomes’ injury and the Chiefs’ season on his podcast, which Kelce hosts with his brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, Travis described Mahomes as “fearless.” “He’s going to battle through this.
It’s just things didn’t go our way up to that point, and that’s the game for you right there,” Kelce said.","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said, “It was almost like it wasn’t real” when watching quarterback Patrick Mahomes go down with a torn ACL in Sunday’s 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

“It’s never easy seeing your guys go down,” Kelce said on Wednesday’s episode of his “New Heights” podcast. “For the season to be going like it did up to that point, and we’re on our last quest to try and keep our playoff hopes alive there in the fourth quarter, and on a freakish play to see (number) 15 go down like that man, it f—in’ it was almost like it wasn’t real.”

Sunday’s loss was the final straw in a domino effect of outcomes that eliminated the Chiefs from playoff contention. Kelce, along with several other disappointed Chiefs players, did not speak to the media in the postgame locker room.

In opening up about Mahomes’ injury and the Chiefs’ season on his podcast, which Kelce hosts with his brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, Travis described Mahomes as “fearless.”

“He’s going to battle through this. It’s the only way this guy is wired, man,” Kelce said. “He’s a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing. He’s going to make sure he comes back stronger than ever.”

Kelce continued, “Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now, it’s kind of right around that Week 1 or beginning of next year. So I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”

On Monday, Mahomes had surgery to repair the tear in his left ACL. The Chiefs said the procedure was successful and that the three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback will begin his rehab process immediately. ACL recovery can take between nine and 12 months, but coach Andy Reid said he is optimistic Mahomes will recuperate on an accelerated timeline.

Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew will replace Mahomes for the remainder of the season. When he stepped in against the Chargers after Mahomes’ injury, Minshew completed 3-of-5 passes, but ended the game with an interception on a pass intended for Kelce.

“We had some momentum going there with our guy Gardner Minshew and tried to find a way there at the end. It’s just things didn’t go our way up to that point, and that’s the game for you right there,” Kelce said. “Things, when you need them the most, just weren’t falling for us, and you gotta go back to the drawing board.”

The Chiefs have not missed the postseason since 2014. They have made seven straight AFC Championship Game appearances, winning five of them. Kansas City still has three games left (at the Tennessee Titans, versus the Denver Broncos and at the Las Vegas Raiders), but the stakes are different than this team is used to. Kelce was a rookie the last year the Chiefs missed the playoffs, and he described the team’s current state as “unfamiliar territory” to many on the roster.

“We’ve got three games left, I know we’re still talking about this game, but the integrity of who you are as a professional and as a player, you gotta love this s—,” Kelce said. “Chiefs Kingdom, we’re going to give you everything we’ve got. There’s no question about that.

“There’s only one way I do things. There’s only one way Coach Reid does things, and if we’re going to go out there and play some football, we’re going to do it the right way and keep trying to get these things fixed and end on the highest note we can.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/17124056/kelce-mahomes-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-18 20:00:25.608205

Rapoport wrote Adams is ""almost certainly"" going to miss the Rams' Week 16 ""Thursday Night Football"" game but the team listed the 12-year veteran as doubtful on Wednesday's final injury report.

The winner of this pivotal ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup will likely take control of the NFC West division and have the inside track to the NFC's No. 1 seed.

Here's the latest on Adams before the ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Seahawks.

Davante Adams injury update

The Rams have not yet announced whether Adams will be available for Thursday night's game against the Seahawks.

Adams failed to practice in any capacity on the short week and his status for the game is still undetermined. Official word may not come until the Rams announce their inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football.""

Adams has not missed any games this season. He has not missed a game since September 2024, when he missed two games due to a hamstring injury. Prior to that, he played all but one game between 2021 and 2023.

With Rapoport suggesting Adams will miss Thursday's game, it's likely the Rams will allow Adams extra time to rest with the ""mini bye"" following ""Thursday Night Football."" The Rams have already clinched a playoff spot but remain in the race for the No. 1 seed.

Los Angeles would certainly benefit if Adams can regain full health by the start of the postseason.

Rams WR depth chart

Puka Nacua

Davante Adams (questionable – hamstring)

Konata Mumpfield

Tutu Atwell

Jordan Whittington

Xavier Smith

Nacua ranks second in the NFL in receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,367), but if Adams misses time, the wide receiver room is thin. Atwell returned from IR in Week 15 and Mumpfield has scored just one touchdown this season. No Rams wide receivers outside of Nacua and Adams have garnered more than 25 targets in 2025.

Running back Kyren Williams and tight end Colby Parkinson will likely see additional work if Adams misses time.

Safety Kerby Joseph has missed the last eight games with a knee injury and may be moved to injured reserve.

Cornerback Amik Robertson practiced with a club on his injured left hand and expects to play Sunday.

Left tackle Taylor Decker, who missed last week's practices, was a limited participant.

Graham Glasgow played all 64 snaps last Sunday in the Detroit Lions' loss to the Los Angeles Rams this past Sunday.

But on Thursday, when the team held its first full practice since that defeat, the veteran center did not participate and was listed with a knee injury on the organization's official report. This season, Glasgow has started 13 of 14 games. However, a knee injury caused him to miss the Lions' loss to Green Bay late last month. It's uncertain, however, whether his current condition is related to his previous ailment.

Glasgow was one of two players absent Thursday. The other was Kerby Joseph.

Joseph’s absence wasn’t much of a surprise. He has missed the last eight games as he continues to deal with a lingering bone bruise in his left knee. After returning to practice Dec. 10, he suffered a “setback,” according to Lions coach Dan Campbell. He hasn’t participated in practice since. Campbell acknowledged last week that the All-Pro safety could be moved to injured reserve in the near future.

“We’re at the backend of the season now, so anything – even if it’s not technically long term becomes long term because we don’t have many games left,” he said then.

But Joseph remains on the active roster.

There was fear that the secondary could lose another one of its main cogs when cornerback Amik Robertson left late in the fourth quarter of the Lions’ 41-34 loss to the Los Angeles Rams this past Sunday. But Robertson was going through drills Thursday with a black-colored club on the left hand he injured while trying to strip the ball from tight end Colby Parkinson on his game-sealing 11-yard touchdown catch.

Robertson, who was listed as a limited partipant, told reporters Wednesday that he planned to play Sunday against Pittsburgh.

“That’s how it is looking, if everything goes right,” he said. “It went right (Wednesday) … I’m going to try to have some contact, and I should be fine.”

Other observations: Tight end Brock Wright (trachea) and linebacker Zach Cunningham (hamstring), who are both on injured reserve, were seen working off to the side at practice. Left tackle Taylor Decker, who missed every practice last week but played the maximum number of offensive snaps Sunday, was listed as a limited participant Thursday. He has spent much of the year dealing with pain in his surgically-repaired right shoulder.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/02/PDTF/87052114007-110225-lionsvikspre-011.jpg?crop=4431,2493,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-18 20:00:33.691843

The winner of said game will likely have the inside track to the conference's No. 1 seed throughout the postseason next month, which obviously means guaranteed homefield advantage and the sole bye week available.

Unfortunately for the Rams, who beat the Seahawks at home earlier this season, they will have to overcome their NFC West rival on the road without one of their best players.

Veteran star receiver Davante Adams is likely to miss Thursday's game with a left hamstring injury. It's a reaggravation of the same injury Adams suffered earlier this season. The Rams apparently don't believe Adams' injury is of a long-term variety. He could theoretically return as soon as next week. But with the postseason around the corner, they're rightfully proceeding with caution so one of their top playmakers is healthy and can play in the biggest games.

Even still, a road game against the team nipping at your heels in the NFC and NFC West is probably the worst game to miss. Alas, the Rams are definitely more equipped than most to survive without Adams for at least one week:

We'll see how the Rams fare without Adams, who leads the team in touchdowns (14) and is second in both catches and receiving yards.

Green Bay ruled out tight end Josh Whyle (concussion), running back MarShawn Lloyd (calf/hamstring), and guard John Williams (back).

Watson avoided a significant injury despite being transported to a local hospital in Denver to be examined for chest-related injuries after crashing hard to ground while laying out for a deep ball in the third quarter on Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Broncos.

The fourth-year wideout was cleared to travel with the team Sunday night and allowed to practice on a limited basis this week.

""Encouraging,"" said Head Coach Matt LaFleur when asked before practice Thursday what he's seen from Watson this week. ""Ultimately, it's going to come down to, obviously, medical decision about where he's at on Saturday.""

Jacobs and Tom rode bikes in lieu of practice Thursday, but LaFleur said the team plans to give both up until gametime.

Jacobs told reporters after Tuesday's walkthrough that he took another shot to his injured knee during the Broncos game, which he originally hurt last month against the New York Giants. He fought through the pain in part because Emanuel Wilson was battling an illness and Brooks suffered a chest injury in the game.

""I just know how much it meant, honestly,"" said Jacobs earlier this week. ""Then Chris (Brooks) got banged up a little bit, so I feel like I'd be doing him a disservice if I let him go out there when he can barely stand up straight. So for me, it was just talking to myself and not really wanting to put nobody else in a tough position.""

The Packers placed star defensive lineman Micah Parsons on season-ending injured reserve on Wednesday, but reinforcements could be coming as both Cox Jr. and Oliver were full participants in practice this week.

Cox (injured reserve) and Oliver (physically unable to perform) are Green Bay's reserve lists and need to be activated to the 53-man roster to play against the Bears.

A fifth-round pick in April's NFL Draft, Oliver has yet to play this season while Cox has been sidelined since the opener against Detroit. The third-year defensive end had four sacks during the final seven games of the 2024 season.

""Having him back past couple of practices just been great,"" said defensive lineman Rashan Gary earlier this week. ""Seeing him get off the ball, setting edges, things like that, him building his confidence, and just understanding that we need him to go.""

Receiver/kickoff returner Savion Williams (foot) did not receive a game status and will play Saturday. The rookie third-round pick missed the past three games.

In addition to Williams, Jordan Love (left shoulder), defensive end Lukas Van Ness (foot), and receivers Matthew Golden (wrist), and Jayden Reed (personal matter) don't carry a game status and will play Saturday.

Chicago ruled out receivers Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden (ankle), and linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (hamstring).

The Bears also listed four questionable: running back D'Andre Swift (groin), tight end Cole Kmet (ankle/knee), defensive lineman Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (personal matter) and linebacker Tremaine Edmunds (groin).

""He still has some vision limitations in his [right] eye,"" Steichen said.
""So we're going to get him back on the practice field, get him throwing, doing some scout-team reps.
""Right now, Philip's our starting quarterback,"" Steichen said Thursday.
""I need to be back on the field,"" Richardson said.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. returned to practice Thursday, two months after a scary pregame incident endangered his right eye and left him with a fractured orbital bone.

The Colts are not committing to Richardson returning to the field this season, with coach Shane Steichen saying they want to first evaluate him given the injury's impact on his vision.

""He still has some vision limitations in his [right] eye,"" Steichen said. ""So we're going to get him back on the practice field, get him throwing, doing some scout-team reps. It's just something that's he's going to have to manage through the process.""

For his part, Richardson acknowledged some vision issues but said things are mostly back to normal.

""There's not really major limitations,"" he said. ""It's just a little different because of the impact in my eye, but most of it's really the same. I was still able to move around the same and do everything I needed to do. So that's not that bad.""

He added, ""It's improved a lot, actually. When it first happened, it was just a lot of swelling and everything. Couldn't see much. But after two or three weeks from the surgery, everything healed up nice.""

As for the starting quarterback for the time being, that remains Philip Rivers. The veteran quarterback came out of retirement at 44 last week, after five seasons away from the game, to fill in at quarterback in the aftermath of Daniel Jones' season-ending Achilles injury.

""Right now, Philip's our starting quarterback,"" Steichen said Thursday.

The Colts host the San Francisco 49ers on ""Monday Night Football"" to end Week 16.

The next steps for Richardson involve the Colts monitoring his progress in practice. Steichen said he would not be active for Monday's game.

For Richardson, the return to practice was a long time coming. He was initially prohibited from doing any strenuous physical activity after the injury because the bone needed time to heal.

""I need to be back on the field,"" Richardson said. ""I love playing football. I've been doing it since I was 2. And it's just something I love doing. I just love being here with my teammates. And originally, they told me I was going to have to wait until after the season to see how my eye healed up. And luckily, I got clear this month and I just thank God for it.

""I'm ready to practice.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1218%2Fr1591096_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 15:01:17.714013

Chase Brown (at MIA) — Opponents are 68-of-75 when throwing to RBs this season against MIA (90.7%, would be just the second +90% season since 2010, the 2023 Vikings also had that weakness). Two running backs have at least 4 games with 7+ catches. Christian McCaffrey (7 such games) and Chase Brown (four).

Tyler Allgeier (at ARZ) — The Cardinals are one of two teams allowing 4+ red zone trips per game (Bengals) and allow a league-high 2.6 goal-to-go trips per game. Of 43 RBs with 100+ carries, Allgeier is scoring once every 13.8 carries, the best rate in the NFL (Jahmyr Gibbs and Josh Jacobs are 2-3).

Bucky Irving (at CAR) — His 6 straight 15+ carry games are tied for the longest active streak (Javonte Williams). Last season, he had 20+ rushes, 110+ rush yards, and 30+ receiving yards in both games against the Panthers

Blake Corum — 30 carries for 280 yards and 4 TDs over the past three weeks. The explosion is nice, but how about the floor: he has gained yardage on all 30 of those rush attempts.

Jaxson Dart (vs. MIN) — MIN is pacing to lead the NFL in blitz rate for a third straight season, and they have five of the single highest blitz rate games this season. Since Week 8, Matthew Stafford leads the NFL in passer rating against the blitz (131.6). Drake Maye (122.3) and Jaxson Dart (117.1) is third. New York’s rookie is 22-of-35 for 286 yards, 3 TDs, and 0 INTs in those spots over that stretch.

Caleb Williams (vs GB) — Week 14 against the Packers: 25% complete when pressured and 69.6% when not. Remove Micah Parsons from the equation, and it’s easy to see the non-pressured pass count spike.

CJ Stroud (vs. LV) — The Raiders allow the 2nd fewest yards before carry to RBs this season: HOU may control this game, but that doesn’t mean that the run game is the reason why.

He walked around the pitch at full time with an ice pack around his left knee.
“It looks looks like a knee problem and Tino’s had issues with knee injuries before,” Howe told a post-match press conference.
Let’s wait and see.” Livramento spent over a month on the sidelines between October and November after suffering ligament damage to his left knee earlier this season.
Newcastle are already contending with a number of defensive injury absences, with Dan Burn, Sven Botman, Kieran Trippier and Emil Krafth all sidelined.","Eddie Howe said full-back Tino Livramento is a doubt to face Chelsea on Saturday after he was forced off with a knee injury during Newcastle United’s Carabao Cup quarter-final win against Fulham.

Livramento, 23, received medical attention on the pitch at St James’ Park on Wednesday before being replaced in the 76th minute. He walked around the pitch at full time with an ice pack around his left knee.

Howe described the defender’s need to be withdrawn as “worrying” as Newcastle contend with a number of defensive injuries but said he was unsure on the severity of the problem at this stage.

“It looks looks like a knee problem and Tino’s had issues with knee injuries before,” Howe told a post-match press conference. “So the fact he had to come off and he’s such an honest, dependable lad – that sends worrying signs, really, for his participation maybe in the Chelsea game. Let’s wait and see.”

Livramento spent over a month on the sidelines between October and November after suffering ligament damage to his left knee earlier this season. He was sidelined for nearly a year when he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, again in his left knee, in April 2022 while playing for Southampton.

Newcastle are already contending with a number of defensive injury absences, with Dan Burn, Sven Botman, Kieran Trippier and Emil Krafth all sidelined.

Lewis Hall also missed Wednesday’s win against Fulham due to a hamstring problem, with Livramento moving to left-back and midfielder Lewis Miley slotting in at right-back. Howe, however, said Hall is in contention to return to face Chelsea at the weekend.

“Lewis (Hall), we’re more positive on. He couldn’t play today. He felt some tightness in his hamstring, but he has a chance for Chelsea. We’ve got a number of injuries to the same position, which is never good.”

Asked about the possibility of recalling left-back Matt Targett from his season-long loan spell at Middlesbrough in January as a solution to the extensive defensive injury list, Howe replied: “We’ll make that decision closer to the date where we have to, but certainly at the moment… I don’t have many more rabbits to pull out of the hat to be honest, so we’re in dangerous territory, so let’s see.”

Newcastle were 2-1 winners over Fulham thanks to Miley’s stoppage-time goal to secure their place in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, where they will play Manchester City.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/17181758/GettyImages-2251799612-scaled-e1766013498338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-18 14:02:11.486030

It's a similar situation for Green Bay at right tackle after Tom injured his knee on Jacobs' 14-yard touchdown catch off a wheel route in the second quarter.
Green Bay knows it won't have Parsons the rest of the way, but there's an entire roster ready to step up in the enigmatic playmaker's absence.","GREEN BAY – While Micah Parsons was officially placed on injured reserve Wednesday, the Packers continue to take a wait-and-see approach with several key players entering Saturday's NFC North showdown with Chicago.

Receivers Christian Watson (chest) and Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), and defensive lineman Lukas Van Ness (ankle) all returned in a limited capacity to practice after being estimated as non-participants during Tuesday's walkthrough.

Meanwhile, running back Josh Jacobs, safety Evan Williams and right tackle Zach Tom are all taking a day-to-day approach as far as their availability for the Bears game despite not having practiced this week due to their respective knee injuries.

Seeing Watson back on the practice field was a major sigh of relief for Green Bay after the fourth-year receiver crashed hard on his chest and shoulder after laying out for a deep ball from quarterback Jordan Love early in the third quarter.

Watson said he was transported to a local hospital to be examined for dislocated ribs. He was allowed to fly home with the team after the game and is ""fighting to play"" in Chicago, according to Head Coach Matt LaFleur.

""I dodged a bullet with it, so definitely think I'm in a better spot than I anticipated right away,"" said Watson, who has 28 catches for 481 yards and five touchdowns since returning in October.

""Hopefully it feels a little bit better each and every day, and we're at the point in the season where you gotta fight through some stuff, so should be good.""

Because of everything involved with the hospital visit, Watson said he didn't even know the full scale of the injuries the Packers suffered in Denver until he opened his phone on the plane ride home.

Watson's situation began a nightmarish third quarter for the Packers, who then lost Parsons and Williams on the same play with less than a minute left in the quarter.

Williams told reporters after Wednesday's practice that he sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament after getting rolled into while fighting a block in pursuit of Broncos receiver Marvin Mims deep in the secondary.

Williams didn't know until after the play was over that Parsons tore his anterior cruciate ligament on the other side of the play.

""It was funny from my point of view, because the play finished, I'm rolling over. I'm like, 'Oh my God. I know something happened,'"" Williams said. ""Then I look up, thinking there's going to be a couple trainers. There's one trainer holding a water bottle. And I'm like, 'Where's everybody else?' And there's 15 in a circle all around Micah. I was like, 'Oh, damn.'""

Third-year veteran Zayne Anderson finished the game at free safety in place of Williams and could start there Saturday if the second-year safety can't go.

It's a similar situation for Green Bay at right tackle after Tom injured his knee on Jacobs' 14-yard touchdown catch off a wheel route in the second quarter.

Tom said he took an awkward step while anchoring against a bull rush on the play. Darian Kinnard came in and played the final 39 offensive snaps at right tackle. He or former first-round pick Jordan Morgan would candidates to start against the Bears if Tom isn't cleared.

Tom has started 12 games for the Packers this season despite playing through oblique and back injuries since Week 2. Tom didn't want to get into specifics with the knee injury but said it's a balance of pain tolerance and not trying to do further damage.

""There's some things in there (the knee) that we need to work on that need to get healed before I can go out there and feel confident,"" Tom said. ""I would say the oblique (injury) was probably worse. This one is more so trying to protect myself from doing further damage and keeping me out even longer.""

Joining Tom as one of Green Bay's six injury-related DNPs on Wednesday was Jacobs, who took another shot to his injured knee during Sunday's 34-26 loss in Denver.

The three-time Pro Bowler told reporters on Tuesday he doesn't believe he'll need surgery, reiterating the only thing his knee requires is rest that's often difficult to come by in-season.

Despite all that, Jacobs still totaled 92 yards and two touchdowns while playing 36 of 66 offensive snaps (55%) in Denver. Backup running back Chris Brooks also suffered a chest injury against the Broncos that has him listed on the injury report as limited.

""If it's up to me, yeah, for sure I'm going to try to go,"" Jacobs said. ""For me, it's harder to watch games than it is to play hurt. I'd rather try to contribute in some type of fashion, even if it's in a limited fashion, than just sit there and watch the whole time. I've always had that kind of mindset.""

It's a sentiment shared among most of the Packers' wounded given the significance of Saturday's game against the Bears, who regained a half game lead over Green Bay in the NFC North after a 31-3 romp of the Cleveland Browns.

Green Bay knows it won't have Parsons the rest of the way, but there's an entire roster ready to step up in the enigmatic playmaker's absence.

""I feel like our culture really is just next man up. As one person gets hurt, you get another person with the opportunity,"" Williams said. ""Definitely, it sucks to see guys go down that are key points for this team, but it's also an opportunity for more opportunities for other people. That's pretty cool to see, to see other people get their shot, and to get to see what they get to do with their time on the field.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/waxjbgaaxpzmgbjt6gnt,N,,2025-12-18 16:00:59.492464

Patrick Mahomes return timeline Burkholder did provide an estimate for Mahomes' return.","For the first time since 2014, the Kansas City Chiefs will be watching the NFL playoffs from home. Two-time MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes is watching a little earlier as he recovers from a torn ACL suffered against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 15.

Mahomes underwent surgery to repair his torn ACL Monday in Dallas. Dr. Dan Cooper of the Carrell Clinic performed the surgery, and Chiefs officials say the star quarterback will begin his rehab immediately.

Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder gave a recap of what happened to Mahomes and an update on his status today.

Burkholder said both the in-house staff with the Chiefs and Dr. Cooper agreed on the severity of the injury.

""Everything that he had in this injury was fixable, correctable and it was fixed on Monday night by Dr. Cooper,"" Burkholder said. ""He had no artery damage, no nerve damage, no joint surface damage, no meniscal damage. He's already started rehab down in Dallas and he'll do that through tomorrow and be back here Friday.

As you know in the past with Patrick and his injuries, he attacks them and does very well and he's in that mode right now.""

Burkholder outlined that Mahomes will do the majority of his rehabilitation of the knee injury in Kansas City with the Chiefs' staff. He reiterated that every player, sport and recovery from a knee injury like this is different but mentioned again how Mahomes has done well in recovering from prior injuries.

Patrick Mahomes return timeline

Burkholder did provide an estimate for Mahomes' return.

""Ballpark on this thing is nine months,"" he said. ""Could be a month or two less, could be a month or two more. You never know what goes and everyone's designed differently bio-mechanically so you just have to go through it and then he has position-specific things he needs to do.""

That estimate puts Mahomes potentially in line to start early on in the 2026 regular season, if rehab goes accordingly.

The later end of the window could put him back on the field sometime in November.

The priority for Burkholder and the rest of the team is to get Mahomes' muscles turned on and the overall swelling post-surgery down. The two-time MVP is in a brace while this is going on during the phase immediately after surgery.

Compared to other players he's worked with during rehabilitation, Burkholder acknowledges Mahomes is slightly different.

""As a player, his mindset is a little different than most. He's so regimented in what he does, he's in here at 6 a.m., he's the last guy out at night,"" he said.

With Pittsburgh closing out Week 15 in command of the AFC North, here are some of the biggest storylines coming out of the week.

Unfortunately for fans, Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career. Mahomes already underwent surgery to repair the issue.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.

A concussion, hamstring injury and broken collarbone have limited Evans to five games this season, making the 1,000-yard mark unreachable with three weeks to play.
""I broke my collarbone and had the concussion in one and I knew it was over,"" Evans said on his streak, via the Buccaneers' Players' Table show.
""50 seasons of Buccaneers history and I am in the history books as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer tied with Jerry Rice.

He won't flirt with making it 12 in 2025. A concussion, hamstring injury and broken collarbone have limited Evans to five games this season, making the 1,000-yard mark unreachable with three weeks to play.

It's a reality Evans knew was coming for some time.

""I broke my collarbone and had the concussion in one and I knew it was over,"" Evans said on his streak, via the Buccaneers' Players' Table show. ""It is just one of those things that it wasn't meant to be, and that is OK, and I am cool with that. I tied with Jerry Rice, one of the greatest ever, if not the greatest player ever, so that is enough for me. I just want to help my team get to the playoffs now.

""50 seasons of Buccaneers history and I am in the history books as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer tied with Jerry Rice. That is amazing and you cannot even think of that as a kid to draw that up or to dream about that. So, I have been blessed to be a staple of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.""

With his consecutive 1,000-yard receiving streak on the line and less than a minute to play in Tampa Bay's Week 18 win over New Orleans last season, Baker Mayfield found Evans for a completion that the wideout took another 7 yards to clear the milestone, tying Rice for the most such consecutive seasons in NFL history and sending the Raymond James Stadium crowd into a lovable frenzy.

It was a moment Bucs fans will cherish for decades to come, cementing Evans as one of the franchise's all-time greats and placing him on a path toward Canton. His road has been much rockier in 2025, but his return to action in Week 15 proved he still has plenty of juice and the ability to make big plays the Buccaneers have lacked without him.

Tampa Bay will need it. The Buccaneers have lost five of their last six games, opening the door for Carolina to climb back into the NFC South race with three weeks left in the campaign.

By some standards, it's an achievement that the Buccaneers have even managed to stay in contention, given the rash of injuries that have affected them throughout 2025. Chris Godwin preceded Evans in returning a few weeks ago, but it wasn't until Evans rejoined him that the explosive receiving duo began to look like themselves again.

In the 29-28 loss to Atlanta in Week 15, Evans caught six of 12 targets for 132 yards, including a few big plays created by the rock-solid rapport shared by Evans and Mayfield. Godwin benefitted too, catching four passes for 20 yards, a touchdown and a successful two-point try.

Although the Bucs failed to finish the job and defeat the Falcons, the offensive successes gave them reason to believe they can return to the level of productivity that helped them sprint to a 5-1 start.

""We were thinking what if we all come back together and what we could truly be and that is one of the best receiver rooms on the planet,"" Evans said of his and Godwin's return, ""and we are trying to get into that form right now and help this team continue to make plays.""

Jalen McMillan got in on the return-to-action fun too, making his season debut in Week 15 and filling out a receiving corps that was disproportionately leaning on rookie Emeka Egbuka. In theory, with all four now available, the Buccaneers (7-7) should find more offensive success over the final three weeks, which includes two dates with the rival Panthers (7-7), including this Sunday.

Such success would be enough to send Buccaneers fans home happy, much like they were when Evans extended his streak nearly a year ago.

,,2025-12-18 13:51:14+00:00,NFL.com,Joe Burrow 'can't see' world in which he's not with Bengals in 2026 - NFL.com,Nick Shook,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/joe-burrow-can-t-see-world-in-which-he-s-not-with-bengals-in-2026,"Joe Burrow's Bengals are out of the playoff race for a third straight season, yet the familiar, disappointing result hasn't quenched Burrow's burning desire to continue playing football for the franchise.

""It feels like everything, everybody's trying to do everything in their power to make me not play football, and I feel like I'm fighting it, like fighting everybody else.

Speculation has run wild in recent days after Burrow's recent comments about needing to have fun if he wanted to continue ""doing this."" On Wednesday, Burrow was asked if he could see a world in which he wasn't playing for the Bengals in 2026.

""I can't see that, no,"" he said.

Burrow was less emphatic when asked if he'd thought about ever playing elsewhere.

""You think about a lot of things,"" he said.

Burrow went on to explain that the NFL is an anything-than-can-happen landscape.

""A lot of crazy things happen every year,"" he said. ""Micah Parsons got traded before the season this year. ... Crazy things can happen.""

For now, Burrow is focused on playing the Bengals' final games of 2025, even if some believe he shouldn't be taking part in those contests considering his injury history and Cincinnati having been eliminated from postseason contention.

After all, he was forced to watch most of the 2025 regular season in street clothes before returning on Thanksgiving. Now that his team has little to play for in 2025, some are asking why Burrow -- a frequently injured franchise quarterback playing with a modified cleat to protect his surgically repaired toe -- is risking his health to play in Cincinnati's final three games.

Burrow is tired of hearing the concerns.

""I like playing football. For the same reasons that I wanted to push to come back from injury, the same reasons I wanted to play this week,"" he said Wednesday. ""It feels like everything, everybody's trying to do everything in their power to make me not play football, and I feel like I'm fighting it, like fighting everybody else. I just want to play ball. That's all I want to do.""

Burrow's vague references to faceless adversaries didn't come with subsequent clarification, leaving his response open to interpretation and opening a spiderweb of theories.

After consecutive trips to the AFC Championship Game in 2021-2022 (including one triumph and Super Bowl appearance), Cincinnati will spend its third straight winter watching the postseason from home, prompting some to wonder whether coach Zac Taylor's days are numbered. One might guess Burrow is referring to Taylor or perhaps general manager Duke Tobin, but that train of thought would also lead directly into a tunnel of conspiracy.

The quarterback certainly isn't helping matters with his recent statements during interviews, speaking of his need to enjoy football in order to continue playing. The Bengals haven't had much fun over the last three seasons, fighting to stay in playoff races while battling immense adversity, which has often included Burrow's injury-related absences.

This stream-of-consciousness approach to media sessions has led some to wonder whether Burrow might be angling for an exit or applying pressure in order to force organizational change. Some have also questioned whether Burrow might channel his inner Barry Sanders and walk away in his prime because of his team's repeated struggles. That doesn't seem realistic, at least not now.

""You think about it, but you think about a lot of different things in your life, just like everybody does,"" Burrow said. ""You think about all the different possibilities that could happen. I'm going to playing for a long time. I expect to play for a long time. I expect to play well and consistently great for a long time.""

Burrow quelled the latter fear with his Wednesday response, but it's clear he's tired of arriving at the same disheartening December conclusion. He already received his wish when the Bengals managed to fit extensions for him, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins into their salary cap over the last two years; that's not enough to keep him content, though, not with the consistent failure to make the playoffs.

Burrow isn't without fault, either. His absence -- caused by a season-ending wrist injury that forced Jake Browning into the lineup -- contributed to their downfall in 2023, while a fully healthy 2024 season fell apart because Cincinnati's defense couldn't stop a nosebleed in key losses. On Sunday, Burrow's two-interception performance resulted in a 24-0 loss to the division-rival Ravens, vanquishing their last hope of reaching the postseason.

Judging by Burrow's comments, those in charge might like to limit further mistakes by protecting Burrow from further risk, even if the quarterback denied it when asked if anyone in the building was trying to prevent him from playing.

The remaining games won't matter much for the Bengals in 2025. The offseason, however, might be more important than ever.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/wyezjjckm5hpnulijjys,N,,2025-12-18 12:02:14.564649

Neither participated in their first full practice of the week Wednesday. They also were ruled out on the Bears’ estimated injury report after Tuesday’s walkthrough.

The Bears have one final injury report Thursday.

Burden hurt his ankle after catching a screen pass Sunday and is considered day-to-day. Odunze is trying to return from a chronic foot injury that he has tried to manage for most of the season. He sat out the Bears’ first game against the Packers and was slated to return Sunday, only to feel pain during warmups.

Receivers coach Antwaan Randle El said he has tried to encourage Odunze, who had never missed an NFL game until two weeks ago.

“To miss one game is tough enough, but it’s a tough deal,” he said. “You have to keep encouraging him — ‘Hey, we can’t wait to get [you] back. This too shall pass. It’s just a bump in the road.’ ”

Linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga remains out with a hamstring injury. The Bears also added running back D’Andre Swift to the injury report with a groin injury. He was limited, as was tight end Cole Kmet, who hurt his back and ankle Sunday.

In fact, Hafley made a very bold proclamation Wednesday, predicting that the 2026 season will be a historic one for Parsons, who prior to his injury became the first player in NFL history to record at least 12.5 sacks in each of his first five seasons.

""If I were a betting man, I would bet that he comes back even better and probably breaks the sack record next year,"" Hafley told reporters Wednesday. ""So I'm going to put that on Micah and myself. You guys can put it out there, and that's the confidence I have in him.""

The single-season sack record of 22.5 is currently held by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt -- but potentially not for long. Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett is just one sack away from tying the record this season and has three games left to break it. Garrett said his goal is to finish the season with 25 sacks, so Parsons is going to have his hands full to prove his defensive coordinator right.

Micah Parsons to have ACL surgery: How Green Bay will try to replace star pass rusher

JP Acosta

Record aside, it's clear that Parsons has made a quick impression on Hafley after he was traded from the Dallas Cowboys just prior to the start of the season. Parsons has made an impact on the field as well with Green Bay's defense currently ranking eighth in the NFL in points allowed.

In 14 games, Parsons put up 12.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, 12 tackles for loss and 26 quarterback hits. During a recent three-game span, Parsons tallied six sacks as Green Bay won each game after an underwhelming 5-3-1 start.

""He's a guy that came in here, literally, like three days before we played a game,"" Hafley said. ""Quickly developed a really good relationship with him. ... I just have so much respect for the guy.""

While Hafley has high hopes for Parsons in 2026, he is also confident that his defense can continue to have success this season, starting with Sunday's pivotal road game against the Chicago Bears -- a matchup with major playoff implications.

""We've got really good players. We've played good defense and we're going to continue to play good defense,"" Hafley said. ""Our guys understand that and I think it's important for everyone to understand that these guys have a lot of pride and they're going to get even closer because of this. And they're going to play well.

""Our best players are going to step up. And the guys who haven't played a lot, that's been our job all year is to develop those guys so in situations like this, they're going to step up.

""I'm ready,"" Jones said Friday. ""I've been in the league a little while. It's just football.""

Jones, a third-round pick in 2020, signed with the Seahawks this offseason after spending the past five seasons in Arizona, Houston and Baltimore. He has appeared in 87 games in his career, including 11 this season, with 24 starts, most recently starting three games for the Texans in 2023.

""It feels like a long time, but preseason helped with that,"" Jones said when asked about the last time he started. ""It has been a minute, but I'm super excited and looking forward to it.""

One thing that should help Jones and the offensive line is the fact that he got extensive first-team work alongside left guard Grey Zabel during training camp and the preseason, working with the starters while Cross was recovering from surgery to repair a dislocated finger.

Said Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, ""He got most of those opportunities in preseason, and he did a great job filling in for Charles when he was going through his training camp stuff.

The Miami Dolphins are benching Tagovailoa in favor of seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers ahead of Sunday's Week 16 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported on Wednesday, per sources informed of the move.

McDaniel confirmed the news later Wednesday, adding that Zach Wilson will back up Ewers, while Tagovailoa will serve as the emergency third-string quarterback.

""I think Quinn gives this team the best chance to win,"" McDaniel told reporters, explaining his decision. ""Ultimately, the team needs and I'm looking for conviction in quarterback play. Understanding that he is a rookie, I felt that he would play the position the most convicted, which impacts every player on the field.""

Tagovailoa said Wednesday that he was ""disappointed"" by the news -- ""I'm not happy about it"" -- but vowed to help Ewers and Wilson prepare to play.

""I'm here, and my role right now, if I'm not starting, is to help the starter help us win games,"" Tagovailoa told reporters.

The benching doesn't come as a surprise after McDaniel said Tuesday he was contemplating the move. When coaches begin waffling on a starter, a change almost always follows.

On Tuesday, McDaniel said the quarterback play “was not good enough.” Now he'll see if he can get better from Ewers.

How Tua's struggles led to benching

Tagovailoa's struggles aren't a one- or two-week issue. The starter has been on the downswing for more than a month.

In Monday night's blowout loss, he put up 65 passing yards with an interception and two drive-killing sacks through three quarters. The bulk of his 253 passing yards and both of his touchdowns came in garbage time.

During the Dolphins' four-game winning streak that preceded their Week 15 loss, McDaniel had mitigated the passing game, leaning on an explosive rushing attack. Tua went four consecutive games with fewer than 175 passing yards. It was enough to beat mostly sub-500 teams, but not an indicator of a healthy passing attack.

Tagovailoa leads the NFL with 15 interceptions in 2025. His -0.06 EPA per dropback ranks fourth-worst among quarterbacks with at least 300 pass attempts, ahead of only Cam Ward, Geno Smith and Joe Flacco, per Next Gen Stats. His total QBR is also fourth-worst among qualifying QBs -- Ward, Smith and J.J. McCarthy.

We've seen little of the quick-decision, precision passing game that Tua deployed during his Pro Bowl season in 2023, when he led the NFL with 4,624 yards passing. Far too often, the sixth-year pro has looked lost, missing reads, spiking throws, struggling with pressure and making rookie-type mistakes.

McDaniel's conscious diminishment of the passing offense over the past month spoke volumes about what he thought of the quarterback's play. The benching cemented those assumptions.

Examining QB's future in Miami

If McDaniel remains the head coach in 2026, can he really turn back to a benched quarterback? Can Miami afford to move on?

The Dolphins inked Tagovailoa to a four-year, $212.4 million contract in 2024. Less than two years in, he's been sent to the bench for ineffective play. With three years remaining on his contract, Tua is due $56.4 million guaranteed in 2026.

Cutting or trading him would not come cheap. Releasing him outright would carry a $99.2 million dead-money hit. Even a post-June 1 release would still count $67.4 million against the cap in 2026. A spring trade would be a little less, with $45.2 million in dead money hitting the books. But who is trading for an ineffective, benched QB with a $39 million base salary?

We've seen teams take their lumps with dead money. Russell Wilson in Denver is the biggest example, with the Broncos taking on a record $85 million in dead money, including $53 million in 2024.

The other factor in benching Tagovailoa is his injury history. The quarterback missed multiple games in four of his first five seasons, including multiple concussions and a hip injury that ended his 2024 season. Putting him in bubble wrap to close the season will avoid an injury that could hinder the Dolphins' options this offseason.

Miami is already in a salary-cap quandary, projected to be roughly $11 million over the cap next season, per Over The Cap. Tackling that and dead money from Tua's contract would take gold-medal level cap gymnastics.

The Dolphins could take a page from the Falcons playbook with Kirk Cousins, hanging on to the highly-paid quarterback as an uber-expensive backup -- while possibly hoping a post-June 1 trade materialized to offer some relief. Even considering that move would require a cheap starter on a rookie contract to take the reins.

There are no great options if Tua isn't on the field earning his money.

What can Ewers provide down stretch?

The offseason steps in Miami could come down to how Ewers plays down the stretch.

The seventh-round rookie gets the nod over former Jets first-rounder Zach Wilson, who had been the backup in recent weeks. The decision to leapfrog Wilson for Ewers feels like a move to see what the rookie has to offer. If he hits -- say, like Brock Purdy -- it would give Miami a potential cheap starter at the most expensive position in football.

Ewers has appeared in one game this season, taking over for a benched Tagovailoa in a Week 7 blowout loss to the Cleveland Browns. In mop-up duty, the rookie completed 5 of 8 passes for 53 yards. Now he'll get a chance to show what he's got with a full week of prep.

A three-year starter at Texas, Ewers passed for 9,128 yards and 68 touchdowns with 24 interceptions in 36 games in Austin. The 22-year-old doesn't have the strongest whip, but he can get the ball out quickly, and works in rhythm. Those should benefit him in McDaniel's offense. The rookie will have to display a solid understanding of his progression and avoid the negative plays that hindered him in his final season at Texas.

With the Dolphins officially eliminated from the postseason, they'll give the seventh-rounder a shot down the stretch. It's a worthwhile move. If Ewers impresses, it would provide a massive low-cost answer at quarterback entering 2026. If he bombs, nothing is lost, and Miami could start to look at first-round rookies in April's draft.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/dgumajosqotkauxru6au,N,,2025-12-18 01:59:05.449320

Locke as a fill-in starter across from Talanoa Hufanga. The team's depth safeties behind them are Devon Key and JL Skinner (plus Delarrin Turner-Yell on the practice squad).

The Broncos also have rookie cornerback Jahdae Barron, who has played rotational snaps at safety. So the team will likely turn to in-house options to replace Jones in the starting lineup, but they could still use more depth at safety. Here's a quick look at five veteran free agents Denver could consider, perhaps for a spot on the practice squad.

1. Jordan Whitehead (28): He's a Super Bowl champion with 11 interceptions on his resume, but he hasn't played since a car accident prematurely ended his 2024 season. He played in 12 games with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before that crash last fall and has since recovered. Whitehead worked out for the Atlanta Falcons earlier this year.

2. John Johnson (29): The NFL suspended Johnson for the first three games of the 2025 season for an undisclosed reason. The suspension has long since ended, but he remains a free agent with 15 interceptions on his resume.

3. Vonn Bell (31): A former New Orleans Saints second-round draft pick under Sean Payton, Bell played in all 17 games with the Cincinnati Bengals last season but has remained unsigned in 2025. He has eight career interceptions.

4. Adrian Amos (32): He had a stint on the San Francisco 49ers' practice squad last season but hasn't appeared in a regular-season game since 2023. He was a 17-game starter with the Green Bay Packers in 2022, but only has three starts on his resume since then.

5. Justin Simmons (32): The four-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro needs no introduction to Broncos fans, but it's unclear if he would be willing to return to Denver after being cut by Sean Payton in 2024.

The Broncos have three games remaining on their regular season schedule, and they've already clinched a spot in the NFL playoffs. Up next, Denver will attempt to clinch the AFC West and the No. 1 seed in the conference.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/17/SBRC/87801338007-nfl-free-agent-safeties-vonn-bell.jpg?crop=3297,1855,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-18 00:01:02.274667

And so you just have to go through it.” Burkholder confirmed Wednesday that Mahomes suffered a “significant left knee injury” that was non-contact and also caused by a hyperextension.
The early goal with Mahomes in rehab, Burkholder said, will be to get his muscles firing to help reduce the swelling in his knee.

You wouldn’t expect anything less.” Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew said Mahomes has been active in the Chiefs’ quarterbacks’ group text this week.","KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Kansas City Chiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder set out the next steps for quarterback Patrick Mahomes following his season-ending knee injury while saying a return for the start of next season remains a definite possibility.

Burkholder spoke to reporters Wednesday, two days after Mahomes had surgery in Dallas to repair a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee. Burkholder said the operation by Dr. Dan Cooper — the Dallas Cowboys’ head physician — was successful.

“Ballpark on this thing (for recovery) is nine months. Could be a month or two less, a month or two more,” Burkholder said. “You never know what goes on, and everybody’s designed differently biomechanically. And so you just have to go through it.”

Burkholder confirmed Wednesday that Mahomes suffered a “significant left knee injury” that was non-contact and also caused by a hyperextension. Mahomes underwent an MRI after the game in K.C., then consulted with his agent and family before getting a second opinion from Cooper in Dallas.

Mahomes met with Cooper on Monday morning, then had surgery that night. Burkholder said the reason for the quick movement was Mahomes’ LCL injury. Cooper wanted to repair that ligament, which had detached.

“They said everything he had in this injury was fixable, correctable,” Burkholder said, “and it was fixed on Monday night by Dr. Cooper.”

Mahomes began rehab in Dallas on Tuesday morning, Burkholder said. The Chiefs QB was set to remain there through Thursday before returning to Kansas City on Friday.

Burkholder said Mahomes would do the majority of his rehab with Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who also helped him through previous knee, toe and ankle injuries.

The early goal with Mahomes in rehab, Burkholder said, will be to get his muscles firing to help reduce the swelling in his knee. Mahomes, who was placed on injured reserve Wednesday, will wear a protective brace as his knee heals.

Though Burkholder cautioned that each injury is different, he was optimistic about a quick recovery given Mahomes’ track record.

“As a player, his mindset is a little different than most. He’s so regimented at what he does,” Burkholder said. “He’s in here at 6 a.m.; he’s the last guy out at night. He’ll take the rehab like that.”

Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he’d been impressed by Mahomes’ mindset.

“He’s so positive right now,” Reid said. “Like Rick said, he attacked this thing the day of. You wouldn’t expect anything less.”

Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew said Mahomes has been active in the Chiefs’ quarterbacks’ group text this week.

The biggest reason? To get his guys fired up for Sunday’s road game against the Tennessee Titans.

“That dude still wants us to win. That’s what he cares about,” Minshew said. “It’s awesome to have a leader like that.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/17141600/GettyImages-2249657600-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-18 00:01:11.071493

Chiefs coach Andy Reid announced at a Dec. 17 media availability that Rice had entered the NFL's concussion protocol on Monday.

Reid did not provide any clarity about when Rice – who played 85.2% of the Chiefs' offensive snaps against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 15 – may have suffered the injury.

""Those things happen,"" Reid said of Rice's injury. ""We'll just see where it ends up going.""

Rice logged a team-high 11 targets and recorded seven catches for 51 yards in Kansas City's 16-13 loss on Sunday. The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention by virtue of the defeat.

Here's what to know about Rice's status moving forward.

Will Rashee Rice play Week 16?

The Chiefs did not provide clarity about whether Rice will be able to play in the team's Week 16 game against the Tennessee Titans. Reid simply announced the third-year receiver had been placed into the NFL's concussion protocol.

The Chiefs did not clarify whether they would shut Rice down for the remainder of the season as he deals with a head injury and with the team having already been eliminated from playoff contention.

But if Rice does return to action, he will have to first clear the NFL's concussion protocol – which is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury – before he can return to practice.

The five-step process to be cleared is as follows, as outlined by the NFL:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

The NFL also notes ""there is no set time-frame"" for a player to return to participation following a concussion. Team medical staff consider a variety of factors in determining when a player can return, including their current concussive injury, past exposures, medical and family history and future risk in managing a player's care.

Chiefs WR depth chart

The Chiefs have seven receivers on their 53-man roster, giving them plenty of depth to trust if Rice is forced to miss time. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Rashee Rice

Xavier Worthy

Hollywood Brown

JuJu Smith-Schuster

Tyquan Thornton

Jalen Royals

Nikko Remigio

In addition to Rice's injury, Thornton is in the NFL's concussion protocol while Brown missed Week 15 with a personal issue. If all three can't play, Worthy would operate as the team's No. 1 receiver while Smith-Schuster and fourth-round rookie Royals would have a shot to earn increased roles in Kansas City's receiver rotation.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/17/USAT/87814401007-rashee-rice-chiefs-121725.jpg?crop=2851,1603,x1173,y367&width=2851&height=1603&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-18 01:09:07.588110

As many as nine teams can clinch playoff spots in Week 16. The Denver Broncos can actually clinch the AFC's No. 1 overall seed this week with a victory, a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie, a New England Patriots loss and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie. It's been 21 years since a team won the NFC East in consecutive seasons, but the Philadelphia Eagles can end that streak with a victory over the Washington Commanders on Saturday or a Dallas Cowboys loss against the Chargers on Sunday.

The focus is certainly football, but it's impossible to fully analyze how teams are playing at this point in the year without factoring in injuries. Every team is banged up to a certain degree, which could play a not insignificant role in how the rest of the season unfolds.

With most teams returning to the practice field for the first time this week on Wednesday, we'll take a survey around the league as teams publish their initial injury reports. We'll also analyze the final injury report for Thursday night's critical NFC West showdown between the 11-3 Los Angeles Rams and the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks.

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-1.5)

Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime Video

Los Angeles Rams: WR Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) DOUBTFUL, DE Braden Fiske (ankle) QUESTIONABLE

Seattle Seahawks: LT Charles Cross (hamstring) OUT

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams departed the team's 41-34 Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions with a non-contact hamstring injury, and that injury has him listed as doubtful to suit up in what's seemingly an NFC West division title championship game of sorts. Adams leads the league with 14 receiving touchdowns this season, and if he doesn't play, that will be a tremendous loss for quarterback Matthew Stafford and head coach Sean McVay. Edge rusher Braden Fiske (ankle) is questionable after also not practicing all week like Adams.

The Seattle Seahawks will be without starting left tackles Charles Cross (hamstring) on Thursday night, a huge blow for quarterback Sam Darnold, who threw four interceptions in a 21-19 Week 11 road loss at the Rams. Josh Jones, a 2020 third-round pick by the Seahawks, will be making his first start since Week 3 of the 2023 season, a 37-17 road win at the Jacksonville Jaguars, in place of Cross.

Philadelphia Eagles at Washington Commanders (+6.5) (Saturday)

-- Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has begun rehab following surgery to repair two torn ligaments in his left knee, and the team is optimistic the two-time MVP could be back early next season -- perhaps even by the time Kansas City plays Week 1.
On defense, cornerback Trent McDuffie is still dealing with a knee injury and linebacker Leo Chenal with a shoulder problem.
""We'll see how they roll timewise for the game,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.
As for Mahomes, he plans to return to Kansas City by Friday, where he will continue rehabbing with Burkholder's staff.","KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has begun rehab following surgery to repair two torn ligaments in his left knee, and the team is optimistic the two-time MVP could be back early next season -- perhaps even by the time Kansas City plays Week 1.

Rick Burkholder, the Chiefs' vice president of sports medicine and performance, said Wednesday the procedure performed in Dallas by Dr. Dan Cooper on Monday night went well. The operation happened about 24 hours after Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL in a loss to the Chargers.

The recovery time for such an injury is about ninth months, though it could vary by several months depending on various factors. Next season is expected to kick off on Sept. 10, 2026, and the Chiefs could play their first game a few days later.

""Every player is different. Every sport is different. Every position is different,"" Burkholder said. ""[Mahomes] is so in tune to what he does, he does it a little quicker. Ballpark on this is nine months, but it could be a month or two more, a month or two less.""

The loss to the Chargers eliminated the Chiefs from the postseason, ending that streak at a decade. They had also won the past nine AFC West titles, reached the previous seven conference championship games and played in the past three Super Bowls.

Now, backup Gardner Minshew will quarterback them through the final three games beginning Sunday at Tennessee.

""Quick turnaround from a very emotional game, and obviously the situation with Pat, the situation with our team's playoff picture,"" he said. ""But you know what? You are where you're at. We have to turn this around and get a win this weekend.""

The Chiefs could be missing several big names beyond their star quarterback.

Rashee Rice and fellow wide receiver Tyquan Thornton are in the concussion protocol after taking vicious hits in the game against Los Angeles, while left tackle Jaylon Moore remains out with a knee injury and right tackle Jawaan Taylor is out with an elbow issue.

On defense, cornerback Trent McDuffie is still dealing with a knee injury and linebacker Leo Chenal with a shoulder problem.

None of those players practiced Wednesday.

""We'll see how they roll timewise for the game,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.

As for Mahomes, he plans to return to Kansas City by Friday, where he will continue rehabbing with Burkholder's staff. Leading the effort will be Julie Frymyer, his assistant trainer and top physical therapist, whose name made headlines during the 2022-23 playoffs for her role in helping Mahomes overcome a severe high ankle sprain without having to miss a game.

Frymyer was even featured alongside Mahomes recently in a State Farm insurance commercial.

""I think you guys know, as a player, his mindset is a little different than most,"" Burkholder said. ""He's so regimented in what he does. He's in here at 6 a.m. He's the last guy out at night. He'll take the rehab like that. When you add up all the little things, that allows the player to get back faster. They don't heal up faster, they just get back to performance faster.""

Reid said he's spoken daily with Mahomes since the injury in the closing minutes of Sunday's game.

""He's so positive right now,"" Reid said. ""Like Rick said, he attacked this thing the day of. You wouldn't expect anything less. 'Get me up, get me going,' he's basically saying, an hour after the game. 'Brace me up and let me go.' It's not one of those injuries, obviously, but that's his mindset. I think he'll do great with the rehab. He's a pretty fast healer that way. And his attitude is 90% of things, how you go about it. How you're willing to push through the pain to get right.""

Minshew acknowledged a strange feeling walking through the team facility without Mahomes this week. But the two QBs have been in touch, and the veteran of 46 starts across seven NFL seasons is looking forward to Mahomes' input the rest of the way.

""He's been great, man. Soon as he's been figuring things out, he's been texting the QB room,"" Minshew said. ""Very positive. Trying to get us fired up. That dude still wants us to win. That's what he cares about.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1028%2Fr1567222_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 23:02:10.115405

Giants fans who are angry that Dart was removed from Sunday’s fourth quarter on the goal line feel that Dart had not taken a severe enough hit to warrant an evaluation.

They are both wrong.

The NFL’s arbitrary enforcement and lack of consistent accountability with their concussion policies warrants scrutiny.

But it’s important not to let the public discourse about concussions descend into the unhelpful gray area, where people like Giants offensive coordinator Tim Kelly can say that Dart returning from a concussion in November was “no different than if someone was coming off a sprained ankle.”

Big hits absolutely can cause concussions, like when Dart slammed his head on the grass in Chicago and was diagnosed with a confirmed concussion — or like when Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss flipped Dart like an Olympic gymnast in New England in his first game back.

The science shows, however, that less severe, sub-concussive or non-concussive blows to the head can cause significant long-term damage, too.

In other words, a person could go their whole lives never being officially diagnosed with a concussion, but if they endure hundreds or thousands of repeated bumps, blows or collisions to the head, the best science has linked that to potential changes in brain function and to cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

CTE is caused in part by repeated traumatic brain injuries, which include concussions and non-concussive impacts.

The NFL settled a $1 billion dollar lawsuit with former players in 2016 over the lack of education and mismanagement of concussions that is now connected to some of those retired players’ health ailments.

This is a hot button issue and an important one, not something to be dismissed or snickered at — especially, for Dart, considering how the Giants’ opponents are now zeroing in on attacking the mobile rookie QB.

On Tuesday night’s episode of HBO’s ‘Hard Knocks,’ Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn and defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. were shown in the meeting room telling their players to be ready to hit the vulnerable Dart in the open field at MetLife Stadium.

“The last piece: the QB, alright,” Quinn said, showing film from the Patriots game. “When he’s out here [out of the pocket], he is a running back first. This is a good hit by Ellis on the sideline. [Dart] is not looking to go down and get into the slide. So we’ve got to go out and hit him, fellas.”

Whitt reiterated that Dart’s style of running would give the defense opportunities to be physical and to get the ball.

“The quarterback is a very competitive dual-threat guy,” Whitt said. “He will try to run the ball like a running back. He will try to run you over. He will try to stiff-arm. He doesn’t really run out of bounds. He doesn’t slide a whole bunch, OK? We can get the ball off of him. The ball is life, the ball is air and we need it.”

Fast forward to Sunday’s Giants loss, and interim head coach Mike Kafka called two designed runs for Dart, plus a third play that had a QB run as an option, in which Dart ultimately got hurt.

Dart took significant hits on all three plays, fumbled once and was injured on the third.

Even though Dart’s run wasn’t obviously a huge hit to the head in the moment, he did have his head and neck hit and twisted back when he lowered his body into defensive tackles Eddie Goldman and Javon Kinlaw.

Dart, on replay, appeared to have some sort of reaction to the hit while staying briefly on the turf, too. He said Wednesday that the Washington coaches’ comments about him don’t phase him.

“[Georgia coach] Kirby Smart said the exact same thing every time that he played against me, so did [former Alabama coach] Nick Saban and every coach I played in college,” Dart said. “This is nothing new. I just got to go out there, try to play smart and be available for my team.”

There is a major and understandable problem, of course, with the NFL and Giants not removing Dart from that November game in Chicago — after he was motionless on the field — and then taking him out for something as comparatively harmless as Sunday’s sequence.

So Dart can be forgiven for getting frustrated by the inconsistency and even by the possibility that he is receiving closer scrutiny only because the NFL and NFL players’ association are overcorrecting.

The very public optics of former head coach Brian Daboll charging into the blue medical tent and getting fined earlier in the season, followed by the mishandling of Dart’s concussion in Chicago, has made for bad optics broadcasted to the entire country.

And leaks from inside the Giants’ building simultaneously encouraged this as a discussion point and turned it into a five-alarm fire.

But amid all of the hypocrisy and inconsistency, Dart and Giants fans and everyone else must remember that it’s a good thing when player safety is prioritized, not a bad thing.

Five concussion evaluations for Dart since the start of the preseason is an alarming number, even with only one diagnosed concussion since he entered the pros.

Every hit to the head matters. And Dart’s long-term health as a human — not his availability as a football player — is what everyone should care about most.

LAWRENCE RESTS, THIBODEAUX REMAINS OUT

Defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence was limited during Wednesday’s practice as part of a non-injury related rest day. And edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder sprain) continued to sit out practice, meaning he might miss a fifth straight game.

Wide receiver Beaux Collins (concussion/neck), linebacker Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles (illness) and defensive lineman Rakeem Nuñez-Roches Sr. (ankle) also sat out.

Collins’ injury when he returned to practice last week from injured reserve was called a “neck” injury. Now the Giants have added “concussion/neck” to his status.

Punter Jamie Gillan (left knee), corner Art Green (illness/ hamstring) and corners Dru Phillips (heel) and Rico Payton (back) also were limited.

It has been a tough year for everyone involved in the Chiefs' operation, but Travis Kelce can be seen as a headliner.

The integrity of who you are as a professional, as a player, you gotta love this (expletive). Chiefs Kingdom, we're gonna give you everything we've got. There's no question about that.""

The tight end's 13th season has been far from lucky. He will now miss the playoffs for just the second time in his career.

Travis Kelce discusses Patrick Mahomes injury on 'New Heights'

Kelce noted that plenty of players on the Chiefs were dealing with injuries heading into the game and throughout the contest. He acknowledged that they fought to the end, but seeing Mahomes go down didn't feel real.

""On a freakish play to see one-five go down like that man, it (expletive), it was almost like it wasn't real,"" Kelce added. (Expletive) just sucks man.""

He said there was a belief that they would find a way to win like they always do, but that wasn't in the cards for Kansas City in Week 15. The Chiefs had been dominant in one-score games a year ago. That script has been flipped in 2025, posting a 1-7 record in those situations.

Regardless, they still had the ball, down 16-13, with the chance to tie or take the lead before Mahomes suffered his injury with less than a minute to go.

""Sure felt like that,"" Kelce said, thinking they would find a way to win. ""That's why when one-five went down, I was like, 'No way this is what happens, right?""

Travis Kelce addresses Mahomes' return, Chiefs' 2026 prospects

Whether Mahomes returns in time for the 2026 season remains to be seen, but the tight end isn't counting him out.

""He's a warrior,"" Kelce said. ""I'm telling you. This guy played through everything, battled through everything, crowned champion because he's battled through everything. He's gonna battle through this. It's the only way this guy is wired. He's gonna make sure he's gonna come back stronger than ever.""

""Hopefully the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible,"" Kelce added. ""I know he's gonna be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs.""

For now, Kansas City will turn to Gardner Minshew for the remainder of the season.

Travis Kelce on his future with Chiefs

There are just three games left for the 2025 Chiefs. None of them will have playoff implications, but that won't stop Kelce from putting his best foot forward in what became a slightly emotional rant.

""There's an integrity thing here that when you sign up for the gig,"" Kelce said. ""You're living out a kid's dream that never got a chance to do this. You're playing this game obviously to win Super Bowls, you're playing this game to be in those playoff scenarios, but at the end of the day, you're playing in the NFL. And that's a (expletive) blessing.

""That's an honor. It's an honor to be out there. It's an honor to feel the soreness because you're actually out there, (expletive) doing it. No matter if you're getting the (expletive) ball thrown to you, no matter if you're blocking your tail off. It's an honor to be out there in a uniform, playing for the guys around you, playing for your family, playing for the people back home that are watching you.""

With just three games to go, it remains a mystery if there will be more than that for the star tight end, who didn't discuss his future in the wake of the Chiefs' elimination and Mahomes' injury.

It feels like the end of an era. It remains to be seen if it truly is.

He and guard Isaac Seumalo, who left the Dolphins game with what was announced as a tricep injury, are expected to be limited some this week and Seumalo also didn't practice on Wednesday.
I would imagine he certainly is going to be limited at the early portions of week and see where it leads us.
Harmon missed the last three games with a knee injury, but he is on the mend.
""We had some guys that missed the previous game or games and are angling toward getting back,"" said Tomlin.","The Steelers began their preparation for Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions at Ford Field, a game that is key for both teams with the playoff races heating up.

Per Coach Mike Tomlin, the team didn't have their normal practice, but instead opted for a 'high intensity walk-through' coming off a Monday night game.

""We will work hard and smart, and sometimes that means being inclusive,"" said Tomlin. ""So, we've probably got a high intensity walk-through on the menu (Wednesday) in an effort to have as many people participate as we can as opposed to running and practicing.

""Again, that's not outside of the ordinary this time of year. You do what you need to do in an effort to get the collective ready, and also get them to the stadium in as good of physical condition as you can get them as well.

""You certainly hope that there is a cumulative effect of the daily work we've had over the course of this journey that can be an asset that we can summon up when we get pressed on a short week like this week.""

As of his weekly Tuesday press conference, Tomlin didn't have any updates on the health and status of linebacker T.J. Watt, who missed Monday night's game against the Dolphins with a lung issue. Watt did not practice on Wednesday.

""No new news on T.J.,"" said Tomlin. ""I'm sure I will a little later in the week, but I hadn't heard any new updates regarding his availability or what that looks like as he starts to work his way back to us this week, and so no real news there.""

One of the players who stepped in to replace him on Monday night, linebacker Nick Herbig, is dealing with a hamstring injury and didn't practice on Wednesday. He and guard Isaac Seumalo, who left the Dolphins game with what was announced as a tricep injury, are expected to be limited some this week and Seumalo also didn't practice on Wednesday.

""Issac Seumalo got hurt (Monday) night,"" said Tomlin. ""I don't know what his status is as I stand here today. I would imagine he certainly is going to be limited at the early portions of week and see where it leads us.

""Same thing could be said for Herbig with his hamstring. See where it leads us.""

The arrow seems to be pointing up for rookie defensive lineman Derrick Harmon. Harmon missed the last three games with a knee injury, but he is on the mend. He was a full participant on Wednesday.

""We had some guys that missed the previous game or games and are angling toward getting back,"" said Tomlin. ""Probably the most favorable of those is Derrick Harmon.

""He was probably healthy enough to play at the very end of last week, but as a young guy with limited rep opportunities, I didn't think it would be fair to him or for us to put him in uniform.

""So he'll have an opportunity to get a complete week's work, go back to his hometown, and play some football. Excited about getting him back. He certainly has been an asset to us particularly in terms of defending and stopping the run, and anticipating what we're going to face this week, man, that will be big.

""Some other guys working their way back, (Andrus) Peat is still in the (concussion) protocol, so we'll let the protocol be our guide in terms of his availability. James Pierre was limited with a calf last week. See where that leads us.""

The Steelers have relied on their depth as injuries mounted this year, including players quarterback Aaron Rodgers called 'castoffs' from other teams who have been big contributors for the Steelers, especially when injuries have occurred.

""I'm never surprised by that to be honest with you,"" said Tomlin. ""That's why we have cliches like the standard is the standard, one man's misfortune is another man's opportunity.

""It's not if, it's when as it pertains to injury in our business. So, if you're in a position like mine, you better work your tail off to ready each and every man that's a part of the program and have that urgency daily. I certainly do, and we do as a staff.

""But those are the guys that are deserving of the credit. I'll never ask guys to be patient. I'll ask them to work while they wait, and a lot of guys have done that. We get performances like many of them just displayed. It's just evidence that they have, and certainly some of them are going to get additional opportunities to do so, and maybe some new guys will get opportunities to do so as we move forward. That's just the nature of this thing.

""I think your ability to adapt and adjust and pivot often defines a collective, and certainly we've had some opportunities to do so. We have had success at times and we better keep digging, because I've just been on enough of these journeys. I know it's a component of it.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/hussyskzp0kx4f7erlxb,N,,2025-12-17 18:02:24.031321

Written By Blaise Bourgeois | Published at December 17, 2025

With playoff implications abound, we're heading to NFL Week 16, where several high-profile matchups dominate the landscape.

Thursday Night Football gets us started with a potential NFC Championship preview as the Seattle Seahawks host NFC West rivals Los Angeles Rams in one of the most anticipated contests of the season.

Of course, the NFC North could be decided on Sunday as the 10-4 Chicago Bears host bitter rivals Green Bay, who sit at 9-4-1. With the Bears leading the Packers by a half-game with three games left in the regular season and both teams on the fence, this game could decide who gets to play in January and who heads to Cancun.

We also have an NFC South battle between co-leaders Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Carolina Panthers, who both sit at 7-7. They face off twice in the final three games of the season, and whoever fares best will move on to January.

There are a few other marquee matchups to look forward to this weekend, specifically the Steelers-Lions, Jaguars-Broncos, Ravens-Patriots, and Colts-49ers.

Here’s your full NFL Week 16 betting guide, including brief previews and predictions for each game. We'll also take a look at where injuries could make the biggest impacts. Be up to date on all of the latest NFL odds on all of our favorite betting sites.

Los Angeles Rams @ Seattle Seahawks

Odds: Rams -1.5 (ML: Rams -108, Seahawks -108 | Over/Under: 44.5 (via FanDuel)

The best game of the weekend happens to be on Thursday Night Football. Two division rivals who sit at 11-3 that could and should contend for the Super Bowl title square off for this epic thriller.

In their first meeting, in Los Angeles, the Rams squeaked past the Seahawks 21-19, with Sam Darnold throwing for four interceptions.

Darnold has only two games with 2+ interceptions this season and shouldn't revert to that kind of form again.

The matchup of the day should be Devon Witherspoon against Puka Nacua, especially if Davante Adams can't suit up. Adams has been battling both knee and hamstring injuries and has been less than 100% for several weeks now.

Ian Rapaport claims that Adams is unlikely to play, which should see this game lean towards the under. Playing in Seattle could push this even more towards Seattle.

📊 Prediction: Seahawks 21 Rams 20

Philadelphia Eagles @ Washington Commanders

Odds: Eagles -6.5 (ML: Eagles -285, Commanders +230 | Over/Under: 44.5 (via BetMGM)

No playoffs, and no more Jayden Daniels for the rest of the year as the Commanders begin to close the door on an unbelievably disappointing 2025 NFL season, one year removed from the NFC Championship game.

Washington has been absolutely crushed by injuries all season, with nine of their 22 starters missing at least seven games.

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn has shut down all players currently on injured reserve, including Daniels, Zach Ertz, and many more.

While Washington put on an impressive performance against the Giants last week, they did so by completing just 10 passes. They'd have to do a whole lot more to knock off Philadelphia. I don't see that happening.

📊 Prediction: Eagles 30 Commanders 10

Green Bay Packers @ Chicago Bears

Odds: Packers -1.5 (ML: Packers -115, Bears -105 | Over/Under: 46.5 (via DraftKings)

Talk about high stakes! One of the NFL's oldest and most storied rivalries unveils a new chapter in their biggest regular-season meeting in a crazy long time.

In fact, both teams haven't faced one another with both teams at least five games over .500 since December 2001.

Of course, to Chicago's luck, the entire NFC is extremely good, the NFC North race is still an extremely close three-team one, and they're nowhere near safe despite having 10 wins heading into Week 16.

However, Green Bay got absolutely obliterated in their loss to Denver last week. Micah Parsons is done for the year with a torn ACL, Christian Watson suffered a rib injury and is questionable, while a handful of others exited the game and didn't return.

There has never been a bigger chance for the Bears to claim themselves as the winners of this rivalry in a very long time. The door is wide open; they just have to get the job done. We think it's time.

📊 Prediction: Bears 31 Packers 27

NFL Sunday Early Afternoon

Buffalo Bills @ Cleveland Browns

Odds: Bills -10 (ML: Bills -600, Browns +425 | Over/Under: 42 (via BetMGM)

Talk about an ugly matchup. Even though the Bills are 10-point favorites, we don't see this being anywhere close to that number. They've struggled all year against great defenses, and this game should smash the under.

We also look forward to Myles Garrett breaking the NFL record for most sacks in a single season. He's at 21.5, only one short of the mark. We think he gets it done on Sunday.

📊 Prediction: Bills 16 Browns 9

Los Angeles Chargers @ Dallas Cowboys

Odds: Cowboys -2.5 (ML: Chargers +108, Cowboys -126 | Over/Under: 49.5 (via FanDuel)

These two teams can enjoy a shootout as much as any two teams in the league.

The 10-4 Chargers are rolling on with their season and are virtually assured of a playoff berth. The Cowboys needed to win last week to keep their realistic hopes alive. Unfortunately, now they're only in the race based on mathematics and not in reality.

Somehow, the Cowboys are favored in this one, which we don't quite understand at all. In fact, nobody actually does, which leads us to believe Vegas knows something we don't.

However, based on pure stats, the Chargers should be able to outduel Dallas in a lovely offensive battle. Plus, how much fight will a Cowboys team have now that they're essentially out of the playoffs?

📊 Prediction: Chargers 44 Cowboys 38

Kansas City Chiefs @ Tennessee Titans

Odds: Chiefs -3.5 (ML: Chiefs -190, Titans +156 | Over/Under: 37.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook)

Oof. We're into the really ugly part of the season. Not only are the Chiefs done for the year, but Patrick Mahomes has also torn his ACL, which casts a huge doubt on the future of the Chiefs' dynasty.

Surely, had the Chiefs stayed alive in the playoffs and Mahomes was healthy, the line would be set at -14.5 or higher. Instead, the Chiefs are only three-point favorites with Gardner Minshew under center.

We don't know who the Chiefs will trot out there, but we believe that head coach Andy Reid will be using the next three games to evaluate their bench talent. I would be smashing overs on backups and third-stringers.

📊 Prediction: Titans 16 Chiefs 13

Cincinnati Bengals @ Miami Dolphins

Odds: Bengals -2.5 (ML: Bengals -135, Dolphins +114 | Over/Under: 50.5 (via DraftKings)

Ah yes, another game where both teams are out of the playoffs, and the result means absolutely nothing except for NFL Draft order. Maybe a few players and coaches get some bonus money too.

The actual performances out on the field could mean a lot on both sides. Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow is very disgruntled and isn't having much fun in Cincinnati, which has led to massive trade rumors, specifically to Pittsburgh and Las Vegas.

Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel, meanwhile, is very much on the hot seat. If the Dolphins don't finish strong, his job could be on the line.

📊 Prediction: Bengals 31 Dolphins 29

New York Jets @ New Orleans Saints

Odds: Saints -4.5 (ML: Jets +185, Saints -225 | Over/Under: 40.5 (via BetMGM)

Talk about a game that absolutely nobody should want to watch, unless you have an active interest in where these teams finish in the NFL Draft standings. Maybe if you're a friend or family member of one of the players.

Tyler Shough has proven that he's a halfway decent NFL quarterback! The Saints have won back-to-back games against the two best teams in the NFC South, and have won their last three in the conference.

Shough is also starting to use his legs much more often, rushing for 87 yards and two touchdowns over the last two games.

The Jets don't look good whatsoever. Honestly, we don't know how this team won three games this year. Saints in a minor blowout.

📊 Prediction: Saints 30 Jets 17

Minnesota Vikings @ New York Giants

Odds: Vikings -3 (ML: Vikings -152, Giants +128 | Over/Under: 43.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook)

Seriously, how many games do we have this weekend with two teams that are out of the playoffs with three games left to play? This is actually absurd.

I'm looking forward to this one, with J.J. McCarthy and Jaxson Dart given free passes to ball out with little-to-no risk.

One storyline to follow is the continued misuse of Justin Jefferson, who has been held to a combined six catches for 37 yards over the last three games. That's just over 12 yards per game for a player drafted high in the first round in every fantasy football draft this season.

📊 Prediction: Vikings 24 Giants 20

Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Carolina Panthers

Odds: Buccaneers -3 (ML: Buccaneers -155, Panthers +130 | Over/Under: 47.5 (via DraftKings)

It's all on the line in Carolina as these two NFC South rivals play for the division in the first of two meetings to conclude the regular season.

While it feels that this is just going to be a typical Panthers loss, the Buccaneers have lost five of their last six games.

This is as unpredictable a game as there has been in the NFL this season. Chuba Hubbard and Rico Dowdle will have to have big games against the 10th-ranked run defense for the Panthers to pull this off.

📊 Prediction: Buccaneers 24 Panthers 21

NFL Sunday Late Afternoon

Jacksonville Jaguars @ Denver Broncos

Odds: Broncos -3 (ML: Jaguars +144, Broncos -172 | Over/Under: 45.5 (via FanDuel)

In a potential AFC playoff preview, the top-ranked Broncos host the third-ranked Jaguars in the second battle of two 10-win teams this season.

Both of these teams scored over 40 points last week, which pushed the over/under table up nearly three points.

The Broncos are one of the best defensive teams of all time, especially in the sacks department. Meanwhile, the Jaguars have the best run defense in all of football and will force Bo Nix to air the ball out.

The two Broncos losses this season have been against top-10 run defenses. We expect loss number three.

📊 Prediction: Jaguars 20 Broncos 16

Atlanta Falcons @ Arizona Cardinals

Odds: Falcons -2.5 (ML: Falcons -140, Cardinals +118 | Over/Under: 47.5 (via BetMGM)

We're back to the games pitting two teams out of playoff contention. We've got a great matchup between Bijan Robinson and Jacoby Brissett, who are both having phenomenal seasons despite team performances.

Drake London is still questionable after missing last week, though Kyle Pitts had a monster three-touchdown performance in his absence, undoubtedly the best game of his career.

We love the Falcons in a big way in this one.

📊 Prediction: Falcons 33 Cardinals 15

Pittsburgh Steelers @ Detroit Lions

Odds: Steelers -7 (ML: Steelers +260, Lions -325 | Over/Under: 51.5 (via DraftKings)

We cannot wait for this matchup, as it pits two playoff contenders who will be fighting for their lives in Detroit.

The Lions are the far more explosive team, while Aaron Rodgers has proven to be an impressive game manager for a well-balanced Steelers team this season.

The biggest mismatch should be Jahmyr Gibbs against one of the worst run defenses in football. He could easily go for over 200 yards, while Rodgers will continue to dink and dunk. That shouldn't be enough.

📊 Prediction: Lions 41 Steelers 20

Las Vegas Raiders @ Houston Texans

Odds: Texans -14.5 (ML: Raiders +750, Texans -1200 | Over/Under: 37.5 (via FanDuel)

The Houston Texans need this win as much as the Raiders need the number one pick next year.

We don't know how the Raiders are going to score against the number one defense in all of football, who are also the number one run defense in football.

The Raiders have scored 10 or fewer points six times this season and were shutout against the Eagles last week. They're horrible and the Texans shouldn't need to do much to come out as clear winners.

📊 Prediction: Texans 17 Raiders 3

New England Patriots @ Baltimore Ravens

Odds: Ravens -2.5 (ML: Patriots +130, Ravens -154 | Over/Under: 47.5 (via FanDuel)

This Tom Brady-era rivalry starts a new chapter with Drake Maye in MVP form against Lamar Jackson's Ravens, who have struggled to find their footing.

The Ravens will be far more desperate in this one, and they should find a way to get it done in what should be a thriller.

📊 Prediction: Ravens 30 Patriots 27

San Francisco 49ers @ Indianapolis Colts

Odds: 49ers -6.5 (ML: 49ers -300, Colts +245 | Over/Under: 46.5 (via FanDuel)

We loved seeing Philip Rivers out there balling out against the Seahawks, keeping the Colts in the game despite being two-touchdown underdogs.

Against the 49ers in his second game out there, we don't believe the same magic is going to come out. Expect Christian McCaffrey to have a fantastic game in Indianapolis.

📊 Prediction: 49ers 27 Colts 10

Both teams are dealing with a few key injuries, especially on the defensive side of the ball.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

The Lions have used six of their eight return-from-injured-reserve spots—that includes Mahogany, who is currently in the injury evaluation window—leaving them two available for the remainder of the regular season. With Manu returning to practice, that makes seven. Wright have been seen at practice working with trainers, so he appears to have a better chance of returning than Cunningham, but it’s worth pointing out that Wright is not eligible to begin practicing until Week 18. However, if the Lions make the Ppayoffs, they are given an additional two return-from-IR spots, which they could use as needed.

Decker has routinely taken practices off throughout the season, even missing all three practices in Week 15, but the extra time off has worked, and he’s been available to play on game day. Expect him to continue to get time off as the season progresses.

Joseph suffered a setback last week, according to Campbell, and at this stage of the season, it’s fair to wonder if he will be able to recover from this latest obstacle in time to play this season.

Vaki has been able to practice and play through his thumb injury for a few weeks now, and he looks to be on that same track to start this week of practices.

Trystan Colon is a new addition to the injury report, but given some improved health at the guard position—more on that in a minute—he may be moved to a reserve role this week anyways.

Robertson injured his hand in Week 15 and needed to exit the game, but on Monday, coach Dan Campbell gave an optimistic update on his potential availability.

“Hand injury, so it’s something that could affect him a little bit. But I think we’d like to believe he’s going to have a chance to play here. But until we get through practice, we won’t entirely know,” Campbell said.

Mahogany continued to work through the injury evaluation window and could possibly return to game action this week. Last week, he was initially given a questionable designation on Friday before being ruled out on Saturday, suggesting he is making progress toward returning. A full practice could mean he returns to play on Sunday.

Awosika got in three limited practices last week, was given a questionable designation, but was ruled inactive just ahead of game time. It’s unclear if something happened in warmups or if his foot didn’t improve as expected, but a return to full practice this week suggests he’ll have a chance to help reinforce the Lions’ interior offensive line.

Harper participated in all three practices last week, but was not able clear the NFL’s concussion protocols on time to play in the game. A full practice suggests he’s near the end of concussion protocol, which is good timing since Erick Hallett was poached from the Lions practice squad this week.

The New England Patriots announced they signed linebacker Amari Gainer to the practice squad on Wednesday, following up their active roster addition of linebacker Chad Muma on Tuesday.

Gainer, 25, originally entered the league as an undrafted free agent with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2024, spending the entire season on their active roster before being released prior to the start of 2025.

Despite fans expressing plenty of frustration in Week 13, the Steelers have won their last two games, and now sit at 8-6 with three weeks to play. That's quite the turnaround, considering fans wanted to fire long-time head coach Mike Tomlin in early December.

As for the Miami Dolphins, they may be done with the Tua Tagovailoa experiment. After head coach Mike McDaniel hinted that they may be ready to make a change on Tuesday, it was reported that Tagovailoa was benched and rookie Quinn Ewers would get the start in Week 16.

With Pittsburgh closing out Week 15 in command of the AFC North, here are some of the biggest storylines coming out of the week.

Unfortunately for fans, Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career. Mahomes already underwent surgery to repair the issue.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.
