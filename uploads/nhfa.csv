Check out this week’s picks below.             Explore        See latest videos, charts and news        See latest videos, charts and news   Eladio Carrión, DON KBRN (Rimas Entertainment)     Eladio Carrión’s DON KBRN lands with razor-sharp intent, cementing his role as a dominant figure in Latin trap. With an ambitious 22-track lineup inspired by Yakuza mystique and Samurai discipline, according to the press release, the LP packs raw lyricism, relentless ambition, and next-level collaborations. The star-studded release includes Myke Towers (“Vetements,” a braggadocious anthem of success), Peso Pluma (“Tiffany,” a flashy ode to street hustle), Jessie Reyez (“Call My Line,” a bilingual R&B lament), and Big Sean (“Branzino,” an old-school hip-hop gem). Contributions from Young Miko, Cris Mj, Quevedo, and others also make for a riveting listen.      Solo tracks like “Ohtani” and “Harmonía” further highlight the artist’s range, where he embraces trap, melodic rap, and introspective cuts. Lebron James is even seen bumping “H.I.M.” on his IG Story. The production — by Hide Miyabi, Finesse, Deadts, OZ, G.O.K.B., and more — marked by bold experimentation, also brings DON KBRN to life as a daring statement of intent, showcasing Eladio Carrión’s linguistic mastery while setting a new standard for Latin trap. — ISABELA RAYGOZA      Trending on Billboard        Pipe Bueno, Majo Aguilar & Mariachi Sol de Mexico, “Bailar Contigo” (PB Entertainment/Warner Music Latina)     Pipe Bueno, a renowned Música Popular artist in Colombia, has joined forces with breakout mariachi songstress, Majo Aguilar, and the legendary Mariachi Sol de México for a heartfelt Carlos Vives tribute. In a new rendition of “Bailar Contigo,” a cumbia-rock classic released by Vives in 2013, Bueno showcases his charming vocals alongside Aguilar’s captivating style, interlaced with vibrant mariachi guitars and lively trumpets. This release marks the launch of Bueno’s upcoming EP, Homenaje a Carlos Vives, which celebrates the enduring legacy of one of Colombia’s most cherished artists. The music video for “Bailar Contigo” was beautifully filmed in the picturesque landscape of Jalisco, a region renowned for its rich cultural heritage of tequila production and mariachi music.— INGRID FAJARDO     Yandel, Sinfónico (En Vivo)(Y Entertainment/Warner Music Latina)     The Puerto Rican hitmaker reimagines some of his career-defining songs — from “Abusadora” to “Rakata” — in Sinfónico, a 29-track set recorded live in Miami with the Florida International University Symphony Orchestra. While it’s not the first time an urban artist records with an orchestra, Sinfónico is truly a grand experience offering a different approach to música urbana fusing reggaetón and symphony. Giving his iconic catalog a whole new sonic identity, Yandel launched his reggaetón-meets-orchestra concept back in October when he performed at the Florida International University with the school’s symphony orchestra. The album precedes his Sinfónico Tour, which is set to kick off May 10 in San Juan, Puerto Rico and wrap June 21 in Houston, where Yandel will perform his biggest hits alongside local symphony orchestras. — GRISELDA FLORES   Luis Figueroa & Christian Alicea, “Si Llamas” (Sony Music Latin/Magnus Media)     In a surprising yet pleasing collaboration, Luis Figueroa and Christian Alicea (two former Billboard Latin Artist on the Rise) deliver “Si Llamas.” Both Puerto Rican artists are paving the way for the new generation of salsa stars, respectively, but this is the first time that they join forces to further solidify the movement. Produced by Venezuelan hitmaker Motiff, who is also betting on the new sound of salsa music, “Si Llamas” blends traditional salsa rhythms with Latin urban tones — the two genres that best characterize La Isla del Encanto’s musical flavor. Lyrically, the song is sensual and flirty, telling the story of an unexpected encounter that leaves a lasting impression and begs to be re-lived. A music video accompanies the track, spotlighting Figueroa and Alicea’s potent vocals, playful bromance and killer dance moves. — JESSICA ROIZ     Estevie, “Un Error” (Nice Life Recording Company”     Racking up co-signs from artists like DannyLux, Eslabon Armado and Cuco since her breakthrough in 2022, Estevie is among a handful of rising female artists in the música mexicana space that are offering a fresh take on the genre. Best known for her hip-swiveling cumbias that will promptly get you on your feet, her latest release is no exception. “Un Error,” co-produced by hitmakers like Ulises Lozano and Ernesto Fernández, is powered by an infectious, thumping cumbia beat accompanied by the norteño accordion. In “Un Error,” Estevie sings in her signature velvety vocals about a mistake that might affect her relationship. “I ask you to please forgive me … whatever happened I just want your love but I made a mistake,” she exclaims. — G.F.
