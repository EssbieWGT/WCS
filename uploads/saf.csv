In May 2025, Lianyungang Jiaao secured approval from the country’s Ministry of Commerce and three other departments, becoming first company included in the SAF “Export Whitelist.”

This allowed Lianyungang facility to apply for export licenses for its full annual capacity of 372,400 tons of SAF. The company recently completed China’s first compliant export of 13,400 tons of SAF on May 6, 2025.

China is already developing multifaceted support policies for SAF. In May 2024, the State Council’s Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction Action Plan explicitly called for “promoting advanced bio-liquid fuels and sustainable aviation fuels.”

In October 2024, the NDRC and other departments emphasized “developing green fuels like bio-aviation fuel based on local conditions” in the Renewable Energy Substitution Action Guidance.

China also launched SAF pilot programs at four major airports, with plans to expand scale by 2025, focusing on routine bio-jet fuel refuelling in the Yangtze River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions.",http://www.avfoil.com/images/detailed/23/Addon-05_alk2-eb.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 21:56:25.420427

The expansion plans aim to enable Heathrow to give passengers more choice – at least 30 new daily routes, extra domestic connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Once completed, Heathrow’s plans aim to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, add 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn of annual trade – while keeping its global competitive edge.

The blueprint submitted to Government today includes:

A north-western runway up to 3,500m – a design that already has Parliamentary support

Increased capacity to serve up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers

A brand-new terminal ‘T5X’, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals

The investment consists of three main elements: £21 billion for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14 billion in 2018 due to construction inflation), £12billion for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X – and £15 billion for modernising the current airport through expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3.

A third runway and supporting infrastructure can be ready within a decade and the full investment across all terminals would take place over the coming decades.

Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transport, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts. A new road tunnel, plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station will make it easier to reach the airport.

Crucially, Heathrow is confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and has a deliverable plan to get there, as well as setting targets on noise reduction and air quality. The airport is already ahead of target on its decarbonisation journey, cutting carbon from flights by around 10% since 2019, and carbon on the ground by 15% and has plans to ramp up further its world leadership on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits. A third runway and redesigned airspace will give communities and passengers more certainty and reliability on flight paths.

There will be tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation, unlocking lifelong careers for those who live closest. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East, a truly national endeavour.

For the airport's nearest neighbours, a community fund is being proposed, and Heathrow will continue to engage on how to be a better neighbour to its local community.

An appropriate regulatory framework needs to be put in place – one that encourages growth and investment while remaining affordable for customers – to secure many tens of billions of private capital from equity shareholders and from debt investors.

Feedback from the Government will be required by September to stay on track for Ministers’ set timeline.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said: “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country, it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

If the Government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow plans to consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

Support for Heathrow expansion comes from Chambers of Commerce across the whole of the UK, businesses wanting better access to global markets, trade unions reaffirming the career opportunities, while local Chambers of Commerce, educators and construction firms are ready to roll up the sleeves and get to work.

Heathrow has stressed that its role in the country’s economy is unique. Today it connects UK exporters to 92% of the world’s economy in a direct flight. It argues that expanding Heathrow will deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes and that without action, the UK is at risk of losing its global aviation hub status in the face of growing competition from European hubs. While international competitors have room to grow, Heathrow is already at capacity. Without expansion the UK’s hub will fall behind, harming opportunities for the country’s economy.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander welcomed the initial proposals for Heathrow expansion. She said: “I am pleased to have received the initial Heathrow expansion proposals - a significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure to drive forward our Plan for Change.

“We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO, easyJet said: ""The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway — an investment in the nation's future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.""

“Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Amy Smith, Managing Director (Interim), Cornwall Airport Newquay, said: “Cornwall Airport Newquay supports infrastructure development that enables true regional connectivity. The proposed third runway at Heathrow has the potential to deliver meaningful hub access for regions like Cornwall - but only if there is a clear and sustained commitment to slot accessibility and affordability for regional carriers and regional routes. Direct and reliable connectivity to a UK hub is vital for Cornwall’s economy, inward investment and the future of sustainable regional aviation.”",,N,,2025-08-01 21:56:29.829336

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.","Gevo has long explored various processes, including synthetic biology and industrial chemistry, to develop cost-competitive pathways to create SAF (synthetic aviation fuel) using alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) methods and exploring the benefits of bio-based feedstocks.

Depending on the feedstocks used and the efficiencies built into the production process, our SAF can offer enough carbon abatement and sustainability as attributes that it can be classified as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Since it is ready to replace petroleum-based jet fuel, our ATJ SAF is demonstrated to meet or exceed the standards in ASTM D1655/7566 specification, which specifies blending up to 50 percent (though we’ve flown test aircraft on 100-percent SAF). Here’s a breakdown:

For flash point, the standard stipulates a 38 degrees C minimum, and ATJ is well within acceptable range at 45 to 50 degrees C.

Both also pass the standard for thermal oxidation stability.

For freezing point, the standard requires -40 degrees C maximum for Jet A and -47 degrees C for Jet A-1, and Jet A-1 complies with -50 degrees C, while ATJ is -78 degrees C.

The energy density standard is 42.8 MJ/kg minimum, and Jet A-1 complies with 42.9 MJ/kg, while ATJ has 44.0 MJ/kg.

The total sulfur content standard is 0.3 percent max, while Jet A-1 comes in at 0.05 percent and ATJ rates at less than 0.00 percent.

SAF Opportunities

While the terms Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are often used interchangeably, there are important distinctions. Here’s a helpful breakdown of the determining qualifications for each label:

Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Synthetic aviation fuel refers to hydrocarbons created through chemical synthesis. These fuels can be derived from a wide range of sources, not all of which are sustainable, and have the following characteristics:

Usually considered sustainable aviation fuel only if the production process meets sustainability criteria.

Source materials also are a factor in determining the level of sustainability—not considered inherently sustainable unless made from green H₂ and captured CO₂.

Often made from fossil sources, such as coal or natural gas

Examples include:

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) using electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

CTL (Coal-to-Liquid) using coal

GTL (Gas-to-Liquid) using natural gas

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is an umbrella term for aviation fuels that reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. They must meet sustainability criteria, including feedstock origin and carbon intensity over the lifecycle of the product, and have the following characteristics:

Derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks.

Must reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by at least 50 percent (per ICAO CORSIA standards).

Examples include:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) from used cooking oil or animal fats

FT-SPK (Fischer Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) produced through a process called Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which converts synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, into liquid hydrocarbons from solid waste or biomass

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) converts alcohols like ethanol and butanol, derived from renewable sources, into sustainable aviation fuel

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) use renewable electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

Summary of SAF-Type Differences:

How Does Gevo Fit in the World of SAF?

Gevo Inc. is a U.S.-based company that produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and they fall into the “Alcohol-to-Jet” (ATJ) category, developing both ATJ and Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) pathways.

Gevo SAF at a Glance

Why Gevo’s SAF Is Both Synthetic and Sustainable

Gevo’s process synthesizes jet fuel molecules, but from biologically derived alcohols.

Since the source is renewable (plant-based sugars from regeneratively grown corn) and the process is engineered to minimize emissions, Gevo’s fuel meets sustainability criteria.

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.

He said development of this product, like renewable diesel, is not something that is a long way over the horizon.
""We want it to be more efficient, whether through our own investment plan or through partnerships with third parties we're working with.
In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).","Sustainable fuels, refinery flexibility, midstream and upstream are focus areas of Chile's state oil company Enap, which plans to invest US$3.78bn in 2025-29, up from US$3.50bn in its previous five-year plan.

Enap, whose bottom line climbed 84% year-on-year in January-June to US$318mn, has earmarked around 70% of its multibillion-dollar war chest to projects, with the balance assigned for maintenance.

Profit growth drivers were increased sales of added-value products, logistics optimization and lower financial costs linked to a debt-reduction process.

Sustainable fuels

In terms of energy diversification, Enap CEO Julio Friedmann, in response to a BNamericas question during a results presentation, said the company was working on three fronts: renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green hydrogen.

Enap this year announced the launch of a renewable diesel pilot project, employing used cooking oils and infrastructure at its Aconcagua refinery in Valparaíso region. The mining industry was an offtaker of initial production last half, for usage in buses and trucks.

A next phase would involve building a standalone plant.

Echoing comments made by Enap chair Gloria Maldonado earlier in the week, Friedmann said long-term supply contracts would be needed to unlock further investment, adding that renewable diesel production is not something still stuck on the drawing board.

Friedmann said: ""We've got the capacity, today, to produce this renewable diesel; with successful sales and the agreement of long-term supply contracts, we'll be able to finalize the business case to justify the eventual construction of a plant dedicated to renewable diesel

""Depending on sales volumes, on how the market grows, we could, here, think about directing some of the investment plan to increase capacity, dedicated exclusively to renewable diesel.""

In parallel, Enap is sharpening its focus on SAF. The company already supplies the local aviation market with conventional jet fuel.

SAF development would follow a similar trajectory as that of renewable diesel, said Friedmann, adding that conceptual trial work was planned this half.

""We're in talks with airlines, which have expressed interest in the matter,"" Friedmann said.

He said development of this product, like renewable diesel, is not something that is a long way over the horizon.

The UN's civil aviation standards and planning agency, ICAO, is due to publish a Chilean SAF feasibility report this half, BNamericas reported recently. The airline industry aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which will require a major uptick in SAF usage.

In terms of green hydrogen, Enap has begun ground preparation work at its Cabo Negro industrial site in Magallanes region, where a 1.2MW electrolyzer is due for installation by the end of the year. Output from the US$12mn wind-powered pilot facility, whose construction contract was awarded to Germany's Neuman & Esser, will initially be used in Enap industrial processes, with scope to potentially deploy it elsewhere in the region. Enap staff are receiving technical training.

The Enap facility will join HIF's Haru Oni e-fuels demonstration plant, also in Magallanes.

Refining

Another major pillar is refinery modernization and operational flexibility work, with goals including boosting capacity to process a wider range of crude.

In terms of flexibility, Friedmann referred to the need to mitigate global price and product volatility: ""So we've invested, and that's how it's going to continue. For example, we call it a retrofit – replacing some of the internal components of existing equipment so that we can, for instance, process a wider range of crude oils.""

Logistics, exports

Increasing logistics efficiency is also a key pillar. Enap has 11 ships and four maritime terminals, along with storage infrastructure.

""We're going to place a strong emphasis on modernizing our logistics infrastructure,"" Friedmann said. ""We want it to be more efficient, whether through our own investment plan or through partnerships with third parties we're working with. There's nothing we can announce at this time, as it always involves ongoing discussions and confidentiality agreements, but it's something we're actively working on as well.""

In the sphere of logistics efficiency, Enap is seeking the environmental green light to carry out a US$60mn dredging project at its San Vicente crude and fuel terminal in Biobío region to support the access of larger crude carriers.

""Our investment plan takes into account this dredging work,"" said Friedmann, who added work was underway to boost operational flexibility of the terminal.

This falls under a wider plan to have capacity to potentially export crude. Enap has ramped up oil imports from Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play via the 110,000b/d Otasa duct, in which it is a stakeholder, along with YPF and Chevron.

In May, 12,000m3/d (75,477b/d) was exported to Enap's Biobío region refinery via the Otasa pipeline, according to data from Argentina's federal energy department.

About 30% of crude refined in Chile today comes from Vaca Muerta. Enap will retain capacity to obtain crude from diverse sources, such as Brazil and Ecuador.

A potential Otasa capacity expansion is being considered.

Upstream

In Chile, Enap operates in the upstream segment in Magallanes region, where the gas it produces supplies local offtakers, among them methanol producer Methanex.

A chunk of cash is earmarked for keeping gas flowing and replacing reserves both in Chile and elsewhere. After exiting Argentina, in terms of its international upstream footprint, Enap today has assets in Ecuador and Egypt.

Friedmann said: ""Part of the investment plan also involves Magallanes and ensuring the long-term supply for that region. Remember, that region is 100% dependent on natural gas production, and also Methanex, which is a private company.""

He added: ""And in our international operations, we've also made it a priority to see how we can responsibly replace reserves – whether through organic or inorganic growth – and that may also require a portion of our investment plan.""

At the end of December, Enap's total reserves stood at 121Mboe, chiefly spread across Chile and Ecuador. In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).

Refining capacity is around 224,000b/d, spread across three facilities.",https://cdnimg.bnamericas.com/tHTLxnvmPqLfzCmnIVzZTEwOUWmndaNZJhPnODUpmVSceUQWyUKZZmkzzbRpHroo.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:56:33.050738

The airport says the project is “shovel-ready”, with many technical studies and consultations already undertaken. If Government feedback is received by September, Heathrow expects to begin wider engagement with airlines, local authorities, businesses and communities from 2026, and submit a formal planning application by 2028.

Heathrow estimates the expansion would contribute around 0.43% to UK GDP, with 60% of economic benefits occurring outside London and the South East. The airport also expects to create employment opportunities through construction and operations, including across its national supply chain.

Additional capacity is intended to support up to 30 new destinations and strengthen domestic connectivity. Heathrow claims increased competition from more airlines operating at the airport would offer passengers a wider choice and could place downward pressure on fares.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said:

It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity.

We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.

Transport and Environmental Commitments

Despite the controversy of the third-runway plans, the proposals include commitments to the environment and surrounding transport networks. These include improvements to surface transport connections, such as rail capacity enhancements, a new road tunnel, two new parkways, and expanded walking and cycling routes. Plans also involve upgrades to Heathrow’s bus and coach station to improve access for passengers and airport staff.

Environmental measures form part of the submission, including a target for net zero emissions by 2050. Heathrow reports it has already reduced carbon emissions from aircraft by 10% and ground operations by 15% compared with 2019 levels. It plans further use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and airspace redesigns intended to improve reliability and reduce community disruption.

The airport’s noise footprint has reportedly reduced by 41% since 2006, and all current air quality monitoring stations are said to be within legal limits.

Heathrow is now awaiting the Government’s response to keep the project aligned with their proposed roadmap. The airport operator has said it is ready to begin early-stage investment and supply chain mobilisation before the end of this year, subject to policy clarity and regulatory alignment.

The total 49 billion GBP investment comprises:

21 billion GBP for the runway and associated airfield infrastructure

12 billion GBP for the new terminal and additional stand capacity

15 billion GBP for modernisation of existing infrastructure, including a major redevelopment of Terminal 2 and phased closure of Terminal 3

The figures include inflationary increases since previous estimates in 2018 and are subject to adjustment as design and regulatory processes progress.

In this interview, Rebina Pozole, Head of Sustainability at Deutsche Aircraft, shares how the company is tackling sustainability challenges through smarter aircraft design, fuel experimentation, and strategic partnerships-with the D328eco aircraft leading the charge.

“We’ve always reduced fuel for economic reasons-now we’re doing it for environmental ones.”

Pozole explains that while long-term innovation is crucial, OEMs have a responsibility to pursue near-term, feasible solutions. For Deutsche Aircraft, this includes improving aerodynamics, weight, and engine efficiency while also testing alternative fuel types like hydrogen, batteries, and more sustainable hydrocarbon use.

“There aren’t that many energy carriers we can use in aviation. We need to explore realistic alternatives-and SAF is one of them.”

She highlights two tracks of experimentation:

Applied tech testing, like flights using zero-aromatics synthetic fuels

Research-based experimentation, exploring what may be possible in the future

One major milestone? The upcoming D328eco, scheduled for entry into service in late 2027:

“We’re on track. Seeing the aircraft take shape in the hangar-it’s really exciting.”

Pozole also dives into the critical need for deep, technical collaboration between OEMs, fuel producers, and other ecosystem players:

“It’s not just cooperation for the sake of it. We need to understand each other’s technical and business constraints-something we never had to do before.”

Looking ahead, Deutsche Aircraft is actively forming strategic partnerships with SAF producers to ensure their aircraft can fly with 100% PTL zero-aromatics fuel once it’s commercially available.

Questions asked include:

What role do OEMs play in the aviation industry’s sustainability journey?

How is aircraft design being optimized to reduce climate impact?

What are the key challenges in experimenting with new technologies and fuels?

Can you tell us about the progress of the D328eco?

How vital is collaboration in meeting sustainability goals?

Are there any exciting partnerships on the horizon?

Rolls-Royce Aims Net Zero by 2050: Real Progress, Not Offsets

Rolls-Royce has made climate leadership a priority. It aims for net zero by 2050, not just in its operations but also across its products.

The company avoids relying on carbon offsets. Instead, it focuses on cutting emissions through innovation, efficient operations, and renewable fuels.

Here’s how it is cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its operations:

It targets a 46% emissions cut by 2030, based on 2019 levels. The goal is to reach net zero emissions from its operations by 2050. This includes emissions from engine testing, which have increased due to higher development activity.

The company plans to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in tests. They are shifting to clean power sources and installing batteries in locations like Friedrichshafen. Additionally, they are also buying renewable energy and focusing on efficiency improvements.

In 2024, total Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased to 301 ktCO2e. This rise includes a 55 ktCO2e jump in test-related emissions.

However, operational emissions dropped by 5 ktCO2e, a 3% decrease, which indicates progress.

Scope 3 Focus: Tackling Value Chain Emissions

Beyond direct emissions, Rolls-Royce is addressing Scope 3 emissions—especially from the use of its products (category 11) and purchased goods and services (category 1). These are major sources, with purchased goods accounting for 2.18 MtCO2e in 2024, around 2.5% of total emissions.

It is working with suppliers to set net zero targets, partnering with logistics firms for low-emission transport, and promoting resource efficiency to reduce waste.

Innovation for Cleaner Products

Rolls-Royce is investing significantly in future-ready, low-carbon products. They aim to ramp up their R&D spending on net-zero technologies by 75% this year.

Notable milestones include the UltraFan engine, a next-gen demonstrator with high fuel efficiency and SAF compatibility. All current in-production aero engines are certified to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. The company’s SMR projects aim to deliver scalable, clean electricity to national grids.

These projects are vital for its net-zero strategy and essential for decarbonizing the heavy industry and global aviation sectors.

All in all, Rolls-Royce demonstrates that climate action and financial growth can be mutually beneficial. From record profits to world-class clean tech investments, Rolls-Royce exemplifies how legacy companies can become climate leaders even without carbon credits.

Our methanol-to-jet fuel project highlights how we can deliver investment-ready, competitive infrastructure that aids decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.” This announcement builds on recent momentum for HAMR Energy, as it nears completion of a $10 million Series A funding round.","HAMR Energy, a prominent developer of low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), has unveiled its intention to establish Australia’s first major methanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility. With an estimated investment of $700–800 million, the proposed facility is designed to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry while generating hundreds of new jobs across construction and long-term operations.

This milestone announcement comes after the successful completion of a comprehensive feasibility study, positioning the project as a critical step in HAMR Energy’s broader plan to harness new international regulations that permit the use of methanol as a feedstock in SAF production. Methanol, which can be derived from a variety of renewable sources, is emerging as a game-changer in aviation fuel development due to its scalability, versatility, and ability to serve as a drop-in fuel for existing aircraft infrastructure.

The proposed facility will utilize approximately 300,000 tonnes of low-carbon methanol—produced from forestry waste and green hydrogen at HAMR’s Portland Renewable Fuels project—to generate around 125 million litres of SAF annually. This output would be sufficient to decarbonize nearly 3.5 million economy-class flights between Sydney and Melbourne each year, helping to bridge the global SAF supply gap, which is projected to reach 10 million tonnes by 2030.

The feasibility study conducted by HAMR Energy identified refining technologies that offer a commercially viable path to converting methanol into SAF. The study also assessed critical project considerations such as access to renewable energy, proximity to key markets, and construction economics. Based on these findings, South Australia and Victoria have emerged as the most promising regions for establishing the new facility.

HAMR Energy's vertically integrated approach—encompassing the entire production chain from biomass to final fuel—enables it to maintain one of the industry's lowest production costs. This is particularly attractive to airlines and other SAF buyers that are urgently seeking affordable and scalable decarbonization solutions. The company has already secured supply agreements for limited renewable biomass feedstock, further enhancing project viability.

Co-founder David Stribley emphasized the national benefits of this initiative, stating, “With appropriate policy support, Australia is well-positioned to develop a globally competitive LCLF industry. This can lead to new regional employment opportunities, enhanced energy security, and better use of our renewable and biomass resources. Our methanol-to-jet fuel project highlights how we can deliver investment-ready, competitive infrastructure that aids decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.”

This announcement builds on recent momentum for HAMR Energy, as it nears completion of a $10 million Series A funding round.

Even before you play it, the World Peace Game offers you a fresh perspective simply by learning how it’s played.
The lesson of collective wisdom In a recent conversation, Executive Director of the World Peace Game Foundation Robin Klingler offered what just might be the most vital lesson the game shares.
Yet for many leaders, it’s a lesson overlooked and undervalued.
It’s never been true, but in an uncertain world, holding onto that expectation is a dangerous strategy.","Leaders aren’t typically known for playing games, but maybe it’s time they should, at least this one. It’s called the World Peace Game, and if you’re a leader with even the slightest interest in adaptability, resilience or how to grow the value of something, it’s time you had a look.

On its surface alone, two things immediately stand out. First, in no small way, the game is about dealing with uncertainty. The World Peace Game’s version takes the form of a hands-on political simulation made up of dozens of complex and interlocking problems — actual real-world problems that inhibit actual world peace. Within the game, players take on the roles of countries, international bodies, forces of nature and even ambiguity itself. Their objective is to solve every interlocking problem while leaving no player worse off at the end than they were at the start. The second and more bracing fact? The game was designed to be played by fourth graders.

Before you scoff at any of this or its relevance, you should know that the World Peace Game’s nine and ten-year-old players have more than once been invited to the Pentagon alongside the game’s creator, John Hunter, to consult with the secretary of defense and its generals about what they might learn from these short-in-stature but long-on-wisdom preteen leaders. If you’re a senior leader, those facts alone should have you asking, “What could this game teach me about how to lead better?”

A different view of leadership in uncertainty

Leading at any time is hard, but leading in uncertain times demands a new view. Uncertainty is every leader’s new abnormal, and in that unfamiliar terrain, the message is clear: What worked in the past won’t work now. What that means is that it’s high time you stopped looking in the usual places and to the usual suspects for leadership guidance.

Even before you play it, the World Peace Game offers you a fresh perspective simply by learning how it’s played. One awakening is learning who leads. Though the grown-ups (teachers and school administrators) choose the game, once the basic guidelines for play have been shared, the kids take over. You heard right. Those who by default and title typically lead literally step back and rely on those on the front lines to create, collaborate and solve. Across an intense week of play, the kids not only direct the game, they do it exceptionally, not just solving the challenges presented, but remarkably finding different ways to solve them every time.

The flipping of roles offers a powerful and uncommon chance for everyone to see bigger. It causes both students and teachers to revisit well-worn habits and see through new eyes. The approach quite naturally expands critical and creative thinking while supplanting black-and-white assumptions with a mindset of “what if …” There are countless other advantages and insights the game offers, yet even this one example alone stands in marked contrast to most real-world leadership. More than just a game, Hunter accurately describes it as “a flexible, renewable practice.”

The game teaches so much more, with many of those lessons easily gleaned by watching Hunter’s first TED Talk or reading his wonderfully titled book, World Peace and Other Fourth Grade Achievements. But whether you look further into this powerful game or not, there’s one lesson that must be shared here and now. It’s a lesson every leader in this new abnormal needs to embrace – not someday, but right now.

The lesson of collective wisdom

In a recent conversation, Executive Director of the World Peace Game Foundation Robin Klingler offered what just might be the most vital lesson the game shares. To her, it’s foundational and something she stays in touch with every day. Yet for many leaders, it’s a lesson overlooked and undervalued. “The Game doesn’t work without collective wisdom,” Klingler remarked. What’s obvious to her is hidden in plain sight for many leaders, in part because, despite these deeply uncertain times, we still carry around the mythology that leadership and the individual leader are one in the same. It’s never been true, but in an uncertain world, holding onto that expectation is a dangerous strategy.

The key to comfort with the unknown

More than just an insight about the World Peace Game, Klingler’s observation may just be the best advice any leader on any front can embrace if thriving in uncertain times is their goal. Indeed, collective wisdom and the range of knowledge and experience it implies have repeatedly been shown, including by Harvard Business Review, to make teams smarter, more resilient and perhaps most vital in uncertain times, “more likely to constantly reexamine facts and remain objective.” In short, more than a nice aphorism, Klingler’s insight is the fulcrum for the change leaders need and the key to the lasting success they seek. As Hunter says, the game is ultimately about learning to live and work comfortably in the unknown. Without collective wisdom, it’s a pretty tough lesson to master.

At Jesup, we will leverage our complementary capabilities in the development of a cost-effective, scalable solution for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.”","Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc, a global leader in cellulose specialty products, and GranBio LLC, a prominent innovator in biochemicals and biofuels, today announced a significant stride towards sustainable aviation with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This agreement paves the way for jointly exploring the development of a small-scale commercial cellulosic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility, strategically co-located at RYAM’s Jesup, Georgia site.

The proposed project represents a forward-thinking initiative in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector. Under the terms of the MoU, GranBio will take the lead in this ambitious endeavor, deploying its cutting-edge proprietary AVAP® technology. This advanced process is designed to efficiently convert lignocellulosic biomass – a renewable resource derived from plant matter – into second-generation ethanol. This ethanol will then undergo further upgrading to produce SAF, a crucial component in the global effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. The produced SAF will be subsequently sold to an identified offtaker, ensuring a direct pathway to market.

A key advantage of this collaboration lies in its synergistic approach. The new facility is set to capitalize on RYAM’s extensive existing infrastructure at its Jesup plant. The project is poised to receive substantial financial backing, partially through a $100 million grant awarded to GranBio by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Beyond the immediate benefits of the SAF project, this MoU holds significant strategic implications for RYAM. Should the project successfully move forward, RYAM stands to gain a license to GranBio’s latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP® technologies. This access would extend to both ethanol and sugar production at its own facility, in partnership with GranBio.

De Lyle Bloomquist, President and CEO of RYAM, emphasized the strategic alignment of this partnership, stating, “This MoU aligns with our strategy to unlock new value from our core assets and expand into renewable markets where our infrastructure and technical capabilities create a competitive advantage. GranBio brings world-class technology to this partnership, and together we’re exploring practical, scalable solutions to help decarbonize global aviation fuel markets.”

Echoing this sentiment, Luiz Oliveira, CEO of GranBio, expressed his enthusiasm for the deepened collaboration: “I am very pleased to strengthen our collaboration with RYAM and work toward our joint goal of developing clean energy solutions, while improving the communities in which we work. At Jesup, we will leverage our complementary capabilities in the development of a cost-effective, scalable solution for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.”",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-01 11:56:17.824368

When we hire and train with sustainability in mind, we’re not just filling jobs, we’re helping aviation reach its net‑zero future.”

— Giovanna Mirabile

KALKARA, SOUTH EAST, MALTA, August 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As airlines work to cut carbon emissions and meet net-zero targets by 2050, one area is starting to gain more attention: human resources.

While much of the aviation industry’s climate focus has been on cleaner fuels and electric ground vehicles, experts say the people behind daily operations could play just as important a role. From hiring and training to digital systems and flexible work, HR departments are beginning to influence how airlines meet their environmental goals.

Aviation makes up about 2.5% of global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). And with air travel expected to grow, reducing that number will require change across the entire industry, not just in engineering.

One growing trend is known as sustainability in aviation HR. This means bringing climate awareness into how companies hire, train, and manage staff. It includes looking for employees who understand environmental issues, offering training on topics like energy efficiency, and encouraging low-impact travel to and from work.

Some companies have already started making changes. For example, many airlines in Europe have moved support roles to remote or hybrid work models. This has led to fewer internal flights and commuting, helping cut travel-related emissions by up to 40%. A study from Cornell University and Microsoft in 2023 found that full-time remote work can reduce a worker’s carbon footprint by more than half. Even hybrid models can cut emissions by nearly 30%.

Digital tools are also making a difference. HR teams are switching from paper-based processes to cloud systems, electronic contracts, and online payroll. A 2024 report from the Global Sustainable Aviation Forum found that digital HR operations can lower administrative emissions by up to 30% over five years.

Some companies are also offering green onboarding. One large maintenance provider in the Middle East recently added a sustainability module to its new employee training. It covers things like sorting waste, saving energy, and using lower-emission transport options like e-bikes or carpooling. The company saw a 17% improvement in recycling and a 12% drop in energy use within a year.

As airlines invest more in clean technologies like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electric equipment, they also need skilled people to manage those changes. HR teams are helping by quickly hiring and placing the right staff in new green projects. According to IATA, SAF use is expected to grow from less than 1% of fuel today to 10% by 2030, which means more training and hiring will be needed.

Aviation HR provider Aeroates is one example of a company helping airlines plan for this shift. They work with clients to add sustainability goals to job descriptions, build digital systems, and stay up to date with environmental rules and regulations.

There is also evidence that these changes are good for business. A 2025 survey by Deloitte found that 67% of airline executives saw better employee engagement when HR policies supported sustainability. More than half said their teams also became more efficient.

While aircraft design and clean fuel remain central to cutting emissions, many in the industry now believe people will play a bigger role than expected. Culture, behaviour, and day-to-day choices all matter, and that is where HR comes in.

With just 25 years left to hit net-zero targets, aviation companies are realising that sustainability needs to reach every part of the business. That includes the people who help it run every day. Human resources may not have been part of the climate conversation in the past, but it is becoming a key part of the solution.

Sheffield will lead a consortium to commercialise its innovative SAF production pathway that can produce cleaner aviation fuel using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology

Consortium plans to attract investors to build SAF demonstration and production plants to boost the supply of UK-homegrown fuel

The University of Sheffield has been awarded UK government funding to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel and bring passengers a step closer to greener flights.

Announced by the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane MP, during a visit to the University (Monday 21 July), Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million project to commercialise its new SAF production technology and attract investors to build SAF production plants in order to boost the supply of the cleaner fuel to the aviation industry.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain. The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF – a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2 and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF. The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister, Mike Kane said:

This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution.

We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

The University of Sheffield is one of the world’s leading universities for sustainable aviation fuel R&D. Its Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe, which include pilot scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House – one of only two centres in the world – that support fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel. Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 per cent reduction in emission levels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

“At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Industrial hemp is a miracle crop. It grows fast, absorbs up to 15 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, and can be used for building materials, textiles, and fuel. It needs little water, no pesticides, and improves soil quality. When you grow hemp, you grow hope.

Hemp is also a powerful tool for carbon removal. As it grows, it absorbs carbon from the air and locks it in the biomass. We use this carbon to build hempcrete homes or make sustainable aviation fuel. The carbon is stored for decades or burned cleanly in a circular economy model.

Our Ukraine project

In partnership with Hemp Ukraine Recover, we’ve built a powerful pilot project that delivers climate, social, and economic impact. We’ve already removed and permanently sequestered 500 tonnes of net CO2, housed 170 people, and proven the viability of hemp carbon removal in post-conflict zones, and everywhere else.

Every tonne of CO2 removed is measured and verified. We subtract all emissions associated with the project, including fuel use, to ensure net removals. And every removal credit can be tracked to a real impact on the ground.

A pathway for aviation

We are scaling hemp carbon removal as a solution for aviation. Hemp can also be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel with high energy density. Our vision is to turn airports into hemp farms that remove carbon and fuel planes at the same time.

High-quality removal credits can be sold to passengers, airlines, and airports. This creates new revenue streams, engages climate-conscious customers, and helps aviation meet its decarbonisation targets.

On 4 July 2025, GIZ Thailand, through the International Hydrogen Ramp-Up Programme (H2Uppp), in cooperation with the National Energy Technology Centre (ENTEC) and the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC), organised ‘From Waste to Wings: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Thailand and Southeast Asia’ at Asia Sustainable Energy Week 2025 (ASEW 2025). The forum brought together policymakers, industry representatives and academics from the aviation and SAF industry to exchange insights and perspectives on the role and potential of SAF in creating a cleaner and more sustainable future for aviation, focusing on Thailand and Southeast Asia (SEA).

Dr Dominika Kalinowska, Transport Projects Director from GIZ Thailand, emphasised GIZ’s commitment to sustainable aviation, supported by a series of events organised under the H2Uppp SAF Working Group, as well as further GIZ initiatives assisting public stakeholders in developing an SAF roadmap for Thailand.

“The forum theme ‘From Waste to Wings’ reflects our vision to transform waste and renewable resources into low-carbon fuels, supporting decarbonisation of the aviation sector while enhancing energy security, economic value creation and regional cooperation. This forum aims to scale up ambition, align regional efforts, and chart a practical roadmap for Thailand and ASEAN to move from vision to action.”

The plenary sessions of the forum featured an array of distinguished speakers, who shared insights on a variety of SAF topics – from the SAF value chain, policies and regulations to production and trade.

Beginning the session was Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), who spoke about SAF integration prospects in Thailand, emphasising aligning airline companies’ policies with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), advancing the SAF value chain in the country, and CAAT’s own SAF expansion framework.

Sutharee Kiatman from the Biofuel Development Division, Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), Ministry of Energy (MoE), provided an overview of Thailand’s national SAF policy and strategic approaches, underpinning the commitment reflected in the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2024 and the Oil Plan 2025.

Ketsada Sutthiumporn from the Department of Energy Business (DoEB) presented fuel regulations and standards related to SAF in Thailand, highlighting inspection and laboratory processes as key in ensuring biofuel standards.

Pahoong Thammaratdumrong from Energy Absolute (E@) shared insights into different SAF production methods, together with challenges and potential solutions through the company’s insights and experience in the field.

Finally, a presentation by Scott Turn, a professor from the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI), University of Hawaii at Manoa, offered an in-depth observation of SAF development in Southeast Asia over the years, highlighting initiatives and progress from different countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

Following the plenary session, a panel discussion was held to exchange expert perspectives on aligning SAF to transport decarbonisation in Thailand and Southeast Asia through the perspectives of experts and project developers in relevant sectors. Focusing on the topic of SAF production, the panel suggested that, while feedstocks are abundant in countries such as Thailand, alternative feedstocks such as biomass-to-fuels and other pathways based on SAF demand-supply should be explored to ensure sustainability and environmental impact reduction from the production chain. With technologies and policy frameworks currently in place to support SAF in Thailand, the challenges now lie in aligning its implementation to meet decarbonisation and climate targets in the transport sector.

In the closing speech, Tim Nees, H2Uppp Project Manager, expressed his appreciation to the forum speakers and participants for fostering discussion and cooperation on SAF in the region. He also invited interested parties on SAF topics (as well as hydrogen and other PtX products) to further collaborate through networking opportunities and activities from the H2Uppp programme.

Additionally, H2Uppp also joined the Future Move Forum at ASEW 2025, where Dr Pramote Puengjinda introduced the project and shared insights into SAF feasibility and application potential, especially for decarbonising the transport sector. The project also organised an exhibition booth to offer information on the global H2Uppp project and engage with interested visitors around green hydrogen and PtX topics.

The H2Uppp programme, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE), is implemented globally. In Thailand, GIZ implements the project together with the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC), with the aim of supporting policy and market development for green hydrogen and Power-to-X through expert networking, knowledge dissemination and public-private partnerships (PPP).

A green jet fuel investment worth £1.25bn could be at risk if the UK's largest bioethanol plant is forced to close, the firm behind it has said.

Meld Energy signed an agreement with Vivergo Fuels earlier this year for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the Saltend Chemicals Park in Hull.

However, Vivergo's future has been put in doubt over the past few months after the decision to end the 19% tariff on US bioethanol imports as part of the recent UK-US trade deal.

Meld Energy CEO and founder Chris Smith said that without Vivergo at the site they may have to look overseas where ""that infrastructure is already in place"".

He said: ""We're excited about the potential to bring our sustainable aviation fuel project to the Humber – one of the UK's most important industrial and energy hubs.

""A bioethanol plant on site at Saltend is a critical part of that mix.

""Without it, we'd have to consider alternative locations overseas where that infrastructure is already in place.""

Mr Smith's comments came as the Vivergo plant was expecting its last scheduled wheat delivery from a farm in Lincolnshire on Friday.

'Urgent support needed'

Last month, Vivergo Fuels, which is owned by Associated British Foods and employs more than 160 people, said staff had been told about its uncertain future, which could see production stop before 13 September, if it does not get support.

Earlier this year, managing director Ben Hackett also wrote to wheat growers to say that the plant will only be able to honour existing contracts for wheat purchases while the uncertainty continued.

Mr Hackett said: ""We have the site, the skills, the supply chain and the ambition to lead the way on sustainable aviation fuel.

""But without urgent government support for British bioethanol, the UK risks losing that opportunity, along with the jobs and billions of pounds in investment that depend on it.""

A government spokesperson said officials and ministers have met with Vivergo over the past few months to discuss options over the ""significant challenges"" that the bioethanol industry had been facing for some time.

""We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,"" the spokesperson added.

This marks a shift from earlier hydrogen systems along China’s coast, many of which still rely on fossil fuels.
It aligns with national goals set by the National Development and Reform Commission to promote green hydrogen and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
If successful, the pipeline could become a model for future projects both in China and globally, advancing efforts to build low-carbon energy systems.","China has started building its first interprovincial green hydrogen pipeline, a major step in the country’s effort to expand clean energy infrastructure. The pipeline will carry hydrogen made from wind power in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, to Beijing, covering a distance of nearly 400 kilometers, reports Intellinews.com.

The project is being led by Sinopec, China’s top hydrogen producer. Once completed, the pipeline will supply up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually to Sinopec’s Yanshan petrochemical complex in the capital. Future phases aim to raise that capacity to 500,000 tonnes.

Approved by the Inner Mongolia Energy Bureau, the pipeline is part of a broader national strategy to lower emissions from heavy industry and reduce energy waste. Inner Mongolia has abundant wind and solar energy, but much of it currently goes unused due to a lack of transmission systems.

A 1-gigawatt wind-powered electrolysis facility in Ulanqab will be at the heart of the project. Electricity from wind turbines will be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be compressed and sent through the new pipeline to industrial users in Beijing.

This marks a shift from earlier hydrogen systems along China’s coast, many of which still rely on fossil fuels. The new project is designed to directly connect areas with surplus renewable energy to regions with high energy demand, such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic zone.

Sinopec says the project is a key step toward a cleaner, more flexible energy system. “This pipeline will help us move clean energy from where it’s made to where it’s needed, cutting waste and supporting industrial demand,” a company spokesperson said.

Transporting hydrogen by pipeline is expected to be far cheaper and more efficient than moving it by truck or mixing it with natural gas. This could remove one of the biggest hurdles in developing China’s hydrogen sector.

The project also supports Inner Mongolia’s regional development plan, which includes a network of hydrogen pipelines. It aligns with national goals set by the National Development and Reform Commission to promote green hydrogen and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Analysts warn that the success of the project will depend on how quickly industries adopt hydrogen and whether prices remain competitive. But many believe this new pipeline could encourage further investments across the hydrogen supply chain—from fuel production to storage and transport.

If successful, the pipeline could become a model for future projects both in China and globally, advancing efforts to build low-carbon energy systems.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Green-Hydrogen-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 09:57:17.611556

For the first time, UK air passengers say they care more about punctual flights than cutting emissions.

According to the 2025 NATS Aviation Index, 63% of respondents now rank on-time performance as the industry’s top priority, overtaking reducing carbon emissions (56%) for the first time in the survey’s history.

While environmental concerns remain important, they have declined from their pandemic-era peak.

In 2020, 70% of passengers said cutting emissions was their number one priority. Today, however, passengers are more focused on improvements they can feel—like arriving on time—than those they can’t immediately see.

Air passengers are concerned, but won’t reduce flying

When asked which climate solutions the industry should pursue, the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ranked highest, prioritised by 39% of respondents. This puts SAF ahead of airspace modernisation (21%) and carbon offsetting as the most popular route to lower emissions.

Despite this support for greener technology, only 17% of passengers say environmental concerns actively deter them from flying. In contrast, ticket cost remains crucial, with 89% citing price as the primary influence on travel decisions.

Public perceptions around responsibility for aviation’s climate impact remain skewed toward institutions rather than individuals:

30% place the burden primarily on government

26% on airlines

23% on industry bodies like NATS and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)

Just 4% believe individual passengers should take the lead

This disconnect is reflected in personal behaviour: one-third of respondents admit they’ve done nothing to reduce their own flight-related emissions, despite growing awareness and concern.

Support for green taxes is growing—but not for limits on flying

In a surprising shift, 50% of respondents now support a frequent flyer tax, up from previous years. However, enthusiasm drops when it comes to more direct restrictions: just 36% would support hard limits on the number of flights individuals can take within a given timeframe.

While this indicates growing public openness to policy interventions, it’s unclear how sentiment might shift if such proposals became real government policy.

Although travel habits have stabilised post-pandemic—with 52% flying internationally and 32% domestically in the past year—the balance between sustainability and affordability is still tilted firmly toward cost.

Looking ahead, 26% expect to fly more over the next 12 months, particularly younger and ethnically diverse passengers. But cost remains the biggest constraint to that growth.

Airspace reform and innovation are gaining ground

Public support for airspace modernisation is rising. Awareness of UK efforts to redesign flight paths jumped from 11% to 19% in a year, and 52% support changes to enable more efficient routing.

Support for airport expansion remains stable at 53%, but 69% say any capacity growth must be underpinned by airspace reform.

Passengers are also warming to innovation. Support for flying taxis rose from 34% to 40%, while drones for emergency services (86%) and infrastructure inspection (81%) received overwhelming support.

Attitudes to artificial intelligence are mixed: 68% support AI in baggage screening and 50% approve of its use in air traffic control, but 49% express concerns about misuse and cybersecurity risks.

The NATS Aviation Index makes clear that UK passengers still value aviation’s social and economic benefits, but punctuality, affordability, and convenience are winning out over sustainability.

While support for SAF, airspace reform and even green taxes is growing, public expectations remain firmly grounded in the here and now: getting where they want, on time, at the right price.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/British-Airways-aircraft-with-palm-trees.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 06:56:17.312352

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on July 31 unveiled a national development roadmap targeting a 35% share of renewable energy in power generation by 2030. The plan also includes interconnecting power grids between Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak to expand green electricity exports, and the revival of the country’s nuclear power ambitions as part of its low-carbon energy transition.

13MP sets out reforms for renewable growth

The 13th Malaysia Plan (13MP), as the blueprint is known, lays out the government’s strategic direction for the next five years. Anchored on three core themes and nine strategic thrusts, the plan includes an investment of 430 billion ringgit (about USD 100 billion) to position Malaysia among Asia’s leading economies and within the world’s top 30.

On the renewable front, the plan sets a target of increasing installed capacity from renewables to 35%, up six percentage points from 2024. Sarawak already exceeds its target with a 62% share. The blueprint also mentions plans to enhance the interconnection between East and West Malaysia, potentially strengthening ASEAN Power Grid (APG) integration and facilitating cross-border electricity trade, though no further details were provided.

Presenting the plan to Parliament, Anwar emphasized Malaysia’s transition toward a cost-reflective power market, where electricity pricing would better reflect generation, transmission, and renewable integration costs. This shift is intended to enhance system efficiency and attract more investments.

Nuclear power revival planned for 2031 launch

13MP also supports the continuation of renewable energy schemes, such as the Community Renewable Energy Acculturation Mechanism (CREAM) and the Corporate Green Energy Supply Program (CRESS), which are designed to encourage public and private participation in the green electricity market. These initiatives will be supported by the National Energy Transition Fund (NETF), which will use blended financing to stimulate the development of low-carbon and decarbonization industries.

The plan also targets raising the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend to 5% by 2030. In Hulu Terengganu, the government aims to scale up floating solar PV, hydropower, and green hydrogen production hubs.

One of the most notable announcements is the proposal to reinstate Malaysia’s nuclear energy program, which was halted after the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Under the new plan, nuclear power is expected to enter the national energy mix by 2031, providing low-carbon and clean electricity.

CVR Energy Inc. on July 30 reported its renewables segment achieved increased throughput during the second quarter despite unplanned downtime, but reported a net loss of $11 million. The company expects to retroactively claim the 45Z clean fuel production credit for volumes produced.

CVR Energy’s renewable segments includes operations of the renewable diesel unit and renewable feedstock pretreater at its refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.

The renewables segment reported a second quarter net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million, unchanged when compared to the net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4 million, compared to $2 million.

Total vegetable oil throughput for the second quarter of 2025 was approximately 155,000 gallons per day, up from 127,000 gallons per day during the same period of 2024. The 155,000 gallons per day of throughput equates to approximately 14 million gallons for the full quarter.

Renewables margin was $5 million, or 38 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $5 million, or 43 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2024. Factors contributing to the company’s second quarter 2025 renewables margin were higher net sales of $13 million resulting from increased production and sales volumes, increased renewable diesel yield due to improved catalyst performance, and increased biomass-based diesel renewable identification number (RIN) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices in the current period, partially offset by the loss of the blenders tax credit (BTC) in the current period and a decrease in average CARB ULSD prices of 24 cents per gallon. Higher net sales were partially offset by higher cost of sales of $12 million due to an increase in throughput and production volumes.

During a second quarter earnings call held July 31, CVR Energy President and CEO David Lamp noted the company did not recognize any 45Z credit benefit during the quarter as it continues to wait for the IRS to issue final regulations. Lamp also noted the company believes it will have the ability to retroactively claim the credit once regulations are finalized.

According to Lamp, the renewables segment has been operating at near breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis year-to-date, with the loss of the BTC and increase in soybean oil pricing mostly being offset by increased RIN prices. CVR currently assumes the 45Z credit will boost adjusted EBITDA for the renewables segment by $6 million for the first half of 2025.

Regarding operations at Wynnewood, Lamp said the company has ordered its next load of renewable diesel catalyst and currently plans to remain in renewable diesel production as it awaits 45Z guidance and other potentially positive changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill. “We’ll also continue to weigh all options for the future of our renewable business,” he said, reiterating comments made earlier this year that the company remains fully willing to participate in the renewables space, but cannot invest additional time or capital without further assurances from the government it will support the business it created.

Lamp’s comments are in reference to plans the company was previously considering to convert Wynnewood to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and potentially add SAF and renewable diesel capacity to its Coffeyville refinery in Kansas. In February, Lamp announced CVR would pause those plans pending clarity on the availability and durability of government subsidies.

Moving into the third quarter, CVR Energy Chief Financial Officer Dan Newmann said the company expects total renewables throughput to be in the range of 16 to 20 million gallons.

Heathrow Airport has revealed details of its plan to expand and modernise the airport at a cost of £49bn.

Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow Airport, said expansion was ""urgent"" as the airport was currently working at capacity, ""to the detriment of trade and connectivity"". The work would be funded by private finance.

The government has backed plans for a third runway, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves saying it would ""make Britain the world's best connected place to do business"".

However, the plans face opposition from environmental groups, politicians, and locals. London's mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said it would have a ""severe impact on noise, air pollution and meeting our climate change targets"".

The plans come a day after the deadline set by the government for parties to submit proposals.

Heathrow's plans, which it estimates would be completed within a decade, include:

Creation of a third runway, called the ""North-Western Runway"", which would be up to 3,500m (11,500 ft) long. Heathrow bosses say this will increase capacity to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers a year - it currently serves about 84m

A new terminal called T5X, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals. It would close Terminal 3

Enhancement of local rail connections, plus walking and cycling routes

Diversion of the M25, which would involve a new road tunnel under the airport, and widening the motorway between junctions 14-15

Creation of two new Heathrow parkways

Improvements to Heathrow's bus and coach stations

Heathrow said it would cost £21bn to build the third runway, which includes procuring the land, changing the M25 and other associated infrastructure costs while building the new terminal would be £12bn and modernising the current airport's infrastructure £15bn. Due to rounding, it will total £49bn.

A spokesperson added the plans would grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP.

'Unlock billions'

The plans revealed by Heathrow were welcomed by business groups and airline companies.

A joint statement from the Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, MakeUK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, said it was ""an investment in the nation's future"".

It added: ""The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.""

John Dickie, chief executive of BusinessLDN, said as the airport was currently operating at full capacity, the expansion would give businesses ""better connectivity to overseas markets and support Britain's growth"".

He added it would also help achieve the government's target of 50 million international visitors per year to the UK.

Environmental damage

Mr Woldbye said Heathrow's submission was in line with the aviation industry's target to be net zero by 2050.

He added that Heathrow was ""the airport in the world with the highest uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel"", and that planning permission would not be granted by government unless legal limits of emissions were adhered to.

However, the plans were heavily criticised by groups who called the environmental justifications for the plans as ""hopeful marketing spin"".

Dr Douglas Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said the government had ""decided yet again to prioritise more leisure opportunities for a comparatively small group of frequent fliers, whilst the rest of us have to live with the consequences of their disproportionate polluting"".

He suggested a ""frequent flier levy"", and said no expansion should take place until there was a solution to the ""pollution problem"".

His concerns were echoed by politicians including Sir Sadiq who said he remained ""unconvinced"" that hundreds of thousands of additional flights each year would not have a ""hugely detrimental"" impact.

He added City Hall would ""carefully scrutinise"" the impact the extension would have on people living in the area and the ""huge knock-on effects for our transport infrastructure, which would require a comprehensive and costed plan to manage"".

A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""Heathrow is already the single largest polluter in the UK, and the Climate Change Committee itself has said expansion would put the UK's climate goals at risk.

""It's also clear we can't rely on the silver bullet of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to save the day,"" they added.

The Green Party deputy leader, Zack Polankski, said the plans were being delivered ""regardless"" of the environmental impact.

""If Labour's environmental commitments were worth the paper they're written on, these proposals would never have seen the light of day,"" he said.

Local residents living in Harmondsworth, near the airport, told the BBC earlier this year a third of the village would be destroyed if a third runway was to go ahead.

Rival plans

Heathrow's plans follow the publication of a rival proposal by the Arora Group, which has outlined a way to expand the airport without needing to redirect the M25.

Owner of the group, hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, said the creation of a third runway and a new terminal, under his plans, had a cost estimate of under £25bn, not including the redevelopment of the airport's existing central area.

The proposal crucially does not involve an expensive alteration to the M25, as the group said it was possible to build a 2,800-metre (9,200 ft) third runway instead of the full-length 3,500-metre (11,500 ft) runway planned by the airport.

Arora Group said its plan, called Heathrow West, could have a new runway fully operational by 2035, while a new terminal would open in two phases, in 2036 and 2040.

Moving the M25

When asked about the added expense of altering the M25 to accommodate a new, third runway, Heathrow's CEO said: ""The whole conversation about the M25 has been slightly exaggerated"", and that disruption to drivers would be minimal.

""We will build a new and much better M25, 100m (330 ft) to the west of the current one. It will be wider and it will be safer and it will have more capacity,"" Mr Woldbye added.

He said plans to create a much shorter runway to avoid moving the M25 - like the one proposed by The Aurora Group - would ""not provide the capacity that we and the airlines need"", but said the airport would be open to a discussion with airlines about building a shorter runway if it could deliver the same benefits.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the two proposals were a ""significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure"".

""We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year,"" she added.

'Half the battle'

BBC London's political editor Karl Mercer said: ""History has not been kind to plans to build a third runway, whoever has put them forward, and whichever colour government is in power.

""Having bidders interested is only half the battle - the hardest half will be getting it delivered.""

The extended subsidies aim to provide additional support for large-scale biomass power producers that aim to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) capacity.
Pellet production hit a new record during the six-month period and was up more than 5% when compared to the first half of last year.
This, together with existing sales to third parties, primarily in Asia, provides a good underpin to the current level of earnings from pellet production, the company said.
EBITDA from biomass power generation was down 16% during the first half of 2025.","Drax Group plc on July 31 confirmed it expects to sign a final agreement with the government before the end of the year establishing a low-carbon dispatchable contract for difference (CfD) to support transitional operations at Drax Power Station.

""Drax is the leading dispatchable renewable power company in the U.K., delivering 5% of the U.K.'s power and significantly more when the system needs it,” said Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax. “Thousands of our colleagues at Drax and in our supply chain work tirelessly to ensure our assets continue to help keep the lights on for millions of this country's households and countless businesses, no matter the weather.

""During the first half of the year, we made significant progress towards ensuring we continue to play an important role in U.K. energy security through this decade and beyond, reaching a heads of terms with the U.K. Government on a low-carbon dispatchable CfD,” Gardiner added. “We expect to sign a final agreement later this year and look forward to continuing to play a critical role in the U.K. system into the future.”

The U.K. government in February announced it would move forward with a short-term support mechanism for large-scale biomass power generators. The country’s current biomass power subsidies are set to end in 2027. The extended subsidies aim to provide additional support for large-scale biomass power producers that aim to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) capacity. The transitional subsidies, wich also aim to support the U.K.’s energy security, are expected to be in place from April 2027 through March 2031.

According to Drax, the U.K. Houses of Parliament in June voted to approve legislation required to enable the government to enter agreements for these transitional subsidies, which are to be offered in the form of low-carbon dispatchable CfD agreements. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority completed a review of the planned subsidies in July, and negotiations on the precise details of the final contract for Drax Power Station are currently ongoing.

Under the proposed agreement the CfD scheme will apply to up to c.6TWh of power annually from Drax Power Stqation, paid against a season ahead reference price (as per the current CfD scheme). Drax will then seek to maximize generation from its four biomass units at times of high demand and reduce generation at times of low demand, using the station's flexibility to support U.K. energy security. The proposed agreement also allows for system support and ancillary services, according to Drax.

Drax’s pellet business reported a 14% increase in EBITDA for the first half of 2025, which the company said reflects an increase in production, including the benefit from an expansion at the Aliceville pellet plant. Pellet production hit a new record during the six-month period and was up more than 5% when compared to the first half of last year.

As part of the company’s post-2027 targets, Drax said the proposed low-carbon dispatchable CfD agreement at Drax Power Station is expected to utilize 2 million metric tons of own-use pellets from the U.S. South in addition to third-party volumes. This, together with existing sales to third parties, primarily in Asia, provides a good underpin to the current level of earnings from pellet production, the company said.

In order to support long-term earnings growth and maximize the value of pellet production, Drax is continuing to assess operations for own-use and third-party sales, from existing and new markets, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which the company said could represent a major growth market opportunity for biomass pellets.

Drax also confirmed it is continuing its engagement with Pathway Energy LLC, which is developing a SAF project in Port Arthur, Texas. As part of its process with Pathway, Drax has agreed heads of terms on a multi-year agreement that could see Drax supply 1 million tons per year of sustainable biomass for the production of SAF. The company said the project could be an attractive home market for Drax’s U.S. pellet production, which pricing expected to be consistent with the company’s target for post-2027 adjusted EBITDA.

EBITDA from biomass power generation was down 16% during the first half of 2025. Drax said the reduction reflects a combination of lower forward contracted prices, partially offset by a continued high level of generation, demand for system support services and value from renewables.

Between April 2024 and March 2025, Drax generated more than 5% of the U.K.’s electricity and 11% of its renewable power. During this period, it produced on average 19% of the UK's renewable power at times of peak demand and on certain days over 50%.

CVR Energy Inc. on July 30 reported its renewables segment achieved increased throughput during the second quarter despite unplanned downtime, but reported a net loss of $11 million. The company expects to retroactively claim the 45Z clean fuel production credit for volumes produced.

CVR Energy’s renewable segments includes operations of the renewable diesel unit and renewable feedstock pretreater at its refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.

The renewables segment reported a second quarter net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million, unchanged when compared to the net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4 million, compared to $2 million.

Total vegetable oil throughput for the second quarter of 2025 was approximately 155,000 gallons per day, up from 127,000 gallons per day during the same period of 2024. The 155,000 gallons per day of throughput equates to approximately 14 million gallons for the full quarter.

Renewables margin was $5 million, or 38 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $5 million, or 43 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2024. Factors contributing to the company’s second quarter 2025 renewables margin were higher net sales of $13 million resulting from increased production and sales volumes, increased renewable diesel yield due to improved catalyst performance, and increased biomass-based diesel renewable identification number (RIN) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices in the current period, partially offset by the loss of the blenders tax credit (BTC) in the current period and a decrease in average CARB ULSD prices of 24 cents per gallon. Higher net sales were partially offset by higher cost of sales of $12 million due to an increase in throughput and production volumes.

Rollins today announced the U.S. Forest Service is investing $106 million to support state and landowner efforts to conserve private working forestlands across the country. Funded through the Forest Legacy Program, these projects will protect forests vital to the economic and social fabric of local communities – ensuring they remain productive, working forests for Americans and tourists to use and enjoy.

“Just like our farms and ranches, working forests are part of the backbone of rural America – providing jobs, timber, clean water, and places for families to hunt, fish, camp, hike and make lifelong memories,” said Secretary Brooke Rollins. “For too long our forests have been left idle, only to burn and devastate communities. President Trump has made it a priority to properly manage our forests, empowering USDA and our state partners to protect and unleash the full potential of their forestlands to help their communities grow and thrive.”

In total, the Forest Service will fund 10 projects across 177,000 acres of state- and privately owned forestlands in Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Oregon and South Carolina. The investments advance President Trump’s Executive Order on Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production by safeguarding forests that supply critical wood products and outdoor recreation opportunities—both of which fuel rural prosperity by creating jobs and supporting rural economies.

The Forest Legacy Program is authorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act Of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2103c) and operates through voluntary partnerships with states and landowners with the goal of conserving these lands while balancing other local uses and goals. Projects are selected through competitive state and national processes and carried out through conservation easements or fee-simple acquisitions. Lands conserved through the program either remain in private ownership with long-term protections or become new public lands managed by state or local governments.

Privately owned forests represent 60% of the nation’s 704 million forested acres. These lands are essential to the social, economic, cultural, and ecological fabric of local communities and play a critical role in national timber production, supplying 88% of all domestic timber.

To date, the Forest Legacy Program has conserved more than 3.1 million acres of forestland nationwide. To learn more or to view the full list of 2025 projects, visit the Forest Legacy Program webpage.

In addition, our West Palm Beach site is engaged in extensive R&D for future military engine applications.","July 2025 — In an interview with Invest:, Mary Anne Cannon, vice president of West Palm Beach Site and Development Operations for Pratt & Whitney, an RTX business, said that workforce development and innovation are key to sustaining growth in South Florida’s aerospace and manufacturing sectors. “One of the major trends is the competition for skilled labor; there’s high demand across companies in the region,” Cannon said.

What are some of the emerging trends in the aerospace, engineering, and manufacturing industries in Palm Beach County and South Florida?

Most people are familiar with RTX’s Pratt & Whitney business, a global leader in the design, manufacture, and service of aircraft engines for both commercial and military markets. We’re seeing growth in both of those segments. One significant trend we’re noticing locally is the increasing retirement rate among baby boomers, particularly in skilled trades. Palm Beach County has long been known for its aerospace presence, with major players like Pratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin, and L3Harris operating here.

So, a key focus right now is skilled labor — recruiting and developing the right talent. We’re actively working with institutions like Palm Beach State College, Florida Atlantic University, and local aviation maintenance technician schools, given the competition for skilled labor and the high demand across companies in the region. Internally, we support workforce development through our robust RTX Employee Scholar Program, which allows employees to pursue two-year and four-year degrees while working here. For example, Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) mechanics can come in with an 18-month certification and later move into other career paths within the company. I’ve participated in many discussions focused on developing the next generation of aerospace engineers and mechanics. It’s a critical issue not just in South Florida, but across the state.

Can you elaborate on any specific initiatives Pratt & Whitney has in place to support workforce development?

We’re involved with several local initiatives, including programs at the high school level. For instance, we’ve partnered with Forest Hill High School to offer summer internships for juniors and seniors. In fact, some students just started their internships this summer, giving them early exposure to the industry before deciding whether to pursue college or trade school.

Beyond high school, we collaborate with Palm Beach State College to develop specialized programs focused on electronics and data recording — key areas since we collect and analyze significant amounts of data from jet engines. We also work with Florida Atlantic University, the University of Florida, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. One of our recent collaborations with Embry-Riddle was the development of a new bachelor’s program in safety management systems.

Hiring locally is also a priority. People who grow up here tend to want to stay, which makes them highly committed to the community. While we also recruit from outside of Florida, there’s real value in cultivating local talent.

What makes Palm Beach County such a strong hub for the aerospace industry?

Pratt & Whitney was founded in 1925 in Hartford, Connecticut, and we expanded to South Florida in 1958. The reasons for the move were strategic: Florida offered attractive costs, and we secured 7,000 acres along the Beeline Highway for engine testing and development.

Even back then, the area had strong educational institutions. We’ve long drawn talent from Florida as well as nearby states like Georgia and Alabama. The late 1950s also marked the beginning of the space race, with Cape Canaveral ramping up. So, the region, stretching from the Space Coast to Palm Beach, became a hub for both aerospace and space-related development. We were involved in both sectors. Our space division eventually was sold and became part of Aerojet Rocketdyne, but our roots in Palm Beach County go deep.

The availability of land, proximity to major airports like Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach International, and access to a skilled workforce all contribute to making this an ideal location for our operations.

What products or services are driving growth, demand, and profitability for Pratt & Whitney?

Our two biggest product lines are the GTF and F135 engines. The GTF powers the A320neo aircraft and has seen strong demand from airlines thanks to its industry-leading noise reduction and fuel efficiency. Here in West Palm Beach, we handle the overhaul of these engines. For example, Spirit Airlines’ GTF engines are regularly serviced here and then returned to Fort Lauderdale.

The F135 engine, which powers the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet operated by the United States and 19 allied nations, is another key product. We manufacture some of those engines here in Florida as well as at our facility in Middletown, Connecticut. In addition, our West Palm Beach site is engaged in extensive R&D for future military engine applications.

How do you see alternative fuels and hydrogen-powered aircraft shaping the industry?

We’ve done a lot of local testing on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and alternative fuels, and the engines perform well with them. The main barriers right now are cost and availability. If an airline wanted to fly with a higher percentage of SAF, the cost would currently be prohibitive, and supply is limited. But the technology itself is sound.

Hydrogen is another area of interest. It’s worth noting that when this facility was established in 1958, one of the first engines we worked on was hydrogen-powered. It worked successfully, but the world wasn’t quite ready for it. That early hydrogen technology eventually led to the development of rocket engines, which today are produced by Aerojet Rocketdyne as part of NASA’s Artemis program. So, while we can demonstrate these technologies, getting them into widespread commercial use requires overcoming significant hurdles.

How is Pratt & Whitney leveraging technology to streamline operations and improve turnaround times?

We use a proprietary operating system called CORE, which drives continuous improvement across all processes, from engine assembly to testing and disassembly. We’re heavily focused on making these processes faster, more repeatable, and of higher quality.

This includes incorporating automation and robotics, as well as extensive data monitoring. Compared to 30 or 40 years ago, the time required to build a jet engine has been significantly reduced. We scrutinize every step, from how many bolts we use to how we ensure the engine performs consistently, always aiming for more efficient and reliable methods.

What specific steps is Pratt & Whitney taking to reduce emissions and improve sustainability?

Environmental responsibility is embedded in our DNA. Beyond engine emissions, we track and aim to reduce our facilities’ greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and waste streams. What’s notable is that we don’t normalize the data based on growth, we set absolute targets. For example, even if production increases, we still aim to reduce facility emissions by 20% over five years.

Locally, we’ve partnered with FPL to integrate solar power into our operations, which has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We’re also implementing water conservation initiatives and working to eliminate waste streams. We share a border with the JW Corbett Wildlife Refuge, so being strong environmental stewards is non-negotiable.

What are the primary challenges facing the aerospace engineering and manufacturing industry, and how is Pratt & Whitney addressing them?

Beyond the common issues — supply chain disruptions, inflation, tariffs — we’re really focused on recruiting and retaining top talent. Despite advances in automation and AI, it still takes skilled people to design and build jet engines. It’s a competitive market, and everyone is vying for top talent.

This is a long-term industry — designing a new aircraft engine can take a decade. That’s why we’re investing in automation, infrastructure, and, most importantly, our people. Pratt & Whitney is celebrating its centennial this year and, after a century in business, we’ve learned that success comes from listening to our customers and delivering what they need: greater fuel efficiency, range, lower noise, and reduced emissions. That approach has served us well on both the commercial and military sides of the business.

What are the company’s key priorities in the region going forward?

On the commercial side, we’re in the middle of ramping up production for the GTF engine and preparing to launch the next version, the GTF Advantage, which we anticipate will enter service next year. On the military side, we continue to work on the F135 Engine Core Upgrade, focusing on design maturation, aircraft integration and mobilizing the supply base to prepare for production.

These are evolutionary upgrades. For more revolutionary changes, like an engine for a new single-aisle aircraft platform from Boeing or Airbus, you’re looking at a five-to-15-year timeline. But behind the scenes, a lot of groundwork is already being laid to prepare for those long-term shifts.

Aviation’s growing emissions and the push to decarbonize

The challenge is simple. Most of aviation’s emissions come from burning fossil-based jet fuel. While engine efficiency improvements and operational optimizations offer some progress, they are not nearly enough. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 317 member airlines from over 120 countries have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To get there, SAF must replace a significant share of traditional jet fuel in the decades ahead.

Global mandates and airline commitments

Governments are beginning to mandate action. The European Union and the United Kingdom have already introduced mandates that require airlines to blend a small percentage of SAF with conventional jet fuel. These mandates start at just 2% in 2025 but scale up rapidly. The EU’s targets call for a 70% SAF blend by 2050, with 35% of that coming from so-called e-fuels. Airlines are also stepping up. For example, Air France has committed to reaching a 10% SAF blend by 2030, well ahead of the regulatory curve.

Despite this progress, the production gap is significant. Only 1 million tonne of SAF were produced globally in 2024 — far short of the 5 million tonne needed by 2030 to meet current blending mandates, signaling a need for major investment and innovation in the next few years.

Why SAF is a game-changer for aviation

Unlike hydrogen or electric aircraft, which are still in early development and not viable for long-haul flights, SAF is compatible with today’s jet engines and airport infrastructure. This drop-in compatibility lets airlines decarbonize without needing to overhaul their fleets. More importantly, SAF can reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, making it one of the most powerful tools available for immediate emissions reductions.

What is SAF?

“Sustainable aviation fuel” is a broad term that refers to nonpetroleum-based jet fuels made from renewable or waste-based feedstocks. SAF is chemically similar to traditional kerosene, which means it can be blended with fossil jet fuel and used in existing aircraft without modifications. The fuels must meet strict ASTM standards to ensure safety and performance.

A look at the four main SAF pathways

The SAF landscape is built around four primary production pathways, each with its own strengths, challenges, and level of commercial readiness:

Bio-oil to SAF

This method uses waste oils, such as used cooking oil and animal fats, or vegetable oils as feedstock. These oils are processed through hydrotreatment and hydrocracking to produce jet fuel in a technology known as hydrotreated esters and fatty acids, or HEFA. Companies like Neste have scaled this technology at biorefineries in Singapore and the Netherlands. While bio-oil to SAF is proven and scalable, its long-term growth is constrained by limited availability of sustainable waste oil feedstock. Regulatory restrictions also prohibit the use of food-based oils in many regions, further tightening supply.

Biomass to SAF

This process converts solid biomass, including forestry residue and agricultural waste, into jet fuel. The most advanced approach involves gasifying the biomass into synthesis gas and converting it through the Fischer-Tropsch process. Another method under development is pyrolysis, which liquefies the biomass into a biocrude that can then be upgraded. Although biomass is an abundant and sustainable feedstock, the technology is still in development. Fulcrum BioEnergy’s demonstration plant in the United States was a step forward but ultimately shut down due to technical complications, highlighting the challenges of scaling this pathway.

Ethanol to SAF

In this process, ethanol is converted into jet fuel through a series of catalytic steps, including dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. LanzaJet is leading the field with a demonstration plant launched in 2024. However, this pathway faces a complex regulatory landscape. In the EU and the U.K., first-generation ethanol made from food crops is not allowed, requiring the use of second-generation cellulosic ethanol instead. Unfortunately, cellulosic ethanol production is still underdeveloped and limited in scale, making this pathway more viable in regions like the U.S. and Brazil where first-generation ethanol is permitted.

CO2 to SAF

Also known as e-fuel, this method involves capturing CO2 from the air or industrial sources and combining it with green hydrogen to create synthetic fuel. The most common technologies use reverse water-gas shift reactions followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or convert CO2 into methanol, which is then refined into jet fuel. While this approach offers abundant and sustainable feedstock, the cost is prohibitively high. Producing SAF from direct air capture of CO2 and electrolysis can be five to six times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Despite this, several companies, including Infinium and Johnson Matthey, are pushing forward with pilot projects.

The benefits of SAF

SAF offers numerous environmental and strategic advantages. It can cut life cycle emissions by up to 80%, helping the aviation industry align with global net-zero targets. SAF can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks, offering regional flexibility. It also enhances energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and opens opportunities for rural economic development through the use of agricultural and forestry residues.

From an operational standpoint, SAF’s compatibility with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure makes it uniquely positioned for near-term deployment. Airlines can adopt SAF without waiting for new aircraft technologies or major infrastructure upgrades.

The challenges of SAF

Despite its promise, SAF faces significant challenges. The most pressing is cost. In a best-case scenario, SAF made from bio-oil still costs about 30% more than fossil jet fuel. Other pathways, such as biomass to jet and e-fuels, can be two to six times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. These price premiums create real financial strain for airlines, especially on long-haul international routes.

Feedstock availability is another concern. HEFA production is constrained by the global supply of waste oil, and advanced feedstocks like cellulosic biomass and CO2 are either expensive or technologically immature. The lack of proven, scalable technology for many SAF pathways further complicates the path to market.

Policy support is also a mixed bag. While mandates help drive demand, they do little to reduce the high cost of production. Without subsidies, tax incentives, or carbon pricing mechanisms, SAF may remain financially out of reach for many airlines.

Looking ahead: Trends shaping the SAF landscape

The next five years will be critical for scaling SAF production. We can expect increased investment in demonstration projects for ethanol, biomass, and CO2-based fuels. As green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies improve, e-fuels may become more cost competitive.

In the U.S., policy flexibility around feedstock use is likely to support the growth of HEFA and ethanol-to-jet fuels. In contrast, the EU’s stricter feedstock regulations and aggressive SAF targets may drive innovation in biomass and CO2-based pathways, albeit at a higher cost.

Corporate partnerships will also shape the future. Oil majors, airlines, and technology developers are increasingly joining forces to de-risk SAF projects and accelerate commercialization. The space is also seeing greater involvement from startups focused on unlocking new feedstocks and improving conversion technologies.",https://luxresearchinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Social-Sharing_Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel_-Technologies-Benefits-and-Challenges.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 20:56:08.127582

U.S. tariffs and geopolitical destabilization have spurred an overdue appetite for industrial policy in Canada. Decades of economic development led by the private sector has created deep vulnerabilities in the Canadian economy, and public leadership will be necessary to reassert independence and ensure long-term prosperity in a rapidly changing world.

It’s an argument well-made in a major new report published by the Transition Accelerator, The Right Move at the Right Time, which calls this a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the Canadian economy. The paper argues that Canada needs a central authority to identify priority sectors and to facilitate coordination between industry and government in those sectors. Crucially, those sectors need to be aligned with a net-zero economy over the long term not only to reduce emissions but also to take advantage of emerging opportunities in a decarbonizing global economy. A separate report from the Transition Accelerator this month, The Productivity Benefits of High-Value, Low-Carbon Investment, highlights mass timber, sustainable aviation fuel and electric vehicles as opportunity areas.

These recommendations generally align with the CCPA’s own work on industrial policy, including the Alternative Federal Budget and our 2022 citizen’s guide to green industrial policy. Our work emphasizes a stronger voice for workers in industrial policy as well as a more grassroots approach to determining industrial priorities, especially at the regional level. We’d like to see more aggressive use of Crown corporations to drive new technologies and markets, and we’d prefer a focus on truly zero-emission industries rather than biofuels and the like. But we fully agree on the core project of leveraging the state to accelerate long-term, strategic industrial development in the public interest.

The new federal government is using much of the same language. The Liberal election platform and the PM’s mandate letter talk about industrial policy priorities, and the government’s signature Building Canada Act is couched in terms of accelerating industrial projects in the “national interest.” Unfortunately, there are several major issues with the government’s approach so far.

First, weakening Indigenous rights and environmental protections, which the Conservative-backed Building Canada Act is designed to do, is clearly not in the public interest, whether or not a project is deemed to be in the “national interest.” Industrial development should be done in service of Indigenous reconciliation, decarbonization and other social and environmental priorities, not in spite of them.

Second, the federal government’s industrial priorities include defence spending and fossil fuel infrastructure, neither of which is consistent with a cleaner and healthier economy. Indeed, they are counterproductive to much of the green industrial work we ought to be doing.

Third, there is a big difference between nation-building projects and a nation-building strategy. One-off initiatives are flashy, but facilitating an industrial transformation takes more systematic and sustained effort. This is a major focus of the Transition Accelerator report. In the absence of a big picture vision—popularized by economist Mariana Mazzucato as a mission-oriented industrial strategy—and a long-term commitment to specific technologies and supply chains, industrial policy efforts are much more likely to fail.

It’s not too late for the federal government to articulate a clear and productive industrial vision—one that is consistent with long-term sustainability and inclusive prosperity. But it’s clear we have a lot of work to do.

Lots of research to dive into this month before the summer lull, so let’s get into it.

Storm surge: this month’s key reads

Landmark report lays the groundwork for Indigenous-led climate policy

Indigenous Climate Action has released Land Back is Climate Policy, the final installment of its ambitious Decolonizing Climate Policy research project. It builds on the findings of a previous report, featured in this newsletter back in 2023, that focused on barriers to Indigenous climate leadership in Canada—especially the role of settler climate policy in perpetuating colonialism.

The new report is a tour de force of good ideas grounded in extensive interviews with Indigenous youth and communities. It documents all of the many ways Indigenous Peoples are already leading on climate policy, and the ways in which Indigenous worldviews can transform climate action for the better.

There is a clear message for Indigenous allies in the climate policy space: stop getting in the way by defending colonial institutions, and start actively supporting Indigenous sovereignty. Self-determination is the central theme of the work, including the necessity of free, prior and informed consent for projects on Indigenous land. It’s precisely the opposite approach to the one being taken by the federal government right now.

Large-scale worker training an essential input for decarbonization

One of the most underappreciated barriers to decarbonizing the Canadian economy is an insufficient skilled workforce. Despite rising unemployment, there are already large skill shortages in some sectors, such as the building trades, that are projected to rise significantly as an aging workforce retires. Canada is on track for more than a million skilled trade job openings in the next decade alone.

A new report from the Pembina Institute, Recruit, Train, Retain, explores these trends and the need for more proactive workforce development to realize Canada’s climate commitments. Our grand infrastructure dreams will grind to a halt without enough skilled workers in every region of the country.

Incidentally, workforce development is a big part of industrial strategy. Coordinating the training pipeline with projected labour needs in strategic sectors is a key role of government. Historically, government training programs have deferred to market demand, but that approach is insufficient in a context where public leadership is driving a particular economic trajectory. Given the long timelines associated with apprenticeships, in particular, we need to start training new workers ten years before they’re needed.

Among the Pembina report’s recommendations is the necessity of increasing public spending on post-secondary institutions. Colleges and universities are being squeezed at precisely the moment we need more capacity, not less.

UK releases business-first industrial strategy

Keeping on with our industrial strategy theme this month, the government of the UK published its much-anticipated Modern Industrial Strategy, which checks many of the boxes described above. It is comprehensive, mission-oriented and consistent with a net-zero economy. Decarbonization is a central theme of the strategy, and the eight industrial priority areas identified in the plan, such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences and the creative industry, are generally consistent with that goal (the main exceptions being the defence industry and carbon capture in the energy industry).

The biggest red flag is the strategy’s capitulation to the private sector. Two of the plan’s four major pillars are explicitly focused on making it easier to do business, in part through deregulation, and creating “enduring partnerships” with business (i.e., P3s). In matters of investment, the plan sets out “a strategic course that allows business to make long-term decisions” with no institutionalized input from communities or workers. And while the plan creates some new public institutions, such as an Industrial Strategy Council, they are mainly relegated to advisory roles.

The published strategy is only the first step for the UK. The government has promised additional sectoral strategies, and it will need to budget for the new spending it has promised or implied. Despite its limitations, this is a useful example for Canada to consider in the development of our own industrial strategy.

Research radar: the latest developments in work and climate

Indigenous-led development a path forward for critical minerals. The Canadian Climate Institute released Critical Path, which explores how Canada can benefit economically from booming demand for critical minerals without compromising on Indigenous rights or environmental protection. It’s a fine line to walk, but I appreciate CCI’s recommendation that Indigenous communities should have ownership stakes and a degree of control over any projects on their territories. The report also emphasizes that trying to rush projects through—like the government is attempting to do with the Building Canada Act—is ultimately counterproductive. Rushed projects attract legal challenges and are prone to costly errors down the line.

Canada’s big bet on LNG a recipe for economic failure. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis finds in a new analysis that the purported economic benefits of liquified natural gas for Canada are likely transient due to growing competition and a looming supply glut. Despite federal and provincial governments banking on LNG as an industry of the future, in the long term these projects will likely worsen affordability, environmental quality and economic stability in their communities.

Federal adaptation plan too weak given rising climate impacts. The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development has found once again that a federal climate plan is too vague and unambitious to meet a major challenge. This time, it is the National Adaptation Strategy that comes under fire for failing to prioritize the greatest climate risks, to allocate sufficient resources or to develop a framework for measuring results. Climate adaptation is vital, but a piecemeal approach won’t insulate us from the growing impacts of extreme weather.

Disadvantaged communities are being cut out of the EV transition. A study published in Nature Communications finds that disadvantaged communities in the U.S.—defined by low socioeconomic status and a high dependence on fossil fuels—have access to half as many electric vehicle charging stations as other communities. It’s not an especially surprising finding given the North American EV market’s focus on luxury vehicles and at-home charging, but it reinforces the risk of transition policies exacerbating inequality.

UK must leave oil in the ground to meet emissions goals… Researchers at University College London published The Climate Implications of New Oil and Gas Fields in the UK, which makes it very clear that the UK cannot develop any additional fossil fuel projects without endangering domestic and global climate commitments. The recognition that most fossil fuels need to go unburned has been established for a long time, but governments around the world continue to entertain expansion plans.

…while scaling up offshore wind in its place. The UK’s Energy Transition Unit published Striking the Balance, which models different scenarios for the future of the UK’s offshore energy workforce. While offshore oil and gas jobs are slated to decline in the coming decades in most scenarios, they can be more than offset through an expansion of offshore wind power. It’s a prime opportunity for a just transition but only if the public sector can mobilize the requisite investment.

Ireland publishes first official just transition report. Kudos to the Just Transition Commission of Ireland for releasing its introductory report this month. This newsletter is a big fan of the Scottish Just Transition Commission, and the new Irish commission has a similar mandate. The initial report focuses on the big picture for Ireland, recommending a comprehensive just transition strategy and the institutional framework necessary to support it. Hopefully, the commission will follow in the footsteps of their Scottish counterparts by engaging directly with workers and communities in future work.

RBC remains the biggest climate villain in the Canadian banking sector. The 2025 edition of the Banking on Climate Chaos report by a coalition of global ENGOs lists RBC as the 8th largest fossil fuel financier in the world, increasing its financing to the fossil fuel industry by US$34.3 billion over last year. Every major Canadian bank is overinvested in fossil fuels relative to its international peers. The report calls out the Coastal GasLink pipeline project, which is being pushed through Wetʼsuwetʼen territory in the face of significant opposition, as a particularly egregious project. Collectively, the global banking sector committed US$429 billion toward fossil fuel expansion projects last year.

Global climate investment falling short by half or more. Speaking of finance, a new report from Oil Change International, Private Fantasies, Public Realities, finds that the world is only spending 38 per cent of what is necessary to achieve a just transition to a net-zero global economy. A similar finding is buried in the International Energy Agency’s latest World Energy Investment report, which concludes that clean energy investment needs to double or triple to meet climate goals. According to OCI, the main issue is deference to the private sector and the hope that the market will voluntarily shift its investment dollars from dirty to clean sectors. The report calls for stronger green industrial policy as a solution.

South Africa a case study in why carbon tariffs work. The Net-Zero Tracker published Carbon Competitiveness, which describes the need for South Africa to decarbonize its exports to meet the demands of the EU and other economies that apply a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to imports. In short, a CBAM applies the domestic carbon price to any good that was produced without facing a carbon price of its own. It’s a smart policy, now being entertained by Canada, to offset the competitiveness concerns of domestic carbon pricing systems. One of the big takeaways from this report, however, is that CBAMs are not only about domestic competitiveness—they also apply helpful pressure on other countries to improve their own climate policies.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-2150627382-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 01:56:11.521129

“You also need to drive the costs of sustainable aviation fuel down,” she explained.
“And that requires subsidies.” Solar fuel is expensive, several times more per gallon than fossil fuel, because, unlike with petroleum, the infrastructure doesn’t exist yet.
So, even though it’s drop-in ready, solar fuel isn’t yet a viable commercial alternative.","The YouTube page of Synhelion has a series of videos that look kind of like a combination of a “Fast and Furious” movie and a Silicon Valley tech ad: cars, boats and motorcycles fueling up and going fast.

In the age of electric vehicles, it looks like something from another era. In fact, watching these videos without sound, one might not even realize that they’re advertising renewable energy.

Synhelion is a Swiss startup that produces so-called “solar fuel,” which is a bit of a misnomer, according to the company’s founder and CEO, Dr. Phillipp Furler. The product isn’t actually sunlight in a tank but a synthetic gas made by combining carbon dioxide and water at super high temperatures generated by solar power. Now, it’s being explored for use as a drop-in-ready alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

“We use solar heat to drive a thermochemical process,” Furler said. “Typically, we go to around 1,200 degrees (2,192 degrees Fahrenheit), and we operate the chemistry at around 900 degrees celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit).”

Furler said the company uses a field of mirrors to harness power from the sun. That power is then transferred to a lab, where a thermochemical process is used to create the synthetic fuel, which can be used in the same way as traditional fossil fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Analysts say it’s an attractive option, because you don’t need to reinvent the wheel and build a new, zero-emission vehicle; you just need to plop in a different kind of gas at the pump.

“[It’s] not just a future hope. [It’s] a present solution,” said Camille Mutrelle, an aviation policy expert for Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based organization that advocates for clean energy transportation.

According to Mutrelle, synthetic fuels like Synhelion’s could play an essential role in decarbonizing the aviation sector, especially on long-haul flights. That’s because, unlike with cars, batteries for airplanes — especially those travelling far — can’t store enough energy. If they were big enough to do that, they’d be too heavy to fly.

“Unlike for short routes, where battery or hydrogen-powered planes might eventually be a viable solution, long-distance aviation simply cannot wait for those technologies to mature,” she said.

Some governing bodies like the EU have set ambitious targets to reduce emissions by incorporating alternatives to traditional jet fuel, including solar, but Mutrelle says that’s not enough.

“You also need to drive the costs of sustainable aviation fuel down,” she explained. “And that requires subsidies.”

Solar fuel is expensive, several times more per gallon than fossil fuel, because, unlike with petroleum, the infrastructure doesn’t exist yet. So, even though it’s drop-in ready, solar fuel isn’t yet a viable commercial alternative. Mutrelle said companies like Synhellion need support in order to scale up and make it cheaper.

“These fuels exist, and now the ball is definitely in the court of governments and whether they can provide the right support for these fuels to take off,” she said.

Synhelion, for its part, isn’t waiting around. Over the past few months the company has been testing its fuel on all sorts of vehicles — and of course, posting flashy videos of their tests online.

The first time you see a rendering of blended wing-body aircraft, you can see the future of aviation taking shape. From the cockpit, the design curves out into a rounded triangle toward the wings, finishing in a trapezoid behind them. The engines pop out of the top like dorsal fins. It’s sleek, aerodynamic. Then you wonder what the inside looks like. Sadly, we don’t have real-life examples of what the flying experience will be like inside the blended wing-body aircraft, but the innovative designs promise more interior room while using less fuel. So, when will we see these planes in the skies?

A New Era in Aircraft Design

If all goes well with aerospace and aviation manufacturer JetZero’s Z4, the first blended wing-body flight could take place in 2027. The U.S. Air Force has invested $235 million in the craft’s development. United has an agreement in place to order up to 100 of the planes, with the option to order 100 more.

“United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,” said Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. “JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

The blended wing-body design can cut fuel consumption in half compared to similarly sized aircraft. The Z4’s engines will be compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel, offering the potential for even more emissions savings.

“If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures. “United Airlines Ventures was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.”

As for that customer travel experience, the blended wing-body design leaves more room for comfortable seating arrangements and a wider door for faster boarding and deplaning. The design will still be compatible with current runway and jetway layouts. With a goal of launching commercial flights in 2030, JetZero plans for the Z4 to be able to carry up to 250 passengers on a 5,000-nautical mile range, good enough for service on transatlantic routes.

Competing for a Cleaner Tomorrow

A little competition could be key to getting blended wing-body aircraft into the skies in the next few years. In addition to its deal with United, JetZero has also reached an agreement with Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab to design the interior of the commercial Z4 and help Delta along on its 2050 net zero goal.

“While Delta is focused on doing what we can today to address our carbon footprint, it’s critical we also work with a variety of partners to advance revolutionary technologies, like JetZero’s BWB aircraft, to solve for a significant portion of future aviation emissions,” Delta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca said.

JetZero’s competition is another Southern California-based aviation company, Natilus, which is developing its Horizon blended wing-body aircraft to carry 200 passengers on intercontinental and transatlantic routes. With emission reductions of 50% and 40% more interior space than tube-and-wing airplanes, Horizon will be able to lower drag and weight, burning less fuel.

“We have about 30% more floor space than a traditional airplane,” Natilus CEO Aleksey Matyushev told CNN. “So, what I think a lot of our customers are thinking about is an elevated passenger experience. Could you bring back the lounge? Are there other spaces in the airplane that you could carve out for those long flights?”

Like JetZero, Natilus also hopes to have commercial blended wing-body aircraft enter service by 2030. Horizon will apply lessons learned from Kona, Natilus’ air freight product, which the company says will be able to carry a payload of 3.8 metric tons over a distance of 900 nautical miles. There are 400 orders for Kona planes, and Natilus hopes to have a model off the ground in 2026.

“There’s a lot of questions about how you build a blended body at full scale, because all we have is wind tunnel data right now and then scale prototypes, but nobody’s actually built one at full scale,” Matyushev told CNN.

The discoveries these aviation innovators make in the next couple of years could go a long way toward shaping the future of flight.",https://thebossmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Group-3073-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 15:56:36.809116

,,2025-07-31 18:02:57+00:00,F&L Asia,UK takes bold lead with 30% SAF co-processing in Jet A-1 fuel - F&L Asia,Vicky Denton,,,,,https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/fli-article/uk-takes-bold-lead-with-30-saf-co-processing-in-jet-a-1-fuel/,"A key driver behind the UK MoD’s move is the UK government’s mandate, announced in 2024, that will require 2% of total UK jet fuel demand to be met with SAF in 2025, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.
As it is structured, the concerns of the UK MoD Aviation Fuel Committee are strictly focused on aviation fuels, including Def Stan 91-091.
The Aviation Fuel Committee within the MoD advises on technical changes, but only government officials can make binding updates.
In the UK, aviation fuel is typically transported directly from refineries to airports in a controlled fashion that preserves blend and source identity.
In the United States, jet fuel often travels through multi-product pipelines where it is commingled with jet fuel from multiple refineries, making traceability and segregation more difficult.","The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has taken a major step forward in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption with a landmark update to its Defence Standard 91-091 (DS91-091)—the nation’s official specification for Jet A-1 fuel used across both military and civilian aircraft.

While ASTM D1655 remains the globally recognised benchmark for conventional jet fuel, the UK’s revised Def Stan introduces a notable divergence. As of May 2025, the standard now allows up to 30% renewable HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) to be co-processed into Jet A-1 fuel, up from the previous 5% cap. This change was spearheaded by a government-industry task force led by Air bp, the aviation division of bp, with input from the MoD, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), fuel producers and major airlines.

The move marks a significant shift in SAF policy, aiming to accelerate decarbonisation across the aviation sector. bp, which is already producing SAF via co-processing, has announced plans to increase its renewable feedstock volumes in line with the new standard.

The promise of co-processing

Co-processing refers to the practice of integrating renewable or waste-derived feedstocks—such as used cooking oil, tallow, and vegetable oils—into conventional fuel production processes. The appeal of co-processing lies in its ability to reduce carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions while leveraging existing refineries and distribution networks. It also provides an efficient route to manage hard-to-recycle waste materials by turning them into high-value, high-quality fuels.

Colonel Pete Skinsley, deputy head of Operations at the UK MoD’s Operational Energy Authority, heralded the change as a significant milestone for the industry. “Co-processing produces high-quality fuel that meets stringent aviation standards, while helping to increase the volume of SAF available to customers,” he says.

A key driver behind the UK MoD’s move is the UK government’s mandate, announced in 2024, that will require 2% of total UK jet fuel demand to be met with SAF in 2025, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK government also introduced a 10% cap on the contribution of HEFA feedstocks to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). RTFO is a government policy that requires suppliers of transport fuel in the UK to ensure that a certain percentage of the fuel they supply comes from renewable and sustainable sources. As of 2025, suppliers must meet an increasing percentage target—set to reach up to 14.6% by energy in 2032.

This move was part of a broader strategy to encourage a more diverse and sustainable range of biofuel feedstocks, reduce over-reliance on HEFA—which is derived from waste oils and fats—and promote investment in advanced, waste-based, and non-food crop feedstocks such as cellulosic materials and e-fuels.

A significant change in concept

UK SAF volumes could technically be achieved through blending synthetic components certified under ASTM D7566 (which is recognised in DS91-091), says George R. Wilson, vice chair of ASTM D02.J, the Aviation Fuel Subcommittee. Wilson is also a member of the UK MoD Aviation Fuel Committee.

ASTM D7566 defines the requirements for blending synthetic fuels with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 to create drop-in aviation fuels that are safe and compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. However, co-processing integrates renewable feedstocks directly into existing fossil fuel refining processes, allowing all resulting Jet A-1 fuel—including the fossil portion—to qualify as renewable under certain regulatory frameworks.

A shift from 5% to 30% co-processing is a significant change in concept, says Wilson. The 5% limit fits within standard refinery operations, requiring no substantial modification. A 30% approach demands process adjustments to ensure a meaningful share of renewable content enters the jet fuel. Altering the process that generates jet kerosene can have potential effects on the production of lighter ends (such as gasoline) and heavier distillates (like diesel fuel), he says.

ASTM ballot to increase co-processing ballot fails

While ASTM D7566 governs the certification of SAF produced via dedicated synthetic pathways, co-processing is addressed under ASTM D1655. D1655 and DS 91-091 are traditionally harmonised. However, a recent ASTM ballot to increase the approved level of co-processing in Annex 1 from 5% to 30% failed within D02.J. The effort was led by an ASTM task force, which included industry stakeholders such as Air bp. Following the failed ballot, both the task force chair and vice chair resigned. As a result, the task force is currently in stasis.

Aviation is the most conservative sector when it comes to fuels — and with good reason. Innovation is welcomed, but only when it poses no operational risk. According to Wilson, the broader liquid fuel products community raised many questions, with the most significant being the lack of supporting data. The general sentiment is that there isn’t enough diverse data to make a broader case that this approach won’t negatively impact other fuels. Wilson noted that the lack of data may be overcome if, indeed, UK refiners start boosting the content of HEFA.

ASTM vs UK Def Stan standards

One of the fundamental differences between ASTM and Def Stan lies in their governance. ASTM is a voluntary, consensus-based standards body. The Aviation Fuel Subcommittee includes a balanced membership of users, producers and general interest parties. Any approved measure must be ratified by the overarching D02 Committee on Petroleum Products, Liquid Fuels, and Lubricants.

In contrast, Def Stan is a government-mandated specification, developed and enforced by the UK MoD. Final decisions rest with His Majesty’s Government. As it is structured, the concerns of the UK MoD Aviation Fuel Committee are strictly focused on aviation fuels, including Def Stan 91-091. The Aviation Fuel Committee within the MoD advises on technical changes, but only government officials can make binding updates. If there is input from non-aviation sources, it happens at the government level. The tension between the two specifications is driven by their different natures, says Wilson.

Another key difference between the specifications lies in how their home markets operate. In the UK, aviation fuel is typically transported directly from refineries to airports in a controlled fashion that preserves blend and source identity. In the United States, jet fuel often travels through multi-product pipelines where it is commingled with jet fuel from multiple refineries, making traceability and segregation more difficult. The same pipelines also carry automotive gasoline and diesel fuels separated only by the physics of the process. This method is called batching or sequential batch transport. For example, the UK specification was able to identify a single synthetic fuel manufacturer, Sasol, which would have been impossible for ASTM, says Wilson.

Ongoing efforts to broaden SAF integration

Although ASTM Subcommittee D02.J rejected the proposal to allow 30% co-processing, efforts to broaden SAF integration are ongoing. A parallel initiative—designated WK94882—aims to revise D1655 to permit generic co-processing of multiple non-conventional feedstocks at levels up to 5%, with a combined maximum of 10%. While synthetic fuels such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids – synthetic paraffinic kerosene (HEFA-SPK) and Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) have undergone extensive testing over several years, co-processing novel or mixed feedstocks introduces new challenges. The proposal seeks to establish a framework that would allow any hydrocarbon source — up to 5% volume via a suitable hydroprocessed pathway — to be safely incorporated.

The first ballot on WK94882 was conducted at the subcommittee level. While it passed statistically, Wilson noted that there were too many negatives to reach consensus without additional data. He again reiterated the scrutiny coming from other liquid fuel sectors—such as gasoline and diesel fuel producers—who want to ensure that any controls introduced to guarantee a clean, usable jet fuel product will also safeguard the integrity of their fuels.

Despite these challenges, Wilson remains optimistic. He believes that if UK refiners move forward with producing Jet A-1 with 30% co-processing under Def Stan 91-091, the resulting operational data could build the case needed to revisit ASTM’s position. Over time, with additional data, both the 30% HEFA approach and more flexible co-processing proposals could be adopted under ASTM D1655, he believes.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2-UK-takes-bold-lead-with-30-SAF-co-processing-in-Jet-A-1-fuel.webp,N,,2025-07-31 17:56:41.351387

Airlines receiving support will be reimbursed for the price gap between SAF and fossil fuel and for related airport costs.
The scheme will be valid until the end of 2027 and is also the first EU-approved aviation fuel subsidy to apply these specific safeguards.","The European Commission gave Denmark €36 million to subsidise more climate-friendly fuel in domestic aviation.

This was the first time the EC had released state aid for such a project. The goal is to help airlines use jet fuel made from waste, such as used cooking oil or animal fat, instead of fossil oil. The fuel emits less carbon, but it costs far more.

The announcement came as air travel has rebounded across Europe. Passenger numbers were expected to keep rising, with global air travel projected to double by 2050, Bloomberg reported July 21.

The international airline association IATA expected air travel to grow by 6 per cent this year, while sustainable fuels still accounted for less than 1 per cent of global supply.

Even IAG, parent company of British Airways and a world leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use, relied on fossil fuel for more than 98 per cent of its flights last year.

Unlike road transport, aviation has largely avoided restrictions. There are no EU-wide taxes on kerosene, no passenger caps and no direct limits on flights.

Instead, the EU is banking on a shift to SAF and Denmark has become the bloc’s first test case.

SAF is not one single fuel but is chemically close enough to fossil kerosene to be used in standard aircraft without engine modification.

The Danish scheme will support one or more domestic routes flying with at least 40 per cent SAF — near the technical limit of 50 per cent.

Under current EU law, only a 2 per cent SAF blend is required this year. Airlines receiving support will be reimbursed for the price gap between SAF and fossil fuel and for related airport costs.

Grants will be paid monthly and awarded through competitive bidding. At least 20 commercial one-way flights per week will be supported. The goal is to cut emissions without cutting flights.

The EC said on July 19 that the scheme complied with EU state aid rules and was the first of its kind to go beyond existing fuel mandates.

According to the EC’s Executive Vice-President for a Clean, Just and Competitive Transition Teresa Ribera, the Danish plan “paves the way for more sustainable aviation by going beyond what the EU currently requires”.

The UK has launched a similar SAF subsidy programme, distributing £198 million (€229 million) to date.

The production of SAF remains far below the levels needed, though. On July 16, IATA’s director-general warned the EU targets were unlikely to be met. “I struggle to see how we will have sufficient sustainable aviation fuel available,” Willie Walsh said, adding that airlines were sourcing SAF from outside the EU just to comply — even if that meant shipping waste oil from overseas, AFP reported.

The fuel’s limited supply reflected a deeper problem. Most SAF today comes from waste, specifically from oils and fats left over from cooking or food production. These are attractive to regulators because they don’t require farmland and are considered more sustainable. But their supply is tied to the volume of food and animal waste generated in the first place.

According to the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook published on July 15, these waste oils are “not unlimited resources” and are already in competition with other industries, such as animal feed and chemicals. Their availability depended on how much waste was generated, not how much fuel was needed.

First-generation biofuels made from crops such as corn or palm oil were still far more common but carried higher carbon emissions.

The EU is phasing out palm oil-based fuels by 2030. In most high-income countries, biofuel growth was already slowing due to weaker policy support and the rise of electric vehicles.

Global use is expected to grow by just 0.9 per cent annually over the next decade.

SAF is now seen as the only viable way to decarbonise aviation in the medium term. But it costs two to five times more than fossil kerosene and IATA estimates that only 7 per cent of jet fuel will come from SAF by 2050 — far short of its own net-zero targets.

In response, governments have been pushing new mandates and subsidies although not all of them align.

In the United States, the latest bill signed by US President Donald Trump earlier this year removed federal incentives for SAF made from foreign feedstocks. These included used cooking oil from China and animal tallow from Brazil.

The decision came as part of a broader package aimed at promoting domestic energy production and cutting imports, the same logic behind Trump’s tariffs on steel, solar panels and batteries.

But the two approaches now appeared at odds. The tariff strategy was sold as a way to “make others pay” but in the case of SAF, observers reported it made the US pay instead.

Airlines must still meet their fuel targets but were now limited to using domestic feedstocks, which are more expensive and in shorter supply.

“Let’s not have the American taxpayer help you do that,” said Ed Prosser of agricultural trader Scoular, referring to importers of foreign biofuel, Bloomberg reported July 1.

The industry has pushed back, though. A major US oil group told Congress that the new SAF restrictions, combined with broader biofuel blending mandates, could raise compliance costs to $70 billion per year, 10 times the government’s own estimate, Bloomberg reported July 29.

The group also warned that tariffs on imported feedstocks were putting existing refinery investments at risk.

The Danish programme, by contrast, uses public funds to close the price gap and enforces safeguards against double subsidies.

The aid excludes SAF that already receives support under other EU schemes or from third countries.

The scheme will be valid until the end of 2027 and is also the first EU-approved aviation fuel subsidy to apply these specific safeguards.",https://brusselssignal.eu/content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-31-at-15.33.15.jpeg,N,,2025-07-31 15:56:45.091623

Yet, by 2025, the company has embarked on a strategic rebound that blends operational discipline, geopolitical tailwinds, and a recalibrated business model. For value-oriented investors, this confluence of factors presents a compelling case to reassess Boeing's undervalued potential.

The Operational Turnaround: From Bleeding Cash to Cash Flow Catalyst

Boeing's financial recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. After a $14.31 billion cash outflow in 2024, the company nearly halted its bleeding by Q2 2025, driven by CEO Kelly Ortberg's aggressive cost-cutting and production ramp-up. Revenue surged 35% year-over-year to $22.75 billion, with commercial airplane sales jumping 81% to $10.87 billion. The 737 MAX production rate hit 38 units per month by May 2025, with a target of 42 units by Q3—a critical threshold for hitting the company's $10 billion free cash flow goal this year.

However, Boeing's path is not without hurdles. The $87.5 billion inventory and $545 billion order backlog require sustained production increases, while bottlenecks in 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 certification linger until 2026. Still, the operational metrics are undeniably improving.

Trump's Trade Diplomacy: Shielding the Supply Chain and Expanding Market Access

The Trump administration's trade policies have played a dual role in Boeing's recovery. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has been a lifeline, preserving duty-free access to critical components from Canada and Mexico. This shielded Boeing from the broader tariff wars that disrupted global supply chains, allowing the company to maintain cost efficiency for its 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX.

Conversely, Trump's 10% tariffs on parts from Japan, Italy, and China initially raised production costs, prompting Boeing to absorb some expenses to avoid passing them to customers. Yet, the administration's enforcement shift—prioritizing corporate leniency—proved even more impactful. By negotiating a reduced $1.2 billion settlement (down from $2.5 billion) for the 737 MAX crisis, the Trump-era DOJ avoided a felony conviction that would have imposed long-term federal oversight, preserving Boeing's operational autonomy.

Strategic Diversification: Defense, Space, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Boeing's pivot to defense, space, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a long-term play to reduce reliance on volatile commercial aviation cycles. The defense and space unit turned a $913 million loss in Q2 2024 into an $110 million profit by Q2 2025, driven by a $12 billion satellite communications acquisition. Meanwhile, the company's commitment to SAF-capable aircraft by 2030 aligns with global ESG trends, though the capital intensity of these ventures remains a risk.

The defense sector's high margins and government contract stability offer a buffer against commercial aviation headwinds. However, investors must weigh Boeing's $87.5 billion inventory and $15 billion capital raise (including $10 billion in new shares) against the potential rewards of these bets.

Valuation and Risk: A Calculated Bet in a Turbulent Era

Boeing's stock has traded at a discount to its intrinsic value, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.5 as of July 2025, compared to an industry average of 12. The company's free cash flow projections and improving order backlog (625 net orders in H1 2025) suggest undervaluation, especially when paired with its strategic diversification.

Yet, risks persist. The 3,200-worker labor dispute at its defense unit and ongoing FAA scrutiny of production safety could disrupt momentum. Additionally, Trump's trade policies, while beneficial now, may shift under a Biden administration in 2028, introducing regulatory uncertainty.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for the Patient and Strategic

Boeing's recovery is a tale of two forces: operational rigor and geopolitical tailwinds. The company's production ramp-up and cost discipline are laying the groundwork for sustained cash flow, while Trump's trade policies have insulated it from the worst of global supply chain chaos. For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, Boeing represents a buy opportunity at current levels, provided they are prepared to monitor labor, regulatory, and geopolitical risks.

The key question is whether Boeing can maintain its production cadence and leverage its defense/space growth to offset commercial aviation volatility. Given the company's $545 billion order backlog and improving financial metrics, the odds are tilting in favor of a sustained rebound.

Historically, a simple buy-and-hold strategy around Boeing's earnings release dates has shown a positive average return of 0.73% over three days, with a 10-day win rate of 53.33%. This suggests that patience and discipline in holding through earnings cycles could enhance long-term returns.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-31 11:56:36.528672

For airlines, fuel efficiency allows them to save money on the bottom line by conserving fuel, but the subsequent increased aircraft range also allows airlines to offer a wider range of long-distance routes to their customers. To keep up with these market pressures, engine manufacturers have been in an arms race to produce the most efficient engine possible.

Rolls-Royce has arguably led the pack in this regard with the Trent XWB engine, the power plant of the Airbus A350, which is considered to be one of the most efficient commercial airliners on the market today. The bad news for General Electric (GE), the engine manufacturer and Rolls-Royce competitor, is that Rolls-Royce is close to unleashing a new highly efficient turbofan, which features great sustainability and efficiency selling points, but is also the biggest and most flexible yet. Meet the UltraFan, 'the ultimate turbofan'.

The UltraFan Is Larger Than The Biggest GE Turbofan

One of the important aspects in determining the efficiency of a turbofan engine is its size, and in this case, bigger is better. A bigger engine can suck in more air, and as explained in more detail by the Pilot Institute, accelerating a larger mass of air by a smaller amount is more efficient than accelerating a smaller mass by a larger amount. Therefore, the UltraFan, also known as the UF001 engine, with its 140-inch fan diameter, according to Rolls-Royce, is likely to be highly efficient due to its fan diameter.

The closest competing turbofan from GE Aviation is the GE9X, with a fan diameter of 134 inches. The GE9X is the power plant for the as-yet unreleased Boeing 777X, and was derived from the General Electric GE90. It has a larger fan, advanced materials like ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), and higher bypass and compression ratios than the GE90. The GE9X was designed to have increased fuel efficiency by 10% compared to its predecessor.

However, the UltraFan offers a 25% fuel burn improvement over the Trent 700, a first-generation Trent turbofan, and is being designed for a 15:1 bypass ratio and 70:1 overall pressure ratio, according to Aviation Week. Compared to the GE9X, which offers a 10:1 bypass ratio and 60:1 overall pressure ratio, the UltraFan is starting to look like it will outperform the GE9X, at least in terms of efficiency through air volume moved.

Could The UltraFan Be The World's Most Flexible Turbofan?

Another worrying factor for competing manufacturers is the flexibility the UltraFan promises. Thanks to systems like its gear mechanism and variable pitch fan design, the engine is capable of running at optimum revolutions per minute relative to its airspeed. These eliminate the need for a thrust reverser, which is used to slow aircraft for landings, and also facilitate low-pressure ratio fan operability. According to Rolls-Royce:

""UltraFan also features a new geared architecture (introduced between the fan and intermediate pressure compressor), ensuring the fan runs at optimum speed, as does the engine compressor and turbine thanks to the core architecture. The carbon titanium fan system is further developed to allow the removal of the thrust reverser, enabling a truly slim-line nacelle system.""

The planetary gearbox has five planet gears and is sized to power the engines at 25,000 to 110,000 pounds of thrust. According to Flight Global, the design will result in two UltraFan variations, the UltraFan 30 and UltraFan 80, the former being suitable for narrowbody single-aisle aircraft. According to Alan Newby, director of research and technology, the fan for this smaller variant “will be bigger than current narrowbody engines [...] pushing towards 90 inches”. This flexibility appears to be a core aim of the project:

“What we are trying to do now is to develop an integrated development programme that features both small and large assets.”

In recent years, the trend in the aviation market is towards lighter, more efficient narrowbody aircraft, as increased efficiency has allowed these aircraft to link airport pairs previously only flyable by longer-range widebodies. This was recently seen with the A321XLR, which launched at the June 2019 Paris Air Show, with a range of 4,700 nautical miles, 1,200 nautical miles longer than the baseline A321neo.

The UltraFan Has Minimal Environmental Impact

One of the aspects that makes the UltraFan such a groundbreaking engine is its environmentally friendly features, and the engine looks poised to steer the commercial aviation industry in a much more sustainable direction. With no modifications, the UltraFan will reach the market, being compatible with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to WECB, this will reduce the carbon footprint of the engine by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to engines that use traditional jet fuel.

Rolls-Royce is also actively exploring hybrid-electric and hydrogen solutions for the engine, which promise a substantial reduction in emissions for the future of the industry. The first test run of the engine is planned to take place later this year, using 100% SAF. Rolls-Royce also plans to make the engine compatible with existing models, thus it may make aircraft already in service much more efficient if retrofitted.

""There is also potential to transfer technologies from UltraFan to current inservice engines to provide even greater fuel efficiency and reductions in emissions.""

""The engine will then go on test at the new engine test facility, Testbed 80, in Derby UK later this year. [...] The first run will be on 100 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel.""

Impressively, the engine also offers a 40% improvement in NOx emissions, which is sure to keep emissions bodies such as the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) happy. As a consequence of all this increased efficiency through good design and high-bypass ratio, the noise level of the engine is also reduced by 35%, which is good news for passengers hoping for a quiet flight.

How Is Development Going?

According to Aviation Week, Rolls-Royce unveiled its plans for the UltraFan in January 2014. The plan formally introduced composite fan blades, a first for this class of engine, and featured geared turbofan technology for the first time. The potential for open-rotor derivatives was also being considered. Using titanium aluminide blades, the 75 MW (100,000 hp) UltraFan gearbox was first run in October 2016 in partnership with Liebherr, a German-Swiss manufacturer.

By July 2018, the UltraFan configuration was frozen with titanium leading edges on blades, and 2021 was penciled in for ground tests. By early 2019, the engine had amassed over 250 hours of run time, and in the same year, Rolls-Royce withdrew the geared-propulsion concept from Boeing’s new mid-market airplane (NMA) engine competition, according to Aerospace Testing International.

By February 2020, Rolls-Royce had begun manufacturing carbon fiber fan blades in Bristol, England, which saved weight of up to 1,500 lb on a twin-jet. In May 2023, the first test run was made using a demonstrator engine configured for 80,000 pounds of thrust and a 14:1 bypass ratio, using carbon-titanium fan blades. By 2025, the 15:1 bypass ratio had been achieved, and desired power ratings exceeded. According to FlightGlobal, Rolls-Royce plans to have ground tests of the UltraFan 30 and UltraFan 80 by 2028, and flight tests before 2030.

Could The UltraFan Be Too Big?

Thankfully, Rolls-Royce is largely solving this problem, thanks to its plan to introduce two variants of the UltraFan engine. However, there will be some limitations, even with the smaller variant, as the UltraFan 30 will have a fan diameter nearing 90 inches compared to the 81-inch fan diameter of the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G, which is used for popular narrow-body airliners such as the Airbus A220, Airbus A320neo family, and Embraer E-Jet E2.

There is some speculation, such as with Aviation Week, that with the introduction of these largest-in-class engines, a gull-wing design could start to be seen in the commercial aviation industry in order to accommodate this new generation of turbofans. As seen above, a gull-wing is characterized as an aircraft wing shape featuring a prominent bend in the wing's inner section towards the root.

As seen in the Aviation Week article, Rolls-Royce ran a Boeing 747 as a test-bed, and the UltraFan looks almost comically huge next to the existing 747's engines. This illustrates just how much engine size has been prioritized since the 747 was designed.

The UltraFan Will Do More With Less

Interestingly, the UltraFan does not have the highest thrust ratings out there. According to WDB Group, a company that manufactures parts for the project, the UltraFan is aiming for a thrust range of 25,000 to 100,000lb, while current Trent engines have a thrust range of 68,000 to 115,000lb. However, in terms of efficiency, there will be no comparison, particularly if Hydrogen-based propulsion gets off the ground, which is a very exciting prospect.

The reason this engine will be so important will be the intelligence of its design. Aside from the efficiency benefits, there are also improvements on the logistics side, as the UltraFan is much more modular than current Trent engines, allowing maintenance crews to easily repair or replace parts, ultimately reducing costs for the end customer. Overall, the engine gives GE and other competitors many reasons to worry, as even impressive engines like the GE9X look old-fashioned in comparison. It probably helps that the fan blades are green, too.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/geworried.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 11:57:07.314119

Things are taking off—literally—when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and the University of Sheffield is leading the charge. Backed by a £1.5 million grant from the UK Department for Transport, Sheffield has launched the NextGen-SAF project, aiming to make green aviation fuel not just possible, but practical, scalable, and actually carbon-neutral. Housed in the university’s Energy Innovation Centre, this isn’t another science fair project—it’s a bold effort to reinvent how we power the skies.

The Real Kicker: Power-to-Liquid Tech

The magic behind all this? A game-changing process known as Power to Liquid (PtL). Instead of relying on old-school sources like used cooking oil or plant waste, PtL uses something much cleaner and simpler: just renewable electricity, water, and CO₂. Seriously—that’s it.

Here’s the step-by-step: electricity from solar or wind splits water into hydrogen. At the same time, carbon dioxide—captured either straight from the air or off the back of a smokestack—is introduced into the mix. Then comes the heart of the process: an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch reactor that fuses it all into synthetic hydrocarbons. Those hydrocarbons are refined into jet-grade fuel. It all comes together in one streamlined demo plant based right in Sheffield, once famous for steel, now making a name for itself in clean tech innovation.

Real-World Team, Real-World Impact

This isn’t just a university pipedream—it’s a true collaboration between academia, the private sector, and government. The team includes heavy hitters like Fuel Cell Energy (they know hydrogen and carbon capture inside out), Drax (a renewable energy leader), Green Lizard Technologies (process innovation pros), and Leeds Bradford Airport (who bring real airport know-how). Throw in support from Airbus, Boeing, and Qatar Airways, plus a thumbs-up from UK Aviation Minister Mike Kane, and it’s clear this thing has serious momentum.

Let’s not forget—Sheffield played a pivotal role in the world’s first 100% SAF-powered transatlantic flight through the Flight100 project. So yeah, this city knows what it’s doing.

Kicking Old-School SAF Challenges to the Curb

Traditional SAF options? They’ve been bogged down by limited supplies of feedstocks like fryer grease and plant scraps. It’s a clever idea, but not exactly future-proof. PtL sidesteps all of that by using resources we’ve got in abundance: water, CO₂, and sunshine (or wind, if you’re in the UK). That means a cleaner, more scalable SAF supply that’s less tied to complex logistics—and more resilient to global hiccups.

With the UK chasing its net-zero target by 2050, this tech couldn’t be coming at a better time. Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to clean up, but PtL could be the missing link that finally cracks the code.

Collateral Wins: Jobs, Economy, and Energy Security

This isn’t just about flying cleaner—it’s about powering up the UK economy in the process. The project’s expected to deliver high-skilled green jobs, boost energy independence, and cement Sheffield as a global hub for industrial decarbonisation. It’s part of a wider £63 million green aviation investment spread across 17 projects—though Sheffield’s bid is already turning heads thanks to its ready-to-go infrastructure and serious know-how.

And the UK SAF Clearing House, also based at the University of Sheffield, will speed up certification and regulation processes. That means less red tape and more aircraft actually running on the stuff—not just in theory, but in practice.

What’s Next?

The pilot facility is scheduled to switch on in July 2025, and that’ll be the real test. If it performs like the team expects, it could become the template for similar projects—both across the UK and around the globe. The model is clear and repeatable, which opens the door to fast, widespread adoption.

Bottom Line?

This isn’t just a cool lab experiment—it’s a serious leap toward the future of flying. By pulling together clean energy, cutting-edge tech, and a rock-solid team of experts, the NextGen-SAF project hits multiple goals at once: carbon reduction, job creation, and energy security.

With a $100 million U.S. Department of Energy grant backing the project and access to GranBio's proprietary AVAP® and Celer2L™ technologies, RYAM is positioning itself to capitalize on a market poised for exponential growth. But this is more than a bet on biofuels—it's a strategic pivot into a sector where regulatory tailwinds, ESG-driven demand, and technological scalability are aligning to create long-term value.

The Strategic Logic of RYAM's Move

RYAM, a global leader in cellulose-based materials, has long operated in commodity-driven markets with cyclical demand. By entering the SAF arena, the company is leveraging its core competencies—access to lignocellulosic feedstock, logistics infrastructure, and technical expertise—to diversify into a high-margin, high-growth niche. The Jesup site, already optimized for biomass processing, eliminates the need for costly greenfield construction. Instead, RYAM is repurposing existing assets to produce a product with a clear offtake path and a carbon footprint that aligns with global climate targets.

GranBio's AVAP® technology, which converts non-food biomass into fermentable sugars, and its Celer2L™ yeast, which enhances ethanol yields, are critical to the project's scalability. These innovations address a key bottleneck in second-generation biofuels: the economic viability of lignocellulosic feedstock. If successful, the partnership could serve as a blueprint for replicating SAF production in other RYAM facilities, transforming the company from a materials supplier into a renewable energy player.

Market Dynamics: A $15.85 Billion Opportunity by 2030

The SAF market is on a hyperbolic growth trajectory. At a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57.5%, it is expected to expand from $1.63 billion in 2025 to $15.85 billion by 2030. This surge is driven by regulatory mandates, such as the U.S. Sustainable Skies Act, the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative (which mandates 70% SAF blending by 2050), and APAC's aggressive SAF targets. Airlines, under pressure from consumers and governments, are locking in long-term supply agreements, creating a stable demand environment for producers like RYAM and GranBio.

RYAM's entry into this space is not without risks. SAF production currently costs 3–5 times more than conventional jet fuel, a gap that must narrow for widespread adoption. However, the project's $100 million grant and access to DOE-funded R&D programs could accelerate cost reductions. Additionally, RYAM's existing infrastructure reduces capital expenditures, while GranBio's patented technologies offer a defensible competitive edge.

ESG Alignment and Long-Term Value Creation

The environmental and governance implications of this partnership are equally compelling. SAF produced via lignocellulosic biomass has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuels. For RYAM, a company historically associated with forestry and pulp production, this pivot signals a commitment to circular economy principles—transforming waste streams into high-value products while preserving forest ecosystems.

From an investment perspective, ESG alignment is no longer a peripheral consideration. Institutional investors are increasingly prioritizing carbon-intensity metrics, and companies that demonstrate progress toward net-zero goals are seeing valuation premiums. RYAM's SAF initiative could enhance its appeal to ESG-focused funds while insulating it from potential regulatory risks in carbon-intensive sectors.

Risks and Considerations

While the partnership is promising, several factors could impact its success. The due diligence process, expected to conclude later in 2025, will test the technical and financial feasibility of scaling GranBio's technology. Additionally, the SAF market remains concentrated among a few producers, with Neste and LanzaJet dominating early contracts. RYAM and GranBio will need to secure offtake agreements quickly to gain market share.

Investment Implications

For investors, RYAM's SAF venture represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector with structural growth. The company's existing revenue base ($1.6 billion in 2024) provides a financial buffer to absorb R&D costs, while its technical expertise and infrastructure reduce execution risks. If the project secures commercial production by 2026, RYAM could see a material uplift in earnings and a re-rating of its valuation.

However, patience will be required. SAF is a capital-intensive, long-lead-time industry, and meaningful cash flows may not materialize until the late 2020s. Investors should monitor key milestones: the completion of due diligence, the licensing of GranBio's technologies, and the securing of offtake partners.

Conclusion: A Catalyst for Transformation

RYAM's partnership with GranBio is more than a diversification play—it's a strategic repositioning into a sector where demand is being driven by regulatory force, corporate responsibility, and technological innovation. By combining its industrial assets with GranBio's cutting-edge biotechnology, RYAM is not just entering the SAF market; it's building a bridge between traditional forestry and the future of sustainable energy. For investors willing to navigate the early-stage risks, this could be a rare opportunity to participate in a decarbonization story with real-world impact and financial scalability.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-31 11:57:47.912460

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 31, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM) (the ""Company"" or ""RYAM""), the global leader in cellulose specialty products, announced today the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with GranBio LLC, a pioneer in biochemicals and biofuels, to jointly explore the development of a small-scale commercial cellulosic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility co-located at RYAM’s Jesup, Georgia site.

Under the agreement, GranBio will lead the proposed project to deploy its proprietary AVAP® technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass into second-generation ethanol, which will be upgraded into SAF for sale to an offtaker. The new facility would leverage RYAM’s infrastructure at the Jesup plant, including feedstock, utilities, and logistics. The project will be partially financed through GranBio’s $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.

In addition to advancing its strategic goal of maximizing value from existing assets, should the project proceed, RYAM would receive a license to GranBio’s latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP® technologies for ethanol and sugar production at its own facility, in partnership with GranBio - a meaningful step in diversifying into high-growth biofuel and biochemical markets.

""This MoU aligns with our strategy to unlock new value from our core assets and expand into renewable markets where our infrastructure and technical capabilities create a competitive advantage,"" said De Lyle Bloomquist, President and CEO of RYAM. ""GranBio brings world-class technology to this partnership, and together we’re exploring practical, scalable solutions to help decarbonize global aviation fuel markets.""

""I am very pleased to strengthen our collaboration with RYAM and work toward our joint goal of developing clean energy solutions, while improving the communities in which we work,"" said Luiz Oliveira, CEO of GranBio. ""At Jesup, we will leverage our complementary capabilities in the development of a cost-effective, scalable solution for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.""

This first-of-its-kind project marks a major milestone in GranBio’s strategic goal of systematically scaling up SAF production, with strong potential for replication.

The due diligence is expected to conclude later this year, at which point both parties will determine next steps. The MoU underscores both companies’ commitment to sustainability, innovation, and the development of next-generation biomaterials and fuels.

In addition to SAF, the company said a significant volume of renewable diesel (HVO) was also produced.
“Processing biogenic feedstock within existing infrastructure is one of the most efficient ways to decarbonise refinery operations and increase the share of renewables in the transport sector,” said Ivica Jerbić, director of Development at INA.
Due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties, preparation for the pilot project took eight months.
Although INA’s core markets are Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the company is also active in Slovenia, Serbia, Albania, Hungary and the Mediterranean.","The pilot project was part of the company’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and align with European renewable energy regulations, INA said on 16 July.

In addition to SAF, the company said a significant volume of renewable diesel (HVO) was also produced.

Conducted in May in cooperation with the unit’s licensor, Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the pilot’s aim was to test the co-processing of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) with fossil feedstocks.

During the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were processed and the process was certified by independent auditor Bureau Veritas, in line with the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard for sustainable biofuels.

“Processing biogenic feedstock within existing infrastructure is one of the most efficient ways to decarbonise refinery operations and increase the share of renewables in the transport sector,” said Ivica Jerbić, director of Development at INA.

Due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties, preparation for the pilot project took eight months.

The project involved the procurement of specialised filters and the adaption of laboratory methods to increase the capacities of the hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units and ensure controlled handling of the biogenic feedstock within existing operating conditions, the company said.

More than 400 samples were collected during the test run and then sent for analysis at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14) analysis was conducted by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt in Debrecen.

“This pilot project has created the foundation for further activities and the introduction of continuous biogenic feedstock processing at the Rijeka Refinery in the near future,” said Goran Pleše, operating director of refining and marketing at INA.

INA said it planned to offer a continuous supply of SAF to the market by 2029 in line with the European Union (EU)’s target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing the share of renewable energy sources in transport.

By 2030, EU member states would be required to ensure an appropriate share of renewables in the transport sector, with a particular focus on advanced biofuels and SAF.

The main activities of INA and its subsidiaries (the INA Group) include: oil and gas exploration in Croatia and overseas; petroleum oil processing and the production of oil derivatives at refineries in Rijeka (Urinj) and Sisak, where fuel production is located, and Zagreb, where lubricants are produced; the sales of oil derivatives and other products through a network of more than 500 service stations in Croatia and neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Montenegro; and trading in crude oil and oil derivatives.

In February, Air Products withdrew from three projects: the World Energy sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) expansion, the Massena green hydrogen project in New York, and a Texas-based carbon monoxide facility.

Operating margin of 29.7% decreased 200 basis points, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through.

Asia sales of $810m increased 3% from the prior year. Operating income of $217m increased 8%. Operating margin of 26.8% increased 150 basis points from the prior year, as favourable costs, driven by productivity improvements and lower maintenance were partially offset by lower helium pricing.

Europe sales of $771m increased 11% from the prior year on 5% favourable currency, 3% higher volumes, 2% higher pricing, and 1% higher energy cost pass-through.

Operating income of $225m increased 10% from the prior year,

The operating margin of 29.2% decreased 30 basis points from the prior year.

Middle East and India equity affiliates’ income of $86m decreased by 4% from the prior year, driven by an affiliate in Saudi Arabia.

(NYSE: RYAM) (the “Company” or “RYAM”), the global leader in cellulose specialty products, announced today the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with GranBio LLC, a pioneer in biochemicals and biofuels, to jointly explore the development of a small-scale commercial cellulosic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility co-located at RYAM’s Jesup, Georgia site.

Under the agreement, GranBio will lead the proposed project to deploy its proprietary AVAP® technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass into second-generation ethanol, which will be upgraded into SAF for sale to an offtaker. The new facility would leverage RYAM’s infrastructure at the Jesup plant, including feedstock, utilities, and logistics. The project will be partially financed through GranBio’s $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.

In addition to advancing its strategic goal of maximizing value from existing assets, should the project proceed, RYAM would receive a license to GranBio’s latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP® technologies for ethanol and sugar production at its own facility, in partnership with GranBio - a meaningful step in diversifying into high-growth biofuel and biochemical markets.

“This MoU aligns with our strategy to unlock new value from our core assets and expand into renewable markets where our infrastructure and technical capabilities create a competitive advantage,” said De Lyle Bloomquist, President and CEO of RYAM. “GranBio brings world-class technology to this partnership, and together we’re exploring practical, scalable solutions to help decarbonize global aviation fuel markets.”

“I am very pleased to strengthen our collaboration with RYAM and work toward our joint goal of developing clean energy solutions, while improving the communities in which we work,” said Luiz Oliveira, CEO of GranBio. “At Jesup, we will leverage our complementary capabilities in the development of a cost-effective, scalable solution for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.”

This first-of-its-kind project marks a major milestone in GranBio’s strategic goal of systematically scaling up SAF production, with strong potential for replication.

The due diligence is expected to conclude later this year, at which point both parties will determine next steps. The MoU underscores both companies’ commitment to sustainability, innovation, and the development of next-generation biomaterials and fuels.

Once reserved for Hollywood blockbusters, new electric vertical flight technology represents a generational opportunity to revolutionise air travel. While the entire aerospace sector is focused on decarbonising, a whole new class of aviation is fast emerging to deliver zero-carbon flight in the near term.

Electric Vertical Take off and Landing (eVTOL) technology is developing at speed, with the UK well placed to play a leading role in demonstrating and commercializing zero-emissions flight. Amidst a shifting commercial landscape across Europe, the UK now likely remains the only European country capable of bringing a product to market in the near term.

That offers a huge opportunity for the UK to champion and scale new vertical flight technology, supporting thousands of jobs across the UK and contributing towards the UK Government’s core missions to grow the economy and boost regional connectivity.

Estimates from PwC suggest that Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) could bring more than £2 billion worth of socioeconomic benefit per year to the UK by 2040 if we get this right.

Yet the benefits extend far beyond economic opportunities. AAM could reduce carbon emissions by 222 million tonnes every year, equivalent to taking 120,000 diesel cars off the road, and boosting the number of sustainable transport options for consumers.

Public services will also benefit from emerging vertical flight technology. Uncrewed drones are already supporting medical deliveries in London, transporting urgent blood samples between Guy’s Hospital and St Thomas’. Yet not only are they reducing emissions by 99%, they are also speeding up deliveries by more than 93%. Meanwhile, eVTOLs could support rural and island connectivity, as well as medical emergencies in hard-to-reach areas.

Vertical flight technology policy

So what does industry need from the government to industrialise vertical flight technology and secure the UK’s international leadership? Principally, it comes down to regulation. By and large, the technology is already at an advanced stage of readiness, but regulators need to keep pace to ensure the UK’s competitiveness with other markets. That is why the CAA needs to outline its eVTOL rulemaking framework for operations and vertiports, giving industry clarity on the route forward.

Political direction is also needed to encourage investment in new vertical flight technology and supporting infrastructure such as vertiports and the grid. With the government committed to the strategic objectives of the Future of Flight Action Plan, but not the plan itself, the government needs to continue working closely with the Future of Flight Industry Group to set out a vision of the best way to unlock the benefits of this new technology through use cases and integration.

To support the industrialisation of AAM technology, the government should launch the next phase of the Future Flight Challenge at the Spending Review. Previous phases have successfully positioned the UK as a world leader in green aviation, but we must not now lose momentum just as the technology is ready to be commercialised.

Public perception will also be critical to supporting the sector’s future growth. Without public buy-in, vertiports could struggle to secure planning permission, and vertical flight technology will unduly remain the preserve of the wealthy. That’s why industry needs to work with the government and regulators to raise awareness of new technologies and dispel myths around noise generation.

Scaling new vertical flight technologies

It might sound as though these issues are niche, but the reality is that they are absolutely critical to the scaling of new vertical flight technologies. To truly realise the advantages of zero-emissions aviation, the public needs to understand how they will benefit from vertical flight and what it will mean for them. That could mean the government steps in as a first customer to demonstrate the public value of zero emissions vertical flight, whether that be air ambulances or another critical application.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iStock-1393960783.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 08:42:23.609650

FAQ About US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow Exports Why did the US implement tariffs on Brazilian tallow?","Understanding the Impact of US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow Exports

The international tallow market is experiencing a significant transformation following the announcement of substantial US tariffs on Brazilian imports. This development has sent ripples through global biofuel supply chains and forced Brazilian exporters to rapidly reconsider their market strategies. This analysis examines the multifaceted impact of these tariffs and explores the emerging alternatives for one of Brazil's most valuable agricultural exports.

What Are the Recent US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow?

Overview of the Tariff Implementation

The tallow market faced a dramatic shift when US President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on all Brazilian goods on July 9, 2025. Set to take effect on August 1, 2025, this comprehensive tariff includes tallow—a critical feedstock for biofuel production in the United States. The announcement came with explicit warnings that any attempts to circumvent these tariffs through transshipment would face even higher rates, effectively closing potential loopholes.

The tariff implementation represents a significant policy shift that directly impacts a well-established trade relationship between the two nations. According to Fastmarkets analysis, the timing of the announcement created immediate market uncertainty, as numerous shipments were already en route to US ports when the news broke.

""The tariff announcement created a situation where exporters had to quickly reassess not only future shipments but also cargoes already at sea,"" noted industry analysts from Fastmarkets in their July 2025 market report.

Historical Trade Relationship Before Tariffs

Prior to the tariff announcement, the United States had been the predominant destination for Brazilian tallow exports, accounting for approximately 97% of Brazil's total tallow exports in 2025. This heavy reliance on a single market underscores the vulnerability now faced by Brazilian exporters.

Brazil's tallow export volume to the US had been robust throughout 2025, averaging 51,000 tonnes monthly during Q2. June 2025 marked a particularly significant period with record-breaking exports of 71,650 tonnes shipped to US-based buyers. These established trade patterns, developed over years of commercial relationships, now face severe disruption.

The historical price stability and logistics efficiency of this trade route had created a deeply interdependent relationship, making the tariff announcement particularly impactful for both nations. Brazilian processors had optimized their production specifically for US market specifications, while US biofuel producers had come to rely on the consistent quality and supply from Brazil.

How Has the Tallow Market Responded to the Tariffs?

Immediate Market Reactions

Following the tariff announcement, the export trading of Brazilian tallow initially came to a complete halt. Market participants from both countries entered a strategic planning phase, focused on mapping alternative approaches to manage the new economic reality.

By late July 2025, activity cautiously resumed with storage tanks at the Port of Santos—Brazil's primary tallow export facility—receiving product for export once again. Approximately 36,000 tonnes were sold for August delivery to US-based buyers, representing a significant decline from pre-tariff volumes but demonstrating continued trade despite the new barriers.

September shipment offers were being presented even as August deliveries were finalized, though market sources indicated that negotiations were expected to be prolonged and complex as both sides adjusted to the new cost structure. This gradual resumption of activity suggests that market participants are finding ways to adapt, albeit with reduced volumes and increased costs.

Price and Supply Chain Disruptions

The tariff implementation has triggered considerable oil price movements and pricing volatility in both Brazilian and US markets. Shipments already en route to the United States during the announcement faced particular uncertainty, with some exporters seeking last-minute diversions to alternative markets.

US domestic biofuel producers have been scrambling to secure alternative feedstock sources, leading to upward price pressure on domestic tallow and competing feedstocks. The reduced Brazilian export volumes are creating potential supply gaps in the US market that domestic production cannot immediately fill.

The disruption has had cascading effects throughout the supply chain:

Rendering facilities in Brazil are facing storage capacity challenges

Logistics providers are renegotiating shipping contracts and routes

Biofuel producers in the US are reassessing production schedules

End-product prices for biodiesel and renewable diesel face upward pressure

This period of adjustment has created both risks and opportunities for market participants able to navigate the changing landscape effectively.

What Alternative Markets Are Brazilian Exporters Exploring?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production Route

A creative solution has emerged with US-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel producers becoming a primary outlet for Brazilian tallow despite the tariffs. This approach leverages the duty drawback mechanism available under US customs regulations.

SAF production allows companies to claim reimbursement of up to 99% of tariffs paid when the finished product is subsequently exported. This creates an economically viable pathway for Brazilian tallow to enter the US market, undergo processing, and then leave as a value-added product.

However, this option is limited to exporters with established relationships with the relatively small number of US companies that have established SAF export channels to European markets. The specialized nature of this production path means it cannot absorb the full volume of previous Brazilian tallow exports to the US.

European Market Potential

Europe has been identified as the most likely alternative destination for direct Brazilian tallow exports. According to industry projections, European demand for certified beef tallow for SAF production is expected to grow by an impressive 250% between 2022-2035, creating substantial long-term potential.

Despite this promising outlook, Brazilian exporters face significant barriers to immediate market entry:

Complex certification requirements with minimum 40-day compliance timelines

Higher export costs reducing price competitiveness

Established European supplier relationships limiting market access

Economic viability challenges compared to the pre-tariff US market

One industry expert familiar with European certification procedures explained: ""Certification and export costs are extremely high and undermine the competitiveness of our product. Exporting to Europe does make sense, but if it happens, it will be more due to pressure from the Brazilian side than actual demand from Europe.""

Regional Alternatives in South America

In search of more immediate solutions, the Brazilian rendering sector has engaged in high-level meetings with Uruguayan officials to explore regional alternatives. Uruguay already serves as an export route for tallow from Argentina and Paraguay, potentially offering established channels for Brazilian product.

Argentina was also considered as a potential market, but analysis indicated that its domestic market would be overwhelmed by the volume of Brazilian exports, making it an impractical solution for anything beyond small shipments.

Transshipment options through neighboring countries were explicitly rejected by industry leaders due to fraud concerns and the threatened higher tariffs for circumvention attempts. As one source noted, ""This would be the same as committing fraud,"" highlighting the industry's commitment to legitimate market solutions despite the challenging circumstances.

What Are the Duty Drawback Mechanisms Being Utilized?

How the Drawback System Works

The US duty drawback system has emerged as a critical mechanism for mitigating the impact of US tariffs on Canadian industries and Brazilian tallow. This customs provision allows companies to claim reimbursement of up to 99% of tariffs paid when imported materials are used in products that are subsequently exported from the United States.

The process works through the following steps:

Brazilian tallow is imported into the US with the 50% tariff paid

The tallow is processed into Sustainable Aviation Fuel or similar products

The finished product is exported to international markets (primarily Europe)

The US processor files for duty drawback reimbursement

After processing and verification, up to 99% of the original tariff is refunded

This creates a legal pathway to significantly reduce the effective tariff rate while maintaining compliance with US customs regulations. SAF producers in particular have been quick to leverage this mechanism, creating a specialized market channel for Brazilian tallow.

Limitations of the Drawback System

While the drawback system offers a valuable tariff mitigation strategy, it comes with significant limitations that prevent it from serving as a complete solution:

Significant delays in recovering tariff payments, typically several months

Cash flow requirements limiting participation to companies with strong financial positions

Specialized knowledge needed for compliance with complex customs procedures

Limited capacity among qualified SAF exporters with established European distribution

The system also creates a competitive advantage for larger, more financially robust companies that can absorb the tariff costs during the reimbursement waiting period. Smaller processors face disproportionate challenges in utilizing this mechanism effectively, potentially leading to market consolidation over time.

What Are the Long-Term Implications for Global Tallow Markets?

US Market Adjustments

The US domestic biofuels market will continue requiring imported feedstocks despite the tariffs, as domestic production cannot meet current demand levels. This fundamental supply-demand imbalance is likely to drive several market adjustments:

Potential shift toward alternative suppliers like Australia

Price increases for domestic US tallow to attract more collection/production

Biofuel producers advocating for tariff relaxation or targeted exemptions

Possible technology shifts to accommodate different feedstock profiles

Looking ahead, changes to the 45Z tax credit program starting in 2026 will exclude imported feedstocks from eligibility, creating an additional layer of complexity for market participants planning long-term strategies. This regulatory change, when combined with the US tariffs and inflation, represents a significant reshaping of the US biofuel feedstock landscape.

Global Supply Chain Realignment

The disruption to established trade flows is triggering a broader realignment of global tallow supply chains. Australia is positioned to become a stronger supplier to Asian markets, potentially filling gaps created by shifting trade patterns.

Industry experts have noted that ""Australia is expected to become a stronger supplier of animal fats in Asia,"" indicating a broader geographic rebalancing of the market. However, Brazilian tallow faces challenges in directly competing in these markets, with one source noting that ""Brazilian tallow is already uncompetitive [in Southeast Asia] in terms of costs and product quality.""

The potential surplus of Australian tallow in Asian markets could occur if US-bound volumes redirect, creating cascading price effects across the region. European certification requirements are simultaneously creating barriers to quick market shifts, slowing the rebalancing process and potentially creating temporary regional surpluses and shortages.

Brazilian Domestic Market Impact

The Brazilian domestic market faces significant changes if export volumes cannot find alternative international destinations:

Increased domestic supply leading to downward price pressure

Rendering sector exploring new business relationships and value-added opportunities

Adaptation period required for establishing new international market channels

Potential consolidation among smaller producers unable to weather market disruption

Brazilian producers are investing in certification processes despite the costs, recognizing the need for market diversification in the new trade environment. The adaptation period is expected to last 6-12 months as new commercial relationships develop and market participants adjust to the changed economic conditions.

How Are Regulatory Changes Affecting the Biofuels Landscape?

US Policy Changes Beyond Tariffs

The 50% tariff represents just one element of evolving US biofuels policy. The 45Z tax credit program changes starting in 2026 will exclude imported feedstocks from credit eligibility, creating a double challenge for international suppliers to the US market.

Ongoing developments in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) are simultaneously affecting market dynamics, with potential changes to blending requirements and carbon intensity scoring methodologies. The combined impact of tariffs and credit changes is fundamentally reshaping supply chains and investment decisions throughout the sector.

This regulatory evolution creates a complex decision matrix for market participants:

Regulatory Factor Current Impact Future Implications (2026+) 50% Tariff Immediate price pressure; Drawback utilization Potential for tariff adjustment or expiration 45Z Tax Credit Currently includes imported feedstock Will exclude imported feedstock starting 2026 RFS Requirements Driving demand for all qualifying feedstocks May shift toward favoring domestic production

Certification Requirements for International Markets

European markets represent the most promising alternative destination for Brazilian tallow, but they come with extensive certification procedures that create both time and cost barriers:

European market certification requires a minimum of 40 days for compliance processing

High costs associated with certification significantly undermine competitiveness

Many companies currently prefer domestic sales despite slightly lower prices

Certification complexity creates additional administrative burden

As one industry source explained: ""For now, many companies prefer to sell domestically rather than earn slightly more and deal with all the extra work [of certification]."" This sentiment highlights how non-tariff barriers can be as significant as direct tariffs in reshaping trade flows.

FAQ About US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow Exports

Why did the US implement tariffs on Brazilian tallow?

The tariffs are part of a broader 50% duty imposed on all Brazilian imports announced by US President Donald Trump on July 9, 2025. These tariffs were not specifically targeting tallow alone but affect the entire trade relationship between the two countries. The measure impacts a wide range of Brazilian exports to the United States, with tallow being particularly affected due to its significance in the biofuel supply chain.

Can Brazilian exporters legally avoid the tariffs?

Yes, through the US duty drawback mechanism, which allows for reimbursement of up to 99% of tariffs when the imported material is used in products that are subsequently exported. This approach is being utilized particularly by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers who import Brazilian tallow, process it into SAF, and then export the finished fuel to international markets.

While this creates a legal pathway to mitigate tariff impacts, it requires significant cash flow capacity to cover the tariff payments during the several-month reimbursement process, limiting its accessibility to larger, financially robust companies.

What alternative markets exist for Brazilian tallow?

The primary alternatives for Brazilian tallow exporters include:

European markets: Offering long-term growth potential but with significant certification barriers and higher export costs

Regional South American markets: Including Uruguay and Argentina, though with limited absorption capacity compared to US volumes

Domestic Brazilian consumption: Providing immediate sales channels but typically at lower prices than international markets

Each alternative presents unique challenges in terms of price competitiveness, market access requirements, and volume capacity. Brazilian exporters are likely to pursue a diversified approach rather than relying on any single alternative market.

How long might these tariffs remain in place?

The tariffs are set to take effect on August 1, 2025, but their duration remains uncertain. Market participants are monitoring political developments while simultaneously developing both short-term workarounds and long-term alternative market strategies.

The policy could potentially be adjusted based on several factors:

Bilateral trade negotiations between the US and Brazil

Changes in US domestic biofuel production capacity

Evolution of global renewable fuel markets

Pressure from US biofuel producers facing feedstock shortages

Given this uncertainty, industry participants are developing strategies that can adapt to multiple scenarios, including both the potential continuation and eventual relaxation of the tariff measures.

The facility forms part of HAMR Energy’s broader strategy to capitalise on new international regulations that enable methanol as a SAF feedstock.
“With the right policy settings, Australia has the opportunity to build a world-class LCLF industry,” said Jon Stribley, Co-founder of HAMR Energy.
HAMR Energy is currently finalising a $10 million Series A funding round, drawing strong interest from strategic partners and private investors.
The company sees this project as a cornerstone for positioning Australia as a leader in clean aviation fuel production and energy security.","HAMR Energy has unveiled plans to construct Australia’s first large-scale methanol-to-jet fuel production facility. The initiative, valued between $700 million and $800 million, aims to help decarbonise the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and generate jobs across the construction and operational phases.

The facility forms part of HAMR Energy’s broader strategy to capitalise on new international regulations that enable methanol as a SAF feedstock. Methanol, produced from sources like forestry residues and hydrogen, offers a scalable and flexible pathway to cut aviation emissions. The move also seeks to address a global SAF shortfall expected to reach 10 million tonnes by 2030.

The company’s recent feasibility study found that its technology offers a commercially viable way to produce SAF from methanol, with South Australia and Victoria identified as ideal locations.

“With the right policy settings, Australia has the opportunity to build a world-class LCLF industry,” said Jon Stribley, Co-founder of HAMR Energy. “This methanol to jet feasibility study demonstrates our ability to deliver competitive, bankable, projects to help hard to abate industries like aviation decarbonise, whilst attracting significant investment and improving national fuel security.”

The proposed site will convert 300,000 tonnes of methanol into about 125 million litres of SAF annually, enough to offset emissions from roughly 3.5 million economy-class flights between Sydney and Melbourne.

Meanwhile, the USA and China had started a fresh round of talks as expectations grew that the world’s two biggest economies could agree a 90-day extension to their trade war truce, the BBC wrote on 28 July.

The trade deal with Indonesia included provisions eliminating tariff barriers on over 99% of US products exported to Indonesia across all sectors, including for all agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and communications technology, automotive products and chemicals, the Ethanol Producer report said.

According to a 23 July FreightWaves report, US trade with Indonesia totalled US$38.3bn in 2024. Key US imports from Indonesia include palm oil, electrical machinery, solar panels, leather shoes and cocoa butter.

US agriculture groups praised the new trade deal with Japan that calls for the nation to significantly increase its imports of US rice and purchase US$8bn in US goods, including corn, soyabeans, fertilisers, ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a World Grain report.

“This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include US ethanol,” Ryan LeGrand, president and CEO of the US Grains Council (USGC), was quoted as saying in the 25 July report.

According to the US Census Bureau, Japan is the USA’s fifth-largest trading partner in goods, with two-way trade between the two countries totalling U$227.34bn in 2024 and Japan running a trade surplus of nearly US$70bn. ow

The US-EU deal will impose 15% tariffs on almost all European exports to the USA including cars, about triple the 4.8% tariff currently in force but avoiding punitive 30% import duties Trump had threatened to impose on 1 August, according to a 29 July report by The Guardian.

Trade between the two heavyweights was critical to global trade as it represented the most significant bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, commodity platform Vesper wrote on 16 July.

In 2024, the US imported nearly US$3bn more in dairy products from the EU than it exported. Specifically, the EU’s agri-food exports to the USA, including dairy products, were valued at €25.1bn (US$29.45) between January and October 2024, according to the EU’s official website.

The European trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič described the deal as a “breakthrough” in the face of a potential trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, The Guardian report said.

However, French prime minister François Bayrou said the EU had capitulated to Trump’s threats of ever-increasing tariffs, labelling the framework deal struck in Scotland on 27 July as a “dark day” for the EU.

German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed the deal as averting a more damaging outcome.

Following the announcement of the US-EU trade agreement, trade organisation le ‘Comité Européen de Liaison du commerce agricole et agroalimentaire (CELCAA), which represents the interests of European agricultural and agri-food traders, said the deal would bring a degree of certainty and lead to the re-equilibrium of trade activity between the USA and the EU.

“While tariffs are nothing to celebrate, the agreement brings short-term certainty and avoids the threat of further escalation which has been hanging over operators for months now,” the association said on 28 July.

Trump’s agreement with the Philippines will reduce its tariff rate on goods from the country to the USA to 19%, without paying import taxes for what it sells there, according to the FreightWaves report. The previous duty rate on products from the Philippines was 20%.

The Philippines was the 33rd ranked US trading partner in 2024, with two-way trade totalling around US$23.5bn that year, the report said.

Key imports from the Philippines include coconut oil, wheat and animal feeds, semiconductor devices and computers, auto parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, according to Philippines authorities.

Despite daily “tactical pauses” declared by Israeli forces, humanitarian conditions in Gaza remain catastrophic, with children starving, aid workers overwhelmed and fuel and water supplies critically low, UN humanitarians reported on Wednesday.

Speaking at the regular news briefing in New York, UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said that even four days into the announced pauses, “we are still seeing casualties among those seeking aid and more deaths due to hunger and malnutrition.”

He added that parents are “struggling to save their starving children” and warned that the current conditions for aid delivery are “far from sufficient”.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that while it is using every available window to deliver supplies during the unilateral pauses, the scale of need vastly outpaces what is getting through.

“A permanent ceasefire is needed more than ever,” Mr. Haq said, emphasising that “unilateral tactical pauses alone do not allow for the continuous flow of supplies required to meet immense needs levels in Gaza.”

Access a major hurdle

Access remains one of the biggest hurdles.

Entry through the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing requires multiple layers of approval from Israeli authorities, including safe passage, cessation of bombardment and the literal opening of locked gates.

“Yesterday, three facilitated missions allowed our staff to collect cargo containing food from the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings and allowed for fuel to be transferred within Gaza,” Mr. Haq said.

“However, the others faced impediments, particularly delays in receiving the green light to move by the Israeli authorities, and one had to be cancelled.”

Extreme hunger haunts children

The situation was echoed by Ricardo Pires, UNICEF’s communication manager, who returned from Gaza this week.

“It’s absolutely apocalyptic,” he told UN News. “Children are being injured and killed while trying to get food and aid while suffering from malnutrition and hunger.”

Mr. Pires said that two out of the three criteria for a famine declaration have been met, according to the latest alert by food security experts.

UNICEF and other agencies are also grappling with the collapse of basic infrastructure.

Perfect storm of suffering for children

“We’re at the brink of a man-made drought,” Mr. Pires said, with only 40 per cent of water production functioning and children turning to contaminated sources, risking deadly disease.

“Children are dehydrated. They are reverting to contaminated water, which will make them sick, with deadly diseases or diarrhoea outbreaks and in some cases, even meningitis,” he added.

In conclusion, Veolia's Maia project is more than a technical achievement—it is a strategic investment in the infrastructure of tomorrow.
As the world transitions from a linear to a circular economy, projects like this will define the next decade of sustainable growth.","In an era where climate action is no longer optional but imperative, the convergence of technological innovation and circular economy principles is reshaping global markets. At the forefront of this transformation is Veolia, whose groundbreaking carbon capture and e-fuel project in Portugal exemplifies how strategic investments in decarbonization infrastructure can align profitability with planetary impact. For investors seeking opportunities at the intersection of sustainability and scalability, this project offers a compelling case study.

The Maia Project: A Blueprint for Circular Carbon Economy

Veolia's collaboration with LIPOR and P2X Europe at the Maia Energy Recovery Plant near Porto represents one of Europe's first Power-to-Liquid (PtL) projects. By capturing 100,000 tonnes of biogenic CO₂ annually from waste-to-energy (WtE) emissions, the project converts this carbon into e-kerosene, e-diesel, and chemical products using green hydrogen. This closed-loop system not only reduces the plant's emissions to near-zero but also transforms non-recyclable municipal waste into a resource, aligning with Portugal's carbon neutrality goals.

The project's strategic value lies in its dual impact:

1. Circular Economy Enablement: By repurposing CO₂ emissions as feedstock for e-fuels, the initiative redefines waste as a commodity, closing the carbon loop in energy production.

2. Decarbonization Scalability: The integration of CCU technology with existing WtE infrastructure demonstrates a replicable model for industrial decarbonization, particularly in sectors like aviation, which lack low-carbon alternatives.

Strategic Investment Logic: Aligning with Global Transition Trends

Veolia's Portugal project is not an isolated endeavor but part of a broader €4 billion investment strategy to dominate the €500 billion local decarbonizing energy market. Key drivers for investors include:

- Policy Tailwinds: Portugal's aggressive climate targets, including a 2050 carbon neutrality goal, create a regulatory environment that incentivizes CCU and e-fuel adoption.

- Market Demand: The aviation industry alone requires 300 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel by 2050 to meet ICAO targets, a demand Veolia's e-kerosene production is poised to address.

- Technological Leadership: Veolia's global R&D in CCU (e.g., amine capture, MOFs) and its track record in projects like India's Tata Steel CCU plant reinforce its competitive edge.

Financial and Market Implications

While specific ROI metrics for the Maia project are not disclosed, the broader financial landscape suggests strong potential. A 2020 study of European utilities found a positive correlation between renewable energy investments and profitability, a trend likely to extend to CCU and e-fuel ventures. Veolia's GreenUp program, backed by €2 billion in capital, aims to reduce Scope 1-3 emissions by 50-30% by 2032, a trajectory validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

For investors, the project's alignment with the EU's Green Deal and COP28 ambitions further enhances its appeal. Portugal's role as a renewable energy leader (with 80% of its electricity already from renewables) positions it as a testing ground for scalable decarbonization solutions, which Veolia is uniquely equipped to commercialize.

Investment Advice: Positioning for Long-Term Value

Veolia's Portugal project underscores a critical shift: decarbonization is no longer a cost but a value driver. Investors should consider:

1. Equity Exposure: Veolia's stock, with its strong ESG alignment and €4 billion energy transition investment, offers exposure to a company at the vanguard of the circular economy.

2. Thematic ETFs: Funds focused on carbon capture, renewable energy, and ESG innovation can diversify risk while capturing sector-wide growth.

3. Public-Private Partnerships: Portugal's policy framework, including incentives for green hydrogen and CCU, signals a fertile ground for future collaborations, enhancing long-term returns.

In conclusion, Veolia's Maia project is more than a technical achievement—it is a strategic investment in the infrastructure of tomorrow. As the world transitions from a linear to a circular economy, projects like this will define the next decade of sustainable growth. For forward-looking investors, the message is clear: align with innovation, and the returns will follow.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-31 07:32:06.285661

Turning to SAF is a bigger, riskier move, but the Luxembourg-based operator is determined to continue its road to decarbonizing business aviation.

A recent collaboration puts the focus on clean jet fuel made in Iceland. Luxaviation has selected IdunnH2 for SAF deliveries, and this is a long-term, strategic partnership that will impact the future of private aviation. Instead of going for an established SAF producer with an existing roll-out, Luxaviation chose to support Iddunn H2, which is a green hydrogen company, to start making SAF and gradually increase its capacity.

This is known as an offtake framework, meaning that Luxaviation has agreed to purchase something that will be produced in the future, namely SAF. The actual delivery of Icelandic SAF to Luxaviation is set to begin in 2029, under this 15-year takeoff framework. Quantity-wise, we're talking 10,000 metric tonnes (11,000 tons) of RFNBO-compliant SAF per year.

The clean fuel will be certified in accordance with European standards (EU RED II and ReFuelEU) and will be distributed in the European Economic Area via an established book-and-claim system.

There are many types of SAF, and the one purchased by Luxaviation is e-kerosene. e-kerosene is made using green hydrogen (obtained from renewable power) and CO2, either straight from the atmosphere or from an industrial source. In order to qualify as a clean, sustainable fuel, e-kerosene must be produced with green hydrogen and sustainable water resources.

IdunnH2 will produce e-kerosene at a new facility in Helguvik Garbor, close to the Keflavik International Airport. Iceland is uniquely positioned to become a leader not only in green hydrogen but also SAF. IdunnH2 describes it as ""Europe's renewable energy island,"" which will allow the future SAF facility to run entirely on off-grid clean energy.

In addition to abundant water availability, Iceland has been one of the pioneers of green hydrogen in Europe. Here, green hydrogen has been used in the mobility sector for more than 15 years. More than two decades ago, in 2003, Iceland officially inaugurated the world's first commercial filling station. Fuel cell bus demonstrations took place as early as 2003 as well.

IdunnH2's SAF facility near the Keflavik Airport is expected to reach a capacity of 66,000 tons of fuel per year. This could be the first step in making Iceland one of the most important SAF suppliers in Europe.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/luxury-private-jet-operator-turns-to-icelandic-sustainable-fuel-255173_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 07:32:26.243551

• In the past few years, analysts from various houses seemed to view Singapore-listed China Aviation Oil (CAO) with mixed feelings.

• Recommendations have been muted, as they shifted emphasis at varying times in response to fluctuating risk factors.

Things like oil price volatility, trading margins, and associate contributions (from Shanghai Pudong International Airport Aviation Fuel Supply Company).

• Breaking out of that sentiment, CGS International has now put out a 'buy' call and a high $1.40 target price.

So has OCBC Investment Research, citing CAO as a potential beneficiary of the Equity Market Development Program (EQDP) given ""its significant net cash position and positive growth outlook.""

This follow CAO's robust US$78.1 million earnings for 2024 (+33.8% y-o-y).

• A striking thing is CAO had amassed a cashpile of US$500 million by end-2024, up from US$373 million a year earlier.

• When you look at the company's current market value of S$972 million (US$747 million, stock price S$1.13) and subtract all that cash, the actual business is valued at only S$328 million.

For a company pulling in ~US$85 million in profit, that's dirt cheap -- with ex-cash PE of 3.

• Wait, there's a downside risk -- CAO's trading of oil products is high volume and thin margin.

CAO reported losses for its 2H24 ""other oil products"" trading segment.

Excerpts from CGS International report

Analysts: Tan Jie Hui & Lim Siew Khee

Resume coverage; Add and a TP of S$1.40, ex cash 2x CY26 P/E.

We resume coverage on CAO with an Add call and a higher TP of S$1.40 as we roll over our valuation to FY26F and adjust our P/E multiple from 9.5x to 10x (CAO’s 10-year historical average).

The stock trades at CY26F 8.5x P/E and ex-cash P/E of 2x.

We estimate US$500m net cash at end-FY25F along with healthy operating cash flows, which should allow CAO to keep its FY25F dividend payout ratio at 30% minimum.

Re-rating catalysts: strong recovery in outbound China flight volumes, GPM improvement through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) trading and M&As.

Downside risks: geopolitical tensions and economic slowdown impacting China’s outbound flight volumes and CAO’s GPM. Geopolitical tensions may weaken 2H25F margin

In Jun 25, escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran heightened concerns over disruptions to oil production and shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global crude supply.

We reckon a potential volatility in freight costs for oil trading could impact GPM in 2H25F as not all of it can be passed through to customers, though CAO could capitalise on the rising oil prices for arbitrage opportunities.

As such, we estimate 1H25F contributed 57% of FY25F net profit.

Dividends and M&A ""CAO has maintained a robust net cash position for more than 10 years and it stood at US$500m as of FY24. Its debt-free balance sheet accords dry powder for M&As, which we see as a catalyst for longer-term growth. CAO was also able to sustain its 30% dividend payout (c.US$25m as of FY24). We believe CAO will pursue opportunities related to vertical integration across the value chain.""

Visa reforms and airline expansions to drive aviation growth

In Dec 24, China expanded its visa-free policy, allowing ordinary passport holders from 38 countries to enter China for up to 30 days without a visa while extending the permitted stay for eligible foreign travellers from 72 hours to 240 hours (source: gov.cn).

According to Centre for Aviation, airlines are ramping up China-bound services in 2025F.

We forecast EPS growth of 7%/7%/5% for FY25F/26F/27F.

1H25F preview: strong volumes likely led by aviation boom

More than 90m travellers (+7% yoy) passed through China’s aviation system during the spring festival season in Jan-Feb 25 while the May Day holiday brought a record 11m passenger trips on civil aviation networks (+12% yoy), according to Civil Aviation Administration of China.

We estimate CAO’s net profit rose 14% yoy to US$48m in 1H25F due to jet fuel volume growth and improvements in GPM due to better SAF trading with higher GPM.

We also believe share of associates’ profits climbed 19% yoy to US$28m in 1H25F as passenger traffic at Shanghai Pudong International Airport likely spiked during the abovementioned festive seasons.

Domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet 30% of New Zealand's jet fuel needs by 2050 could generate NZD 1.3 billion in gross value added (GVA) and create 5,700 jobs, while also strengthening fuel security, according to a Cyan Ventures study supported by Boeing.

“The opportunity to secure New Zealand’s long-term aviation fuel supply, boost economic growth and help meet ambitious climate goals through SAF is compelling,” said Kimberly Camrass, Boeing acting regional sustainability lead, Asia Pacific. “Overall there’s a clear case to act now, and a clear set of potential steps.”

The report outlines the benefits of defining acceptable feedstocks and certification standards, linking SAF to the national Emissions Trading Scheme, establishing a policy framework to support investment into SAF, and create a strong demand and investment signal at a leadership level.

It also found that New Zealand can potentially safeguard NZD 4.1 billion in tourism revenue and almost NZD 200 million in trade revenue over the period to 2050, as other countries accelerate decarbonizing aviation and SAF becomes a business and passenger expectation.

""Additionally, New Zealand's reliance on imported jet fuel highlights the need for a domestic SAF supply. This is critical for reducing emissions as aviation could rise to represent 22% of the country’s gross emissions by 2050 if no action is taken, but also for ensuring sovereign security,” said Camrass.

SAF is produced from renewable sources – such as agricultural and forestry waste, animal fats, vegetable oils and municipal solid waste – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s life cycle.

While SAF currently costs more than conventional jet fuel, the study states that adopting 5% use of SAF by 2030 would align with other countries in the Asia Pacific region and add less than the cost of a cup of coffee on one-way domestic flights – a cost outweighed by attracting 1.2% more travelers.

More than 190 countries, including New Zealand, have agreed via the International Civil Aviation Organisation to reduce carbon intensity of aviation fuel by 5% by 2030, and approximately 45 countries are already implementing or committed to SAF policies, including all of New Zealand’s top ten trading partners.

The New Zealand SAF study, which is part of Boeing’s commitment to the aviation industry’s goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, was unveiled at a New Zealand industry Policy Roundtable on Aviation Decarbonisation held in Wellington today.

government’s new Low Carbon Jet Fuel (LCJF) standard.
To achieve this, the volume of LCJF blending in jet fuel in B.C.
But sustainable aviation fuel production is currently not meeting existing demand, and the investment climate in B.C.
Suppliers who sell smaller amounts of jet fuel are exempt from the requirements, according to the B.C.","British Columbia has long had the dubious distinction of having the highest gasoline prices in Canada. B.C.’s low carbon fuel standard is just one of the hidden costs that contribute to higher gas prices here. B.C. may soon have the highest jet fuel prices, too, thanks to the B.C. government’s new Low Carbon Jet Fuel (LCJF) standard.

As it has done with EV mandates, the David Eby government appears to have gotten out over its skis with its new LCJF standards, as they will require airlines to buy a type of fuel that is up to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and which does not exist in sufficient quantities yet in Canada or, indeed, anywhere in the world. “The airlines are very concerned about paying more, because one of their primary costs — if not the most expensive thing that they do — is buy their fuel,” said David Schick of the Canadian Fuels Association.

The new standards require major airlines and their fuel suppliers to decrease their carbon intensities by 2%, starting next year, with 2% decreases each year thereafter until they top out at 10% in 2030. To achieve this, the volume of LCJF blending in jet fuel in B.C. is mandated at 1% by 2028 and 3% by 2030.

Now, one or three per cent may not sound like a lot. But when that fuel additive is three or four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and when it is not being produced at the volumes required to meet demand, it could become very costly, if not impossible, for airlines to meet the new standards. Airlines and suppliers that can’t source enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet the standards will be subject to a penalty of $0.50 per litre. How much that additional cost will add to your airplane ticket to Calgary or Mexico remains to be seen.

Biofuels made from canola oil, animal fats or wood waste can be used as a drop-in fuel additive that lowers the emissions intensity of jet fuel without requiring any modifications to jet engines. But sustainable aviation fuel production is currently not meeting existing demand, and the investment climate in B.C. is such that proposed biofuel production projects here have stalled or been shelved. As a result, B.C. will be the only province in Canada obliging jet fuel buyers to buy fuels that are not being produced domestically, and doing so in a highly competitive market.

The Parkland refinery last year produced a small amount of low carbon jet fuel on a pilot basis – 101,000 litres – with Air Canada becoming a customer. But no one in Canada is currently producing SAF in the quantities that will be needed. To put things into perspective, YVR uses 1.5 billion to 2 billion litres of jet fuel annually, so 1% of that would be 15 million to 20 million litres, and 3% would be 45 million to 60 million.

Last year, the total global production of SAF was 1.3 billion litres, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which was 600,000 litres short of the 1.9 billion that had been expected to be produced. So the shortfall of SAF production isn’t just domestic, it’s global. The BC Chamber of Commerce warns the new SAF requirements will put B.C. at a disadvantage by raising costs for flying. “If British Columbia proceeds with its current timeline, in advance of the creation of domestic SAF production, and ahead of its peers on the west coast of North America and throughout Canada, airlines flying to and from BC airports will be at a competitive disadvantage,” the chamber warns.

Since there is currently no domestic production of these fuels, suppliers will have to import them from the U.S., and will be competing with airlines in Europe, which also has new LCJF mandates, for a limited supply. “Folks like our members are very concerned about being obligated on something that doesn’t exist,” Schick said. “There’s just not enough of it to be able to meet the targets.” Which raises the question: Will air travel in and out of B.C. become more expensive? And will small regional and municipal airports and charter operators be suddenly hit with soaring fuel bills? The standards only apply to the suppliers of jet fuel for the big airlines and largest airports. Suppliers who sell smaller amounts of jet fuel are exempt from the requirements, according to the B.C. government. Small, regional airports and small charter airline companies therefore should not be subject to the new LCJF standards. Only major airlines and airports will be required to meet the new standards.

“It’s not in every litre that you have to have renewable in some percentage,” Schick explained. “It’s in aggregate. It’s over the total pool.” “So if you have to be 5% SAF in your mix for the province of British Columbia, you may have 7% at YVR to make up that total obligation, and not have it at many of the small airports. It would be just too difficult, logistically, to move it around.”

To get some idea of what B.C.’s new LCJF standard might mean for air travel costs, we can look to Europe. The EU has a 2% SAF standard in place, and some airlines operating out of European airports are already adding surcharges, as a result. Lufthansa has a new environmental surcharge to cover the increased cost of SAF that adds one to 72 Euros (CAN$1.60 to $114) to the ticket price for flights out of 27 European countries, the UK, Norway and Switzerland.

If the B.C. government wants airlines to meet new LCFS standards, it and the federal government will need to somehow incentivize domestic SAF production. “Most of my job these days is trying to get the Government of Canada to help us create an investment climate that allows us to compete with the U.S.,” Schick said, “because they have a lot of incentives to make this stuff.”",https://resourceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAF-AP-Photo-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 20:01:04.992217

“The opportunity to secure New Zealand’s long-term aviation fuel supply, boost economic growth and help meet ambitious climate goals through SAF is compelling,” said Kimberly Camrass, Boeing acting regional sustainability lead, Asia Pacific. “Overall there’s a clear case to act now, and a clear set of potential steps.”

The report outlines the benefits of defining acceptable feedstocks and certification standards, linking SAF to the national Emissions Trading Scheme, establishing a policy framework to support investment into SAF, and create a strong demand and investment signal at a leadership level.

It also found that New Zealand can potentially safeguard NZD 4.1 billion in tourism revenue and almost NZD 200 million in trade revenue over the period to 2050, as other countries accelerate decarbonizing aviation and SAF becomes a business and passenger expectation.

""Additionally, New Zealand's reliance on imported jet fuel highlights the need for a domestic SAF supply. This is critical for reducing emissions as aviation could rise to represent 22% of the country’s gross emissions by 2050 if no action is taken, but also for ensuring sovereign security,” said Camrass.

SAF is produced from renewable sources – such as agricultural and forestry waste, animal fats, vegetable oils and municipal solid waste – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s life cycle.

While SAF currently costs more than conventional jet fuel, the study states that adopting 5% use of SAF by 2030 would align with other countries in the Asia Pacific region and add less than the cost of a cup of coffee on one-way domestic flights – a cost outweighed by attracting 1.2% more travelers.

More than 190 countries, including New Zealand, have agreed via the International Civil Aviation Organisation to reduce carbon intensity of aviation fuel by 5% by 2030, and approximately 45 countries are already implementing or committed to SAF policies, including all of New Zealand’s top ten trading partners.

Aotearoa New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to be part of building a thriving SAF market that could benefit our aviation sector, climate goals and economic competitiveness.
It includes sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.","Comment: When I board my flight from Wellington to Sydney, I’m not just thinking about the meetings ahead. As CEO of a transport energy company, I’m acutely aware that the fuel powering that aircraft represents one of our greatest decarbonisation challenges.

New Zealand is a geographically remote island, which means air travel is vital to our connection with the rest of the world. Tourism also makes up an essential part of our economy. The overwhelming majority of visitors get on a plane to visit and air transport enables the export of some of our most valuable products to customers across the globe every day.

While critical, its contribution to carbon emissions is a challenge that needs to be addressed. Aviation accounts for around 2-3 percent of global carbon emissions, but unlike road transport where we’re seeing the adoption of electric vehicles, the technology pathway for low-carbon aviation is far more challenging. There is no battery technology currently on the horizon to power long-haul international flights. For the foreseeable future, if we want to keep flying, we need liquid fuels.

Beyond changes such as reducing flights or deploying more efficient aircraft, airlines are looking to alternative jet fuel options, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the most viable solution currently available for a lower-carbon emission future in air travel.

SAF is an industry term used for a form of alternative jet fuel made using feedstocks such as forestry residues, municipal waste, or used cooking oils with the goal of reducing the lifecycle carbon footprint of jet fuel. SAF is most typically used by international airlines when blended with conventional jet fuel to form part of the overall fuel mix and is considered as a ‘drop‑in’ fuel, meaning it can be used in an existing aircraft fleet.

SAF was first used in New Zealand in September 2022, when Z, in partnership with Air New Zealand and Neste, imported 1.2 million litres – enough fuel to power approximately 400 return flights between Wellington and Auckland. This remains the largest SAF shipment New Zealand has made to date.

The aviation sector globally is showing growing interest in SAF. Some airlines have set carbon emission reduction targets, passengers are increasingly conscious of their carbon footprints, and international regulations are generally evolving towards tighter environmental standards. Yet today, SAF represents less than 1 percent of total aviation fuel use worldwide, primarily due to limited supply and high costs.

One of the biggest challenges for SAF production is getting enough of the right feedstock (raw material from which fuels are produced). There are several different feedstocks that are commonly used, such as tallow and vegetable oils. Other feedstocks such as woody biomass or hydrogen can technically be used, however these can be harder or more costly to manufacture. The additional layer of complexity with any feedstock is that many have alternative uses in the energy transition, so the best use case for each feedstock needs to be taken into consideration as countries and industries navigate the energy transition.

For me it isn’t a question of if we need SAF in New Zealand, but how we will be able to successfully establish its supply for the domestic and Trans-Tasman markets when international demand for the product is increasing.

At Z, we’ve spent considerable time over the past few years working with industry partners across Aotearoa to understand what it would take. Our conclusion is clear: we need supportive policy settings to give industry the confidence to invest, combined with strategic partnerships and economies of scale that can deliver SAF reliably and in the most cost-effective way to our airline customers.

The global policy race is already underway

All of New Zealand’s top 10 trading partners now either have SAF-supportive policies in place or have shown support for it. Many countries already have minimum SAF-blending requirements, and over time, market access may depend on meeting these requirements. Without action to establish policy settings that create a level playing field, our region risks losing competitiveness, increased exposure to offshore compliance costs, and being shaped by policies set by others.

The call for supportive policy settings extends beyond Z. Air New Zealand’s public support for a SAF mandate last year reflects broader industry recognition of what’s needed. We’re continuing to collaborate with fuel supply chain partners, airports and airlines and their representative groups to help inform the Government on policy settings that aim to keep New Zealand competitive in an increasingly regulated global aviation market.

Collaborative advantage

Z’s view is that New Zealand’s approach to SAF should play to our strengths – our strong relationships, particularly our Trans-Tasman connections, may allow us to access SAF supply more effectively than attempting to build domestic production capacity from scratch.

That is why Z is looking to our parent company Ampol, to see what opportunities we can leverage with our joint scale. Ampol’s Memorandum of Understanding with GrainCorp and Industry Funds Management Investors (IFM) to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels* industry presents one possible opportunity.

The initial priority under the memorandum saw Ampol and IFM progress a feasibility assessment of a renewable fuels facility at Ampol’s refinery in Brisbane and work with GrainCorp to explore the supply of homegrown feedstocks, including additional crushing capacity to supply canola oil to the potential future plant. The feasibility work for the plant is now complete, and the project has moved into the next phase of pre-FEED (front-end engineering and design).

The project is still very much in its infancy, with much progress to be made before it’s determined viable, but it’s a step in the right direction. It’s not the only project on the table, there are others exploring similar opportunities, and every initiative will keep more options on the table to hopefully see the industry create a viable market in the future.

The opportunity remains

New Zealand needs to evaluate any SAF policy announced in Australia and be ready to consider how it might be mirrored or adapted for the New Zealand market.

This isn’t just about following Australia’s lead; it’s about ensuring we don’t create unnecessary barriers that fragment what could be a unified Trans-Tasman market. When policies are aligned, this will help investment stay in our region.

Aotearoa New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to be part of building a thriving SAF market that could benefit our aviation sector, climate goals and economic competitiveness.

This ambitious program seeks to achieve its environmental objectives by promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for all domestic flights. This is not merely another aid scheme; it represents the very first such initiative approved by the Commission that specifically champions the widespread adoption of SAF.

The Danish scheme, slated to run until December 31, 2027, is meticulously crafted to incentivize airlines operating within Denmark to transition to SAF on their domestic routes. A key objective of this initiative is to ensure that at least one domestic air route operates using a minimum of 40% SAF, a figure remarkably close to the current technical limit of 50%.

Under the framework of this progressive scheme, the financial assistance will be disbursed as monthly direct grants. These grants are specifically earmarked to cover the additional costs incurred by airlines when utilizing SAF as opposed to conventional kerosene. This comprehensive coverage also extends to supplementary expenses related to airport infrastructure adaptations necessary for handling and supplying SAF. To ensure fiscal responsibility and maximize the impact of the aid, the level of support will be determined through a competitive bidding process. This mechanism is designed to guarantee both cost-effectiveness and efficiency in the allocation of funds. The program is projected to support a minimum of 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations on a weekly basis, spread across one or more domestic routes within Denmark.

To prevent any instances of overcompensation, the scheme incorporates stringent rules. These include the explicit exclusion of supported SAF from any parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive. Furthermore, the scheme strictly prohibits the use of SAF that has previously received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or any third countries, ensuring that the aid contributes genuinely new reductions in emissions.

Denmark, for its part, has committed to ensuring that the aid will result in overall CO2 reductions and will not merely lead to a displacement of emissions from one sector to another.

This approval highlights the continued evolution of the 2022 CEEAG, which provides vital guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of environmental protection, climate protection, and energy aid measures that fall under the notification requirement of Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. These Guidelines establish a flexible and fit-for-purpose enabling framework, designed to empower Member States in providing the essential support needed to achieve European Green Deal in a targeted and cost-effective manner.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-30 14:56:53.166807

The company plans to assemble the prototype core for testing starting around year’s end at its recently acquired test site at Colorado Air and Space Port in Watkins. Located close to Denver International Airport and the company’s Centennial headquarters, the facility will be expanded for follow-on, full-up propulsion system tests later in 2026.

Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl noted July 28 on social media that “first chips” had been cut by a computer numerically controlled lathe that was newly installed in the company’s Denver “Supercenter” facility. Other recently acquired machine tools include a 65,000-lb. mill for producing precision machined large castings and forgings. Parts will be combined with a growing collection of other core components already produced, including additively made turbine blades and outer blade air seals.

Texas-based high-temperature materials and components partner ATI is providing materials for Symphony’s high-pressure compressor integrated blade and disk stages, as well as the turbine disk. Other engine partners in the Boom-led propulsion program include Standard Aero and Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT), a unit of Kratos.

In development for Boom’s planned Mach 1.7 Overture airliner, the two-spool, 3:1 medium-bypass turbofan engine will feature a single-stage 72-in.-dia. hollow blade fan and be optimized for prolonged supersonic operation with an air-cooled, single-stage high-pressure turbine and three-stage low-pressure turbine. The overall propulsion system will weigh 14,000 lb. and measure 41-ft. long, of which 12 ft. will be made up by the core.

Speaking at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum in Las Vegas on July 25, Lazzara says Symphony “is an ambitious attempt to bring a new engine to market that fits in between existing off-the-shelf options as a 40,000 lb.-thrust class medium bypass ratio engine. It is already designed to be 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatible, so that we can plug that in once the infrastructure is ready for use.

“On top of that, it has a key set of design features going from the inlet to the trailing edge at the back of the nozzle that enables it to meet the noise regulations as part of the package overall with Overture,” Lazzara says. “We have some experienced partners in the industry that have helped with the turbomachinery design, as well as others who have been a part of engine OEMs and aircraft OEMs that have come together to bring the design in a way that would not be possible by simply pulling an off-the-shelf engine.”

Explaining the difference between a conventional aircraft design approach and the integrated airframe-engine process underway at Boom, Lazzara says “airframe design and the engine design are basically two separate design worlds that are brought together and oftentimes in a suboptimal marriage. When Boom made the choice to bring the engine in-house, they essentially brought those two worlds and made them one, allowing for optimal integration, mission performance and even closure of a business model. This is what sets Boom apart from other attempts at high-speed flight in the past,” he adds.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-07-30 14:57:01.826058

There are concerns that green policies, such as using more sustainable aviation fuel, could lead to higher air fares.

Nats, the air traffic control provider that commissioned the research, said it had worked closely with aviation partners over the past 12 months to enhance punctuality and resilience.

This included using tools such as intelligent approach, which optimises the distances between arriving aircraft.

Nats said it was responsible for 1.2 per cent of total delays to flights en route to Europe in June, despite handling nearly a quarter of air traffic.

Thousands of UK airline passengers have suffered delays because of industrial action by French air traffic control staff in recent months.

The survey indicated that 52 per cent of UK adults had flown internationally in the previous 12 months, while 32 per cent flew domestically. Some 26 per cent expected to fly more in the following year.

The poll also suggested a growing acceptance of aviation innovation such as drones, flying taxis and AI-enabled services.

For example, 68 per cent of respondents supported using AI to screen bags while 50 per cent were in favour of it managing flight routing.

Simon Warr, Nats’ communications director, said: “The 2025 Aviation Index highlights the public’s clear priorities – reliable service, greater environmental performance, and smart use of innovation.

The 230,000-panel installation was developed by Energy Solutions Group (ESG), the Belgian green energy firm, which invested 90 million euros in the project, according to reporting by De Tijd.

The De Groene Energie Corridor (DGEC) solar farm, covering 100 hectares, lies under Schiphol’s approach routes and is capable of powering around 40,000 households. A Dutch court recently ruled that only part of the site (two of its four zones) must be taken down due to potential glare during landings. However, Schiphol is now pushing for the entire farm to be removed.

Safety concerns

In a letter to the Dutch infrastructure minister, Schiphol CEO Pieter van Oord warned that from late August to early April, glare from the panels could force runway closures and lead to ""accidents with potentially fatal consequences."" The airport argues that this would reduce capacity, increase noise elsewhere, and potentially cause millions in damages.

“The main issue is who is responsible for the costs""

ESG and DGEC say they are disappointed with Schiphol’s decision to escalate the issue politically after losing in court. They continue that the project has an irrevocable permit and have proposed reorienting the panels to reduce reflection, but are asking Schiphol to contribute to the cost. “The main issue is who is responsible for the costs,” ESG said.

The dispute marks a setback for ESG, which has grown rapidly with support from investors including Patronale Life, SFPIM and France’s Infranity. The Limburg-based company recently raised 125 million euros and is seen as a potential green energy unicorn.

While solar farms near airports are a growing trend, they remain sensitive. Brussels Airport aims to be carbon neutral by 2030 and has conducted extensive reflection studies for its own solar installations. At Ostend-Bruges Airport, solar panels were also added without issue.

That opportunity, radiating with promise and potential, is green hydrogen.

The upcoming Global African Hydrogen Summit 2025 is not merely another forum for dialogue; it is a clarion call for bold leadership and decisive action. The vision of Africa as a global green hydrogen powerhouse is no longer a distant aspiration. It is an emerging reality, and is fuelled by the continent’s abundant renewable energy resources, a surge in political will, and, most significantly, a dynamic generation of young Africans ready to innovate and lead change.

Consider this: over 60% of the world’s most abundant solar resources shine upon Africa. When combined with expanding wind corridors, burgeoning geothermal developments, and ongoing improvements to hydropower infrastructure, Africa holds an unparalleled natural advantage. This positions the continent to produce green hydrogen at a globally competitive scale and cost. Yet, this journey is not solely about electrons and molecules — it is a roadmap to transformational development, one that uplifts lives and empowers communities.

Green hydrogen is a catalyst for inclusive growth, delivering benefits across multiple sectors:

Decarbonising industries and forging new global value chains: By embracing green hydrogen, we can revolutionise our industrial landscape, positioning itself at the heart of emerging green global value chains. This ushers in a new era of sustainable industrialisation — one that is both environmentally sound and economically resilient.

Creating dignified jobs and empowering local talent: The green hydrogen economy is a powerful engine for employment. From electrolyser manufacturing and advanced engineering services to logistics and infrastructure, this sector offers career pathways that build skills, foster economic independence, and empower individuals and communities alike.

Empowering local communities with clean energy and infrastructure: Beyond large-scale industrial developments, green hydrogen brings direct benefits to communities. It means modern infrastructure and access to clean, reliable energy to power homes, schools, and businesses — transforming lives from the ground up.

Unlocking new markets for African exports: Green hydrogen presents a unique opportunity to enhance the value of African exports. From green hydrogen-based fertilisers to green steel, the continent can open new market frontiers, adding value to agricultural and mineral resources and strengthening trade competitiveness.

The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €36 million (DKK 268 million) Danish measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic aviation sector. This will be achieved through encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuel (‘SAF’) for domestic flights. This is the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of SAF and represents a significant step towards decarbonising the aviation sector, aligning with both national and EU climate objectives.

The Danish scheme

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It will be in place until 31 December 2027. The goal is to support at least one domestic air route using 40% SAF, which is very close to the current technical limit of 50%. This exceeds the minimum set by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which requires fuel suppliers to achieve a minimum share of 2% during the scheme period.

Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark. The scheme includes rules to prevent overcompensation, namely by ensuring that supported SAF is excluded from parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive, and by prohibiting the use of SAF that has already received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or third countries.

The Commission’s assessment

The Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (‘TFEU’), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (‘CEEAG’), which allow Member States to support measures reducing or removing CO2 emissions.

The Commission found that:

The scheme is necessary and appropriate to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector in line with national and EU environmental targets.

The scheme has an incentive effect, as airlines benefitting from the measure would not use SAF to the same extent without the public support.

The aid has limited impact on competition and trade within the EU. It is proportionate as the aid will be limited to the minimum necessary, given the use of a competitive bidding process. Denmark committed to ensure that the aid delivers overall CO2 reductions and that it does not merely displace emissions from one sector to another.

On this basis, the Commission approved the Danish scheme under EU State aid rules.

Background

The 2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission will assess the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU.

The Guidelines create a flexible, fit-for-purpose enabling framework to help Member States provide the necessary support to reach the European Green Deal objectives in a targeted and cost-effective manner. The rules involve an alignment with the important EU’s objectives and targets set out in the European Green Deal and with other recent regulatory changes in the energy and environmental areas and will cater for the increased importance of climate protection.

From hydrocracker hacks in Croatia to post‑Brexit fuel moonshots in the UK, from Hawaii’s island‑energy puzzle to solar‑made jet fuel in Switzerland, a new wave of innovators is showing how to crack the hardest code in aviation: scaling SAF without breaking the system that keeps planes (and economies) in the air.

The Hydrocracker Hack: CLG & INA Break New Ground

The first code cracked? Making old refineries run like new.

Chevron Lummus Global (CLG) and Croatia’s INA recently pulled off a milestone demonstration at INA’s hydrocracker unit, proving that legacy infrastructure can be deftly retooled to co‑process bio‑based and fossil feedstocks at scale. The test involved 1,000 tonnes of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) alongside fossil feedstocks — a first for the site — yielding ISCC‑certified clean fuels under the watch of independent body Bureau Veritas d.o.o.

This wasn’t just a “plug‑and‑play” switch. The project required custom filters, re‑engineered laboratory methods, and boosted capacity in both hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units — all while keeping the biogenic feedstock within safe operating parameters.

CLG and INA’s work shows how existing assets can be bent toward the future without breaking budgets or production schedules. And this isn’t a one‑off stunt: INA plans to complete all preparatory work by 2029, positioning itself for continuous SAF supply.

Post‑Brexit: The UK’s Fuel Codebreakers

If Bletchley Park cracked wartime ciphers, the UK’s Department for Transport (DfT) is cracking the supply code for jet fuel’s low‑carbon future.

Through its Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), DfT just backed Essar Energy Transition to build one of the UK’s largest advanced SAF production hubs at Stanlow. The Methanol‑to‑Jet facility is slated to produce 200,000 tons of SAF per year, drawing from 550,000 tpa of renewable e‑methanol and bio‑methanol, including supplies from Essar Future Energies’ upcoming project in Gujarat, India.

The roadmap is clear: pre‑FEED design by March 2026, full FEED by Q2 2026, and a final investment decision by late 2027. When online, the hub will flow directly into the Manchester Jet, Midlands, and UKOP pipeline systems— using existing jet fuel “arteries” to pump green molecules across the UK.

And Essar isn’t the only player in this decoding effort. LanzaTech Global just secured an $8.5M AFF grant for its DRAGON projects:

DRAGON 1 will turn recycled ethanol into jet fuel at a Port Talbot facility using LanzaJet’s Alcohol‑to‑Jet tech.

DRAGON 2 will pioneer the conversion of waste CO₂ + green hydrogen into ethanol for SAF at a UK site yet to be named.

Meanwhile, LanzaJet’s Project Speedbird (36% owned by LanzaTech) also got AFF backing, helping scale SAF production inside the UK.

Island Ciphers: Hawaii & Tahiti Rewrite Their Fuel Future

For islands, energy is its own Enigma — and Hawaii is cracking the code with one of its biggest SAF plays yet.

Par Pacific Holdings, Mitsubishi, and ENEOS Corporation have joined forces under the banner Hawaii Renewables to produce renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s Kapolei refinery. Mitsubishi and ENEOS, via Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, are putting up $100M for a 36.5% stake, with Par Pacific leading project execution.

Once operational, Hawaii Renewables will pump out roughly 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, SAF, naphtha, and low‑carbon LPG — with up to 60% SAF capacity aimed squarely at decarbonizing the islands’ aviation sector.

And in French Polynesia, Atoba Energy and Air Moana are taking a similar path, locking in a 10‑year SAF offtake deal that ramps up from 2026 through 2035, blending physical delivery with a book‑and‑claim system to meet ReFuelEU targets.

Solar Decoded: SWISS & Synhelion Turn Sunlight Into Jet Fuel

In perhaps the most poetic codebreak yet, SWISS International Air Lines became the first airline to integrate solar‑made jet fuel into regular operations.

Swiss‑based Synhelion delivered 190 liters of synthetic crude — created at its DAWN solar‑thermal plant — to a northern German refinery, where it was processed into certified Jet‑A1 fuel. It was then fed into the Hamburg Airport supply system and blended for SWISS flights.

“A genuine milestone,” said CEO Jens Fehlinger, calling it a proud investment in Swiss innovation and a vital step toward wall‑to‑wall renewable aviation.

Cracking the Registry: Ensuring Trust in SAF

Even SAF tracking is getting its code cracked.

The Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) and 4AIR have joined forces to harmonize SAF registries across commercial and business aviation, eliminating double‑counting risks and streamlining emissions claims. “It sends a strong demand signal for more SAF,” said 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci, emphasizing the importance of transparency and integrity in the emerging market.

From Riga to the Runway: The Baltic Breakthrough

And in Latvia, a priority project for the Latvian Investment and Development Agency has broken ground: a 236,000‑ton feedstock plant in Riga, expected to produce 93,000 tons of HVO and 87,000 tons of SAF annually — enough to cover 100% of Baltic aviation demand and export 70% of production.

The Bigger Picture: From Enigma to Everyday

Each of these moves — whether hacking hydrocrackers, repurposing pipelines, or rewriting sunlight into fuel — chips away at the central cipher: How do we make enough SAF, cheaply enough, to decarbonize global aviation?",,N,,2025-07-30 13:56:28.768342

That performance feature allows flights to haul more cargo or land at airports with short runways and makes operations both more flexible and profitable for carriers as well as improving safety for pilots.

The way Airbus achieved that in its latest widebody series is a combination of a few engineering factors. One of the primary contributors is the low weight of the big jet, thanks to its composite materials. The other big contributor is the aerodynamic shape of its wings and the performance of its engines. So, without any further ado, let's break it down.

How Slow Does The A350 Go?

Now, if you ask any pilot or air traffic controller (ATC), every landing is different, and that means that landing speeds are too. Even with that in mind, the A350 generally comes in around the 140-knot (259 kmh) mark on approach and touchdown. That low speed makes landing safer and smoother during normal operations, but the qualities that make that possible also unlock other potential. In the post-pandemic era of recovery, airlines need the flexibility to fly to virtually any destination with many different load factors and route profiles while keeping costs low.

The large wing surfaces of the A350 with extending flaps and other control surfaces make it highly controllable in harsh weather or under tough conditions like hot or high operations. When the air is thin in hot weather or at high-altitude airfields, the A350 is unbothered, and flights run like business as usual. Its reverse thrusters also shorten the rolling distance the A350 needs to stop once it hits the tarmac, which opens more destinations and increases the max payload potential. That means carriers can fly more, fly further, and go to more places than before with better operating efficiency than ever before.

Airbus has been locked in a rivalry with Boeing for decades over both the narrowbody and widebody market, which has inspired innovation by both aerospace juggernauts. As Boeing struggles with certification and production issues on both the 737 MAX and 777X, Airbus has had an opening to shine. The A350 has impressed airlines around the world with its flexibility, efficiency, and excellent flying characteristics, filling the order books and even prompting a specialized ultra-long-haul variant, the A350-900ULR, to be made for Singapore Airlines.

The A350-900 By The Numbers

Airbus’ original extra-widebody A350 officially entered commercial service in 2015 with the first delivered A350-900 going to Qatar Airways. The first of its class, the -900, is not a small plane by any means. Purpose-made to be a champion of long-haul flying, it also carries a strong seat count that makes it highly useful for both dense hubs and distant connections. Over 560 of the -900 model have been built for customers all over the world, from the United States to China or Qatar, along with almost 100 of the -1000 variant thus far.

The -900 so impressed with its fuel efficiency and range that Singapore ordered seven jets with more fuel capacity to make nonstop flights between Changi International Airport (SIN) and New York’s John F Kennedy International (JFK), which covers 9,537 miles (15,349 km) and is nearly 19 hours long. The high-lift aerodynamic design that makes low-speed landings possible also gives it that incredible range.

The A350-1000 By The Numbers

Three years after its predecessor, the stretched A350XWB variant would arrive at Qatar as well, with the first A350-1000 touching down at Doha International Airport (DIA) in 2018. The -1000 has the more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines compared to XWB-84 on the -900 but virtually identical wings, but thanks to its elongated fuselage, it can carry more fuel to fly even further.

The A350-1000 has an equally good reputation for low-speed handling that makes takeoff and landing a smooth and safe experience for aircrew and passengers alike. The freighter variant A350F that is expected to debut in 2027 will use the same platform as the -1000, just swapping seats out for pallet anchors. The -1000 has been a success serving the largest hubs in the world for global airlines like Emirates, Japan Airlines (JAL), British Airways, and Air France, to name just a few.

Composite Airframe Weight Savings

Airbus claims that by using composites known as carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and other weight-saving techniques, the A350 cut 1.2 metric tons of weight compared to conventional alloys. Minimizing the aircraft's systems, structures, and installation architecture also enabled this weight loss regimen. These advances in material science were applied to both the -900 and the stretched -1000.

The A350 program advanced the aerospace application of cutting-edge carbon fiber. The support structure of the landing gear, as well as the upper and lower wing covers, all use the same material, in addition to the fuselage structures. CFRP helped make the cabin quieter, and its greater strength allowed for a reduced cabin altitude of 6,000 ft (1,828 m). The wider and longer cabin also allowed for bulkheads in the rear and cockpit to be changed, with 30 extra seats possible thanks to the new layout.

In the first recorded incident of a serious A350 crash that occurred in Japan last year, the composites materials were credited with actually saving lives. At Tokyo Haneda Airport(HND), the JAL A350-900 collided with a Coast Guard Bombardier Dash-9 patrol plane en route to Niigata with humanitarian aid. The Dash-9 crew all perished in the mishap, but all 379 passengers and crew of the Airbus escaped, which was attributed to the fire-resistant qualities of the plane’s materials in a report by Plastics Today.

The use of advanced carbon-fiber composites made the A350 lighter, which makes its lowest airspeeds before stall better than the previous generation. That material also dramatically increased the performance of its control surfaces and wing, which enhanced its lift generation and aerodynamic properties in all flight regimes.

Aerodynamics For Ideal Handling

Each variant of the A350 has essentially the same wing with a flexing shape that “twists” as it flies through different conditions of speed, altitude, and load factors. That wing enables it to fly efficiently at high cruising speeds as well as land with slow, gentle handling characteristics. The carbon composite material that makes up much of the wing’s composition allows it to have this incredible flexibility while also being very light and strong.

A report by the International Council of Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS) praised the engineering of the A350, saying:

“‘Shaping Efficiency’ was the directive for the design of the aircraft, which was valid for all involved disciplines but of special motivation for aerodynamics. That means for the high-lift system to deliver maximum aerodynamic efficiency for low approach speeds and low take off drag, while keeping the overall system small and simple to provide low weight and low complexity.”

The wings of the A350 are very large and get even larger when the leading Droop Nose Device (DND) and slat surfaces drop down to increase lift. The Adaptive Drooped Hinge Flaps (ADHF) extend as the plane nears the runway, which raises the wing’s lifting power even more. There are also seven spoilers on the wing to complement the flaps’ effects. All of these qualities make both the A350-900 and -1000 a slow, safe, and predictable widebody jetliner when it returns from the sky and gently sets back down on earth.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-the-airbus-a350-has-such-a-slow-landing-speed-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 12:58:08.732889

The successful test, conducted within a CLG-licensed hydrocracking unit, underscores the adaptability of existing refinery infrastructure for producing renewable fuels. This development is particularly crucial as the aviation industry seeks viable pathways to decarbonize and reduce its environmental footprint. The ability to integrate new feedstocks into current operational units offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for increasing SAF production capacity.

""This test-run conducted at INA's hydrocracker unit, along with several other recent tests by CLG licensees, showcase how our technology can be integrated into customers' existing infrastructure to co-process a wide range of feedstocks to produce clean fuels,"" stated Arun Arora, Chief Technology Officer, Chevron Lummus Global. Arora further emphasized, ""The results also underscore the flexibility and scalability of our technologies and how they help customers maximize the value of their assets while achieving their sustainability goals."" His comments highlight CLG's commitment to fostering innovation that supports both economic viability and environmental responsibility.

The testing phase involved the co-processing of 1,000 tonnes of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) feedstock, a biogenic material, alongside conventional fossil-based feedstocks. The rigorous process and the resulting biofuels were meticulously certified by Bureau Veritas d.o.o., an independent certification body, in strict adherence to the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard for sustainable biofuels. This certification provides crucial validation of the sustainability credentials of the produced SAF and renewable diesel.

Prior to the commercial test, CLG and INA engaged in extensive collaboration to overcome the inherent complexities associated with processing a novel feedstock like POME, which possesses distinct physical and chemical properties. This collaborative effort encompassed a wide array of preparatory activities, including the procurement of specialized filters, the adaptation of existing laboratory methodologies, and crucial modifications to enhance the capacity of both the hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units. Furthermore, meticulous attention was paid to ensuring the controlled and safe handling of the biogenic feedstock within the refinery's existing operational parameters.

The pilot marks an initial step toward a nationwide rollout planned for early 2026, as part of Vietnam’s broader push toward cleaner energy alternatives.

Petrolimex will introduce E10 at 36 fuel stations across Ho Chi Minh City, while PVOIL will begin sales at six locations, including four in Hanoi and two in Hai Phong.

Despite the upcoming launch, concerns remain about ethanol supply. Vietnam currently has six ethanol production plants with a combined capacity of around 500,000 cubic metres per year. However, only two facilities are currently operating, producing just 100,000 cubic metres annually.

Dao Duy Anh, deputy director of the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Agency for Innovation, Green Transition and Industry Promotion, noted that Vietnam may need to import ethanol in the early stages. Major ethanol-producing countries such as the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as regional suppliers like Singapore and South Korea, are expected to help fill the gap.

In the meantime, domestic ethanol producers are preparing for a potential rebound in demand. The Petrovietnam Central Biofuels Joint Stock Company is working to restart key production facilities, including the Dung Quat plant, which is expected to resume operations by late 2025.

This approval marks the first time the Commission has greenlit a state aid scheme focused specifically on promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reflecting a key step towards decarbonising the aviation sector, reports European Commission.

The Danish government’s plan targets domestic flights, encouraging airlines operating within the country to switch from conventional jet fuel to SAF. The scheme will remain in effect until the end of 2027 and aims to ensure that at least one domestic air route operates with 40% SAF—just below the current 50% technical limit and well above the 2% minimum required under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.

To support this transition, airlines will receive direct monthly grants to cover the extra costs of SAF compared to regular fuel. These grants will also help offset any associated infrastructure expenses at airports. The aid will be awarded through a competitive bidding process to guarantee cost-effectiveness. The scheme is expected to support a minimum of 20 commercial one-way flights each week using SAF on one or more domestic routes.

The program includes safeguards to avoid overcompensation. It ensures that supported SAF does not benefit from other forms of government or EU subsidies, including those under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the ReFuelEU framework. SAF that has already received funding from Denmark, other EU countries, or third countries will not be eligible for support under this scheme.

The European Commission evaluated the Danish scheme under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), which permits state aid that supports economic development, and the 2022 Climate, Environmental Protection and Energy Aid Guidelines (CEEAG).

The Commission concluded that the plan is both necessary and appropriate for helping Denmark and the EU meet their environmental goals. It determined that the public support gives airlines a real incentive to switch to SAF—something they would not likely do on their own at this scale. The Commission also noted that the scheme is designed to minimize market distortion, as the aid is limited to what’s necessary and awarded through a competitive process. Denmark has committed to ensuring the measure leads to genuine carbon reductions, not merely shifting emissions elsewhere.

Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition said that this Danish scheme paves the way for more sustainable aviation by fostering the use of sustainable aviation fuel beyond current EU mandates.

US refiners criticize Trump biofuels approach

New York, 29 July (Argus) — A US oil refining trade group wrote to top Republican lawmakers to criticize federal biofuel policies that are favorable to farmers and to voice opposition to a bill that would authorize higher-ethanol gasoline blends. ""Recent policy decisions will negatively impact consumers, our members, and the President's energy dominance agenda,"" the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) wrote in a 25 July letter to House speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune, which was obtained by Argus . AFPM has long criticized biofuel policies it says hike energy costs and threaten domestic refining capacity. But the group was previously noncommittal on legislation that would allow the year-round sale of 15pc ethanol gasoline (E15), which nearly passed Congress late last year. The bill — previously seen as a narrow compromise with oil interests since it also offers some small refiners targeted relief from biofuel blend mandates — is a top priority for ethanol advocates this year and could now require further changes to assuage the oil industry. The outreach suggests that Republicans' efforts to boost fossil fuel companies after an unfavorable regulatory environment during former-president Joe Biden's tenure are not entirely succeeding. And the letter is notable too given some other oil companies' recent support for stronger biofuel incentives. The American Petroleum Institute joined a lobbying push this year for a steep increase in biomass-based diesel quotas and has supported the E15 bill. AFPM focuses much of the letter on the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners and importers to annually blend certain amounts of biofuels or buy credits from those that do. The Trump administration recently proposed requiring record-high biofuel blending the next two years and halving credits for fuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. The US plans to finalize those new biofuel quotas before November. The changes could mean not just pricier credits for oil refiners with limited biorefining capacity but also thinner margins for companies that saw renewable diesel as their way to escape the program's mounting compliance costs. The fuel lacks the blend limits of ethanol and biodiesel and can be made through a similar hydrotreating process as crude refining, but renewable diesel producers say domestic feedstock options are limited. US refiners used South American tallow and Asian used cooking oil to make more renewable diesel than ever before last year, frustrating farm groups that see foreign supplies as curbing demand for domestic crop-based fuels and feedstocks. The letter also faults the Environmental Protection Agency for its delays resolving a long backlog of small refiners' requests for program exemptions and signaling it could require larger companies to compensate for any future waivers by blending more biofuels themselves. AFPM did not confirm the letter, although the group told Argus it has ""deep concerns with federal biofuel policy and the latest [Renewable Fuel Standard] proposal, especially"" and that it is sharing these concerns with the administration and Congress. The letter points to other policies too, including ""eleventh-hour"" emergency waivers allowing E15 year-round in 2025. Some refiners had already spent millions of dollars preparing for a now-delayed shift to a lower-volatility summertime gasoline blend in the midcontinent, which would have allowed E15 blending in that region. AFPM is also frustrated with recent legislative changes to a biofuel tax credit — upping subsidies for corn ethanol in future years while cutting off eligibility for renewable diesel made from many foreign inputs — and with tariffs on renewable feedstock imports. Valero and Phillips 66 — which both told analysts last week that they would throttle biofuel output because of poor margins — are members of AFPM alongside other major renewable diesel producers like Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, and HF Sinclair.

US-EU deal sets impossible energy sales goal

Washington, 28 July (Argus) — A deal the EU negotiated with President Donald Trump's administration in a bid to avoid a major trade war committed the European bloc to purchasing $250bn/yr in US energy commodities in the next three years — a target that outstrips current US production and export capacity. Comments from European officials indicate that the commitment is likely to focus on LNG, in the broader context of efforts by the EU to phase out the remaining imports of Russian pipeline natural gas and crude. EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Monday called the $250bn/yr target ""achievable"", and the White House said the deal will ""strengthen the US energy dominance, reduce European reliance on adversarial sources, and narrow our trade deficit with the EU"". US exports of crude, refined products, LNG and natural gas liquids (NGLs) to the 27 members of the EU amounted to $74.3bn in 2024, based on US Department of Commerce data. The new deal would require the EU to quadruple the value of those exports — and increase the volume of exports by an even higher amount, since oil prices are lower this year than in 2024. The US exported 1.54mn b/d of crude and 655,000 b/d of refined products to EU members last year — at a total customs value of $58bn. At current WTI prices, US crude exports to the EU would hypothetically need to increase to over 10mn b/d to achieve the US-EU deal's target — about 75pc of current total US output and significantly higher than the total US exports last year. US LNG exports to the EU amounted to 1.7 Tcf of gas equivalent last year — about 22pc of total US LNG exports, US Energy Information Administration data show. The average LNG export price for EU destinations was $6.59/mmBtu last year, and the value of US LNG exports to EU members was $12.2bn. The total value of US LNG exports was $28bn last year. The energy component of the US-EU trade deal is outwardly similar to the so-called ""Phase 1"" deal Trump's first administration signed with China in January 2020 — and is likely to encounter the same issues with enforcement as political commitments clash with market realities. The US-China 2020 deal required Beijing to step up purchases of energy commodities by $18.5bn in 2020 and another $33.9bn in 2021. Hitting the target when the agreement was concluded in January 2020 would have required buyers in China to import an extra 1.2mn b/d at then WTI export prices. Just months later, the Covid-19 pandemic upended global oil markets and resulted in significantly lower oil prices — so achieving the export target would have required an even higher volume of US exports. China, in the end, never reached the Phase 1 deal energy purchase target. US-China trade relations continued to worsen even in the interlude between Trump's two presidencies. Unlike the EU, China has responded with strong countermeasures against tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year. Washington and Beijing are negotiating terms of new trade arrangements against a deadline of 10 August for the snapback of even higher tariffs.

Spain's Moeve sees wider refining margins in 2H

Madrid, 28 July (Argus) — Spanish integrated Moeve expects wider refining margins in the second half of 2025 to support group earnings, after weakness in April-June contributed to a fall in company profit. Moeve's refining margin fell to $5.80/bl in April-June from 7.60/bl a year earlier, it said today. There was regional weakness earlier in the quarter and the firm's entire 464,000 b/d refining system had to shut and restart after a blackout on 28 April. But margins have been above $10/bl throughout July and will continue to be supported by ""stronger product cracks, higher yields and the adaptability of our refining business,"" Moeve's chief financial officer Carmen de Pablo said today. De Pablo sees the visibility of the refining business improving in July-December in terms of marine and aviation fuels, as the timeline becomes clearer for transposition of the EU's renewables directive RED III in Spain. The directive is unlikely to be fully brought into Spanish law before the end of 2025. The outlook for sales of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is positive for the second half of the year, de Pablo said, because airlines have been purchasing and ordering more than the 2pc regulatory minimum blend mandated by RED III in 2025 ahead of directive's transposition. The blackout, combined with scheduled maintenance at the 220,000 b/d Huelva refinery in April and May, drove refinery output 14pc lower on the year to 4.6mn t in the second quarter. Capacity utilisation was 82pc, compared with 94pc in April-June 2024. Moeve's Energy business, which includes its core refining and marketing segments, reported a 31pc drop on the year in adjusted replacement-cost earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) to €277mn ($325mn). Initial estimates for losses resulting from the power cut for Moeve's refineries alone are ""well above €50mn, which we will claim"" said de Pablo. She did not quantify the blackout-related losses at Moeve's aromatics-focused chemicals division, but noted the firm is over the ""worst of the chemicals environment"". Adjusted Ebitda at the business fell by 24pc on the year to €58mn, and sales were down by 12pc at 547,000t. Upstream Ebitda fell by 24pc on the year to €63mn. Moeve's crude production fell by 13pc on the year to 30,000 b/d, reflecting the divestment of 60pc of its upstream portfolio over the past few years. Moeve plans no further disposals this year, de Pablo said, having sold its 25pc stake in exploration block 53 offshore Suriname to TotalEnergies in June. Moeve's adjusted Ebitda fell by 31pc on the year €356mn in the second quarter, and its adjusted profit increased by 8pc to €186mn on unspecified lower depreciation and amortisation charges. Profit including the inventory effect and other unspecified one-time items fell by 49pc to €89mn. Moeve is fully owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth investor Mubadala and US private equity firm Carlyle. Its unlisted status allows it to provide only limited financial information in its earnings results. Group net debt was steady on the year at €2.5bn as of the end of June. Capital expenditure (capex) fell to €502mn from €673mn, and Moeve expects this to be lower still in the second half resulting in capex of ""less than €1.0bn"" for the full year, de Pablo said.

More than a decade after the first SAF-powered test flight, this cleaner alternative is becoming more available in big countries, and wider availability also leads to better affordability.

Avfuel is committed to bringing more and more SAF to the business aviation sector. SAF customers range from major OEMs and airports to corporate flight departments. Avfuel is working with multiple SAF production partners (Neste, Valero, TotalEnergies, and Gevo) and is also actively supporting innovative production technologies (such as power-to-liquid and woody biomass SAF).

Eight of 57 Avfuel fueling locations are SAF strategic supply points across the US. Denver, Colorado, is the latest to join the club, alongside California, Florida, Texas, and New Jersey. This new supply hub in Denver will be the first of its kind in the entire region, which can contribute significantly to making SAF more readily available to operators in the central United States.

The clean fuel that will be available at the Denver location is SAF produced by Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture between an affiliate of Valero (which is a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation) and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients. This is a HEFA-type of SAF, meaning it's made using lipids (fats) such as used cooking oil. This type of SAF claims to reduce GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

However, because SAF can only be used in a blend with conventional fuel, in accordance with the current legislation, this level is much lower in actual operations. More specifically, a blend of 30% SAF and 70% jet fuel can lower GHG emissions by approximately 24%.

This might seem like a small percentage for a clean fuel, but the industry agrees that it's the best alternative available right now, taking into account factors like costs and availability. Even if the percentage is moderate, SAF's greenhouse gas footprint is small enough to be worth it overall.

Avfuel joined forces with Valero to set up this new supply point in Denver, and this kind of agreement between suppliers and producers is essential for advancing the commercial use of SAF. On the other hand, major airlines such as United, Qantas, and Air New Zealand are also investing in green jet fuel and gradually increasing the use of SAF for regular operations.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/new-saf-supply-point-in-denver-is-the-first-of-its-kind-in-the-region-255115_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 04:56:28.855795

Intriguing article (below) about creating a greener fuel source and this new option relies heavily on THE SUN.

Other than some of the advances in aerospace (AAMs, UASs, SSTs and more), the aviation news focuses on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and multiple efforts to reduce Carbon Emissions based on many prosing research/development initiatives. Here are a few:

That’s an impressive array of promising endeavors, but the below article about SYNHELION[i] a innovative venture THAT “TURNS SUNLIGHT INTO FUEL.” As its website explains, “Solar fuels are synthetically produced fuels designed to mimic the chemical and physical properties of fossil fuels.” [footnote two below offers a more complete explanation of how this process works its alchemy] Here is a graphic display of what happens:

A page in Synhelion’s website reviews the seven ways that its sun fuel BENEFITS THE ENVIRONMENT AND COULD REALISTICALLY BE UTILIZED BY COMMERCIAL AVIATION:

The company does not overstate the status of its synthetic fuel, “…there’s still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor.” Honesty but still promising.

Solar Jet Fuel Used for the First Time in Civil Aviation

A reputable European airline and a clean tech startup are the players behind a pioneering move related to green aviation: SOLAR FUEL WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CIVIL AVIATION, and it was successful. In terms of numbers, it is only a small step, but the implications are tremendous, paving the way for a cost-efficient, sustainable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) is a term that is currently widely used when talking about zero-emission aviation, but solar fuel isn’t a well-known alternative to conventional fuel. Solar jet is a type of synthetic crude oil produced using solar energy. Synhelion, a Swiss-based clean tech startup, describes the process of making solar jet fuel[i] as a combination of affordable feedstock, cheap renewable energy, and cost-effective thermal storage.

SYNHELION has benefited from support from Swiss (Swiss International Airlines) since 2020. That is when Swiss became a strategic partner. Two years later, it turned into an investor. Five years after their collaboration began, Swiss and Synhelion were able to demonstrate the use of solar fuel in civil aviation for the first time. It was a premiere for the entire aviation industry.

Although both players are based in Switzerland, the solar fuel was delivered and used in Germany. That’s because it was used as part of the fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. First, Synhelion[ii] delivered a barrel of its synthetic crude oil to a refinery in Northern Germany. Here, the oil was processed and turned into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel.

The crude oil used for this industry trailblazing delivery was manufactured at

using proprietary thermal energy storage system. [CLICK on image to see fascinating video on the process.]

For the next phase, this processed fuel was integrated into the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport, from which it was then used for Swiss flight operations. It wasn’t something big, like an entire flight powered by solar fuel, but it was a first step and a symbolic start.

This first use of solar fuel wasn’t about quantity, but about getting the ball rolling. Synhelion only delivered a 190-liter (50 gallons) barrel of crude oil, and the resulting jet fuel represented only around seven percent of the total fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. The goal was to confirm that THIS ALTERNATIVE FUEL CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED TO POWER AIRPLANES via a seamless logistical process.

Could solar fuel become as popular as SAF currently is? Perhaps, but there’s still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor. Synhelion has full support from the Swiss, which enables it to move down the certification and scaling-up ladder faster.

Synhelion is now looking to secure the sustainability certification for both its fuel and production process, according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive.

[i] A solar fuel is a synthetic fuel produced using solar energy, through photochemical (i.e. photon activation of certain chemical reactions), photobiological (i.e., artificial photosynthesis), electrochemical (i.e. using solar electricity to drive an endogenic reaction such as hydroelectrolysis),[1][2][3][4] or thermochemical methods (i.e., through the use of solar heat supplied by concentrated solar thermal energy to drive a chemical reaction).[5][6] Sunlight is the primary energy source, with its radiant energy being transduced to chemical energy stored in bonds, typically by reducing protons to hydrogen, or carbon dioxide to organic compounds.

A solar fuel can be produced and stored for later use, when sunlight is not available, making it an alternative to fossil fuels and batteries. Examples of such fuels are hydrogen, ammonia, and hydrazine. Diverse photocatalysts are being developed to carry these reactions in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.

[ii]Solar energy is converted into high-temperature process heat beyond 1’200°C. At DAWN, this solar heat is generated either by renewable solar power from a PV field through an electric heater, or by heliostats that direct the solar radiation onto a solar receiver.Part of the generated solar heat is fed into the thermochemical reactor that produces syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. The syngas is then processed into fuels, such as jet fuel, gasoline, or diesel, using standard gas-to-liquid technology. The other part of the heat is saved in the thermal energy storage to enable continuous 24/7 operation.

[iii] nucleus of a helium atom, a doubly positively charged cation. The term helion is a portmanteau of helium and ion, and in practice refers specifically to the nucleus of the helium-3 isotope, consisting of two protons and one neutron.

[iv] ✈️ The FAA’s approval process for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rigorous and rooted in international standards to ensure safety, compatibility, and environmental integrity.

Certification Standards

SAF must meet ASTM International specifications, primarily:

ASTM D7566: Covers synthesized hydrocarbons for aviation turbine fuel. SAF must be blended with conventional jet fuel and meet ASTM D1655 standards after blending.

ASTM D1655: Standard for conventional Jet A/Jet A-1 fuels. Once SAF is blended and meets this spec, it’s considered fully certified for use.

Approved SAF Pathways

There are currently 11 ASTM-approved production pathways, including:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)

FT-SPK (Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene)

ATJ-SPK (Alcohol-to-Jet)

CHJ (Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet) Each pathway has specific feedstock requirements, conversion processes, and blend limits—typically up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

FAA’s Role

The FAA supports SAF development through testing, evaluation, and streamlining approvals.

It collaborates with ASTM, OEMs, and research institutions like ASCENT to validate SAF performance and safety.

FAA also contributes to international efforts via ICAO’s CORSIA program, ensuring lifecycle emissions reductions are credible and standardized. Incentives & Legislation

SAF producers may qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, with up to $1.75/gallon based on lifecycle GHG reductions.

The FAA administers FAST grants to support SAF infrastructure and blending at airports.
