T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability.
During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency.
Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.
The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III.","Aircraft designs serve specific purposes, and the C-17 Globemaster is no different. Let's examine its tail, for example. Basically, to make room for its rear loading operations, McDonnell Douglas built the C-17 Globemaster with a T-tail. This allowed it to transport large loads of equipment at airfields quickly with ease thanks to the clearance. Another benefit of the horizontal stabilizer positioned high on the vertical fin and the airflow is stability during mid-air drops when the open cargo doors disrupt the air stream. Keeping the elevator away from engine exhaust and turbulent airflow, it also ensures a cleaner flow over the tail surfaces, which makes it easier to fly.

T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability. Its simplified design reduces considerations for aerodynamic interferences and offers greater short-field performance. The iconic jet was ground-breaking when it was announced in the 1980s. Its reliability, flexibility, and performance were game changers.

Multi-Mission By Design

The C-17’s exceptional capacity for both military and humanitarian missions transformed strategic airlift not only for the US Air Force but allied powers as well. Despite a handful of early design flaws and a challenging manufacturing spool up, the aircraft first went into service in 1993. The T-tail and high wing offer greater clearance at the rear for cargo loading, unloading, and airdrops.

The C-17's speed and payload for supporting forward operations, even on improvised and short fields, solidified its role as a powerful tool for projecting global power. The C-17's primary features are its high speed, ability to land on austere runways, its global range (with aerial refueling), and high reliability. Its versatility has proven highly valuable in carrying out missions beyond airlift, like humanitarian relief, aeromedical evacuation, and special operations.

Steady, predictable handling during complex flight maneuvers and expeditiously performing ground operations are crucial to the C-17’s missions. The high-wing configuration is also beneficial to the same two ends, as is the robust landing gear. McDonnell Douglas' earlier experimental aircraft, the YC-15, is the origin of the T-tail on the C-17. The prototype demonstrated short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities for operating in austere environments, becoming the model for the C-17.

The Best Handling At Any Altitude

The T-tail design of the C-17 offers benefits like improved stall condition management, maneuverability, and consistent elevator response under all conditions. Pitch and roll stability is optimized by the C-17 Globemaster's anhedral (downward sloping) high-wing design, especially when carrying a heavy payload. The wing aspect ratio and configuration aid in lowering lift-induced drag during flight, and performs well going “low and slow” at high angles of attack.

During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency. The aerodynamics of the wing minimize the effect of wingtip vortices to reduce drag and improve the big jet’s performance. Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.

Global Airlift Without Limits

Because the elevator’s airflow is less affected in the event of a stall, recovery is considerably easier to handle. A versatile and effective military transport aircraft, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster excels at handling large, heavy cargo and ensuring a steady elevator response.

Optimized For Short Fields

The C-17 can take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet (1,064 meters) and only 90 feet wide (27.4 meters). The plane can make a 180-degree star turn within 80 feet while on the ground, according to Air Force Technology. It is also capable of backing itself up with reverse thrust when on the ground. The directed flow thrust reversers can be used to go up a 2% gradient slope with a fully loaded aircraft.

The T-tail is designed to perform well both at low altitude during expeditionary missions and at cruise when the C-17 is transiting between air bases. Four 40,440-lb thrust Pratt & Whitney PW2040 turbofan engines, with engine thrust reversers and speed brakes, power the big jet. Its cruise speed is between Mach 0.74 and 0.77, and the range without in-flight refuelling is 2,400 nautical miles.

Aerial refuelling provides an intercontinental non-stop range that is virtually unlimited. The Globemaster III is capable of carrying payloads up to 77 tons. The aircraft has the capacity to carry 134 passengers, 102 paratroopers, six high-dependency medical patients or 36 stretcher patients, one CH-47F Chinook helicopter, or 18 military pallets.

Inside The Globemaster III

A variety of vehicles, palletized cargo, paratroopers, airdrop loads, and aeromedical evacuees can all be transported by the C-17 thanks to its cargo compartment. Three Black Hawk helicopters, four Bushmaster vehicles, and an Abrams tank are among the items that can be loaded into the cargo bay.

The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III. Four Honeywell multifunction cathode-ray tube displays, two full-capability HUDs, and cargo systems are all part of the digital avionics system.

There is also a mechanically operated backup system for the electronic flight control system, which is quadruple redundant. The Northrop Grumman large aircraft infra-red countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is equipped with 56 USAF C-17 aircraft, with 25 upgraded aircraft entering service in 2007.

Over Three Decades Of Service

Boeing was a part of the program from the beginning of the C-17 aircraft's development and manufacturing in 2006. McDonnell Douglas eventually merged with Boeing in 1997, which saw the program fall under its widened umbrella. Currently, there are 275 aircraft in the global C-17 fleet serving the USAF and allied nations, including the UK, Canada, Australia, India, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and the 12-nation Strategic Airlift Capability.

Despite Boeing's announcement that C-17 production would end in 2009 once existing orders were completed, the USAF was authorized to purchase 15 more aircraft in 2008. In July 2008, Qatar ordered two C-17s, and in February 2009, the UAE declared that it would purchase four C-17s in January 2010. Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense awarded a follow-on contract worth up to $2.26 billion to Boeing for the sustainment of the C-17 fleet.

The Indian Ministry of Defence signed a $4.1bn agreement with Boeing in June 2011 to acquire ten more C-1s. The C-17 met all the IAF's requirements during rigorous field evaluation trials held in India in June 2010. Kuwait purchased two C-17s in 2014, along with equipment and training support. The final Globemaster III left the company’s production facility in Long Beach, California, in November 2015, marking the end of the production after more than two decades.

Boeing, in partnership with Mahindra Defence Systems, opened a C-17 training centre in 2016 to serve the Indian Air Force (IAF), and signed an $8m contract to train C-17 aircrews at its international training centre (ITC) in the UK under the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) programme. It also trains Emirati C-17 students. Royal Air Force (RAF) C-17 engineers and aircrew are trained by Boeing at the C-17 International Training Centre (ITC) in Farnborough, United Kingdom.

The C-17 Goes Green

In 2021, Boeing told its defense customers that its military aircraft can run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) up to a 50% blend with conventional fuel. There are no technical problems with Boeing defense aircraft using synthetic aviation turbine fuels. All defense aircraft manufactured by Boeing and their derivatives were covered by the study as well. So on top of the smooth, steady, efficient flying that its T-tail and high wing deliver, it can run on eco-friendly fuel too.

When compared to conventional jet fuel, unblended, or ""neat"" SAF, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 84%. It also presents the industry's biggest opportunity to cut carbon over the next 30 years across all aviation segments. At the moment, a 50/50 blend with traditional fossil fuels is the highest amount of SAF that can be used in the C-17 and other Boeing military aircraft.

Brigadier General Darren Cole, Air Mobility Command (AMC) director of Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection, commented on the SAF program:

""The C-17 continues to serve as the strategic airlift workhorse for the nation, as evidenced by its impressive performance in the recent airlift of more than 124,000 evacuees from Afghanistan in an around-the-clock operation. As the command responsible for operating the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet, AMC looks forward to the continued partnership with our Boeing teammates as we work to keep the Globemaster fleet healthy for years to come.""

Boeing has been a pioneer in making SAF a reality and has a long track record of advancing alternative fuels. In 2010, the company collaborated with the US Air Force on an in-depth fuel study as part of their efforts to certify the C-17 Globemaster to use SAF blends. The same year, Boeing also helped make possible the supersonic flight of a US Navy F/A-18F ""Green Hornet"" on a 50/50 SAF blend.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/why-did-mcdonnell-douglas-build-the-c-17-globemaster-with-a-t-tail.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:08.269599

Sustainable Growth and Innovation As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised.
This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.","Business travel is expanding significantly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which is already well on its way to becoming a global centre for corporate mobility. MENA is establishing itself as a top corporate travel destination as companies continue to turn their attention to emerging markets. The industry is growing faster than the global average, which is paving the way for a significant shift in the travel industry in the area.

Steady Growth and Investment Surge

In 2024, the MENA corporate travel sector was expected to reach a value of $18.1 billion, with a projected 6.1% year-on-year growth in 2025. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are increasingly aware of the region’s immense potential, pouring capital into its rapidly developing infrastructure. In fact, MENA’s business travel bookings saw a significant 40% surge in early 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024, with the months of April and May marking peak travel periods post-Ramadan.

As global business increasingly turns its attention to the Middle East, projections suggest that the broader market will reach $270.8 billion by 2030. This growth will be propelled by continued infrastructure development, digital innovation, and strengthened economic ties with Europe and Asia, creating a fertile environment for both business and leisure travel.

Key Drivers of Growth

A major contributor to MENA’s expanding business travel market is the economic momentum seen in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. These economies are projected to grow by 4.2% in 2025-2026, compared to around 1.5% in Europe. A significant portion of this growth is being driven by diversification and expansion beyond oil and gas, particularly in sectors like technology, finance, and tourism.

One of the key drivers of the corporate travel boom is the massive infrastructure projects taking place in Saudi Arabia. Projects like Neom, Qiddiya, and the Red Sea development are attracting global talent, particularly consultants, engineers, and project managers. As these initiatives continue to unfold, they are expected to further bolster the demand for business travel in the region.

The Bleisure Trend: Business Meets Leisure

A notable trend in MENA’s business travel market is the rise of “bleisure” — a blend of business and leisure travel. In fact, 25% of business travellers are now extending their trips to incorporate leisure activities, particularly younger generations who prioritise work-life balance. This shift has prompted airlines such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad, and Saudia to enhance their in-flight and ground services, offering more flexible and comfortable travel options to cater to this growing segment.

In response to the increased demand for bleisure travel, regional airlines have introduced new features such as lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible dining and entertainment options. This has made it easier for business travellers to balance work commitments with relaxation and exploration during their trips.

Sustainable Growth and Innovation

As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised. The region is increasingly balancing expansion with environmental responsibility, incorporating carbon dioxide (CO₂) tracking and AI-powered cost optimisation tools into corporate travel operations. Platforms like Tumodo are now offering businesses the ability to forecast spending, track emissions, and ensure eco-friendly travel routes. This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.

In line with regional goals to achieve net-zero emissions, several countries within MENA — including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar — have set ambitious sustainability targets. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel, along with the use of green-certified hotels and infrastructure, is becoming a key part of corporate travel strategies in these countries.

Tech and Infrastructure: Key to Success

Alongside sustainability efforts, the role of technology in enhancing business travel experiences cannot be overstated. MENA is seeing a rise in digital platforms that support business mobility, such as travel booking services and logistics management systems, which help streamline corporate travel operations. The region’s investment in technology is paving the way for greater efficiency, transparency, and convenience in business travel.

Simultaneously, the physical infrastructure required to meet growing demand for corporate travel is being developed at a rapid pace. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is investing heavily in airport expansions, new rail projects, and hotel developments. This has created a robust pipeline of infrastructure projects, attracting both local and international investors.

Challenges and Investment Opportunities

While MENA’s business travel sector presents significant investment opportunities, investors are being cautioned to assess potential risks carefully. The massive scale of ongoing mega-projects presents a risk of market imbalance, especially if demand growth fails to keep up with infrastructure development. Furthermore, potential regulatory shifts related to visas, taxation, and ownership laws could affect the returns on investment.

For businesses seeking to capitalise on the region’s growth, there is a clear opportunity to invest in both physical infrastructure — including hotels, event spaces, and transportation hubs — as well as digital solutions that support business travel operations. However, investors must also consider the possibility of overcapacity in one area and shortages in another if infrastructure development does not keep pace with demand.

Future Outlook: A Global Leader in Business Travel

With its combination of economic diversification, cutting-edge technology, and sustainability initiatives, MENA is solidifying its position as a global leader in the business travel industry as it continues to expand. Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to spearhead this change with its Vision 2030 initiative and a strong emphasis on logistics, infrastructure, and tourism.

How well the area can serve the needs of both business and leisure travellers in the years to come will depend on its capacity to strike a balance between rapid growth, environmental responsibility, and technological innovation. As of right now, MENA continues to be a vibrant and alluring travel, business, and investment destination.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MENA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:11.747259

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel Air passengers anticipating long-distance trips will appreciate the service entry of the Airbus A350F for more than just its technological marvels.","Long-haul fliers wanting flights that are more economical and environmentally friendly might be interested in the latest innovation now being tested in Toulouse, France, home to the latest development of Airbus. The aerospace-friendly city in France is currently constructing the new Airbus A350F freighter, the first of its kind in the new generation of freighter aircraft. Designed and built with a focus on sustainability and operational efficiency, Toulouse officials state it might have a major impact on both cargo and passenger travel in the next decade.

Toulouse has currently become the central hub of aircraft construction in France. The A350F, a derivation of the passenger A350-1000 model, is modified to satisfy the increasing requirement for sustainable aircraft. Major sections of the fuselage from construction plants all over France and Germany are now being assembled in Toulouse. Their architectural design, set out by the government’s aviation authorities, is built around emissions and fuel efficiency on a global scale.

Sustainable Aviation in the Center of Aviation

According to company officials, the A350F is likely the only choice an airline is likely to make when upgrading its fleet. This is due to its compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 2027 CO2 emission. It is, however, designed with cutting-edge features that let it remain far more efficient than its predecessors. Beyond the Rolls-Royce Trent, the A350F offers 2a 0% reduction in consumption, while the other freighters remain unchanged. More than that, with these planes in service, it offers passengers way more options.

In addition, government reports claim that the reduction in cost due to the A350F will indirectly cater to the needs of the consumers. Citizens, especially those living close to the airports, will benefit more than those boarding the flights. The quieter features of the aircraft can reduce pollution levels. Consumers newly introduced to airplanes, who have been disturbed by loud airplanes, will appreciate this feature. It is a huge step in improving aviation.

Elevating Passenger and Cargo Experiences

Even though the A350F is designed for the features that enhance the cargo operations, the design also aids in the passenger logistics by making air freight faster and more dependable. The aircraft is equipped with the class’s largest main deck cargo doors, which afford the airline the ability to carry goods along with passenger services. Transport analysts opine that smoother cargo operations could translate to essential goods such as e-commerce parcels and time-sensitive items being delivered faster to travelers, thus assisting the travelers indirectly.

The Aircraft can carry 111 tonnes and travel 4,700 nautical miles, which is suitable for long-haul to destinations such as Tokyo, Singapore, and Europe. The more recent governmental transport reports indicate that the development and incorporation of innovative flights into the airline fleets results in more accurate schedules and fewer delays overall. This enhances the overall passenger travel experience.

More Environmentally Friendly Routes and Worldwide Communique

With the support of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program, the A350F is certified to use up to 50% of SAF and plans to reach 100% use by 2030. Aviation authorities believe this is vital for cutting the carbon footprint of aviation. Passengers of long-haul flights may enjoy some positive environmental impacts of this aircraft, especially on transcontinental flights between Europe, Asia, and North America.

The government says Toulouse’s aerospace center has become a hub for cutting-edge innovation, with projects like the A350F and other aircraft technologies helping boost the country’s green transport objectives. Officials believe the A350F’s cockpit and cabin could provide seamless improvements to the environmental and operational aspects of the flights and services offered for the served cities.

Reducing Workload and Improving Well-Being for Users

Airbus has partnered with some cargo and airlines operating the A350F to ensure the aircraft is designed for operational efficiency and versatility. These include optimal fuselage volume, floor reinforcements for heavy loads, and variable configuration loading systems that improve indirect passenger travel by flight. These examples of sustainable infrastructure, in addition to making airline travel easier, also contribute to the center of travel systems that encourage new mindsets and systems.

Based on reports from authorities, the A350 passenger family has already logged millions of flight hours and the cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and maintenance practices lessens the cost of training for the airline and streamlines the service offered to the users of the airlines. The airline’s ability to stick to the timetable offers passengers on routes served by the A350F improved reliability and comfort, with airlines better able to maintain timetables and minimize disruptions.

Impact on Travel and Logistics in the World

Airbus A350F is a construction milestone for the airline’s modernization because of the ability to combine flexible freighter and eco-sustainability. The more advanced the fleet, the better equipped the airline will be to provide its passengers with global connectivity through safe, reliable, and eco-friendly travel in response to the global trade and e-commerce boom, coupled with heightened environmental policies.

While airlines are adopting such freighters to respond to the growing global trade, e-commerce boom, and stricter environmental policies, travelers can expect comfort alongside lesser emissions as the assembled A350F, with test flights scheduled for 2026, will be ready, thanks to airlines. The airline’s industry in Toulouse regards the A350F as an indication of the aviation streamline of the future, merging the technological advancements in travel with the benefits brought to its passengers. Authorities point out the project’s features for aviation, showing that the growing aviation demands can still be positive for the planet.

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel

En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave.
La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar.","Queridos lectores de LT9, hoy con Marcelo Kusznierz los invitamos a conocer un grupo de cultivos que en los últimos años se están abriendo camino en nuestros campos y también en las discusiones sobre el futuro de la agricultura. Se trata de la colza (Brassica napus var. oleifera), la carinata (Brassica carinata) y la camelina (Camelina sativa). Tres especies oleaginosas que, aunque emparentadas en algunos casos y con historias distintas, comparten un denominador común: su capacidad de diversificar las rotaciones, aportar sustentabilidad y generar productos de alto valor, desde aceites alimenticios hasta biocombustibles de última generación.

La colza tiene un largo recorrido en Europa y Canadá. Allí se la conoce más por su versión mejorada: la canola, que fue seleccionada en los años 70 para reducir el ácido erúcico y los glucosinolatos, lo que permitió su uso masivo en alimentación humana.

En los últimos 10 años las materias primas más utilizadas en la producción de biodiésel fueron los aceites vegetales, entre los cuales se destacan el de palma, el de soja y el de canola. Los países que producen biodiésel principalmente a partir de aceite de soja son Estados Unidos, Argentina, Brasil y algunos de la UE.

El aceite de canola, como insumo para su elaboración, se encuentra muy difundido en la UE, mientras que el de palma es muy utilizado en Colombia, Indonesia y el resto del sudeste asiático.

En la actualidad aproximadamente el 20% de la producción mundial de aceite de canola, así como el 19 % del de aceite de soja y el 18% del de aceite de palma se destinó a la producción de biodiésel, marcando la importancia de la plantación de colza a nivel global para los biocombustibles.

En Argentina, la colza comenzó a sembrarse tímidamente en los años 90 y tuvo un fuerte impulso en la última década, especialmente en la región pampeana, como alternativa de invierno frente al trigo.

La carinata, por su parte, es menos conocida. Se trata de una especie originaria de Etiopía, emparentada con la colza pero adaptada a climas más cálidos y secos. En nuestro país se la está probando en varias provincias con muy buenos resultados, sobre todo porque presenta tolerancia a altas temperaturas y genera un aceite ideal para la producción de biocombustibles de aviación (SAF: Sustainable Aviation Fuel), un sector con gran potencial de crecimiento.

Los combustibles sostenibles para aviación se definen como combustibles derivados de materias primas biológicas o no fósiles, que pueden sustituir o complementar a los combustibles para aviación derivados del petróleo, reduciendo las emisiones de GEI a lo largo del ciclo de vida del producto.

Según la AIE (Agencia Internacional de la Energía), mezclar biocombustibles sostenibles para la aviación de bajo contenido de carbono con combustible fósil para aviones será esencial para alcanzar el objetivo de descarbonización. Esto se refleja en su Escenario de Desarrollo Sostenible, donde se prevé que en 2030 los biocombustibles suplirán alrededor del 10 % de la demanda de combustible de aviación y, en 2040, cerca del 20 %. Asimismo, la IRENA (2020), en su “Transforming Energy Scenario”, estima que en 2050 el consumo de biojet llegará a los 100.000.000 m3, siendo los biocombustibles la única opción disponible para reducir significativamente las emisiones de dicho sector.

La camelina, finalmente, es una vieja conocida de la agricultura europea. Hay registros de su cultivo desde hace más de 3.000 años en zonas como Escandinavia y el Mediterráneo. Durante mucho tiempo quedó relegada, pero en la última década resurgió por sus notables ventajas: ciclo corto, rusticidad, bajo requerimiento de insumos y un aceite rico en ácidos grasos omega-3. Al igual que carinata tiene como destino principal el biocombustible.

Tanto la camelina como la carinata son materias primas utilizables para la producción de SAF, de acuerdo al proceso productivo de este combustible podemos detallar su correspondiente porcentaje de mezcla, procesos tecnológicos aprobados a través de la norma ASTM para la fabricación, su año de aprobación, las posibles materias primas por utilizar y el volumen máximo de mezcla con combustibles fósiles.

Aspectos agronómicos

Colza

Ciclo: 120 a 150 días.

Siembra: otoño, compitiendo directamente con trigo.

Requerimientos: necesita suelos bien drenados y buena fertilización nitrogenada y sulfatada.

Ventajas: excelente antecesor para soja de segunda, alta producción de biomasa que mejora la estructura del suelo.

Rindes: en Argentina varían entre 1.5 y 3 toneladas por hectárea, con picos superiores en condiciones óptimas.

Carinata

Ciclo: similar a la colza, aunque con mayor rusticidad.

Siembra: otoño-invierno, con adaptabilidad a ambientes más marginales.

Requerimientos: menos exigente que la colza en agua y fertilidad.

Ventajas: tolera altas temperaturas y sequía, genera un aceite con gran estabilidad oxidativa.

Rindes: entre 1 y 2.5 toneladas por hectárea en experiencias locales.

Camelina

Ciclo: muy corto, 85 a 100 días.

Siembra: puede implantarse a fines de invierno o principios de primavera.

Requerimientos: se adapta a suelos pobres y ambientes semiáridos.

Ventajas: bajo costo de implantación, rusticidad, posibilidad de entrar en nichos de rotación poco aprovechados.

Rindes: de 800 a 1.800 kg/ha, aunque con gran variabilidad.

Más allá de los mercados, estos cultivos aportan beneficios en el sistema que me parecen indispensables para una agricultura que piensa en un todo:

Diversifican las rotaciones y reducen la presión de malezas resistentes.

Son aliados frente a la huella de carbono: fijan CO₂ y, al destinarse a biocombustibles, reducen las emisiones netas del transporte.

Generan un uso más eficiente de la tierra, al ocupar ventanas de barbecho invernal.

En países como Canadá y Alemania, la colza ya forma parte estable del esquema agrícola. En Argentina, aunque todavía son cultivos de nicho, representan una oportunidad para productores que buscan diversificación y nuevas fuentes de ingreso.

Uno de los grandes retos para que colza, carinata y camelina despeguen en Argentina es la articulación de la cadena de valor. Se necesitan más acopios que reciban estas oleaginosas, más industrias dispuestas a procesarlas y, sobre todo, reglas claras de fomento a los biocombustibles avanzados.

En este sentido las Cámaras de Biocombustibles de Argentina están haciendo enormes esfuerzos para lograr un nuevo marco normativo, una nueva ley que potencie la producción de “combustibles del futuro” como pudo lograr nuestro principal socio comercial del Mercosur, Brasil, con potencialidades muy similares a las locales.

En la provincia de Santa Fe, por ejemplo, existen proyectos piloto con estos tres cultivos vinculados a universidades y empresas que trabajan en bioenergía. Estos ensayos muestran que hay potencial, pero que sin políticas activas y mercados garantizados es difícil que el productor se arriesgue a cambiar parte de su esquema productivo.

La agricultura global se enfrenta a un doble desafío: producir más alimentos y energía, y hacerlo con menos impacto ambiental. En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave. No reemplazarán a la soja ni al maíz, pero sí pueden ser complementos estratégicos.

En un mundo que avanza hacia la descarbonización, la demanda de biocombustibles de aviación crecerá de manera exponencial, y allí Argentina tiene la chance de posicionarse. Lo mismo con la camelina, cuyo aceite puede conquistar mercados premium de alimentos y cosmética.

Queridos lectores, la agricultura es movimiento constante, y quienes estamos en el sector sabemos que el futuro se construye sumando alternativas. La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar. Son cultivos con historia, con presente y, sobre todo, con un futuro prometedor si logramos integrarlos en nuestros sistemas productivos.

La pregunta que queda abierta es: ¿seremos capaces, como país, de darles el espacio y el impulso que necesitan?",https://www.lt9.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/camelina_corza_carinata.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 20:56:26.841238

Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet.
For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet.","The Airbus A350 has long been identified as one of the widebody jets most likely to have an impact on airline fleet development for decades to come. The model, built in an industry-leading manner from unique composite materials, is capable of delivering a combination of range and capacity simply unmatched by any other model on the market today.

It is with these factors in mind that most major international carriers have worked the Airbus A350 into their long-term fleet development plans. Even long-time holdouts, such as Chicago-based United Airlines, have eventually shifted their mindset towards operating the twin-engine aircraft. American Airlines, however, has been a noteworthy exception.

We analyze the principal factors driving American's decision not to operate the Airbus A350, stemming primarily from the fact that other aircraft meet the jet's needs better. American Airlines had an Airbus A350 order in the past, but an interesting set of factors pushed the carrier to cancel this commitment. There are currently no plans to acquire A350 jets in the future, and the airline views its future exclusively in the hands of the manufacturer, Boeing, when it comes to widebody fleet development.

A Brief Overview Of The A350's Role In The Market

We view the Airbus A350 as the long-haul workhorse of choice for most major airlines, as it pairs an impressive range with lower trip and per-seat costs. An aircraft largely built from carbon-fiber composites and powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, the aircraft burns significantly less fuel than most previous-generation widebody jets, helping carriers hit their margin targets while also lowering emissions output with a relatively large aircraft.

The Airbus A350-900 serves long-and-thin routes while the larger Airbus A350-1000 targets large trunk markets in need of additional seats. This gives airlines a capable two-sized aircraft family that offers shared training and maintenance capabilities. We also see the aircraft's elevated level of passenger comfort through providing cabin pressurization and humidity improvement, as a key catalyst supporting the aircraft's generation of premium yields. From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A350 slots between the Boeing 787 and the larger Boeing 777/777X family, allowing airlines to find a right-sized aircraft that suits their capacity needs at a particular moment in time.

The aircraft also has an ultra-long range variant, one which is currently used exclusively by Singapore Airlines, that helps airlines link far-flung destinations which would have otherwise required stopovers. This helps support network differentiation and premium schedule capacity growth. The upcoming Airbus A350F extends the platform into the cargo market, helping replace older-generation freighters facing environmental restrictions. With sustainable aviation fuel compatibility and continued tweaks to its performance capabilities in the works, we see the A350 as a credible long-haul backbone that can be used by carriers to balance the needs of hub-to-hub and point-to-point missions. Lessors see the aircraft as an incredibly valuable asset for roughly the same reasons.

An A350 Order Inherited From US Airways

US Airways first committed to purchasing the Airbus A350 in 2005, penning an order for 20 aircraft in order to support an anticipated long-haul network expansion that would begin following its emergence from a restructuring process. Airbus redesigned the A350 program as the clean-sheet Airbus A350XWB, and US Airways actually elected to expand the deal to 22 Airbus A350 XWBs between 2007 and 2008. This included a Trent XWB engine selection with Rolls-Royce. In 2013, American Airlines merged with US Airways, transferring the order to the newly united carrier, according to reports from Reuters.

Initially, American Airlines planned the first deliveries of its A350 models between 2017 and 2018, with management electing twice to defer the schedule in order to manage capital spending and better preserve network flexibility with an international demand picture increasingly softening. In July 2016, American Airlines pushed the Airbus A350 stream to late 2018 through 2022, with deferrals averaging 26 months. The airline was looking for capital expense relief of around $500 million in 2017, which grew to $700 million in 2018.

Starting in April 2017, American Airlines began to move its first deliveries even further back to 2020, effectively turning this year-old commitment into essentially a perpetually unactivated option that the airline continued to avoid actually exercising. During this period, American Airlines was introducing Boeing 787s into its fleet, as well as refreshing its legacy widebody jets. The Airbus A350 was still a credible pathway for the airline's long-term fleet development, but it was becoming increasingly deprioritized.

Pulling The Plug In 2018

On April 6, 2018, American Airlines elected to terminate its order for 22 Airbus A350-900 jets, instead placing a new order for 47 Boeing 787s, including 22 787-8s, which arrived starting in 2020 and 25 787–9 models, which began arriving in 2023, according to Boeing. An additional 28 options were also secured by the carrier. We see this move as a calculated play taken by American Airlines to simplify its overall fleet strategy, including the shrinkage of the number of widebody types that American would be operating. The carrier quickly moved to retire the Boeing 767-300, the Airbus A330-300, and the aging Boeing 777-200ER, all in an attempt to simplify the carrier's fleet and reduce operating costs.

The American Airlines management team highlighted the Boeing 787's fuel-burning and maintenance advantages over the aircraft it was replacing, and that the aircraft's range was an ideal fit for American's network. We see another factor as a crucial element of American's decision-making process here. Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet. From a financial perspective, this decision was already locked in as a replacement order, which helped the airline limit capital expenses, after several rounds of Airbus A350 deferrals shifted cash towards where it was needed most.

American Airlines publicly thanked both manufacturers for aggressively marketing its jets, including the Airbus A330neo. However, the management team ultimately settled on the Dreamliner as the model that optimized operational and economic benefits while also establishing a growing Boeing 787 subfleet. This fleet standardization choice was, in our eyes, no technical indictment of the Airbus A350 as a model but rather a move that helped the airline better align its strategic and financial priorities.

What Is The Longer-Term Picture?

While we see American's decision in 2018 to cancel its original purchase of the Airbus A350 as driven by the need to reprioritize medium-term cash flows, we do believe that there were multiple long-term reasons why the decision was beneficial for the airline. For starters, the simplification of the airline's fleet offered a number of benefits which management was keen to realize. Specifically, operating fewer widebody jets allowed the airline to train employees on fewer different types of jets, keep fewer spare parts in store, and easily swap jets in its network. Expanding the airline's Boeing 787 fleet also delivered a number of scale-based benefits, with a small A350 subfleet mostly being a large cost burden on the airline.

A second factor we see as important in this decision is not just short-term cash flow reallocation but also long-term balance sheet discipline. The 2016–2017 deferrals of these orders demonstrated the airline's interest in lowering capital expenses, but in doing so, it also preserved the airline's long-term financial flexibility. The decision to focus on just one manufacturer and retire older, expensive aircraft helped the airline rebalance its assets and liabilities.

Beyond this, we do see the Boeing 787 as the ideal fit for American's transpacific and transatlantic networks, where the vast majority of long-haul revenue is generated. The aircraft is liked by customers, and it provides the optimal combination of range and risk that American Airlines was looking for. Through this introduction, the carrier also avoided the risks associated with introducing a new type of aircraft to its increasingly complex fleet.

Could This Have Been A Mistake?

While we do believe that the Airbus A350 would have been a weaker choice for American's broader network expansion plans, we see some benefits which could have eventually been realized had American Airlines elected to push forward with A350 fleet development. The aircraft is the most efficient large widebody in service today, with the Boeing 777X still sitting at least a year away.

The A350's exceptional reputation for passenger comfort could have been very useful for American today. The carrier is broadly lagging behind United and Delta in terms of premium network capacity and reputation for passenger comfort.

The jet itself is also exceptionally suited to certain kinds of high-density ultra-long-haul routes, which would be more effectively served by an A350 than the Boeing 787. The airline still lags its competitors in many ultra-long-haul markets.

Could American Order The A350 In The Future?

Just because American Airlines canceled its A350 orders in the past does not mean it could not order the jet again in the future. However, this seems relatively unlikely.

For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet. The carrier also has a strong relationship with manufacturer Boeing, which it clearly is not thinking about changing.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bpeing-787-at-mia.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-13 16:56:13.164989

The sector is expanding faster than the global average — reaching $18.1 billion in 2024 and projected to grow 6.1 percent year on year in 2025, according to a report by UAE-based travel platform Tumodo. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are already taking note of the region’s transformative potential.

MENA’s business travel bookings surged 40 percent in early 2025 compared with late 2024, with April and May marking the busiest months post-Ramadan.

The broader market is expected to hit $270.8 billion by 2030, fueled by infrastructure development, digital innovation, and deepening economic ties with Europe and Asia.

“The impressive 50 percent year-on-year growth we’ve seen this year signals a shift from recovery to reinvention,” said Stan Klyuy, chief commercial officer of Tumodo, in the report, noting that average airfares are down by 12 percent and hotel bookings up by 2 percent.

Rita Raad, senior principal of strategy and transformation of the public sector at FTI Consulting, explained in an interview with Arab News: “The 40 percent surge in business travel bookings to MENA in the first half of 2025 reflects a powerful mix of regional momentum and shifting global priorities.”

She added: “Much of this growth is driven by the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), where the economy is projected to grow 4.2 percent in 2025-26 compared to about 1.5 percent in Europe, fueled by 3.7 percent non-oil sector expansion and diversification efforts.”

Oil and gas, technology, and finance remain the biggest corporate travel drivers, according to Raad, while Saudi Arabia’s giga-projects continue to draw waves of consultants, engineers, and operators.

Hassan Malik, tourism and sport consulting leader and partner at Deloitte Middle East, told Arab News that the region is indeed “witnessing a remarkable rebound and reinvention in corporate travel.”

A key catalyst of business travel growth, according to Malik, is “the influx of mega-projects and infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, like Qiddiya, Neom, and the Red Sea project, drawing global business and investment interest.”

Meshal Al-Faras, head of Middle East, Africa and Central Asia at Janus Henderson, told Arab News: “We are seeing a sustained shift in how international companies and investors view this region, and Saudi Arabia is a clear driver of that momentum.”

He added: “The objectives of Vision 2030 are being implemented at scale across infrastructure, logistics, finance and tourism. That level of clarity and execution attracts interest from global organizations that want to grow in a stable and high-potential market.”

Travel trends

According to Tumodo’s report, Saudi Arabia led as the top destination for users of the platform, accounting for 20 percent of all travel, followed by the UK at 15 percent, and France and India each at 10 percent.

Regional airlines Emirates, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways dominated preferences, while India emerged as the most affordable route and the UK as the premium choice.

Regarding the trend for bleisure — trips that blend business with leisure — Raad noted: “The concept of bleisure continues to shape corporate mobility in MENA, with 25 percent of business travelers now extending their stays for leisure, especially among younger generations prioritizing work-life balance.”

She mentioned that airlines such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates, and Saudia were responding by enhancing their in-flight and ground services to cater to bleisure travelers.

These upgrades included features such as fully lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible entertainment and dining options, enabling passengers to work comfortably and relax during flights and transit.

Malik said that bleisure has now become mainstream, with many travelers extending work trips for personal time or combining them with relaxation. He noted that business travelers are increasingly staying longer to explore local destinations.

“Airlines are responding by introducing premium economy offerings, enhanced Wi-Fi, and flexible stopover packages, and Emirates and Etihad also now routinely promote wellness and sightseeing add-ons,” added Malik.

Al-Faras commented that the idea of business travel being limited to boardrooms no longer reflects how people operate, adding that executives want both flexibility and quality when they travel.

He added: “In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, we are seeing that expectation being met with strong investment in premium hospitality, high service standards, and facilities that allow people to work and relax in the same setting.”

Sustainability and tech

On sustainability efforts, Raad explained that MENA’s business travel sector is increasingly balancing growth with sustainability by embedding CO2 tracking and AI-driven cost optimization into corporate travel operations.

“Platforms like Tumodo now let companies forecast spending, measure emissions, and enforce eco-friendly routing — optimizing for shorter flights, sustainable hotels, and consolidated itineraries — and delivering emissions reductions of up to 20 percent,” she added.

Malik added that sustainability is becoming central to corporate travel strategy in MENA, noting that national targets in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar all aim for net-zero emissions in the coming decades through Vision 2030 and national energy strategies. He emphasized that “sustainability is increasingly core to corporate travel strategy in MENA.”

Malik noted that businesses are aligning procurement, travel, and logistics with green standards, prioritizing local suppliers and offset schemes via platforms like MENA’s Global Carbon Council, the region’s first voluntary carbon offsetting program.

Investor takeaways

Looking at investment opportunities, Al-Faras stated: “I believe the $270 billion projection is realistic as this growth is supported by what we are seeing across the GCC.”

He added that there is strong demand for physical infrastructure — ranging from airports and rail to hotels and event spaces — as well as for digital platforms that support business travel and mobility. Al-Faras noted that Saudi Arabia has developed a pipeline of projects in these areas and has shown “a clear willingness to partner with private capital.”

Raad cautioned that investors needed to carefully assess risks, as the massive scale of ongoing mega-developments could disrupt market balance if demand growth slowed.

She also highlighted potential regulatory shifts in visas, ownership, and taxation that might impact investment returns, along with increasing environmental, social, and governance pressures.

Companies are increasingly demanding low-carbon travel, which would require the timely adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and green-certified infrastructure.

Malik concluded: “Risks are very real, too. The biggest challenge will be timing and coordination. If infrastructure growth — number of flights, hotel rooms, venue capacity — doesn’t align across the board, there’s a risk of overcapacity in one area and bottlenecks in another.”

He added: “Regulatory complexity across countries and cities may slow seamless integration. Delivering not just on time, but to international quality standards, will be crucial to sustaining momentum.”

As MENA’s business travel sector surges, the region’s blend of innovation, sustainability, and economic diversification cements its status as a global leader — with no signs of slowing down.",,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:12.200137

“Proyek ini menjadi bagian penting dari upaya PGE membangun ekosistem green hydrogen secara end-to-end, mulai dari produksi, distribusi, hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung transisi menuju industri rendah karbon,"" jelas Julfi.

""Fasilitas ini tidak hanya sebagai pusat inovasi, tetapi juga model yang bisa direplikasi di wilayah kerja panas bumi lainnya, sekaligus membuka peluang percepatan off-grid solution untuk transportasi dan industri rendah karbon. Ke depan, peta jalan pengembangan PGE juga mencakup hilirisasi green ammonia dan green methanol sebagai solusi energi masa depan,” tambahnya.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi di Indonesia, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seluruh komitmen tersebut dinyatakan sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.

Pertamina Catat Produksi Migas Tembus 1 Juta BOEPD, Pendapatan Tembus Rp672 Triliun

PT Pertamina (Persero) berhasil menjaga kinerja operasional dan mencatat performa keuangan positif sepanjang semester pertama 2025 atau Januari hingga Juli tahun ini.

Langkah strategis Pertamina ini, dinilai sejalan dengan target pemerintah melalui Asta Cita untuk mewujudkan swasembada energi dan mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional.

Direktur Utama Pertamina, Simon Aloysius Mantiri mengungkapkan capaian tersebut dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) bersama Komisi VI DPR RI di Jakarta, Kamis 11 September 2025.

“Pertamina mencatat beberapa capaian, di antaranya temuan cadangan migas baru sebesar 724 juta barrel setara minyak (MMBOE) di wilayah kerja Rokan,” ujarnya dalam rilis resmi yang dikutip, Jumat 12 September 2025.

Produksi Migas Stabil, Temuan Cadangan Baru

Lebih lanjut, Pertamina hingga Juli 2025, mengungkapkan bahwa pihaknya mampu menjaga produksi migas (minyak dan gas) tetap di atas 1 juta barrel setara minyak per hari (BOEPD). Selain itu, penemuan cadangan migas baru ini bakal memperkuat ketahanan energi jangka panjang di dalam negeri.

Simon mengatakan, paruh pertama tahun ini menjadi momentum penting karena Pertamina berhasil menjalankan sejumlah program strategis, mulai dari produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pertama di Asia Tenggara dengan kapasitas 9.000 barrel per hari, hingga pengoperasian PLTP (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi) Lumut Balai berkapasitas 800 GWh (Gigawatt-hour) dan revitalisasi tangki Arun berkapasitas 127.200 meter kubik yang ditargetkan rampung pada akhir 2025.

“Pertamina SAF merupakan bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan yang dihasilkan melalui teknologi co-processing antara Kerosene (minyak tanah) dan Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah. Ekosistem bisnis UCO SAF bukan hanya mendukung swasembada energi nasional namun juga mampu mendorong perekonomian mikro dan ekonomi sirkuler,” terang Simon.

Proyek Energi dan Produk Hijau

Pertamina juga memperluas langkahnya melalui proyek Palawan di Filipina dengan kapasitas 285 MW (MegaWatt) serta meluncurkan Pertamax Green 95 di 160 SPBU dengan volume penjualan mencapai 4,83 ribu KL (Kiloliter) hingga Juli 2025.

Langkah ini menunjukkan keseriusan Pertamina sebagai perusahaan milik negara dalam mempercepat transisi energi, memperkuat ketahanan energi, sekaligus mendukung implementasi energi bersih.

Kinerja Keuangan Pertamina

Meski menghadapi tekanan dari penurunan harga minyak mentah, solar, hingga kurs dolar AS (Amerika Serikat) dibandingkan periode 2024, Pertamina tetap mampu menjaga kinerja keuangan.

Untuk Biodiesel, program B40 resmi berjalan pada 2025, dengan dukungan kilang hijau (green refinery) yang dapat memproduksi Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) untuk melampaui kebutuhan pencampuran biodiesel. Sementara Bioavtur (SAF), uji coba SAF berbasis minyak jelantah yang telah dilakukan Pelita Air menjadi wujud nyata transisi energi di sektor transportasi melalui pemanfaatan sumber daya lokal yang ramah lingkungan.

Terkait kendaraan Listrik dan Baterai, melalui Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC), Pertamina membangun ekosistem EV dan BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) dengan ambisi menjadi produsen terbesar di ASEAN. Adapun untuk Hidrogen dan e-Fuel, Pertamina tengah menyiapkan dua Stasiun Pengisian Hidrogen (HRS) di Daan Mogot (2026) dan Jawa Barat (2028), dengan kapasitas awal 200–500 kg/hari.

“Indonesia dianugerahi potensi energi bersih dan terbarukan yang melimpah, namun tetap ada tantangan di depan. Karena itu kita perlu bekerja sama. Transisi energi membutuhkan aksi kolektif dengan kolaborasi erat dari semua pihak.” Ujar Norman Ginting.

Headline Takeaway:

(CTAS) faces a mixed outlook as weak technicals suggest caution, but strong fundamentals and positive money flows offer a counterbalance.

News Highlights

May 29, 2025: A new report on the fuel ethanol market highlights opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel technology, potentially benefiting sectors with green innovation ties. While not directly related to Cintas, it underscores broader industry tailwinds in sustainability.

May 31, 2025: A series of reports on aid looting in Gaza and geopolitical tensions in the region raise concerns over global supply chains and humanitarian efforts. These developments may indirectly impact logistics and supply-demand dynamics across industries, including Cintas' service areas.

May 28, 2025: A new Pentagon policy tightens oversight on the procurement of non-commercial products. This could influence procurement decisions in industries with strong government ties. While Cintas is not a defense contractor, its corporate services may see ripple effects in the logistics and safety sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The recent analyst activity for Cintas is limited but tells a story. The simple average rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating (adjusted for performance history) stands at 4.30. This suggests a slightly more optimistic outlook when accounting for the track record of the analysts involved. The lone analyst, Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital, has an 80% historical winning rate but has rated the stock as Neutral recently.

However, the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), which is at odds with the generally optimistic weighted analyst expectations. This divergence could signal market uncertainty or underperformance in the near term.

Looking at the fundamentals, Cintas scores well in several key areas:

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 16.13%, with a model score of 7.54 (internal diagnostic score). This is a strong indicator of profitability.

Basic earnings per share (YoY growth rate): 19.35%, scoring 7.54.

ROA (Return on Assets): 4.79%, with a score of 7.54.

ROE (Return on Equity): 10.45%, scoring 7.54.

These fundamentals suggest a company that is growing and efficiently using its assets, even if the stock price is currently falling.

Money-Flow Trends

Despite the weak technical outlook, money-flow patterns show positive momentum. The overall inflow ratio is 55.90%, indicating substantial institutional and large-cap investor interest. The Extra-large inflow ratio is 62.30%, which is a strong signal from big-money players. This suggests that while the retail sentiment might be cautious, institutional investors are showing confidence.

The fund flow score is 7.91 (internal diagnostic score), labeled as good, and the overall trend is positive, even as the Small and Medium trends are negative. This points to a mixed retail investor sentiment, while the larger market participants are leaning bullish.

Key Technical Signals

The technical analysis for Cintas is bearish. The stock has 0 bullish indicators and 2 bearish indicators, with 1 neutral indicator. The overall technical score is 3.94 (internal diagnostic score), and the trend is summarized as weak, with a suggestion to avoid the stock.

Key technical indicators:

WR Oversold: Score of 3.73 (internal diagnostic score), indicating a neutral to slightly bullish signal historically, but not strong enough to override the bearish trend.

Bearish Engulfing: Score of 1.47 (internal diagnostic score), a strong bearish signal with a historical average return of -0.23% and a win rate of 36.36%.

RSI Oversold: Score of 6.62 (internal diagnostic score), suggesting moderate potential for a rebound, but not enough to tilt the overall trend.

Recent chart patterns show that WR Oversold was active on multiple dates (September 10, 9, 5, 8), and Bearish Engulfing appeared on September 5. This indicates a recent bearish consolidation phase. The key insight from the technicals is that the direction is unclear and bearish signals are dominant.

Conclusion

Cintas presents a mixed outlook. While the fundamentals are strong and money flows remain positive, the technical indicators are bearish, with no clear reversal signals. Given the internal diagnostic score of 3.94 (technical) and 7.54 (fundamental), the stock is a candidate for cautious observers but not for immediate buyers.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd30b25e4bc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:37.982358

Petrobras produz combustível de aviação com óleo vegetal

Ainda nesta semana, a Petrobras havia anunciado que, pela primeira vez em sua história, produziu combustível de aviação com óleo vegetal, também conhecido como SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ou combustível sustentável de aviação).

Durante o teste na refinaria Henrique Lage (Revap), em São José dos Campos (SP), foi realizada a mistura a partir do processo tradicional de produção do querosene de aviação (QAV).

O SAF pode substituir diretamente o querosene convencional sem necessidade de alterações nas aeronaves ou na infraestrutura de abastecimento, uma medida prática para reduzir as emissões do setor aéreo.

O teor de óleo vegetal no produto atingiu o patamar de até 1,2%, um marco fundamental na produção de combustíveis mais sustentáveis para a aviação.

Além da Revap, a refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, obteve a autorização da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF.

Veralto (VLTO) has seen a recent price rise of 2.67%, but analysts and technical indicators suggest a period of mixed signals and technical neutrality. The stock is currently caught in a tug-of-war between modest optimism and caution.

News Highlights

Recent news has largely stayed away from

, but global developments in the fuel ethanol industry and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have kept the broader market on edge. Here are two key developments:

New Ethanol-to-SAF Technology: A May 29 report from ResearchAndMarkets highlighted advancements in ethanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology. This could eventually benefit energy and biofuel firms, though Veralto itself isn’t directly mentioned.

Gaza Humanitarian Crisis: Reports of looted medical supplies in Gaza (May 31) have heightened global tensions, potentially affecting commodity and energy markets. While Veralto isn’t directly involved, such instability can indirectly impact investor sentiment.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Veralto has only one active analyst on the scene: Bobby Zolper of Raymond James, who has issued a ""Neutral"" rating in the past 20 days. This single voice doesn't provide a broad consensus, but it does highlight that expectations remain balanced for now.

Average rating: 3.00 (simple mean)

Weighted rating: 2.08 (performance-weighted)

Rating consistency: Analyst views are limited and show no strong dispersion, but the single rating is not bullish or bearish.

Price trend vs. ratings: The stock has risen 2.67%, but analyst expectations remain neutral. This suggests a mismatch between the current price action and broader expectations.

Key Fundamentals

The internal diagnostic scores (0-10) help highlight key financial metrics:

ROE (Return on Equity): 8.34 % → Score: 7.0 (moderate performance)

ROA (Return on Assets): 3.10 % → Score: 6.2 (room for improvement)

Net Profit Margin (Net income / Revenue): 41.42 % → Score: 4.1 (solid but not exceptional)

Total Profit Growth (YoY): 10.38 % → Score: 9.4 (strong positive momentum)

Net Profit Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders Growth (YoY): 15.50 % → Score: 7.5 (positive but less explosive)

Basic EPS Growth (YoY): 14.65 % → Score: 3.4 (modest gain with weak weighting in the model)

Veralto’s overall fundamental score is 7.04, suggesting a generally sound company, but with mixed signals in growth and profitability categories.

Money-Flow Trends

The big-money picture for Veralto is negative. All major inflow categories (Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large) show negative trends, with the overall inflow ratio at 47.38%. This means that capital is generally moving out of the stock, especially among institutional and larger retail players.

Small retail inflow ratio: 49.66%

Large institutional inflow ratio: 49.62%

Block inflow ratio: 46.96%

This suggests that while retail investors are still cautiously optimistic, larger players are scaling back or exiting the stock.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Veralto remains in a state of neutrality with no strong bullish or bearish signals. Here are the key insights:

Williams %R Overbought Signal: Internal score: 6.57 (suggesting limited strength)

Williams %R Oversold Signal: Internal score: 6.03 (mild bearish but not dominant)

Bearish Engulfing Signal: Internal score: 6.28 (cautionary signal, but not overpowering)

Recent Chart Patterns

Marubozu White (2025-09-11) – a strong bullish candle

WR Oversold (2025-09-03, 2025-09-02, 2025-08-29) – multiple bearish signals

WR Overbought & Bearish Engulfing (2025-08-28) – mixed signals

These patterns indicate a volatile and indecisive market — with long and short positions in a relatively balanced state. Traders are advised to watch closely for a breakout, as the current technical neutrality is unlikely to last forever.

Conclusion

With a technical score of 6.29 and a fundamental score of 7.04, Veralto is in a moderately watchful position. The recent price rise of 2.67% has yet to be matched by strong analyst consensus or strong technical momentum. While the company shows solid underlying fundamentals, the market remains cautious.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd380f2c538001.png,N,,2025-09-13 13:56:17.683983

She outlined five strategies: fleet renewal, advanced technology, renewable energy and sustainable fuels, operational efficiency, and market-based measures. Boeing’s latest models—including the 787 Dreamliner, 777X, and 737 MAX—deliver 20% to 30% greater fuel efficiency than the aircraft they replace, she said.

Sargin described sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as “the most effective solution over the next 30 years,” capable of cutting life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel.

Boeing is also investing in future technologies such as green hydrogen and electric flight.

Wisk, Boeing’s joint venture, has conducted over 1,750 test flights with a fully autonomous, all-electric air taxi since 2010. Boeing is also collaborating with NASA and GE Aerospace on a 1-megawatt hybrid-electric flight system.

Türkiye’s role in sustainable aviation

Sargin welcomed the sustainable aviation fuel mandate introduced by Türkiye’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

“For our country, this decision is an important step toward reducing emissions and aligns with global net-zero targets,” she said.

She emphasized Türkiye’s strategic position, noting its world-class airline and one of the world’s largest airports, and said Boeing is analyzing feedstock potential through the Türkiye Sustainable Aviation Platform (TSAA).

“We are evaluating the domestic biomass potential that can be derived from Türkiye’s agricultural sector,” she said.

Marking Boeing’s 80th anniversary in Türkiye, Sargin recalled that ties began in 1945 with the delivery of the first DC-3 aircraft.

“Today, Türkiye is not only a valued customer but also a critical part of our global supply chain, a hub of advanced engineering, and an important partner in shaping the future of sustainable aviation,” she said.

“From expanding our supplier network to investing in young talent, and from joint work on sustainable fuel platforms to next-generation technologies, we believe Türkiye will play an important role not only regionally but also globally in shaping the future of aviation.”",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2025/9/13/boeing-marks-80-years-in-turkiye-with-2b-in-procurement-focus-on-sustainability-3206848.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 06:56:24.059489

Durante o teste na Revap, foi misturado óleo vegetal ao processo tradicional de produção do querosene de aviação (QAV). O teor de óleo vegetal no produto atingiu o patamar de até 1,2%, um marco fundamental na produção de combustíveis mais sustentáveis para a aviação.

A Petrobras prevê que a produção comercial de SAF deve ter início “nos próximos meses”.

De acordo com o gerente geral da Revap, Alexandre Coelho Cavalcanti, a operação na Revap é “uma abordagem de menor investimento para a produção de combustíveis com conteúdo renovável, pois utiliza os ativos existentes”, avalia.

A consolidação da rota tecnológica de produção de SAF por coprocessamento é especialmente relevante para o mercado, considerando as futuras exigências do setor.

A partir de 2027, as companhias aéreas no Brasil deverão começar a usar, obrigatoriamente, esse tipo de combustível, com base na Lei do Combustível do Futuro e da fase obrigatória do CORSIA, que é o programa da Organização da Aviação Civil Internacional (OACI) para redução e compensação de emissões de CO2 provenientes dos voos internacionais.

Transição energética justa

Segundo o diretor de Processos Industriais e Produtos da Petrobras, William França, o avanço representa um marco tecnológico para a Petrobras e um passo importante para o Brasil no cenário global de combate às mudanças climáticas.

“A iniciativa demonstra o compromisso da Petrobras com a inovação e a sustentabilidade, preparando-se para atender às demandas futuras de um setor aéreo mais sustentável”, disse o diretor.

Recentemente, a Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, obteve a autorização da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF. A previsão é que, a partir dos próximos meses, a refinaria inicie a produção para comercializar.

Port Lotniczy Katowice w Pyrzowicach przechodzi prawdziwą transformację. Trwa największy w historii portu program rozwoju infrastruktury, którego realizacja zaplanowana jest aż do 2032 roku. Inwestycja ta umocni pozycję Katowice Airport jako ważnego węzła logistycznego w Europie, co przełoży się na rozwój gospodarczy regionu i kraju.

Co to jest multimodalny węzeł przeładunkowy i dlaczego jest tak ważny?

Sercem programu rozwojowego jest budowa multimodalnego węzła przeładunkowego towarów i paliw, który powstaje w oparciu o infrastrukturę kolejową. Nowy terminal cargo i zaplecze paliwowe budowane są w południowo-wschodniej części lotniska, na terenie dawnej bazy paliwowej, która została zrekultywowana w 2019 roku.

Kluczowym elementem inwestycji jest bocznica kolejowa, która połączy teren portu z linią kolejową nr 182 (Zawiercie–Tarnowskie Góry), aktualnie rewitalizowaną przez PKP PLK. Powstanie również specjalne torowisko przeładunkowe, składające się z trzech torów odstawczych o długości około 300 metrów każdy.

Dzięki temu możliwy będzie przeładunek towarów i paliw bezpośrednio między pociągami, cysternami a infrastrukturą lotniskową, co znacząco zwiększy efektywność transportową i logistyczną portu.

Nowoczesna stacja paliwowa – serce multimodalnego węzła w Pyrzowicach

Integralną częścią projektu jest budowa nowej stacji paliwowej, wyposażonej w trzy do czterech zbiorników o pojemności 1000 m³ każdy. Zbiorniki te będą mogły obsługiwać zarówno tradycyjne paliwa lotnicze, jak i nowoczesne paliwa alternatywne typu SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Paliwo dostarczane koleją będzie przeładowywane do autocystern, które z kolei będą rozwozić je do stanowisk tankowania samolotów znajdujących się w strefie operacyjnej lotniska.

Inwestycja o strategicznym znaczeniu militarnym dla NATO i UE

Realizacja inwestycji ma charakter nie tylko cywilny, ale także wojskowy – węzeł zaprojektowano zgodnie z wymogami interoperacyjności NATO i UE, umożliwiając sprawne wsparcie mobilności wojskowej. To szczególnie istotne w kontekście geopolitycznym.

Po rosyjskiej inwazji na Ukrainę w 2022 roku, katowickie lotnisko pełniło kluczową rolę w dostarczaniu pomocy humanitarnej i materiałowej. Nowa infrastruktura pozwoli w przyszłości jeszcze skuteczniej wspierać działania z zakresu mobilności wojskowej w ramach Unii Europejskiej.

India is creating a plan through 2050 in response to the tightening of international regulations on aviation emissions, primarily through the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). For international flights, this plan calls for blending targets of 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030.

India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy. It aims to become a global supplier of green aviation fuels, in addition to meeting domestic blending targets, by leveraging its extensive bio-energy capacity and alliances with companies such as ISMA, Deloitte, and TERI. High manufacturing costs, classification difficulties, and feedstock sustainability remain significant challenges that require resolution.

Why Does India Need a National SAF Policy?

One of the industries contributing to greenhouse gas emissions at the quickest rate of growth is aviation. India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy, and it has become essential as India’s aviation sector grows. In addition to adhering to international regulations, this program aims to improve energy security and establish India as a player in the global green fuels market.

Global Compliance: SAF blending is crucial as India must adhere to CORSIA regulations after 2027.

Net-Zero Goal: India’s aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 is supported by a SAF policy, as aviation is a significant source of emissions.

Energy Independence: National energy security is strengthened by lowering dependency on imported jet fuel.

Export Potential: India can be positioned as a future center for SAF exports with a well-designed policy.

Industry Alignment: Coordinates efforts across several ministries, including Finance, Renewable Energy, Civil Aviation, and Petroleum.

What Are the Challenges in Scaling SAF Production?

India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy, and its adoption is hampered by infrastructure, legislative deficiencies, and expense, despite its potential. Scaling is challenging due to high costs and classification obstacles, and securing a sustainable supply of feedstock is another urgent concern. India will require more research funding, improved incentives, and robust policy assistance to fulfill future demand.

High Costs: Synthetic SAF can cost up to seven times as much as regular jet fuel, and SAF is three times more expensive.

Classification Problems: Because SAF is still classified as a fossil fuel, it is not eligible for bioenergy subsidies such as the Gobardhan plan.

Feedstock Dependency: Diversification is necessary to prevent conflicts between food and fuel due to the current reliance on sugarcane, molasses, and bagasse.

Infrastructure Readiness: Networks for distribution, mixing, and storage must be upgraded quickly.

Global Competition: India is still establishing standards for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), while countries such as the US and Brazil already have them.

Côte d’Ivoire, one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies (projected 6.5 percent GDP growth in 2025), stands to benefit from enhanced exports

The A330neo offers a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions and is certified to operate with 50 percent SAF, aligning with EU environmental regulations and global decarbonisation goals.

Coincides with AfCFTA and SAATM initiatives, emphasising the need for infrastructure upgrades, customs modernisation, and regulatory harmonisation to unlock West Africa’s air cargo potential.

West Africa’s ambitions to emerge as a global trade and logistics hub took a decisive step forward this week with the delivery of Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first Airbus A330-900neo. The widebody aircraft, the first of two on order, was officially handed over in Toulouse on 4 September 2025, marking the Ivorian flag carrier’s entry into long-haul operations. For a region long dependent on foreign carriers and transshipment hubs, the addition of this next-generation aircraft signals a calculated strategy to strengthen direct trade links between Abidjan and major markets in Europe, the Middle East, and eventually North America.

The development comes at a pivotal moment for Africa’s aviation sector, which has defied broader global cargo headwinds. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), African airlines recorded a 10.8 percent year-on-year increase in cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs) in the first half of 2025, significantly outpacing the global average of 4.6 percent. Côte d’Ivoire’s own economic trajectory, with GDP growth projected at 6.5 percent in 2025 by the World Bank, makes this investment more than a fleet upgrade; it represents a long-term bet on West Africa’s capacity to compete in global logistics.

From regional carrier to global competitor

Air Côte d’Ivoire has operated primarily as a regional airline, serving 22 destinations across West and Central Africa. Until now, the carrier relied on narrowbody aircraft, limiting its ability to directly serve high-value export markets. The addition of the A330neo changes this equation, providing up to 20 tonnes of bellyhold cargo capacity per flight.

This expansion is strategically significant for the region’s exporters. Côte d’Ivoire remains the world’s largest cocoa producer, and agriculture continues to dominate trade flows, with cocoa, cashews, and coffee forming a significant share of airfreight volumes. Access to widebody capacity enables faster transit times for perishables, pharmaceuticals, and electronics, reducing dependency on European or Middle Eastern hubs that often add costs and delays to shipments.

For many African carriers, this kind of fleet renewal is more than a prestige move; it is about asserting control over trade corridors. By deploying widebodies from Abidjan, Air Côte d’Ivoire can position itself as a hub carrier, competing with regional giants like Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways.

Soft power and ESG strategy

The delivery flight carried five tonnes of humanitarian aid, including school supplies and health materials, to Abidjan. Coordinated by the Airbus Foundation and supported by Aviation Sans Frontières, this mission underlines Air Côte d’Ivoire’s emphasis on corporate social responsibility. Goods were distributed through NGOs LifeShine and La Bienfaisance to support education and health initiatives in Côte d’Ivoire’s capital.

While symbolic, these actions contribute to the airline’s ESG (environmental, social, and governance) narrative. As global shippers increasingly evaluate partners on sustainability and social responsibility, African carriers adopting ESG-focused strategies can strengthen international partnerships and attract cargo volumes from multinational clients seeking ethically aligned service providers.

A new trade and cargo hub for West Africa

The Gulf of Guinea region is emerging as a focal point for trade flows between Africa, Europe, and Asia. Abidjan’s geographical positioning offers natural advantages, enabling shorter flight times to Europe compared with southern African hubs and providing access to underserved markets in West and Central Africa.

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s A330neo deliveries come as part of a broader strategy to integrate the country more deeply into global supply chains. Côte d’Ivoire already accounts for nearly 40percent of global cocoa production, with annual cocoa exports exceeding $5 billion, according to the International Cocoa Organization. Diversification into high-value exports—pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, and electronics—requires the type of reliable cold-chain and time-sensitive logistics capacity that widebody aircraft can provide.

Data from WorldACD shows that African air cargo volumes surpassed 2.4 million tonnes in 2024, with growth concentrated on Africa–Europe lanes. Yet over 70percent of this freight was uplifted by non-African carriers. By building capacity and a hub model in Abidjan, Air Côte d’Ivoire could capture a greater share of these volumes, reducing reliance on foreign operators and increasing regional value retention.

Aircraft efficiency and regulatory compliance

The A330neo represents a leap in efficiency, offering a 25percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. It is certified to operate with up to 50percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligning with Airbus’ ambition to achieve 100percent SAF compatibility across its fleet by 2030.

Such investments are increasingly critical for African carriers. Europe’s environmental policies, including the EU’s Fit for 55 package and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), place growing pressure on operators to demonstrate emissions reductions. For carriers like Air Côte d’Ivoire, fleet renewal is not only a competitive decision but also a regulatory one, ensuring continued access to lucrative European markets.

Ground infrastructure: A bottleneck to watch

While aircraft investments attract headlines, the success of this strategy will depend heavily on airport and logistics infrastructure. Félix Houphouët-Boigny International Airport, Abidjan’s main gateway, is undergoing phased modernisation, but industry insiders highlight the need for accelerated investment in cold-chain facilities, customs automation, and bonded warehousing to fully capitalise on new widebody capacity.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), now operational, aims to boost intra-African trade by 52percent by 2030, according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa. Yet achieving this potential requires regulatory harmonisation, improved airport cargo-handling standards, and full implementation of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM). Without these policy measures, even the most modern aircraft could be underutilised.

West Africa’s strategic positioning

The decision to expand internationally mirrors strategies seen in East Africa, where Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways have built globally competitive networks. However, West Africa remains relatively underdeveloped in terms of hub infrastructure. Abidjan’s rise could rebalance Africa’s air cargo map, creating new routing options for global shippers and reducing overreliance on Gulf and European transshipment points.

Africa’s economic growth trajectory supports this vision. According to the African Development Bank, West Africa is expected to post 4.1percent GDP growth in 2025, driven by agriculture, mining, and energy exports. Airlines that can bridge the gap between regional production centres and global markets will play a pivotal role in shaping trade patterns over the next decade.

Policy takeaways for stakeholders

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s A330neo delivery carries several strategic implications for industry and policymakers:

Diversification of Cargo Hubs: Building Abidjan as a hub can decongest overutilised gateways like Addis Ababa and Nairobi, spreading regional traffic more evenly.

Sustainability as Market Access: Fleet modernisation and SAF adoption will increasingly determine African carriers’ access to international markets, especially in the EU.

Infrastructure Development as a Priority: Aircraft orders must be matched with investments in airport cargo terminals, cold-chain systems, and customs digitalisation.

AfCFTA and SAATM Synergies: Greater regulatory coordination could unlock the full potential of regional air connectivity, encouraging intra-African trade growth.

From ambition to execution

The delivery of Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first A330neo is a landmark moment for Côte d’Ivoire’s aviation strategy, symbolising both ambition and opportunity. Yet its success will depend on coordinated policy action, infrastructure development, and strategic partnerships. If fully realised, Abidjan’s evolution into a competitive cargo hub could provide exporters with direct access to high-value markets, strengthen regional trade resilience, and enhance Africa’s bargaining power in the global logistics sector.

For air cargo professionals, this signals a broader shift; African carriers are no longer passive participants in international trade corridors but are positioning themselves as architects of new supply chain networks.

In May 2025, Donald Trump made a deal allowing 17 relatives of a Sinaloa Cartel leader to enter the United States. These family members are the relatives of Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán.

January 6 defendants

On his first day in office, Trump issued a mass pardon for approximately 1,500 people connected to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Notable recipients included:

Oath Keepers and Proud Boys leaders: Commuted sentences for extremist group leaders like Stewart Rhodes, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, and other key figures involved in the riot.

Violent rioters: Pardoned dozens of individuals with records of violent offenses on January 6, including assault with a dangerous weapon against law enforcement.

Individuals with prior felonies: Some recipients of the January 6 pardons had prior serious convictions, including drug trafficking and manslaughter.

Esto significa que su producción está oficialmente habilitada para el suministro de biocombustibles en este sector estratégico.

La certificación representa un paso decisivo en el camino hacia la descarbonización de la aviación, ya que el biocombustible producido a partir de aceite de palma constituye una alternativa renovable frente a los combustibles fósiles tradicionales.

Según explicó Óscar Cifuentes, gerente general de Gremca, esta norma “permite, a través del incremento en la productividad, contar con materia prima certificada. En Colombia somos los primeros en lograrlo y, a nivel mundial, somos pioneros como empresa palmicultora. Este logro nos ubica en una posición de liderazgo, articulándonos con la Federación y con diversas entidades del sector para que la cadena productiva siga este ejemplo y avance hacia la certificación”.

Cifuentes también resaltó que el proceso no se limita únicamente al cultivo. “Es necesario certificar el aceite, el proceso de refinación y la producción de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). De este modo garantizamos, en primer lugar, la seguridad alimentaria, ya que una parte significativa del aceite de palma continúa destinada a la industria alimentaria. Sin embargo, una fracción que cumple con la normatividad puede redirigirse al biocombustible de aviación”, señaló.

La norma Corsia, impulsada por la Organización de Aviación Civil Internacional (OACI), establece directrices para reducir las emisiones de dióxido de carbono en el transporte aéreo a escala global.

Su implementación responde a la necesidad de avanzar en la sostenibilidad del sector aéreo y reducir la huella de carbono que genera el tráfico aéreo internacional.

En este contexto, la certificación de Gremca se convierte en un referente no solo para Colombia, sino también para la región, al demostrar que es posible vincular el sector agrícola con los estándares internacionales de sostenibilidad en la aviación.

La empresa ha dejado claro que este resultado no se alcanzó de manera aislada. Fue producto de un trabajo conjunto con la Federación Nacional de Cultivadores de Palma de Aceite (Fedepalma) y otras entidades aliadas, con el fin de motivar a más compañías a sumarse a este tipo de procesos de certificación.

El objetivo compartido es consolidar un ecosistema en el que la palma de aceite no solo tenga un papel en la industria alimentaria, sino que también sea un insumo estratégico en la transición hacia energías limpias.

¿Cómo es el proceso para convertir el aceite de palma en biocombustible?

Respecto al proceso de transformación del aceite de palma en biocombustible, Cifuentes explicó que todo inicia en las plantaciones, donde se cosecha la fruta de palma. Esta se traslada a una planta extractora, en la cual se obtiene el aceite crudo de palma. A partir de allí, una cantidad específica del aceite certificado se destina a la producción de SAF. Posteriormente, el aceite es enviado a una refinería, donde se somete a procesos de blanqueo y desodorización para dejarlo en condiciones adecuadas para la siguiente etapa. Finalmente, en la planta productora de SAF, el aceite pasa por un tratamiento con catalizadores que transforman su estructura molecular, convirtiéndolo en un combustible apto para motores de aviación.

Este proceso, aunque técnico y complejo, responde a estándares de calidad internacional que buscan garantizar la seguridad, la eficiencia y la sostenibilidad del combustible resultante.",https://www.valoraanalitik.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gremca.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 11:56:17.894082

Abstract

The most viable way to decarbonize aviation in the near term is through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), most of which is currently produced via the deoxygenation of fats, oils, and greases (FOG) followed by a separate isomerization step. Multifunctional zeolite-supported catalysts offer several advantages over existing formulations, such as enabling the use of waste FOG streams, performing their deoxygenation via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx), and effecting the synthesis of SAF in one-pot. Previous work has shown that while supported Ni-Cu catalysts can afford excellent results in the conversion of waste FOG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via deCOx, zeolitic materials represent promising supports in formulations employed for the synthesis of SAF. In this contribution, catalysts involving different zeolitic supports and the same Ni-Cu active phase were prepared, characterized, and tested in the conversion of brown grease to SAF to identify the carrier affording the best results. A Ni-Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the highest conversion and yield of SAF-like hydrocarbons relative to formulations supported on ZSM-22, SAPO-11, or SAPO-34 (these catalysts being referred to herein as NCZSM-5, NCZSM-22, NCSAPO-11, and NCSAPO-34).

Graphical Abstract

1. Introduction

The demand for aviation fuel is expected to more than double by 2050 and triple by 2070 [1], which is of concern since aviation already accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions [2]. Given that the electrification of aircraft is in its infancy, the most promising way to decarbonize aviation in the near to medium term is through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can be produced from several feedstocks via different technologies [3]. However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported that >80% of SAF is produced via the hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA) [4]. Processes utilizing fats, oils, and greases (FOG) as feedstocks—such as HEFA—are expected to remain the primary way to produce SAF for the foreseeable future given the maturity and widespread use of this technology [5].

Current HEFA processes are mostly based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction, which displays several shortcomings. Indeed, HDO-based HEFA requires large amounts and high pressures of hydrogen, which are typically only available at centralized facilities where this gas is produced from natural gas via steam reforming. In addition, HDO-based HEFA typically employs sulfided catalysts, which risk contaminating the product with sulfur [6,7], deactivate in the presence of water (a product of HDO) [7,8], are not regenerated online [9], and require FOG feedstocks low in impurities like phosphorus, metals, and free fatty acids (FFAs) [10]. Finally, SAF production via HDO-based HEFA involves separate deoxygenation and isomerization steps that result mainly in normal and branched alkanes but not in other SAF components, namely, cycloalkanes and aromatics. (Jet fuel—a mixture of C8–C16 hydrocarbons—comprises ~20 vol.% n-alkanes, ~33 vol.% iso-alkanes, ~27 vol.% cycloalkanes, and ~20 vol.% aromatics. These hydrocarbon families, respectively, confer jet fuel a high energy density, good cold flow properties, low freezing point, and seal-swelling properties [11]). This leads to SAF production facilities having separate units to (1) pre-treat the feedstock to remove impurities; (2) hydroprocess the pre-treated feedstock to yield n-alkanes; (3) isomerize the n-alkanes to iso-alkanes; and (4) separate the SAF from other fuel fractions via distillation, all of which adds complexity and cost.

Converting FOG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarbonylation/decarboxylation (deCOx) can avoid the drawbacks of HDO-based HEFA since deCOx reactions require smaller amounts and lower pressures of hydrogen and deCOx catalysts are typically supported metals that can be simple (non-sulfided), inexpensive (non-precious), and robust (resistant to deactivation). Moreover, these formulations can be regenerated online and upgrade waste FOG streams rich in impurities and/or composed mainly of FFAs such as brown grease (BG) [12]—i.e., FOG collected from wastewater streams—all of which is currently incinerated or landfilled [13,14]. Another advantage of deCOx formulations is that they can involve zeolitic materials as the support of multifunctional catalysts capable of performing deoxygenation and isomerization (but also cyclization and aromatization) reactions in “one-pot” [15]. Therefore, deCOx-based technology has the potential to convert currently unutilized waste FOG streams to a product mixture containing all families of hydrocarbons comprising aviation fuel and to do so in less steps or units, which can reduce both complexity and cost.

Previous work has shown that supported metal catalysts comprising Ni and Cu in a 4:1 proportion (by weight), can afford excellent results in the conversion of BG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via deCOx [12,16]. In addition, several zeolitic materials have been studied as supports for Ni-based catalysts used in the synthesis of SAF from oleaginous biomass, promising results being obtained using SAPO-11 [17], SAPO-34 [18], ZSM-5 [19,20], and ZSM-22 [21]. However, the literature lacks systematic studies in which the nature of the active phase and the reaction conditions employed are fixed and the zeolitic support is varied to identify the carrier(s) leading to the best results in the conversion of FOG to SAF. A notable exception is the work of Wang et al., who upgraded vegetable oil over Ni-based catalysts supported on SAPO-11, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, or β-zeolites and observed quantitative conversion, high isomerization activity, and decreased cracking over 8 wt.% Ni/SAPO-11, which was found to be the most promising among all catalysts studied [17]. The present contribution aimed to further address the aforementioned gap in the literature by supporting Ni and Cu in a 4:1 proportion (by weight) on several zeolitic materials and testing the resulting catalysts in the conversion of BG to SAF-like hydrocarbons via deCOx. The characterization of both fresh and spent catalysts was also undertaken to rationalize trends and elucidate structure–activity relationships.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Catalyst Synthesis and Fresh Catalyst Characterization

A series of catalysts involving 12 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Cu as the supported metals and different zeolitic materials—namely, SAPO-11, SAPO-34, ZSM-5, and ZSM-22—as the carrier were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation employing the materials and methods described in Section 3.1. The synthesized catalysts were analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to experimentally determine their metal loadings. The results of these tests, which are summarized in Table A1 within Appendix A, show that the experimental loadings obtained are close to the nominal loadings targeted.

The textural properties of the bare supports employed and of the catalysts synthesized were determined by means of N2-physisorption, the results of these measurements being included in Table 1. The data in Table 1 clearly show that the textural properties of the bare zeolitic supports vary widely. For instance, surface area, which follows the trend ZSM-22 < SAPO-11 < ZSM-5 < SAPO-34, ranges from 59.6 to 525.7 m2/g. Unsurprisingly, the surface area of the supported metal catalysts is lower than that of the bare supports, since metal deposition causes some degree of pore filling.

The X-ray diffractograms of the catalysts synthesized are included in Figure A1 within Appendix A. The diffraction peaks so denoted are attributed to NiO, peaks at 37.3°, 43.3°, and 62.9°, respectively, representing its (111), (200), and (220) planes [22]. The fact that no peaks associated with Cu species were observed can be attributed to the lower Cu loading and/or to Cu species being highly dispersed, which is in agreement with previous reports on NCSAPO-11 [15]. The Scherrer equation was applied to the diffraction peak at 43.3° to determine the average NiO particle size, which afforded the values included in Table 1. The average NiO particle size ranges from 21.9 to 28.4 nm and it follows the trend NCZSM-22 < NCSAPO-11 ≈ NCSZM-5 < NCSAPO-34. Notably, the latter trend is the same as that observed for the surface area of the bare supports, which is at odds with the fact that carriers with a higher surface area would be expected to stabilize supported metals in the form of smaller particles and suggests the presence of amorphous and/or sub-nanometric Ni species not detected by means of XRD. Additional information regarding metal dispersion was acquired through H2 pulse chemisorption measurements, which resulted in the data included in Table 2. The trend observed for H2 uptake and metal-specific surface area—namely, NCSAPO-34 < NCSAPO-11 < NCSZM-5 < NCZSM-22—is also indicative of the metal dispersion trend followed by these catalysts.

More detailed information regarding the elemental composition and chemical environment of the surface of the catalysts surveyed was acquired via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, which were performed after reducing the catalysts using the conditions and approach described in Section 3.2. Table 3 summarizes the results of these analyses in terms of the surface concentration and oxidation state of the supported metals, while Table A2 and Table A3 in Appendix A provide more detailed information vis-à-vis the elemental surface composition and the supported metal species of the catalysts as determined via XPS. Full scans as well as Ni and Cu 2p regions of X-ray photoelectron spectra are included in Figure A2, Figure A3 and Figure A4 within Appendix A. The XPS analysis of NCSAPO-11 and NCZSM-5 clearly showed that the entirety of Ni is present in the metallic state in these two catalysts. Similarly, the low intensity of the Ni 2p3/2 satellite peak in the spectra of NCSAPO-34 and NCZSM-22 suggests that Ni is mostly reduced in these two formulations. However, the inhomogeneous character of these two samples precludes the neutralization of charging effects, which cause peak broadening and the appearance of a supplemental peak in the spectra of NCZSM-22 and NCSAPO-34, respectively, and make it impossible to accurately determine Ni0 concentration.

The most salient feature of the data in Table 3 is the surface concentration of the metals, which follows the trend NCSAPO-34 > NCZSM-22 >> NCSAPO-11 > NCZSM-5. However, the surface concentration of Cu0 shows a slightly different trend—namely, NCZSM-22 > NCSAPO-34 > NCZSM-5 > NCSAPO-11—which confirms that the reducibility of the surface metals varies across these catalysts. Indeed, the trend observed vis-à-vis the fraction that Cu0 represents of the total surface metal is NCSZM-5 > NCSZM-22 > NCSAPO-34 > NCSAPO-11. Admittedly, it is difficult to relate particle size information estimated from XRD, metal-specific surface area results from H2 pulse chemisorption, and surface concentration data on the supported metals derived from XPS. This can be attributed to the heterogeneity of Ni and Cu species expected to result from the deposition of these metals via impregnation on the zeolitic materials employed, since Ni and Cu can be expected to be present not only as nanoparticles but also as amorphous clusters and/or sub-nanometric species at different locations of the carriers. For instance, the fact that the Cu2O signal is observed at much higher binding energy than usual—see Table A3 and Figure A4 in Appendix A—may suggest an ionic Cu species exchanged on zeolitic Brønsted acid sites. Nevertheless, the results above provide valuable insights regarding the size of metal nanoparticles, metal-specific surface area, as well as the surface concentration and oxidation state of the supported metals.

The acidity of the catalysts used in this study was assessed by means of ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) given the importance of surface acidity to several reactions and phenomena of interest, including isomerization and cracking as well as coke-induced deactivation. In terms of total acidity, the catalysts followed the trend NCSAPO-34 > NCSAPO-11 > NCZSM-5 > NCZSM-22 (see Table 2), which is in overall agreement with previously reported acidity trends for the bare supports [23,24]. In contrast with previous reports focused on the bare supports, most acidity was found to be associated with weakly acidic sites (from which ammonia desorbs below 250 °C) albeit a smaller number of sites of medium acidity (from which ammonia desorbs between 250 and 400 °C) were also found to be present (see Figure 1). The fact that strongly acidic sites (displaying higher NH3 desorption temperatures) were not observed can be attributed to the fact that these sites would represent the main adsorption and anchor sites for metal precursors and particles, respectively. Thus, any strongly acidic sites—along with most sites of medium acidity—would be occupied during catalyst synthesis, leaving only weakly acidic sites and the relatively small number of sites of medium acidity observed.

2.2. BG Conversion to SAF

The BG sample used in this study was analyzed via gas chromatography (GC) and found to be composed entirely of C18 and C16 FFAs as shown in Table A4 in Appendix B. This feed was upgraded over the catalysts synthesized using the equipment and methods described in Section 3.3, the experimental approach employed used for the GC analysis of both the feed and the reaction products being described in Section 3.4. The results of these upgrading experiments and analyses are summarized in Table 4. Saliently, both BG conversion and the fraction of aviation fuel-range alkanes (C8–C16 hydrocarbons) in the reaction products follow the trend NCSAPO-11 < NCSAPO-34 < NCZSM-5 ≈ NCZSM-22, which suggests that 12 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Cu catalysts supported on the socony mobil zeolites tested afford better results that the corresponding formulations involving the silicoaluminophospate zeotypes essayed. Parenthetically, the inferior conversion of NCSAPO-11 is likely not due to its relatively low concentration of surface Ni0 and Cu0 (see Table 3), which represent the active sites for the deCOx reactions. Indeed, NCZSM-5 affords quantitative conversion despite displaying a slightly lower concentration of Ni0 than NCSAPO-11 and the second lowest concentration of Cu0 of all catalysts tested. Similarly, differences in conversion cannot be assigned to the surface Ni0/Cu0 concentrations of these catalysts, since the ratios for NCSAPO-11 and NCZSM-5 are 10.5 and 3.0, respectively. Instead, differences in conversion can be attributed—at least in part—to the propensity of these formulations towards fouling and coking (see Section 2.3). ZSM-supported catalysts also afford better results than SAPO-supported formulations in terms of the selectivity to the hydrocarbon families comprising aviation fuel, since the catalyst supported on SAPO-11 and SAPO-34 displayed almost identical selectivity of ~88.5% n-alkanes, ~7.5% iso-alkanes, ~2.5% cycloalkanes, and ~1.5% aromatics. In contrast, the catalysts supported on ZSM-5 and ZSM-22 showed lower selectivity to n-alkanes and higher selectivity to the other hydrocarbon families comprising aviation fuel. Among these, NCZSM-5 afforded the highest selectivity to iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes, as well as a yield of aromatics within the 8–25% specified for aviation fuel [25].

To elucidate the fate of the oxygen atoms in the BG feed, the gas stream produced during the upgrading of BG over NCZSM-5 was analyzed with a refinery gas analyzer (RGA) and found to contain 0.45% CO and 0.26% CO2 as the only oxygen-bearing compounds, which is unsurprising since deoxygenation proceeds via deCOx. The other compounds detected by the RGA were hydrogen (the reaction atmosphere) and C1–C6 hydrocarbons resulting from COx methanation and/or the cracking of alkyl chains, which is consistent with previous reports [26].

Figure 2 shows the carbon number distribution of the product mixtures resulting from upgrading experiments. Irrespective of the catalyst support employed, most hydrocarbon products were found to be within the C8–C16 range characteristic of aviation fuel (with the remainder being ≥C17 hydrocarbons). However, SAPO-supported catalysts show noticeable differences in terms of the carbon number of the reaction products relative to those obtained over ZSM-supported formulations. Indeed, NCSAPO-11 and NCSAPO-34 yield a considerable and comparable amount of C15 and C11 hydrocarbons, these two carbon numbers representing the most abundant among the products obtained over these catalysts. In contrast, NCZSM-5 and NCZSM-22 afford much lower amounts of C15, since lighter (≤C13) hydrocarbons are favored among which C10 hydrocarbons are the most abundant.

These results cannot be readily explained by the relative acidity of the supports favoring cracking reactions—since ZSM-supported catalysts have a total acidity that is either slightly (NCZSM-5) or much lower (NCZSM-22) than SAPO-supported formulations—albeit this can be attributed to the fact that most of the acid sites in these supports are either weakly or moderately acidic (see Figure 1) with a relatively low activity towards C-C cleavage [27,28]. Instead, these results can be rationalized by invoking the metal-specific surface area of ZSM-supported catalysts, which is much higher than that of their SAPO-supported counterparts (see Table 2). Indeed, it can be argued that a higher concentration of surface metal sites would increase the metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds, which in turn would favor the formation of lighter—at the expense of heavier—hydrocarbons. The relatively low concentration of surface Ni0 within NCSAPO-11 can only partially explain the lower cracking activity of this catalyst, since NCZSM-5 displays a slightly lower concentration of surface Ni0 (see Table 4). In addition to the aforementioned heterogeneity of Ni and Cu species, the lack of a consistent trend in this regard can also be attributed to the relative distribution of these metals on the catalyst surface, since C–C hydrogenolysis reactions require contiguous Ni atoms to be catalyzed [29] and Cu can disrupt Ni adjacency [30], curbing cracking reactions through both geometric and electronic effects [12,30,31,32]. However, the ability of Cu to disrupt Ni adjacency and cracking reactions appears to be limited in these catalysts, since NCSAPO-11 displays a lower cracking activity than NCZSM-5 despite having a much higher surface Ni0/Cu0 concentration ratio (10.5 vs. 3.0).

Given that the results in Table 4 preclude the identification of NCSZM-5 or NCZSM-22 as the most active catalyst (since both formulations afforded quantitative conversion), upgrading experiments were performed in which the amount of BG employed was doubled relative to that specified in Section 3.3. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table A5 in Appendix B. Surprisingly, both catalysts displayed quantitative BG conversion and practically identical selectivity to C8–C16 hydrocarbons under these conditions. An additional effort was made to identify the most active formulation between NCSZM-5 or NCZSM-22 by halving the amount of catalyst relative to the amount used in the experiments that afforded the data in Table A5. However, conversion remained quantitative, which suggests that testing these catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor, which would allow for additional variables (such as space velocity and time on stream) to be investigated—represents a better approach to enable this comparison. Previous reports on the upgrading of BG over supported Ni-Cu catalysts indicate that fixed-bed reactor experiments are also the best was to study catalyst stability and recyclability [12]; however, those experiments fall outside of the scope of this work and will be the focus of a future contribution.

2.3. Spent Catalyst Characterization

In an effort to rationalize the results of BG upgrading to SAF, the spent catalysts were analyzed by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Indeed, TGA offers a way to determine the amount of type of the carbonaceous deposits that accumulate on the catalyst surface in the course of the reaction, which can in turn serve as a gauge for the catalyst deactivation caused by fouling and coking. Parenthetically, coking and fouling represent the main deactivation mechanism for supported Ni-Cu catalysts used for the conversion of oleaginous biomass to fuel-like hydrocarbons, since metal loss due to leaching or even the formation of volatile carbonyls has been found to be negligible [12,15]. The results of these TGA measurements are summarized in Figure 3. Saliently, the spent NCSAPO-11 catalyst displayed the most significant weight loss (~18%), which suggests that fouling and coking could explain (at least in part) the fact that it shows the lowest BG conversion among all catalysts tested. NCSAPO-11 is unique in the sense that it represents the only spent formulation displaying considerable weight losses below 400 °C—which can be assigned to the removal of residual solvent, reactants, products as well as soft coke—as well as weight losses above the same temperature that can be attributed to the combustion of hard coke or graphitic carbon [33]. Indeed, spent NCSAPO-34 displays the vast majority of its weight loss below 400 °C, whereas spent NCZSM-5 and NCZSM-22 undergo most of their weight loss above this temperature.

In short, it can be argued that coking and fouling can only be invoked to explain catalytic activity when the catalyst displays both a relatively low surface area and a high propensity for coking as is the case for NCSAPO-11. All other formulations display a moderate degree of coking (like NCZSM-22), a relatively high surface area (like NCSAPO-34), or both (as is the case for NCZSM-5). The analysis by means of TGA of the catalysts spent in the experiments resulting in the data within Table A5 seems to corroborate this conclusion, since the weight loss spent NCZSM-22 and NCZSM-5 displayed, respectively, remained unchanged and increased only slightly (see Figure A5 in Appendix B) with no impact on conversion. Lastly, it should be noted that the TGA results can only be partially explained invoking acidity. Indeed, the least acidic catalysts—namely, NCZSM-22—displays the lowest degree of fouling and coking as would be expected. However, the extent of coking and fouling observed for the other catalysts does not show a linear relationship with acidity, which suggests that other variables (like the concentration and relative distribution of Ni and Cu on the catalyst surface) are at play.

2.4. Catalyst Recycling Studies

The recyclability of the catalyst that afforded the most promising results—i.e., NCZSM-5 (see Section 2.2)—was assessed by testing this catalyst in five sequential BG upgrading reactions. Between reactions, the spent catalyst was regenerated through a procedure comprising a calcination step under static air (to remove carbonaceous deposits from the spent catalyst surface) and a reduction step identical to the one used before the first upgrading reaction (to re-reduce the supported metals oxidized during the calcination step). The results of these experiments are summarized in Figure 4.

Notably, BG conversion remained quantitative across all reaction cycles. Interestingly, the selectivity to C8–C16 hydrocarbons was 100% in cycles 1 and 2, dropped to 86.5 and 82.7% in cycles 3–4 (due to the formation of oxygenates and C19 hydrocarbons) and increased to 98% in cycle 5 (since much less oxygenates and no C19 hydrocarbons were produced in this last cycle). Parenthetically, the oxygenates detected in some products mixtures were aldehydes, alcohols, ethers, and ketones, which are produced in small amounts via the incomplete deoxygenation of FFAs in BG and through condensation reactions involving oxygenated intermediates. Finally, Figure 4 also shows how the selectivity to the different hydrocarbon families comprising jet fuel (n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cyclo-alkanes, and aromatics) varied significantly across cycles.

To rationalize these results, the post-mortem of the NCZSM-5 catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments was performed focusing on Ni-specific metal active sites and on surface acid sites associated with the zeolitic support. H2 pulse chemisorption results showed that the metal-specific surface area of the catalyst dropped from 1.414 m2/g in the fresh catalyst to 0.004 m2/g in the catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments, which clearly indicates a loss of metal sites likely due to metal sintering and coking. Similarly, NH3-TPD measurements indicate that the total acidity of the catalyst dropped from 1.44 mmol NH3/g on the fresh catalyst to 0.59 mmol NH3/g on the catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments, which is indicative of a loss of acid sites attributable to the accumulation of recalcitrant coke deposits.

The results of recycling studies and of the post-mortem catalyst characterization suggests that metal sites within NCZSM-5 have a very high intrinsic activity, since conversion remained quantitative despite the loss of most metal sites. Moreover, changes in the amount of metal active sites and surface acid sites are in line with the changes in selectivity observed during the recycling studies, since structural changes are bound to affect the performance of the catalyst in cracking, isomerization, cyclization, and aromatization reactions. In short, although these studies show the recycling stability of the catalyst in terms of conversion, the results also show variance in terms of selectivity, clearly indicating the direction of future work. However, the latter falls outside of the scope of the present contribution and will be the focus of future studies.

3. Materials and Methods

3.1. Catalyst Synthesis

Catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation—using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as metal precursors and SAPO-11 (6% SiO2, 48% Al2O3; ACS MATERIAL, Pasadena, CA, USA), SAPO-34 (~0.5 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; ACS MATERIAL), ZSM-5 (30 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; Zeolyst, Kansas City, KS, USA), or ZSM-22 (65–80 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; ACS MATERIAL) as the support—targeting a Ni loading of 12 wt.% and a Cu loading of 3.0 wt.%. After drying under vacuum overnight at 60 °C, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in static air.

3.2. Fresh Catalyst Characterization

The fresh catalysts prepared were characterized using previously described equipment and methods for ICP [34], N2 physisorption [35], XRD [32], NH3 TPD [36], H2 pulse chemisorption [36], and XPS [15,32,37]. Briefly, ICP was performed using a Varian 720-ES analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), while XRD was carried out on a Phillips X’Pert diffractometer (Philips Analytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation at 0.02° step size. NH3 TPD and H2 pulse chemisorption experiments were performed on an Autochem II analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) outfitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Thermostar mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer, Aßlar, Germany). For each experiment, 250 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-tube quartz reactor connected to the instrument and heated by a clamshell oven. Prior to analysis, the catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 1 h under 10% H2/Ar. For NH3 TPD, after cooling the reduced catalyst to 30 °C, the sample was exposed to a flow (100 sccm) of 1% NH3/N2 for an hour before purging with a flow (100 sccm) of Ar for another hour to remove physisorbed NH3. The sample was then heated to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min while NH3 desorption was monitored using the mass spectrometer signal at m/z = 16. For H2 pulse chemisorption, after reduction the reactor was purged with Ar at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to 45 °C. Pulses of 0.025mL (STP) H2 were then introduced to the reactor in 3 min intervals using Ar (50 sccm) as carrier gas, the TCD being employed to monitor H2 breakthrough. Pulses were continued until the amount of breakthrough H2 detected via TCD became constant. For XPS analyses, catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2 at 350 °C for 3 h in a pre-treatment chamber connected to the instrument and allowing the transfer of pre-treated samples into the XPS analysis chamber without exposure to air. XPS was performed using a PHI 5000 Versaprobe—Physical Electronics (Chanhassen, MN, USA)–apparatus using a monochromatic Al Kα1 X-Ray source with energy of 1486.6 eV, accelerating voltage of 15 kV, power of 50 W, and spot size diameter of 200 μm. Spectra were processed using the CasaXPS software package (version 2.3.25PR1.0).

3.3. Catalyst Testing for BG Conversion to SAF

Catalyst testing was conducted in a 100 mL stainless steel reactor—Autoclave Engineers (Erie, PA, USA)—operated in semi-batch mode. After placing 0.5 g of the formulation to be tested in the reactor, closing the latter, and purging the system with Argon, the catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 3 h under 100 psi and a flow (60 sscm) of 10% H2 in N2. Subsequently, the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature and the system was purged with Argon. Then, a solution comprising 1.8 g of BG—which was produced by “Greasezilla™” a product of Downey Ridge Environmental Company (Lansing, WV, USA) and has the composition in Table A4 within Appendix B—dissolved in 22.75 g of dodecane (99+% Sigma Aldrich) was introduced to the reactor through a port in the reactor head using a needle connected to a syringe containing the feed. After sealing the reactor, Argon was replaced with H2, which was used to pressurize the system to 580 psi and establish a flow of 60 sccm using a backpressure regulator and a mass flow controller, respectively. The reaction mixture was then heated to 375 °C and kept at said temperature for 3 h under constant mechanical stirring (1000 rpm). All experiments were performed in duplicate to ascertain both reproducibility and the statistical significance of the results.

3.4. Analysis of BG and Its Catalytic Upgrading Products

The identity and quantity of all compounds comprising the BG feed employed and the liquid products stemming from its catalytic upgrading were determined via dual detection GC using instrumentation and methods described in detail in a previous contribution [38]. Briefly, analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with both MS and flame ionization detectors. The inlet was operated in split mode (split ratio 25:1; split flow 50 mL/min) using an initial temperature of 100 °C. The inlet temperature was increased immediately upon injection (at a rate of 8 °C/min) to a final temperature of 320 °C, which was maintained for the duration of the analysis. The initial oven temperature (45 °C) was increased upon injection first to 325 °C (at a rate of 4 °C/min) and then to 400 °C (at a rate of 10 °C/min). This temperature was then maintained for 12.5 min, making the total run time 90 min. An Agilent J&W DB-5HT column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.1 μm) rated to 450 °C was employed along with a constant He flow of 2 mL/min. Quantification was performed using cyclohexanone as internal standard. Agilent Chemstation and Separation Systems Inc. (Gulf Breeze, FL, USA). SimDis Expert 9 software were used to perform chromatographic programming and to process the chromatographic data acquired. Solvents (i.e., chloroform and dodecane) were quenched and subtracted prior to data processing. A representative chromatogram—corresponding to the liquid products stemming from the upgrading of BG over NCZSM-5—is provided in Appendix C as Figure A6. In addition, a table including the retention time (RT) of each peak in this chromatogram along with its corresponding compound name, compound carbon number (CN), and percent area under the curve (% AUC) is provided in the same appendix as Table A6.

3.5. Spent Catalyst Characterization

Spent catalysts were subjected to TGA using a Discovery Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer—TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA)—after being dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight to remove water. Dried spent catalysts held in a platinum TGA pan were heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under a flow (50 sccm) of air.

3.6. Catalyst Recycling Studies

Recycling studies were performed using NCZSM-5, the most promising formulation identified in catalyst testing runs. After each upgrading reaction, the spent catalyst was recovered via filtration, rinsed with chloroform, dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven, and calcined under static air at 450 °C for 5 h using a muffle furnace to remove carbonaceous deposits (see Figure 3). The calcined catalyst was then subjected to the same catalyst testing procedure described in Section 3.3, adjusting the amount of feed employed to keep the catalyst–feed ratio constant for five reaction cycles.

4. Conclusions

In this study, catalysts comprising Ni and Cu supported on various zeolitic carriers were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for the conversion of BG to SAF. Among the tested formulations, a 12.8% Ni-3.2% Cu/ZSM-5 (NCZSM-5) catalyst exhibited the highest BG conversion and selectivity to SAF-like hydrocarbons. Specifically, the NCZSM-5 catalyst achieved a BG conversion of 99.9% and a jet fuel yield of 87.3%. Moreover, NCZSM-5 afforded SAF-range products containing n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics, all integral components of aviation fuel. The results obtained compare favorably to those recently reported by Ritmun. Indeed, this author also found that a 12.5% Ni-2.5% Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the best results among a series of Ni-Cu formulations supported on various zeolites—including SAPO-11 and ZSM-5—in the conversion of palm oil to SAF [39]. A notable difference is that while palm oil is an edible feedstock composed almost entirely of triglycerides, BG is a waste stream that is typically incinerated or landfilled and is 100% FFAs. The latter is significant, as current HEFA technology typically avoids feedstocks with FFA levels exceeding 25% [40]. This highlights the potential of BG as a viable and underutilized resource for SAF production.

Additionally, this study addressed a gap in the literature by systematically varying the zeolitic support while using the same active phase and reaction conditions in the conversion of BG to SAF. The findings demonstrate that ZSM-5 offers superior performance relative to other supports tested, including SAPO-11, SAPO-34, and ZSM-22. This contrasts with the results of Wang et al., who found that SAPO-11 led to the best results when they upgraded vegetable oil over Ni-based catalysts supported on SAPO-11, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, or β-zeolites [17].

Overall, the results presented herein provide valuable insights into catalyst design for SAF production from FOG. Particularly, they underscore the role of zeolitic supports in optimizing performance and suggest that the latter may be dependent on the nature of the active phase and/or the feedstock employed.

While passenger demand rebounded swiftly in 2022 and 2023, structural challenges—ranging from decarbonization mandates to shifting consumer expectations—have created a complex landscape for profitability. As airlines grapple with these headwinds, the role of organizations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in shaping recovery strategies has become critical. This analysis explores the interplay between these structural challenges and the industry's path to sustainable profitability.

Structural Challenges: A New Era of Constraints

The most pressing structural challenge facing airlines is decarbonization. The aviation sector accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, and regulatory pressures to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are intensifyingIATA - Airlines[ 1 ]. To meet this goal, airlines must invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric propulsion technologies, and operational efficiencies. However, these transitions come at a cost. SAF, for instance, remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel, creating a financial burden for carriers already strained by high debt levels from pandemic-era losses.

Evolving passenger expectations further complicate the equation. Post-pandemic travelers now prioritize health and safety protocols, digital convenience, and personalized services. Airlines must modernize IT systems, enhance contactless experiences, and invest in staff training to meet these demands—all while managing razor-thin profit margins. Additionally, the rise of low-cost carriers and ancillary revenue models has forced traditional airlines to rethink pricing strategies, often at the expense of long-term profitability.

Recovery Dynamics: IATA's Role in Shaping the Path Forward

Amid these challenges, IATA has emerged as a pivotal actor in guiding the industry. The organization's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, for example, provides a standardized framework for tracking and certifying SAF usage, enabling global compliance with environmental regulationsIATA - Airlines[ 1 ]. By streamlining this process, IATA aims to reduce administrative costs for airlines and accelerate the adoption of greener fuels.

Similarly, the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) program has reinforced operational resilience. Enhanced safety protocols not only rebuild passenger confidence but also mitigate the risk of costly disruptions—a critical factor in an industry where delays and cancellations can erode profitability. IATA's advocacy for harmonized global standards has also reduced fragmentation in regulatory requirements, allowing airlines to allocate resources more efficiently.

However, the road to recovery remains uneven. While major carriers in North America and Europe have shown stronger financial resilience due to robust domestic markets, airlines in Asia and Africa continue to lag. Currency fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, and underdeveloped infrastructure in emerging markets further strain their ability to compete.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the airline sector presents a paradox: long-term growth potential is tempered by near-term volatility. The push for decarbonization, while essential, requires capital-intensive investments that could weigh on short-term earnings. Conversely, airlines that successfully integrate sustainability into their business models—such as those leveraging IATA's frameworks—may gain a competitive edge.

A key risk lies in the misalignment between regulatory timelines and technological readiness. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set ambitious carbon offset targets, but the scalability of current SAF production remains uncertain. Airlines that overcommit to unproven technologies risk stranded assets.

On the flip side, opportunities exist in ancillary revenue streams and digital transformation. Airlines that innovate in areas like dynamic pricing, loyalty programs, and in-flight connectivity could unlock new profit centers. The integration of artificial intelligence for demand forecasting and route optimization also offers a pathway to cost efficiency.

Conclusion

The post-pandemic airline industry is at a crossroads. Structural challenges like decarbonization and evolving passenger expectations demand strategic reinvention, while IATA's initiatives provide a roadmap for navigating these complexities. For investors, the key lies in identifying carriers that balance regulatory compliance with operational agility. As the sector transitions toward sustainability, profitability will depend not just on filling seats, but on redefining what it means to fly in the 21st century.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757703912846.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-12 23:56:23.933886

The aircraft’s special livery marks the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Papua New Guinea. The intricate design was brought to life by a dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters who worked to apply 11 distinct colours using a special airbrushing technique.

This delivery highlights the A220’s strong position in its segment, combining the longest range (6,700 km) with the lowest fuel consumption in its class – 25 percent less than previous-generation aircraft. The A220-100, which serves the 100–135 seat market, is a crucial component of this modern airliner family, while the larger A220-300 is tailored for the 120–160 seat segment. This Air Niugini A220-300 is configured to accommodate a total of 138 passengers, a testament to its flexibility and suitability for the carrier’s network.

The A220 is poised to become the centrepiece of the airline’s regional and international fleet, providing a new level of operational efficiency and passenger comfort. Its unmatched efficiency, coupled with a spacious cabin and the range to connect various destinations, positions it as an exemplary fit for the carrier’s network and its overarching objectives for long-term growth.

The airframe integrates 40 percent advanced materials, resulting in a lighter-weight aircraft. The A220 also incorporates optimised aerodynamics with a newly designed nose and tail cone, both of which contribute to reducing drag. In fact, the A220 has the smallest fuselage wetted area – the surface directly in contact with the air – in its class.

The A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF™ engines, offering a 25 percent reduction in carbon emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target for all aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100 percent SAF by 2030.

David Valaer, Founder and CEO of Green Taxi Aerospace, said, “This collaboration is about taking action today to show meaningful progress in aviation sustainability with technology that makes operations cleaner and more efficient.”

The Zero Engine Taxi™ benefits include the potential of saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel as a result of more efficient taxing processes that, in turn, contribute to cost savings.

“Our Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what we can control today while we innovate future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” said Sangita Sharma, director of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab.

Delta is committed to a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, and with around 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, the global airline is focusing its efforts under three pillars: ‘What we Fly, How we Fly, and The Fuel We Use.’

Notes:

This partnership is a first in the US. We had a clue this was coming back in August after meeting David Valaer at the Pris show. We followed up with him for a conversation.

Airlines, being the competitive bunch they are, will not allow any competitor to have even a smidgen of advantage. Expect others to follow Delta’s lead.

This etaxi solution will likely find traction among regional jets first, so the Big Three are likely to be the first movers. Or the two others following Delta’s first move.

Regional jets spend a lot more time on a taxiway than bigger aircraft. They are likely to show the highest benefit.

Success among the US regionals is also likely to be copied elsewhere.

One last point: US regional airlines are desperate for a solution to their operational costs. They can’t get new fuel-efficient aircraft because of the myopic Scope Clause. But they can tweak their current fleets to extract better economics. Green Taxi is a step in that direction.

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen secured the pledge in Riyadh this week during meetings with senior Alfanar executives, including vice-chairman Sabah Al Multaq, as he promoted the Teesside Freeport to global investors. Houchen said: “It is outstanding news that Alfanar has committed to delivering this project on Teesside. “Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion.” The facility will also plug into the Northern Endurance Partnership’s carbon capture and storage network being developed off Teesside’s coast, avoiding over 750,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions a year. Backed by £40m of government funding from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund, the plant is one of several schemes putting Teesside on the map as the UK’s capital for low-carbon aviation fuels. https://lnkd.in/eYujrpr8",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHmUYoxlGF-gQ/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZk_psvIKkAg-/0/1757709521072?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ZTFFZxguv6gFQlRIeXw-J55SvyDKVFyIsFzdnN-B-ek,N,,2025-09-13 03:56:35.527658

The Deputy Minister will participate in the Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting and the Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable Fuels on Monday, 15 September, to place South Africa at the centre of high-level global discussions on implementing and collaborating on hydrogen policies.

According to the department, Gina will engage with Japanese officials on international collaboration, demand stimulation, and supply chain development between South Africa and Japan.

The Ministerial Meetings will be held in collaboration with Expo 2025 Osaka, an event that brings together people and innovations from around the world to address global issues and showcase Japan's technological capabilities in achieving a hydrogen-powered society.

“The engagements will serve as a bedrock to create institutional foundations for market-based hydrogen trading and price discovery, an essential step towards legitimising hydrogen as a tradable energy asset,” the statement read.

Japan is committed to ensuring that its supply chains are secure, transparent and interconnected on a global scale.

The department said Japan also aims to establish global markets that will substantiate its investments in hydrogen production, transportation and utilisation technologies.

In advancing the sustainable fuels agenda, Japan's primary objective is to ensure the widespread implementation of sustainable fuels, particularly in industries that are challenging to regulate, such as aviation and shipping.

“The country has expressed commitment to expediting the global adoption of biofuels, e-fuels, and e-methane as part of its Initiative for Sustainable Fuels and Mobility with Brazil. In addition, Japan aims to diversify the global energy supply ahead of COP30.”

From 16 to 18 September, the Deputy Minister will engage in discussions with representatives from the Japanese government, academic institutions, and commercial entities, including Toyota, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, as well as the universities of Kyoto and Osaka.

The discussions will focus on science, technology and innovation-related matters, such as nanotechnology, carbon recycling, astronomy and space science technologies.

Green industrialisation

Speaking ahead of the mission, Gina said the Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable Fuels holds considerable significance for South Africa, as the government aims to expedite the diversification of its energy portfolio to foster sustainable and inclusive growth.

“For example, to reduce the carbon intensity within the aviation sector, South Africa aims to learn from Japan's advancements in sustainable aviation fuel. Accordingly, strengthening cooperation with Japanese research institutions and enterprises specialising in sustainable aviation fuels and renewable energy sources will be essential,” said the Deputy Minister.

Gina stated that the insights gained from the mission will be instrumental in developing a robust infrastructure for renewable hydrogen and sustainable fuels in South Africa, with the potential to transform key sectors of the economy.

These include the transformation of the energy and mining sector to decarbonisation operations and power generation.

Advancing the transportation and aviation sectors through the promotion of environmentally sustainable fuels and hydrogen-powered mobility will accelerate South Africa's transition to cleaner fuels, thereby reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.

In addition, South Africa's manufacturing sector supports the expansion of new industries in hydrogen storage, fuel cells and electrolysers, while the agricultural sector supports the production of low-carbon fertilisers and strengthens the food supply chain.

""These initiatives have the potential to promote green industrialisation, create jobs in energy-intensive industries, and enhance the resilience of transport and logistics networks, thereby supporting South Africa's broader social and economic development objectives,” said Gina.

The department said Japan remains a strategic ally for South Africa in scientific research, development and innovation since formalising a scientific and technological cooperation agreement in 2003.

“In future, the country aims to leverage Japan's expertise in vehicle manufacturing, electronics and the commercialisation of research to enhance collaborative initiatives in industrial development and technological innovation,” said the department. – SAnews.gov.za",https://www.sanews.gov.za/sites/default/files/2012/images/news_story_template/202509/gina5.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:56:32.311077

Decarbonization of maritime vessels presents unique challenges.
In adding marine vessels to the RFS, which already covers land-based vehicles and aviation, the bill would seek to put marine fuel applications on an equal footing with other fuel uses.
Moreover, Ms. Metcalf testified on Wednesday, the industry is also actively supporting international regulations on maritime shipping.","The global maritime sector underpins international trade, transporting over 80 percent of the world’s goods. Marine shipping is highly efficient, but the sector is still responsible for 3 percent of all global GHG emissions and ships burn approximately 300 million tons of fossil fuels every year. Although the energy intensity of shipping has fallen in the last two decades, the volume of shipping has increased by a greater amount, so energy use for shipping has increased by five percent since 2008.

The most used fuels in maritime shipping today are marine gas oil and heavy fuel oil – a fuel that results in significant particulate matter and smog in port communities. LNG is a small but rapidly growing fuel for shipping; biofuels account for less than one percent of fuel used for shipping.

Decarbonization of maritime vessels presents unique challenges. Vessels need access to fuels at ports, with resulting infrastructure requirements for the fuel supply, and fuels must have sufficient energy intensity to carry the vessels great distances. That energy intensity can also create safety challenges during storage. While vessels that are used in fixed trade patterns can be designed to use the fuels available at the specific ports at which they trade, chartered vessels must be able to refuel at any port.

Marine engines are also typically designed for a specific fuel type. The vessel size and tonnage requirements affect the engine choices and power needs, which dictate the fuels and propulsion system options. These needs, and therefore fuel options, vary widely across vessel types, from containerships, to tankers, to dry bulk carriers, to passenger vessels, to tug/barge units.

RFS for Ocean Going Vessels

On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee explored this issue of maritime shipping during a legislative hearing in which the committee examined S. 881, the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act, among other Clean Air Act legislation. S. 881 has been introduced by Senator Pete Ricketts, (R-NE) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The Committee called two witnesses to speak on this piece of legislation:

Kathy Metcalf, President Emeritus of the Chamber of Shipping of America

Nikita Pavlenko, Program Director, Fuels and Aviation, The International Council on Clean Transportation

The Renewable Fuel Standards program currently excludes ocean-going vessels; this bill would allow renewable fuels used in ocean-going vessels to generate and retain renewable identification numbers (RINs). RINs create revenues for vessel operators and help to narrow the price gap between renewable fuels and conventional fuels. In adding marine vessels to the RFS, which already covers land-based vehicles and aviation, the bill would seek to put marine fuel applications on an equal footing with other fuel uses.

However, as Mr. Pavlenko pointed out in his testimony, as an opt-in provision that doesn’t fully reduce the price gap between biofuels and conventional fuels, it is unlikely that the bill would materially expand the use of biofuels in marine shipping. A similar provision in 2014 amended the RFS to include jet fuel but has not materially affected sustainable aviation fuel production; a decade later, SAF blending in the aviation sector remains below 1%.

Moreover, the expansion of the RFS could have deleterious consequences if it resulted in the EPA proposed higher volume targets for the RFS, which could result in land use changes as a result of the increased demand for soybean and palm oil cropland. Particularly when land is being converted to biofuel production cropland is currently functioning as a major carbon sick, e.g. when rainforests and forest land are converted to cropland, this can result in significant net increases in carbon emissions despite the lower direct emissions profile of the biofuel.

The maritime industry is actively engaged in efforts to develop alternatives to diesel fuel, with research and development ongoing for a variety of fuels including ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, LNG, LPG, biofuels, and battery-electric hybrid. Moreover, Ms. Metcalf testified on Wednesday, the industry is also actively supporting international regulations on maritime shipping. While the Chamber of Shipping of America testified support for Mr. Ricketts’ bill, they “support that bill as only one piece of an overall strategy to address decarbonization of marine transportation”. Much more important than any potential U.S. regulation is the international framework that has been set forth by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

IMO Standards

The U.S. is one of 108 members in the IMO, and vessels engaged in international trade must comply with international requirements, regardless of whether the U.S. decides to adopt them. In April of this year, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved a Net Zero Framework that includes a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions. If approved by the full IMO, the standards will go into effect in 2027 and become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage.

The framework seeks to achieve net zero maritime GHG emissions by the year 2050 through prices on emissions above set tiers that become more stringent over time. While non-compliance with those tiers will result in penalties, shipowners will be able to purchase credits from over-complying vessels, creating a revenue stream to support low-emission vessels.

Shippers are largely supportive of the proposal. For instance Maersk, which operates in almost 130 countries, has urged the IMO to adopt them, calling the proposals ambitious, proportional, and enforceable measures.

On the other hand, the U.S. is actively opposing the adoption of the IMO standards. On August 12, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy jointly released a statement that described the IMO proposal as “Global Carbon Tax”. In the statement they threatened countries for supporting the regulations, saying “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.” According to Reuters, the State Department is now actively approaching countries and threatening retaliation for support. For instance, the Netherlands was told it could face tariffs or other consequences if it supported the framework, according to a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.

Adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework will require approval by a two-thirds majority of parties at their next meeting in October. There is also a 16-month period after approval in which one-third or more of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or parties representing not less than 50% of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant fleet, can bring an objection. (Currently, the top five flag states are Liberia, Panama, Marshall Islands, Hong Kong, and Singapore – together they represent more than 50% of the world’s gross tonnage.) In April, 80% of voters approved the measure in the Subcommittee, with “no” votes primarily coming from oil-producing nations. It is unclear whether the pressure campaign from the U.S. will change the positions of the countries that previously supported and imperil adoption of the framework.

Biofuels and Soybean Markets

Unlike the Net Zero Framework from the IMO, Senator Ricketts’ RFS expansion bill is not primarily about addressing climate change. Underlying the pressure to expand the use of biofuels is the nation’s changed trading relationship with China under President Trump, and the implications that has for soybeans. By this point in last year’s soybean growing season, the U.S. had booked approximately 13 billion tons of soybean exports to China, whereas this year Chinese importers have yet to buy any soybean crops. China’s 23% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports have added approximately $2 per bushel to the cost of American soybeans, which has resulted in Brazilian soybeans being cheaper even during America’s peak growing season.

Soybean growers hope to expand the market for soybeans by expanding their use in fuel, in order to make up for the reduction in demand for American soybeans from China. However expanding the global market for soybeans could have profoundly negative consequences for global GHG emissions. Currently, the global supply of soybeans is expanding most in locations at high risk for deforestation, including Brazil, which has expanded production of soybeans by 35 percent over the past five years.",https://enotrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Maritime-Fuel-1030x579.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:56:36.559184

THE Federal government has revealed plans to commence the decarbonisation of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.

The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo said the challenges posed by climate change demanded decisive, concerted action by stakeholders to embrace decarbonisation. He suggested exploring group electrification of aprons and terminals, sustainable aviation fuel, SAF, corridors and waste-to-energy projects to reduce emission in airport operations.

The minister, who disclosed this at a stakeholders engagement on carbon emissions management at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, NAIA, in Abuja yesterday.

Represented by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Dr. Ibrahim Kana, at the event organised by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, Keyamo said:

“The global aviation community stands at a crossroads. On one hand, we are drivers of economic growth, connectivity, and national development.

‘’On the other, we are duty bound to address our environmental impact with utmost seriousness. The challenge of climate change is not a distant theoretical concern; it is a present and pressing reality that demands decisive, concerted action.

‘’For Nigeria, a nation poised for exponential growth in air travel and trade, embedding sustainability into the very core of our aviation infrastructure is not an option, it is an imperative for long term, resilient prosperity”

Also speaking, the Managing Director of FAAN, Mrs Olubunmi Kuku, said climate change posed a threat to global aviation industry, with potential negative ripple effects on business and livelihoods, if not properly managed.

Kuku, who was represented by the Director of Human Resource and Administration, Dr. Luqman Eniola, said FAAN was committed to decarbonising its operations through implementation of strategic measures.

On the essence of the stakeholder engagement, she said: “This forum is expected to help FAAN understand emission management measures, so we can integrate them into our carbon management plan for the airport, where it is necessary.”

She hinted that the FAAN ACA Team and the Carbon Emission Reduction Committee, CERC, carried out mapping in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Enugu and Port Harcourt, noting that electricity consumption accounted for about 90 per cent of the total emissions for Lagos airport from 2017 to 2023.

Kuku said implementation of emission reduction measures for the Lagos airport has commenced, adding that more actions would be considered in the reconstruction and expansion of the airport’s terminal buildings.

“The Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, is also important to us and this is why we are hosting this event today to ensure that we hear from you, and we will journey together.

‘’As they say, ‘never walk alone’! We want to walk with you, and we need you to walk with us in our determination of net-zero emissions target in our airport operations,’’ Kuku said.",https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-50.png,N,,2025-09-12 19:57:08.184606

Speakers were discussing the outlook for the sector at the DARE2X ""What Can Brussels Do For Green Ammonia: European Industry, Policy and Regulations"" conference in the Belgian capital on Thursday.

""Global ammonia production is a little under 200 million tonnes annually - if you were to use ammonia in shipping, you could basically double that market between now and 2050,"" said panellist Stephen Jackson, CEO of Ammonia Europe, who stressed that Ammonia Europe sees the maritime sector as the ""main...lead market"" for green ammonia demand.

It is ""feasible"" that as much as ""900 million tons of ammonia"" could potentially be ""needed by 2050,"" said Topsoe's Rob Stevens, Secretary and President Emeritus at the Ammonia Energy Association (AEA), citing high-case AEA projections which identified the key demand growth areas as shipping, fertiliser, and for ammonia as a hydrogen carrier.

The problem facing green ammonia is ""developing the new end uses and ensuring that the fuel is available and available at cost for the new demand markets,"" stated Jackson.

""We are predominantly targeting the maritime sector and pushing hard for the adoption of the IMO framework,"" continued Jackson, adding that for the ""new value chains"" the issue is ""demand, demand, demand.""

""We need those demand signals, and we need the price of clean fuels to come down,"" said Jackson.

Regulatory risk

Asked whether the US government's recent threats against the IMO's net zero framework — seen by many as vital to making green ammonia viable as a marine fuel — might undercut projected maritime demand for green ammonia, panellists noted that an agreement could still be reached, without Washington's cooperation.

""We share similar concerns about the US trying to torpedo the whole agreement,"" said Jackson, but he stressed that in the maritime industry ""the US maybe doesn't weigh quite as much as it does in other sectors, and we do have good chances of getting [the IMO legislation] through.""

Similarly, Stevens said that the AEA is working with the IMO and emphasised the organisation's international structure, and suggested that shippers might come to use different fuels in different jurisdictions.

Ammonia and methanol

Participants at the conference highlighted ammonia's growing role in shipping, and panellists suggested that ammonia might be able to overtake its main rival as a green fuel, methanol, in the coming years.

There are five operational ammonia-fuelled ships and 69 firm orders, including 29 ammonia carriers and 28 bulk carriers, AEA data stated. And there are a further 415 ships on order which comprise 154 ammonia dual-fuel vessels and 261ammonia-ready, the presentation continued, also noting successful bunkering tests at Rotterdam, Singapore and Pilbara.

Citing legislation and the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector, Stevens predicted that ""aviation, in my opinion, is going to out-compete shipping for biogenic carbon,"" supplies of which may be limited. That could in turn help bolster the case for shipping firms to adopt ammonia as a marine fuel.

Engine specialists Everllence — formerly MAN-ES — predicted ammonia will be the ""most prominent fuel"" for shipping by 2050.

The ""toxicity challenge...remains a crucial focus and requires responsible introduction of ammonia as a marine fuel,"" said Rasmus Holm Bidstrup, a director at Everllence.

Bidstrup also noted that he sees little demand so far for hydrogen as a marine fuel or for on-board crackers due to hydrogen's properties and ammonia's smooth combustion.",https://www.qcintel.com/i/qci_logo_sq_300x300.png,N,,2025-09-12 20:56:24.113457

oi-Dennis Abraham James

Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has announced that the blending of isobutanol with diesel will soon be scaled up. Gadkari made the announcement while speaking at The India Sugar & Bio-Energy Conference 2025 and stated that work has already started on it reports the Economic Times.

Gadkari also confirmed that ethanol blending with petrol has now touched the 20% mark. He added that the government is working on increasing the ethanol blend for sustainable aviation fuel as part of its wider strategy to strengthen India's renewable energy sector.

The minister explained that ethanol blending programmes have directly impacted crop prices. Corn farmers, for example, have earned more than ₹42,000 crore under the current initiative. Surplus crops, such as corn, are increasingly being channelled into the energy sector, helping to secure steady incomes for farming communities.

He further said India is producing surpluses of rice, wheat, sugar, and corn. Converting these into biofuels has significantly raised farm earnings across states. Ethanol production, he pointed out, has also relieved the sugar industry from delays in payments to cane farmers, ensuring smoother financial flows.

Gadkari addressed concerns raised over the ethanol-blended petrol programme mandating 20% ethanol in petrol, stressing that fears about engine damage and warranty lapses were unfounded. All government testing agencies, he noted, have confirmed that no technical issues exist in implementing E20 fuel across the country.

Gadkari recalled that several petitions had been filed against the E20 mandate, questioning its legality and safety standards. He highlighted that the Supreme Court recently dismissed those petitions, removing major obstacles to implementation. This cleared the way for nationwide adoption of E20 petrol without legal uncertainty.

Gadkari underlined that ethanol blending is improving incomes for corn farmers while strengthening India's energy security profile. This direct link between agriculture and energy, he said, represents a core element of the government's strategy to support farmers and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Impact of Isobutanol-Diesel Blending on Vehicles Aspect Details Fuel Properties Isobutanol has higher energy content and lower water absorption than ethanol, making it more compatible with diesel engines already in use across India. Emission Impact Blending isobutanol with diesel reduces smoke, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide. Small blending levels require no major engine modifications, easing adoption. Driver Experience Performance differences are minimal at lower blends. Vehicles run smoothly with little to no effect on mileage or engine behaviour. Sources

Significant Milestone

Brand new A220 named “People's Balus” departed Airbus' final assembly line in Mirabel towards Port Moresby with scheduled stops in Vancouver, Honolulu, and Fiji.

This delivery marks the start of Air Niugini's fleet modernisation programme with eight A220-100 aircraft ordered directly from Airbus and three A220-300s leased from Azorra.

Airline’s A220-300 aircraft is configured to carry 138 passengers.

The aircraft is painted in a special livery dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. A dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters applying 11 distinct colors using an airbrushing technique brought the special design to life.

A220 Confident Player on the Market

Powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF engines, Airbus A220 combines the longest range of up to 6,700km with a 25% reduction in fuel consumption and 25% reduction in carbon emissions per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft.

Brand new A220s are made of 40% advanced materials, making them lighter. The newly designed nose and tail cone help to reduce drag. Furthermore, A220 has the smallest fuselage wetted area in its class, enhancing its efficiency even further.

Already today, A220 can fly with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aiming to be capable of operating 100% SAF flights by 2030.

Airbus A220-100 can carry 100-135 passengers, while the larger A220-300 can fit between 120 and 160 people. Spacious and quiet cabin boosts passengers’ comfort to a new level.

Airbus has received over 940 orders for the A220 Family of aircraft from more than 30 airlines and lessors, with 440 aircraft already delivered to customers. The A220 is operating more than 1,800 routes and serving over 480 global destinations, confirming its status as the leading single-aisle aircraft in the market.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68c43e968990525665321540_PM%2038%20745.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:12.984195

The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 11 September at Kaneka Malaysia’s site in the Gebeng Industrial Estate.
Developed under a 20-year supply agreement, the plant will be owned and operated by BACRE’s subsidiary, BACRE Gebeng, with Kaneka Malaysia as the buyer and land provider.
Kaneka Malaysia Managing Director Hiroyuki Nishimoto said the initiative shows the company’s focus on sustainability and innovation.
“This is a major step forward, marking Kaneka’s first biomass steam project here in Malaysia,” he said.","Japanese petrochemical company Kaneka has started building its first biomass steam plant in Malaysia, in partnership with renewable energy developer BAC Renewable Energy (BACRE), reports Bioenergy Insight.

The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 11 September at Kaneka Malaysia’s site in the Gebeng Industrial Estate. The RM 31 million (€6.9 million) project is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026.

The facility will produce up to 30 tonnes of renewable steam per hour, replacing natural gas and cutting around 30,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions each year. The project is part of Kaneka Malaysia’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases targeted by 2030.

Developed under a 20-year supply agreement, the plant will be owned and operated by BACRE’s subsidiary, BACRE Gebeng, with Kaneka Malaysia as the buyer and land provider. It will run on palm kernel shells, empty fruit bunches, and woodchips, using advanced combustion technology, automated ash handling, and strict emission controls.

In addition to direct CO₂ savings, the use of palm residues is expected to avoid methane emissions equal to 70,000 tonnes of CO₂ over the next decade.

Kaneka Malaysia Managing Director Hiroyuki Nishimoto said the initiative shows the company’s focus on sustainability and innovation. “This is a major step forward, marking Kaneka’s first biomass steam project here in Malaysia,” he said.

BACRE Director Hasnoel Ramly said the facility demonstrates how agricultural waste can be turned into clean energy. “It is not just about meeting Kaneka’s needs, but about helping Malaysia’s industries cut carbon,” he said.

The project’s delivery partners include Knight Frank Project Services (contractor), Boilermech Sdn Bhd (technology), and Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (finance), with Emnes providing sustainability support.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biomass-2.jpeg,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:15.351841

On this 24th anniversary of 9/11, I know the whole House will want to join me and, I am sure, the Leader of the House in sending our best wishes to the families and the friends of the victims of those horrendous terrorist attacks.

So, too, our best wishes go to those grieving the murder of Charlie Kirk in the USA, and to our own great colleague, the hon. Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson), for the terrible news she has had this morning.

I thank the recently departed Leader of the House, the right hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell). She and I had our disagreements; I do not think there is much doubt about that. She supported the wrong football team, and I struggled to get her to answer my questions, but she was diligent and effective in responding to Members across the House, as well as in Committee. Without getting too teary about it, I will even miss her appalling puns.

But it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. Hurricane tax dodge blew away the Deputy Prime Minister and destroyed the Prime Minister’s much-vaunted phase two, but it has brought us the former Labour Chief Whip! He was a history teacher, and there cannot be many better forms of public service than that. After his distinguished career channelling industriously away in the usual channels, I warmly welcome him blinking into the bright lights of the Dispatch Box.

I had somehow thought that, having plumbed the depths of incompetence over the summer, the Government would now settle down a bit. How naïve—how desperately foolish—I was. The No. 10 team were obviously taking the mickey. They were laughing at us. “You think this is incompetent?”, they said, “We have hardly got going. We can do vastly better than that. Resets are for wimps—let’s have a full-blown crash reshuffle. Let’s have a new Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary, as well as a new Deputy Prime Minister. And let’s undermine the Chancellor of the Exchequer by ostentatiously lining up the former Chief Secretary to replace her. The markets will really welcome that. Even better—let’s have an election for deputy leader of the party. People are already scared to death about all the taxes coming in the Budget, but they will be completely reassured if we run a Labour leadership election at the same time. Ideally, we can make the deputy leader a former Cabinet Minister whom the Prime Minister has just abruptly fired. That’ll be good for stability. Oh, and we can go further! We can actively undermine relations with our closest ally if we throw in a major scandal over the Prime Minister’s personal choice as ambassador to the USA.”

If only this were a joke—instead, it is a tragedy. It is like we are trapped in an unending episode of “The Office”, with the Prime Minister as David Brent. The unions are ratcheting up their pay demands. The RMT is holding seven days of rolling walk-outs. The tube has come to a standstill. The only people who probably will not be affected are junior doctors in London, who have voted to have strikes until the new year, so they will be staying at home anyway. As the former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies remarked, it all shows how “staggeringly unprepared” Labour was for government, and it is we across this House and all our constituents who are paying the price for their arrogance and negligence.

The Leader of the House will only just be coming up to speed now, of course—one perfectly understands that—but, if I may, I would make one early request of him, with the utmost seriousness. He will know that many thousands of veterans, including hundreds in my constituency and in his, have had their lives thrown into uncertainty and bad—desperate, in some cases—anxiety by the Government’s decision to repeal the Northern Ireland veterans legislation, the Northern Ireland (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023. That was more than a year ago now. The Government promised a legally sound and effective legislative solution to the problem they had created, so could the Leader of the House let us know—now or in a written update before the recess—when the Northern Ireland Secretary will come to the House and publish that solution?

First, may I add my tribute to my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), for her excellent work as Leader of the House over the last year? She spearheaded the revival of the Modernisation Committee, which was a manifesto commitment, and oversaw the packed legislative programme that formed the basis of this Government’s first King’s Speech. I know that I am among many MPs across the House who want to thank her for her diligence and hard work.

I would also like to express my thanks to Colin Lee, the Clerk of Legislation, who retires this week, having joined the House service in 1988. MPs from across the House have valued his wise counsel over many years, and I know the whole House will wish him well.

I know that the House will also share my sadness about the death of Sir Roger Sands, who was Clerk of the House from 2003 to 2006. Sir Roger was a distinguished servant of the House for 41 years, and the House will want to convey our condolences to Lady Sands and Sir Roger’s family.

I thank the shadow Leader of the House for welcoming me to my place. Before I turn to his remarks, I should caution him, and indeed the House, that the last time I answered a question at the Dispatch Box was in the same year that the iPad was released. Both you and I, Mr Speaker, had a little more hair and of a darker hue. At the time the average price of a pint of beer was £2.91—there are people sat behind me who were not even old enough to buy alcohol then.

I am looking forward to these sessions with the shadow Leader of the House. We have been in the House together for a decade, but I cannot claim to know him particularly well, so I also went to Wikipedia to find out a bit more. He is a philosopher, a historian and an author of note. It is clear that he is a thinking Conservative, which is an increasingly rare commodity.

I associate myself with the right hon. Gentleman’s comments about the anniversary of 9/11, and about the death of Charlie Kirk. Let us remember that, in these circumstances, Mr Kirk’s family have been robbed of a father and a husband. There is no justification at all for political violence, whatever the views of the person involved.

I know that there will inevitably be a degree of knockabout about the state of the Government, and indeed of the Opposition, at business questions. I am happy, any day, to have a debate on the comparison between this Government’s 14 months and the right hon. Gentleman’s disastrous Government of 14 years. The only thing that we were unprepared for was the scale of the state that this country was in.

On the right hon. Gentleman’s substantive point about Northern Ireland, he knows that those are difficult matters and that the Government have given a commitment to bringing forward legislation. It is important that reassurances are in place, and I can tell him that the Government will be saying something shortly.

Let me finish with this. The shadow Leader of the House and I both have a deep respect for Parliament. I can give him and the House the reassurance that I take my responsibility, both as the Government’s representative in Parliament and as the House’s representative in Government, very seriously indeed.

Order. I expect this to run for around an hour, so Members can help each other with short and punchy questions. I call Elsie Blundell to set a good example.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his place. I applaud the Government for the bold action that they are taking to reform the criminal justice system, but more must be done to safeguard communities from violent reoffenders. In Middleton, I have been in touch with the courageous family of Michael Hoolickin. Michael was tragically killed in 2016 by a prolific offender who, despite supposedly being under the supervision of the local probation service, was not prevented from committing that appalling act, which has devastated the lives of Michael’s family and friends. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate in Government time so that Members may consider how to mitigate reoffending by violent perpetrators, and to give voice to the countless bereaved families out there, who deserve our compassion and focus?

That is without doubt an appalling tragedy, and my thoughts are with Michael’s family. It is important that we address reoffending—that is critical to public safety. On Tuesday we have the Second Reading of the Sentencing Bill. It aims to reduce offending, which has a devastating effect on victims. I encourage my hon. Friend to consider speaking in that debate.

I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.

I welcome the new Leader of the House to his place. I join him and the shadow Leader of the House in thank the previous Leader of the House, the right hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), for her sterling efforts, especially with so many people bobbing to ask questions every Thursday morning. I look forward to working with the Leader of the House in the various Committees on which we serve. I hope that he will follow the Government’s mantra to go further and faster, especially in modernisation.

Today is a big day for news. In particular, I echo the words condemning the appalling attack on the office of the hon. Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson)—[Hon. Members: “Hear, hear.”]—for whom I have a huge amount of respect.

I also join other colleagues in recognising that today is the 24th anniversary of 9/11. I am sure that the whole House agrees with the importance of remembering the victims, including British citizens, their families and those who continue to be affected physically and mentally by the attack and its aftermath.

This week, I again met victims and family members who have been subjected to ongoing injustice in our health system, in particular women and their children who were affected by shocking failures of medical devices or by the prescription of drugs that had devastating and life-changing consequences. While pregnant, my constituent Mary was prescribed the anti-epilepsy medication, sodium valproate. Very sadly, Mary joined so many other parents whose children were consequently born with significant birth defects. Like any parent of a disabled child, Mary is incredibly worried about their future and what support will be in place to look after them when she is no longer able to.

Victims and their families are exhausted. They have campaigned for many years to draw political attention to such matters, but it seems that successive Governments are not listening. Indeed, the Government have yet to respond to the Hughes report on the sodium valproate and pelvic mesh scandals that was published more than 18 months ago. Will the Leader of the House ask the Health Secretary to make a statement to this House to provide an update urgently?

I thank the hon. Lady for the tone of her question. I, too, look forward to working with her on the Commission and the Modernisation Committee. I commend her for campaigning on these important matters. Our sympathies are with those affected, and we are fully focused on how best to support patients and to prevent future harm. The Government will continue to listen to those affected in this complex area, and I will ensure that Ministers in the Department of Health and Social Care and in the Cabinet Office have heard her concerns. If my hon. Friend wishes to meet them, I will seek a meeting.

I had the pleasure of meeting Fergus, Freddie and Michael, members of the band Jam Tub, on a recent visit to Framwellgate school in Durham. These musicians are passionate about contributing to Durham’s cultural vibrancy, performing at events such as the much-loved Durham fringe festival. They contacted me after they noticed a distinct lack of venues across the whole of County Durham for young bands to perform and practice in, limiting their opportunities to grow as musicians. Will the Leader of the House agree to a debate in Government time on the importance of addressing regional cultural inequalities that are having an impact on the opportunities available to talented youngsters not just in Durham, but across the country?

As a Durham lad, I concur with my hon. Friend. It is a question not just of venues in Durham, but of venues across the country. The Government and, in particular, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are cognisant of that. We will be doing everything that we can to support them. Such issues affect a lot of constituencies. Therefore, should she choose to seek a Backbench Business debate or even an Adjournment debate, I am sure that she would receive support from across the House.

I call the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his position. I hope that we can have an early meeting to ensure that Back Benchers can have their voice heard in this Chamber, as before.

I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for 13 October, when we return from the conference recess. Given past experience of when we return from recesses, with the likelihood of statements and possibly urgent questions, and given that 78 people want to speak on the baby loss debate, I ask him to consider giving it protected time, so that they are able to relay their stories.

In addition, the business in Westminster Hall on Tuesday 16 September will be a debate on the International Day of Democracy. On 16 October, there will be a debate on World Menopause Day, followed by a debate on Ada Lovelace Day and Government support for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. On 23 October, there will be a debate on histological testing of excised moles, followed by a debate on the impact of NHS workforce levels on cancer patients.

I was very tempted to ask a question about the legalisation that happened in an employment tribunal earlier this week that means it is now possible to discriminate against people because of the football team they support. However, there is a much more serious issue: the situation in Nepal.

Following the deaths of 20 protesters, the Prime Minister of Nepal has resigned, the Parliament building has been set on fire and there is the threat of a military coup. I have many constituents with relatives in Nepal, and they are worried about the situation for their families. Will the Leader of the House arrange for a Foreign Office Minister to give a statement next week on what we are doing, as the United Kingdom, to protect those families and support the families in the United Kingdom?

I thank the hon. Gentleman for his work as Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, and I look forward to working with him. I will commit to an early meeting with him and also to regular meetings. He will know I have long taken the view that we need to take care on Mondays, whether it is with Backbench business or Government business, when we return from recess. I will give some thought to protected time, but the reality is that we can often manage the business of that day. The Government can manage the number of statements that go on; there is an issue around managing urgent questions, which is not the Government’s decision, but it nevertheless can be managed. I will return to that issue if need be.

On the really important matter of the situation in Nepal, let me say the recent loss of life and violence in Nepal is appalling. We support fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights, including the right to protest and peaceful assembly, but violence is not the way forward. I expect that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office will be across this matter, but I will draw his remarks to its attention.

School holidays are great, but they can be a really tough time for some families. Programmes such as the holiday activities and food programme help to bridge the gap by providing not only meals, but opportunities to build social skills and confidence with age-appropriate activities and a side serving of fun. This year I attended a HAF Plus event hosted by Northumbria University, at which young people aged 13 to 16 could do just that by taking part in activities from baking to gaming and martial arts, which were designed by young people themselves. I am delighted that the Government have invested to extend the scheme for another three years. Can we have a debate in Government time on how we can build on the success of HAF?

I am delighted to hear about the success of the programme; as an alumnus, I am not surprised that Northumbria University is helping to deliver such successful programmes. It is a fantastic thing for our region. We recently announced that £600 million is being invested to extend the holiday activities and food programme for another three years, and it has already reached more than half a million children in the past year. I will ensure that the Secretary of State has heard my hon. Friend’s question this morning.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his place and pay tribute to his predecessor, the right hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell)—I have to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) that she supports exactly the right football team.

People in Staffordshire Moorlands are very concerned that they should have their say about what happens in devolution plans. I am sure the Leader of the House will share my astonishment that the Reform-led Staffordshire county council has put forward a proposal for an east Staffordshire unitary authority, which would see not just Staffordshire Moorlands, but Burton, Uttoxeter, Tamworth and Lichfield drawn into a greater Stoke-on-Trent. Can the Leader of the House find time for a debate on the importance of local people having their own say on what happens in their local area?

I have to say to the right hon. Member—I was going to say my right hon. Friend, which she is in many ways—that I do not share her astonishment about that at all, because that is not unique in places where Reform has councillors and is running councils. Nevertheless, it is an absolute shame that Reform councillors appear to have gone back on their word in this case. One of the themes that must run through the work we do in local government is listening to local people. I have no doubt that she will continue to make that case, and I urge her to do so by organising a debate on the matter.

The Sikh Helpline is a fantastic charity in my constituency that supports Sikhs and people from all backgrounds with abuse, addiction and mental health issues. Over the summer, it did a 350-mile bike ride from Scotland to West Brom to raise money. Will the Leader of the House congratulate all the riders who took part and make time for a debate on the importance of such civil society organisations?

I first want to recognise the fantastic work that my hon. Friend did as my predecessor’s Parliamentary Private Secretary. I thank her for what I assume, therefore, is her first business question. A 350-mile bike ride is a terrific achievement, and I join her in recognising the importance of the work that the Sikh Helpline does for its local community. That is the sort of matter that could perhaps be raised in an Adjournment debate.

I too welcome the new Leader of the House to his position. I suspect he will have rather more fun at the Dispatch Box than his successor in the Government Whips Office will. I associate myself with his kind remarks about Colin Lee, whose service as one of the Clerks of the House has been exemplary. As one of the longest-serving members of the Speaker’s Panel of Chairs, I have had the pleasure of working with Colin over very many years. He will be sorely missed, and the House owes him a huge debt of gratitude.

Charities in the United Kingdom working in Africa tell me that as a result of the withdrawal of the United States Agency for International Development, women and children are dying in droves. The House will not be sitting when President Trump visits the United Kingdom, so we will not have an opportunity to send a clear message from this House at that time, but the Prime Minister will have an opportunity. Will the Leader of the House ask the Prime Minister to place on the agenda for discussion in the margins the withdrawal of USAID from Africa, which is having such a devastating effect?

I will commit to making the Prime Minister aware of what the right hon. Gentleman has asked, and I hope that will be heard when the President visits. Given the right hon. Gentleman’s experience and voice, I am pretty sure that message will be heard loud and clear.

One of the concerns that my constituents in Lowestoft raise is the closure of our public toilets due to the local council’s redevelopment of our old Wilko site. I am concerned that older and disabled residents in particular are being dissuaded from spending their time and money in our town centre’s shops due to fear of being caught short. I recently met the British Toilet Association, and I learned that in the US there is a national standard of one toilet for every 10,000 people. I therefore ask the Leader of the House whether we can have a debate in Government time on the need for more toilets on our high streets.

I could not agree more about the importance of the availability of toilets in our town centres. I am sure that issue comes to MPs’ attention very often. For many people—particularly those with complex needs or health conditions—the lack of a toilet can be the deciding factor in whether they leave the house. As the issue is clearly one for so many colleagues across the House, I think it would be a great topic for a Westminster Hall debate.

I too welcome the Leader of the House to his place.

Just three days ago, the BBC revealed how effortlessly an illegal vape laced with Spice can be purchased through Snapchat. One in six confiscated vapes in schools now contains Spice, which is described as a zombie drug—a prison drug. That is potentially condemning young people to a lifelong addiction and a criminal life, yet this week Ofcom wrote that such evidence does not meet the bar for enforcement action, even under the new Online Safety Act 2023. Can we have a statement from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to explain why Ofcom is refusing to hold social media companies accountable for drug dealing on their platforms, which puts thousands of young people at risk?

As a former drugs Minister, I absolutely share the hon. Lady’s concern. I have always thought that a strong line should be taken, and of course social media plays a role in that. I thank her for raising that really important issue, which is important for many people, not least parents. I will draw her concerns to the attention of the new Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary.

Our high streets in Leigh and Atherton are being undermined by illicit shops that are used for money laundering, illegal working and counterfeit goods. Raids on shops have taken place this week, leading to the seizure of over £10,000-worth of illicit goods, but the shops reopen within hours. Criminals are exploiting loopholes in the Licensing Act 2003, and councils are struggling to act. Will the Leader of the House confirm that restoring town centres is a Government priority, and will he allow time in Parliament to debate strengthening licensing laws and closing these damaging loopholes?

I congratulate my hon. Friend on her recent marriage. She raises a very important matter, and she is a doughty campaigner for her local community. High streets are a cornerstone of our local communities, and we are delivering 13,000 more officers in neighbourhood policing roles to tackle these matters. I will draw her comments to the attention of the relevant Department, but I encourage her to attend the next Home Office questions next week in order to raise this issue with Ministers directly.

I welcome the right hon. Gentleman to his new role.

May I echo the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Marie Goldman) in drawing his attention to the reply that his predecessor gave to me on 27 February concerning the Government’s response to the report on valproate? It really is necessary that we get a response. Janet Williams and Emma Murphy from the Independent Foetal Anti-Convulsant Trust came to see me this week. They are grateful for the opportunity to meet a Minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, but they really need a formal response to the commissioner’s report of 19 months ago.

The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I am new to this role, but I give him a commitment that I will follow that up after this session. Hopefully, I will be able to arrange a meeting with the Minister and get a response, which sounds overdue.

I have been supporting constituents living in ex-military housing on Embry Road in Wittering, in my constituency. The Ministry of Defence sold the homes years ago, but my constituents have been left in limbo because their properties remain wrongly classified under MOD commercial energy contracts. Despite repeated attempts, many have been unable to set up domestic accounts and are now suddenly facing backdated gas and electricity bills of up to £6,000. Does the Leader of the House agree that the issue of billing errors deserves a debate in Parliament? Will he ensure that Ministry of Defence officials contact me so that we can get those homes reclassified, which would allow my constituents to access fair tariffs and avoid further financial distress?

I thank my hon. Friend for raising that issue, and recognise that his constituents who have been affected will have gone through a great deal of stress in trying to deal with it. I will ask colleagues in the Ministry of Defence to reach out to him, in the hope that these matters can be resolved as soon as possible.

May I, too, welcome the new Leader of the House to his place?

The Trussell Trust’s “Hunger in Wales” report, which was published this week, shows that families with three or more children are far more likely to be forced to turn to food banks. The two-child limit is at the root of this injustice. It deliberately punishes children because of the number of brothers and sisters they have, and it is driving thousands of families into needless hardship. Will Labour in Westminster and Labour in Cardiff work together to grant debates in Government time on the urgent need for this impoverishing policy to be scrapped?

The right hon. Lady knows that we are already taking action to help working parents. For example, free breakfast clubs will put £450 in the pockets of working parents. We have doubled the amount of free childcare for eligible working parents, we are expanding free school meals and we are extending the household support fund. I mentioned earlier in my remarks the holiday activities and food programmes. We are doing a great deal.

I know that there are discussions and debates about what other action can be taken. The Government have a child poverty taskforce, which reports from time to time and will be reporting soon, regardless of whether it has something to say about this issue. I have no doubt that these will be hot topics in the run-up to the Budget, and there will be ample time to debate them.

I welcome my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House to his place.

I recently had the privilege of visiting Lambley reed pond. Will my right hon. Friend join me in thanking and paying tribute to Bonnie Bramwell and all those on the Lambley reed pond committee, who have worked tirelessly to protect and enhance one of the most beautiful hidden gems in my constituency?

Yes, I will. Environmental matters are so important in constituencies, and the work of community groups is so important, because they are the heart of what makes a true community. I pay tribute not just to that group, but to my hon. Friend for his tireless work on their behalf.

Two nights ago, a man in his 30s was stabbed in the centre of Bognor Regis, and that follows a fatal stabbing earlier this year. Will the Government bring forward a debate to consider how to make high streets safer and tackle the increasing prevalence of knife crime in small seaside towns such as Bognor Regis?

We are taking action to tackle knife crime. In fact, we have given a commitment to halve it over the next decade and, I hope, go even further. The hon. Member said two things that are particularly relevant to me. One is that, as a former Home Office Minister, I am acutely aware of the importance of levels of knife crime. The other is that, as an MP for a seaside town, I know how important it is that they are safe places not just for people to visit, but for people to live. The Government are absolutely determined to bear down on violent knife crime, and I am sure there will be opportunities to discuss that in future legislation or should she choose to seek a debate on the matter.

Many right hon. and hon. Members will know the name Armitage Shanks as the company that has been making basins and toilets for over 200 years. However, fewer people will know that it takes its name from the village of Armitage in my constituency. Sadly, Armitage Shanks is planning to scale down its operation there, shutting one of its kilns and threatening up to 100 jobs. I am working closely with the GMB union to make sure that those affected can find other opportunities and to safeguard as many livelihoods as we can, but the impact of those job losses on the community will be serious. Can the Leader of the House arrange for a debate in Government time on how the Government can help protect historic brands such as Armitage Shanks?

The news of job losses that my hon. Friend brings to the House is disappointing. It is always disappointing when jobs are lost, and I know the whole House will share his concern, particularly as it is a well-known name employing a large number of people. We are committed to supporting British industry, and Armitage Shanks is a name well known throughout the land. The Chancellor has announced the date of the next Budget, which will turn to the long-term reforms that Britain needs to unlock growth and ensure that the economy works for working people. I will of course bring forward time for a debate following the Budget in the usual way.

This is a truly sad and tragic day for our friends in the United States of America as they remember the events of 9/11 in 2001, and given the tragic assassination last night of Charlie Kirk. I was privileged to welcome him to the Houses of Parliament in 2018 and take him to Speaker’s House for a Christmas reception. He was a friend of the United Kingdom, he stood up for freedom and his Christian faith, and we mourn his loss and send our condolences to his family and friends.

Talking about someone of principle who stands up for freedom, 13 October—the day the House returns after the conference recess—will be the 100th anniversary of the birth of our finest post-war Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate on the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, which was to restore the British economy, stand up for Britain around the world, defend freedom and not give away British islands but protect, defend and restore them, as she did for the Falkland Islands in 1982?

I echo the remarks I made earlier about Charlie Kirk. Whether we shared views or not, political violence is never acceptable.

Should the hon. Member wish to seek a debate on the anniversary of Mrs Thatcher’s birth, I can assure him that it would be well attended. I can also assure him that there would not be the unanimous approval of her legacy and record that he perhaps thinks there would be. I come from a community that was devastated by the loss of heavy industry, and to be honest, many of those communities are still suffering. The difference between those days and today is that when there is industrial change, this Government stand with working people to lessen the impact and ensure that new growth brings new jobs.

I think I am the only MP who can say they have two amazing football stadiums and two majestic cathedrals in their constituency. Liverpool Riverside is in the top 10 areas nationally for jobs, economic income and economic value. However, the hospitality sector is still struggling to recover from covid and the rise in national insurance contributions. Will the Leader of the House allow for a debate in Government time to discuss how we can bring the UK closer to EU competitors by reducing VAT and providing the maximum discount for hospitality sites with a rateable value of under £500,000, to stimulate demand, boost competitiveness and keep venues open?

My hon. Friend is a doughty campaigner not just for her constituency, but for her city. The Government are always concerned about the state of hospitality and making sure that we encourage investment in hospitality, which is at the centre of many of our constituencies, not least mine. We must ensure that there is not just decent pay and conditions, but respect for the people who work in the sector. I gently say to my hon. Friend that I know the importance of getting the tax situation right, but we need to raise national insurance contributions in order to fill a financial hole. These were not easy decisions, but they were made, and people cannot have it both ways—they cannot have more spending on public services or hospitality support unless we actually raise the money in the first place.

I would like to request a debate on rural broadband and rural 4G. Broadband coverage in much of Devon is poor, in spite of the last Government saying that they would spend £5 billion on it. These 4G notspots are widespread, but the Government scheme to get rid of them bears absolutely no relation to the broadband scheme. Will this Government please get a map of those areas without proper broadband, plot the 4G notspots on it and at least get everyone I represent one or the other?

I will draw these issues to the attention of the relevant Department, but we are investing £500 million this year to deliver Project Gigabit and the shared rural network, to drive the roll-out of digital infrastructure in parts of the UK that are currently underserved. That will improve full nationwide connectivity by 2030, with more than £2.3 billion of contracts signed to connect over 1 million homes in some of Britain’s most remote locations.

I welcome the new Leader of the House to his place and thank him for all the help and support he gave those of us who were newly elected to this place 12 months ago in his previous role.

Last Friday, Cumbria’s first community county flag was unveiled at a special service at Carlisle cathedral. Cumbria county flag is the result of a county-wide competition and public vote, won by Cumbrian artist Ben Walker and presented to the lord lieutenant by the 1st Wetheral Brownies. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Mr Walker on his excellent design and thank Cumbria’s lord lieutenant for organising such a fantastic initiative that celebrates community cohesion and pride?

I am happy to send my congratulations to Mr Walker and the lord lieutenant. We are proud of our flags, both national and regional. I know that Mr Speaker likes to mark historic county days by flying flags from Parliament’s flagpoles, so we may see Cumbria’s new community flag flying in Parliament Square in the future.

May I ask the new Leader of the House for some help? I have been working with the Hinckley school to try and get its science and technology building project sorted. That has been going on for a couple of years and we are at a crucial point with contractors. With the reshuffle, the Minister in charge of that portfolio has been moved on, and we are therefore in a pending position. I have already sent the information to the Leader of the House and I would be grateful if he would contact the Department for Education on my behalf to put pressure on to ensure that we get a decision made on this, so that the development can get started before the winter sets in.

I know that the hon. Gentleman has raised this issue with Ministers before, and I also understand that officials from the Department for Education reached out to discuss the matter on Monday. I pay tribute to him for campaigning on the matter as an assiduous constituency MP on behalf of children, predominantly, but also parents and staff of the school. He will appreciate, as he has acknowledged, that new Ministers are in post after the reshuffle, and there is indeed a new Minister in this role. I will ensure that this is raised with the Minister at the earliest opportunity, in the hope that the hon. Gentleman gets the earliest response possible.

I warmly welcome the Leader of the House to his new role and associate myself with the support across the House for my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson). Members have raised many times the unacceptable level of threats that we face. Increasingly, abuse and threats are being driven and whipped up by one platform in particular, X, previously known as Twitter, which has become a sewer of antisemitism, racism, misogyny and dangerous conspiracy theories. Its owner has specifically targeted Members of this House. With a new director of communications in No. 10 and a refreshed Front Bench, may we have a debate in Government time on whether it is appropriate for that platform to continue to be used for official Government communications?

What my hon. Friend says about X is truly shocking. We are very much in favour of free speech, but we are also against incitement to violence. We have delivered the Online Safety Act 2025 to seek to strike the balance between user protection and freedom of speech. On the matter of the Government’s use of X, it is right that the public are kept up to date with information and a number of people still use X, although of course many are moving to other platforms. I am sure that the Government will take that into account in our deliberations in future, and we also keep our wider social media practices under review.

My new political movement, Restore Britain, is currently running a membership poll on support for deporting all illegal migrants. The response, from thousands of people, is almost unanimously in favour. Will the Leader of the House make time for a debate on mass deportations, given the extraordinary level of public support, and ensure that the House has the opportunity to debate not just the moral imperative but the legal and operational reforms required, including secure detention facilities, bilateral returns agreements, foreign aid suspensions, remittance taxes, visa cancellations, the introduction of a true hostile environment and plenty more, in order to deliver the mass deportation of every last illegal migrant at scale and pace?

I am tempted to give the answer that one of my predecessors, Ted Short, gave, which is to say, “No”. However, I will not do that because these are important matters. I made it very clear in my opening remarks that I regard my role in this House as respecting the views of Members and making opportunities for Members to debate those, even if they are—I have to say—abhorrent. The hon. Gentleman has been here long enough to know that there are many ways in which these matters can be raised—he has just done so now. I am resisting the temptation to recite the very important work that the Government are doing, but if he seeks a debate on these matters in the usual way, perhaps he will be successful.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his new role and hope to see him being as generous with Government time as he was with his own time in his previous role. As he knows well, this month our country will celebrate 200 years since the world’s first passenger railway journey took place on the Stockton to Darlington railway. This momentous innovation changed the world and led to a huge industrial boom for our region. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers have been employed in manufacturing and engineering roles over the past 200 years, but those jobs have declined recently due to the last Government’s neglect of British industry and manufacturing. Given how vital the ambitions of our region are for the industrial strategy, will he grant Government time to debate how this Government will back British workers, back British industry and get our region booming again?

I commend my hon. Friend for the way she speaks for her constituency. It is important that we remember the 200th anniversary of the Stockton to Darlington railway, as it allows those of us from the north-east to claim that we are the cradle of the industrial revolution. As she alluded to, these things change over time. The Government are absolutely committed to bringing growth to every part of our country, including our north-east. That means working through our elected mayors as well as making sure that the skills we have in those engineering industries are kept—even though they are changing skills—and reskilling takes place. We must also have the support in place for companies who seek to invest in our region.

Order. About 20 Members are still on their feet and I am aiming to finish questions to the Leader of the House at 1 o’clock, so please keep your questions very brief.

I welcome the new Leader of the House to his place. Grave breaches of international humanitarian law continue in Gaza, including the unlawful blockade of aid and illegal settlements. According to an aid worker I met recently, sanitary products are being withheld from women and girls. Meanwhile, our Prime Minister rolls out the red carpet for the Israeli President, a man who has said on the record that the entire Palestinian nation is responsible for the 7 October attacks. Will the Leader of the House please commit to a debate in Government time on the UK’s duty to ensure that international law is always upheld and on how we must work with law-abiding international partners to guarantee that carries real weight on the world stage?

The Government have been clear in their condemnation of many of the things that have been happening over the last time in Gaza. They have made it clear that it is important that aid gets into the area and that we move towards a ceasefire to resolve this. But when the hon. Member talks about whom we might talk to about that, I say gently that most conflicts end with some kind of diplomacy, and that requires people to talk to each other, even though they may not agree. That allows the UK Government and the Prime Minister to put views across, which is really important. International law is at the heart of everything that the Government seek to do. As for an opportunity to raise that, there have been many statements and debates in this place about this important matter, and my intention is that that will continue.

I have enjoyed many Bournemouth air festivals, so its cancellation has left a huge gap. I recently met an event organiser who has a plan, and I am open to meeting more organisers. The BH Area Hospitality Association, under the leadership of Rosie Radwell, has launched “Check In – Chill Out”, which is a campaign to showcase how great Bournemouth is. Does the Leader of the House agree in the strongest possible terms that Bournemouth is the best seaside town? Will he congratulate the campaign? Will he grant a debate on tourism, particularly for coastal and seaside towns?

I very much congratulate Bournemouth on how it is promoting its town, as well as my hon. Friend on how he is promoting it. I have to say he is stretching it a bit by asking me to say it is the best seaside town since I have Whitley Bay in my constituency, but it should not be a competition. What we need to do is promote seaside and coastal towns. They are fantastic places to live and to visit.

Last weekend, I met residents of New Park, alongside local Liberal Democrat councillor, Monika Slater. Residents are frustrated about the new Tesco that has been built and its impact on local businesses, with contractors regularly flouting the planning rules to work outside permitted hours. Will the Leader of the House allow for a debate in Government time on local authority enforcement powers and, perhaps, how we can get Tory-run North Yorkshire council to use them?

I am not sure of the detail of this case, but it is not unfamiliar to many of us to see the stress that big developments sometimes cause to residents. Again, this is the sort of thing the hon. Gentleman should seek an Adjournment debate on.

I recently had the pleasure of attending this year’s switch-on of the iconic Blackpool illuminations, lighting up our promenade and attracting millions and millions of visitors each year since 1879. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Kate Shane, Richard Williams and all the people at Visit Blackpool, Blackpool council and Lightworks for delivering such an impressive event this year, and join me in encouraging more people, far and wide, to join us in Blackpool for the illuminations this year?

I absolutely join my hon. Friend in congratulating Kate Shane and everyone at Visit Blackpool on their hard work. I also congratulate him, because he is a champion not just for Blackpool’s cause, but for seaside and coastal towns in general. I have very fond memories of holidays in Blackpool—I have to say some time ago—and trips to see the illuminations. From the illuminations, the tower, the piers and the Pleasure Beach, my hon. Friend’s constituency really has something for everyone. I encourage people to visit the illuminations, not least because they ensure the town has attractions all year round and it is not just seasonal—that is very important.

One of my constituents has raised their concerns with me about the SEEMiS software used in the Scottish school system and the ability of staff to alter cases with no record of changes being made. Transparency in our public bodies is vital to the public trusting both our institutions and us. In these times when public trust in bodies is so low, will the Leader of the House grant time for a debate on upholding the Nolan principles across all public bodies, so that taxpayers can have confidence that decisions are made with integrity and transparency?

Again, I have to admit that I am not across this issue. We would be very supportive on the general principle of transparency. As I am not sure where responsibility lies for such decisions, I suggest that the hon. Lady writes to me, and she might seek a debate on the issue.

I am aware that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, are a strong champion of animal welfare, so you might be pleased to know that tomorrow, for the end of our lido season, is a “bring your dogs to come and swim” day. You might also be pleased, alongside the Leader of the House, to know that this year over 37,000 people have visited Peterborough lido since it opened its doors in May. That is an incredible turnaround since we faced the risk of it closing earlier this year. I pay tribute to Clare Marshall, the Friends of the Lido and the staff of the lido for that amazing work. We can now look forward to the Year of the Lido in 2026, as the lido celebrates its 90th anniversary. I am not ambitious enough to invite the Leader of the House to come for a swim with me in the lido, but will he join me in congratulating everyone who supports our lido in Peterborough, and may we have a debate in Government time about the vital role that lidos play in so many of our communities?

I am not sure that would be a particularly attractive sight, I have to say, because my memory suggests that my costume has a hole in the knee. [Laughter.] But I do want to join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to Clare Marshall, the Friends of Peterborough Lido and of course its staff. A number of MPs have similar concerns—particularly seaside and coastal MPs, but also in other places around the country—and this is exactly the sort of topic that would be good for a Westminster Hall debate or a Backbench Business debate. I urge him to apply.

I welcome the right hon. Member to his new role. There is less pressure as Leader of the House in contrast to the onerous duties of Chief Whip. He referred to the colour of his hair, but he still has his hair whereas mine has been disappearing for many years.

Concerning reports have emerged that the Indian Government are increasing efforts to forcibly return Rohingya refugees to Burma, following the deportation of 40 individuals in May. Rohingya refugees face the risk of severe human rights violations and persecution upon their return. Given the UK’s longstanding obligation to the principle of non-refoulement and the special relationship with India, will the Leader of the House urge the Foreign Secretary to provide a statement outlining what action the Government will take to address this deeply concerning development and to ensure that the rights and safety of Rohingya refugees remain a priority?

Perhaps this job is less pressured than my last one, but I confess that this morning it did not feel that way. As ever, the hon. Gentleman raises a very serious issue. This Government are committed to defending human rights abuses, and regularly engage with the Government of India on a range of human rights matters. I will ensure that the Foreign Office has heard the concerns he raises, and I am sure that at the next Foreign Office questions he will also seek to raise the matter.

While I will not be able to get everybody in, I will get more in if Members can keep their questions to about two sentences. To provide a good example, I call Matt Rodda.

Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker—no pressure. Earlier this week, I was notified that Southern Gas Networks wants to dig up a major road in Reading for 18 weeks. This is the latest in a series of sudden and abrupt interventions by utility companies. Can we have a debate in Government time on the behaviour of utility companies and how better to regulate their activities digging up roads?

Again, these are issues that affect constituents across the country. I am sure that if my hon. Friend sought a debate on these matters, either in Westminster Hall or a Backbench Business debate, he would find that it was well attended.

Sadly, last week in my constituency there was yet more flooding. This follows on from a very dry period and the hottest summer on record. Clearly, the weather is changing. Would the Leader of the House consider bringing forward a debate on building resilience to more extreme weather events, as he makes the political weather?

My hon. Friend raises an important matter. I am sure there will be a lot of people across the country, particularly those who were hardest hit by the very fine and dry weather, concerned about what might happen going forward, in both the short and long term. Our flood resilience taskforce is focused on the long-term delivery of our flood resilience strategy and investment. Should she seek a debate, it would allow Ministers to set out our plans.

In recent days I have been contacted by many residents concerned about increasing hate crime, racist graffiti, vandalism and even violence against police at protests. Will the Leader of the House join with me in the view that there is no place for hate in Hillingdon or anywhere in the UK, that our diversity is our strength, and that those coming to our community to work in our hospitals, in social care and to set up businesses are very welcome? Will he also make time in this place for a debate about a national cohesion strategy, and local strategies to follow?

I absolutely join with my hon. Friend in his remarks. I am proud to say that this country is overwhelmingly inclusive, but it would be wrong to say that we do not face challenges in some communities. The Government are committed to developing a longer-term, more strategic approach to social cohesion. Housing, Communities and Local Government questions will take place once we return from recess. The subject would also make a timely Westminster Hall debate.

The women’s rugby world cup is providing a fantastic sporting showcase, including the seven matches hosted by Sandy Park in Exeter to sell-out crowds. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating the organisers, including the staff at Exeter city council and the teams for an excellent tournament so far, and send the best of luck from this place to all the home nation teams as they enter the knock- out stages this weekend?

With record-breaking crowds at the rugby world cup and tens of thousands of fans packing out the Mall for the Lionesses’ victory parade after their amazing success in the Euros, we are showing ourselves to be true world leaders in women’s sport. I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the organisers, but also in wishing success for the home nations. As he knows, there is a game this weekend between England and Scotland —both home nations—so it is a case of which side to pick.

This week, 6 Towns Radio, a community radio station broadcasting to the six towns of Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme celebrates its 15th birthday. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Dan Townley, Terry Bossons and all the volunteers at 6 Towns Radio as it celebrates its milestone? Does he agree that community radio has played, and will continue to play, an important role in connecting our communities?

I certainly join my hon. Friend in congratulating 6 Towns Radio on its 15th anniversary and community radio right across our country. The Government recognise the importance of community radio and continue to support the sector as part of a diverse media landscape. He may wish to go further than just seeking congratulations for what is happening in his area and consider a Backbench Business debate on the matter, because I am sure that many colleagues would wish to speak in such a debate about their own community radio stations.

Last Saturday, the Linlithgow Union Canal Society celebrated its 50th anniversary with a flotilla from Winchburgh to Linlithgow, marking five decades of volunteer-led preservation and promotion of Scotland’s inland waterways. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating the society and its volunteers on that milestone and wish them all the very best for the next 50 years?

I do not have any canals in my constituency for pretty obvious reasons, but I love them and I think they are fantastic. Local waterways are so important; they do not just link communities but bring them together. I am pleased to offer my congratulations and again point to the fact that community organisations are the absolute backbone of our constituencies and I wish them well going forward.

I congratulate Cornwall on being in wave one of the Government’s innovative roll-out of the neighbourhood health services. We are one of 43 areas making that shift and we have provided services locally, such as community health and wellbeing workers, which have been very well received and which make a difference. May we have a debate in Government time on that shift to community care, with the recognition that urgent and emergency care is an area where Cornwall, like others, has struggled, so alternative services should always be in place as we make that switch?

My hon. Friend will know that the NHS is one of our priorities. She will also know that we are beginning to invest more and to turn the NHS round, but that it is a considerable challenge given the state that we found it in 15 months ago. I urge her to seek a debate on these matters, so that local communities can raise their own specific concerns, which are real and tangible. The Government have very optimistic plans for what can happen with regard to services. It is important that people are treated close to home and indeed, in some cases, at home. That is a considerable challenge, but it is one that we intend to meet.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his place. Last weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the 100-year anniversary of the Midland Red Coalville bus garage, which showcased some fantastic buses through history for people to enjoy. Will the Leader of the House join me in thanking Leicester Transport Heritage Trust, the vehicle owners, Coalville Heritage Society, Snibston Heritage Trust and the district and local councils for their hard work in showcasing their buses and putting on this amazing event? Will he also recognise the work of local volunteers and their contribution to our local communities?

As yesterday’s debate highlighted, the whole House cares deeply about bus services and their role in our local communities. This sounds like a fantastic event to celebrate an impressive anniversary and a great deal of hard work to organise it. I am happy to pay tribute to everyone concerned and delighted to hear about the event’s success. It might have been for the anniversary of the Midland Red Coalville bus garage, but it is about celebrating buses and volunteers as well.

The forced adoption scandal has outraged people in Newcastle-under-Lyme, and up and down the country. This week I heard from Karen Constantine, who gave birth aged 15 in the late 1970s. She was forced out of education in north Staffordshire and into a mother and baby home in Birmingham, and was pushed to give up her child. Although she did not give up her child and fought really hard against others who tried to force who to, other women were not so fortunate. Will the Leader of the House join me in calling on local authorities to preserve and protect all adoption records, so that mothers are able to get the justice they deserve and find their children? Can I also urge him to do all he can to get a formal apology from the Dispatch Box to those women, who so desperately deserve justice?

I thank my hon. Friend for raising this matter and for raising Karen’s case. As he points out, others were less fortunate than Karen. However, these are remarkably distressing and life-changing situations. Such abhorrent practices should never have taken place, and our deepest sympathies are with those affected. We take these matters extremely seriously and continue to engage with those impacted to provide support. We are also improving access to adoption records, including by asking adoption agencies to preserve records for at least 100 years, and I will ensure that the Education Secretary hears about my hon. Friend’s concerns.

That concludes business questions. I thank the Leader of the House for his time.",https://hansard.parliament.uk/dist/opengraph-card.png,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:16.780790

Terms such as ‘carbon neutral’, ‘deforestation free’ and ‘aligned with net zero’ became widespread in corporate messaging, frequently without rigorous or transparent substantiation. In recent years, however, courts and regulators have begun to treat such language as factual representation—claims that must be verifiable, accurate and intelligible to non-expert audiences. This shift is reflected in a growing number of legal disputes and in prominent rulings across sectors such as aviation, finance, and consumer goods. In this environment, climate-washing—misleading or exaggerated communication regarding climate-related impacts, commitments, or mitigation efforts—has emerged as a distinct and rapidly expanding strand of litigation, which gathered pace in 2024 and has continued into 2025.

From Greenwashing to Climate-Washing

Greenwashing refers to communications that mislead the public into believing an organization’s environmental performance is better than it is. The UN Secretary-General has called for ‘zero tolerance’ of greenwashing, and his High-Level Expert Group has urged drawing a ‘red line’ around it, warning that misleading net-zero claims undermine credible climate action. Climate-washing is best understood as climate-related greenwashing, typically involving unsupported or overstated claims about emissions reductions, carbon-neutral products (often via offsetting), or alignment with net-zero goals. It covers communications that create a false impression of an organization’s contribution to climate-change mitigation—by inflating benefits, omitting known risks, or presenting isolated initiatives as overall performance. The concept applies to both companies and public entities.

Common climate-washing risks include advertising or messaging likely to mislead consumers or investors; deceptive ESG certifications, ratings, or audit statements; and false or inflated claims about carbon credits. Existing consumer-protection and advertising rules provide a legal basis to challenge such claims. In parallel, emerging due-diligence and reporting obligations—such as mandatory human-rights and environmental due-diligence laws—could also be used to address misleading climate-related messaging across supply chains. In some investor-facing contexts, securities law may apply.

The Rise of Climate-Washing Litigation

Across jurisdictions, courts ask what overall impression the climate-related communication, taken as a whole, conveys and whether the evidence substantiates it. They also consider whether the claim is likely to influence purchasing or investment decisions. This approach has pulled once-aspirational language into the realm of enforceable fact. In March 2024, the Amsterdam District Court held that parts of KLM’s ‘Fly Responsibly’ campaign were misleading because the advertisements suggested that offsets and alternative fuels could make flying ‘sustainable’, overstating their environmental benefits and not providing clear, specific context on their limitations. The same logic shaped UK enforcement in August 2024, when the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that a Virgin Atlantic radio ad describing a flight as powered by ‘100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel’ was misleading. The unqualified claim was likely to lead listeners to overestimate the environmental benefits and omitted essential information on lifecycle emissions and their limits. The regulator required clear qualifying information in future ads. In June 2024, Germany’s Federal Court of Justice clarified that ‘climate-neutral’ claims trigger strict transparency duties: it must be immediately apparent whether ‘neutrality’ is achieved through actual reductions or by compensation (offsetting).

‘This approach has pulled once-aspirational language into the realm of enforceable fact’

The scrutiny extends beyond consumer advertising. In March 2024, Australia’s Federal Court—following Vanguard Investments’ admissions—found that representations about an ‘ethically conscious’ bond index were misleading because the screening methodology did not match the product description. The court imposed an aggregate A$12.9 million penalty alongside an adverse publicity order. Taken together, these developments show how climate-washing arises across three recurring channels—corporate pledges, product attributes, and investor disclosures—and how each is increasingly actionable when the headline promise outruns the underlying method and evidence.

The Numbers Behind the Shift

The Grantham Institute’s 2025 Climate Litigation Snapshot covering 2024 trends shows a maturing field. By the end of 2024, the global dataset reached 2,967 climate-related cases, with 226 filings recorded for 2024. About one in five of the cases filed in 2024 targeted companies or their directors and officers, underscoring rising corporate exposure.

Overall climate litigation remains most concentrated in the United States, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Germany. In this context, climate-washing has become a prominent corporate-facing claim type: 25 new climate-washing cases were identified in 2024, bringing the post-2015 total to just over 160. Of the more than 100 climate-washing cases decided by the end of 2024, over 60 per cent were classified as successful for claimants. Advertising and product-labelling claims feature prominently, while newer filings increasingly probe omissions in climate-risk disclosures and the integrity of carbon-credit projects and offsetting claims.

Stricter Rules for Environmental Marketing

The European legislation is reshaping the standards for climate-related communication. Directive (EU) 2024/825 on Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition raises the baseline for environmental marketing across the EU: it prohibits vague or misleading claims that cannot be substantiated with verifiable evidence understandable to the average consumer, and it bans claims that a product has a neutral (i.e., ‘carbon neutral’), reduced, or positive impact on the environment in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions where that claim is based on offsetting. Member States must implement the Directive by 27 March 2026. The rules apply from 27 September 2026.

‘The European legislation is reshaping the standards for climate-related communication’

By contrast, the proposed Green Claims Directive—intended to harmonize how explicit environmental claims are substantiated—stalled in June 2025 after the European Commission signalled an intention to withdraw the proposal unless revised, and a scheduled trilogue was cancelled. For now, the proposal remains in limbo. The result is a more decentralized but steadily stricter enforcement landscape, with national consumer-protection and advertising authorities already applying higher standards in practice.

Toward Credible Climate Communication

Climate-washing litigation continues to raise legitimate questions about its long-term impact on corporate behaviour and climate governance. While courts increasingly strike down misleading climate claims, some warn of a counter-effect: greenhushing, in which firms reduce or obscure climate communications to minimize legal risk. Yet recent evidence suggests this caution often reflects gaps in delivery rather than prudence. A 2025 study of more than 1,000 companies with voluntary 2020 emissions targets found that only about 61 per cent met them, while many stopped reporting progress. Likewise, a 2024 study by MIT, Columbia Business School and the European Central Bank found no meaningful difference in tangible climate actions between financial institutions with net-zero pledges and those without.

These findings strengthen the case for closer scrutiny. Courts are not merely criticizing vague language; they are ordering withdrawals, corrective statements, and, in some cases, injunctions—outcomes that carry through to insurance, lending, and credit ratings. With regulators in the EU, UK, US, and beyond tightening expectations, companies face growing pressure to align messaging with verifiable performance. None of this argues for silence. It argues for credibility: clear scope, stated baselines and timeframes, and accessible summaries of methods, assumptions, and limitations, so that a lay reader can follow the reasoning and a specialist can test it. Organizations that move from ambition-led narratives to evidence-based communication will reduce dispute risk—and build more durable trust among consumers, investors, and the wider public.",https://www.hungarianconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFP__20230607__f0377194__v1__HighRes__GreenwashingConceptualCompositeImage-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 11:56:49.480477

Quality Assurance: The blended fuel undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets all necessary specifications, including energy content, flash point, and freezing point.","Pre-treatment: The biomass is pre-treated to ensure uniformity and reduce moisture content. This may involve drying, grinding, and sometimes pelletizing the biomass to facilitate efficient gasification.

Process: The prepared biomass is fed into a gasifier, where it is subjected to high temperatures (700-1500°C) in a controlled environment with limited oxygen.

Reaction: Under these conditions, the biomass undergoes thermochemical conversion into a synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture primarily composed of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H₂), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and small amounts of methane (CH₄) and other gases.

Syngas Composition: The syngas composition can be adjusted by varying the gasification conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the amount of oxygen or steam.

Process: The raw syngas produced from gasification contains impurities such as particulates, tar, sulfur compounds, and other contaminants that must be removed.

Cleaning Steps: The syngas is passed through several cleaning processes, including filtration, scrubbing, and chemical absorption, to remove particulates, sulfur compounds, and other impurities.

Conditioning: The hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H₂/CO) ratio in the syngas is then adjusted through a water-gas shift reaction to optimize it for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The adjusted syngas typically has an H₂/CO ratio of around 2:1.

Process: The conditioned syngas is fed into a Fischer-Tropsch reactor, where it is catalytically converted into long-chain hydrocarbons.

Catalysis: The FT process uses a catalyst, typically iron or cobalt-based, to facilitate the chemical reactions. The syngas reacts over the catalyst at temperatures of 200-350°C and pressures of 20-40 bar.

Products: The FT synthesis produces a mixture of hydrocarbons, ranging from light gases to waxes, which can be further processed into different fuels. The primary products are synthetic crude oil (syncrude) and water.

Process: The heavy hydrocarbon chains (waxes) produced in the FT process are then subjected to hydrocracking, where they are broken down into shorter, more useful molecules.

Reaction: In the hydrocracking unit, the FT waxes are mixed with hydrogen and passed over a catalyst at high temperatures and pressures. This process converts the heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fractions, including kerosene-range hydrocarbons suitable for SAF.

Fractionation: The resulting mixture is then separated into different fuel fractions through distillation or fractionation. The kerosene fraction, which meets the specifications for jet fuel, is separated as SAF.

Process: Like other SAF processes, the synthetic kerosene produced from biomass via the FT process must be blended with conventional jet fuel to meet current aviation fuel standards (ASTM D7566).

Quality Assurance: The blended fuel undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets all necessary specifications, including energy content, flash point, and freezing point.

Aviation has long been a symbol of global connectivity, innovation, and human progress. Yet today, as the planet grapples with the existential threat of climate change, aviation also represents one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize. With aviation contributing roughly 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, the climate impact of flight cannot be ignored. Compounding this challenge is the fact that high-altitude emissions—including contrails and nitrogen oxides—exacerbate aviation’s environmental footprint even further.

As global air traffic is projected to double by 2040, the sector must urgently transition to low-carbon alternatives. Hydrogen and electric aircraft may offer promise in the long term, but they are not yet scalable or practical for the vast majority of commercial aviation today. The most immediate and scalable solution lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a drop-in fuel, compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure.

When produced from waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO), waste fats, and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel. It requires no major aircraft modifications and leverages current airport systems. But for SAF to truly scale, three critical pillars must be addressed: feedstock availability, infrastructure readiness, and traceability.

This is where Malaysia’s opportunity begins. Located along the Straits of Malacca—a global artery for trade and energy—Malaysia is uniquely poised to become a SAF hub for the world. The country’s combination of logistical connectivity, abundant feedstock supply, favorable policy landscape, and strategic industrial partnerships make it an ideal launchpad for SAF expansion.

At FatHopes Energy, we have spent over a decade and a half developing Southeast Asia’s largest decentralized network for UCO collection. What began as a grassroots initiative is now a sophisticated operation spanning households, restaurants, food processing facilities, and roadside stalls. Every liter of oil collected is digitally tracked, ensuring a transparent and verifiable supply chain. Traceability is the backbone of the SAF industry.

Without it, sustainability claims risk greenwashing and carbon accounting becomes unreliable. Our digital traceability infrastructure allows for end-to-end verification, from the point of waste generation to export shipment. This capability ensures that every drop of feedstock meets international standards like ISCC, CORSIA, and RED II compliance.

Yet feedstock alone is not enough. To elevate Malaysia as a global SAF supplier, we must invest in refining infrastructure. This is why we have partnered with Topsoe—a global leader in refining technology—to conduct a detailed feasibility study for a commercial-scale SAF refinery in Malaysia. This facility will be purpose-built to process waste oils into high-performance jet fuel.

The SAF refinery will act as a catalyst for a new industrial economy in Malaysia—one that generates green jobs, supports rural communities, drives export revenue, and reinforces national energy security. Importantly, this vision is deeply rooted in Selangor. FatHopes Energy has always been a Selangor-based organization—bringing value from across Asia into the state through waste-based feedstock aggregation, technological innovation, and sustainable logistics systems.

Now, we are proud to anchor this next phase of growth directly in Selangor. Our vision is clear: In Selangor, For Selangor, By Selangor. This means our SAF refinery will be built in Selangor, sourcing a significant portion of its waste-based feedstock from Selangor, and delivering SAF primarily for Selangor’s aviation needs—especially the growing air traffic at key airports in the state. This approach will not only strengthen Selangor’s position as Malaysia’s industrial heartland—it will also make it a national leader in green fuel innovation and sustainable economic development.

We envision a future where Selangor’s role in aviation extends beyond movement of people and goods—it becomes a beacon of climate leadership. This project is more than a refinery. It is a bold declaration that Malaysia, and specifically Selangor, is ready to lead the global decarbonization effort from the heart of Southeast Asia.

Our vision is not constrained by borders. We believe Malaysia can fuel international carriers, serve global hubs, and define new benchmarks for what sustainable aviation looks like at scale. By embracing SAF, we are not only cleaning the skies—we are redefining Malaysia’s role in the global energy transition.

But achieving this vision requires continued collaboration. We need policy alignment to incentivize SAF production. We need international offtake agreements to secure demand. We need carbon pricing mechanisms that reward low-carbon fuels. And above all, we need the courage to act decisively in this pivotal decade. The journey has begun. The foundation has been laid. Now is the time to accelerate.",https://www.fathopesenergy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/refueling-of-airplane-at-airport-2025-02-16-10-53-09-utc-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 11:56:56.610519

Eniya outlined that the government’s strategy includes electrification of transportation, as well as the development of bioethanol, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (bioavtur) for the aviation industry.

“The grand design for transport energy transition is aimed at achieving long-term emission reductions,” she said.

EV charging infrastructure

State electricity company PT PLN has reaffirmed its role as a key driver of electric vehicle infrastructure development. According to Executive Vice President for Project Development, Financing and Licensing, Moch Padang Dirgantara, PLN has adopted an end-to-end approach starting from renewable-based power generation to customer-oriented public EV charging stations (SPKLU).

“As of September 2024, PLN had deployed over 2,100 charging stations across 1,463 locations, along with 2,200 battery swap stations. A year later, that number has doubled to 4,216 charging units in 2,800 locations, from Aceh to Papua,” Dirgantara reported.

He noted that PLN’s infrastructure rollout is open to public participation. “Through Energy Ministry Regulation No. 182/2023, we’re opening investment opportunities to MSMEs, cooperatives, and even individuals. This inclusive approach will ensure that the EV ecosystem grows in a way that benefits all stakeholders,” he said.

Despite these advancements, electric vehicle adoption in Indonesia is facing headwinds. Member of the National Energy Council (DEN), Dina Nurul Fitria, pointed out a recent slowdown in EV sales growth, attributing it to the expiration of purchase incentives.

“Previously, government subsidies, including relaxed financing schemes from state-owned banks, played a key role in stimulating EV demand. But after these incentives ended and given limited consumer purchasing power interest has waned,” Dina cited.

She also highlighted that the decreasing prices of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have made them more attractive. “Even consumers who can afford a new car tend to opt for non-EVs,” she said.",https://cdn.indonesiabusinesspost.com/4/1/7/2/eits-discussion-series-2025-the-future-of-transport-energy-transition_300x206.jpeg,N,,2025-09-12 11:57:17.169326

The Airbus A220-300, registered P2-PGA, left Montreal Mirabel International Airport (YMX) on September 11, 2025, after Air Niugini took official delivery of the aircraft at the Mirabel Final Assembly Line facility.

Around five hours after takeoff, the new jet arrived at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) for the first scheduled stop on its long journey.

According to Airbus, the A220-300 will also make stops at Honolulu and Fiji before its final flight to Port Moresby Jacksons Airport (POM).

The A220-300 is the first of three brand new aircraft leased to the airline by US-based Azorra.

In a significant milestone for Airbus, Air Niugini has become the 25th global operator of the A220, which is now flying with carriers on five continents.

The aircraft has been named ‘People’s Balus’ and has been decorated in a special livery to mark the 50th anniversary of the independence of Papua New Guinea.

“The intricate design was brought to life by a dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters who worked to apply 11 distinct colors using a special airbrushing technique,” said an Airbus spokesperson.

Fleet renewal to replace Fokker planes

Air Niugini is currently going through a fleet renewal process, with eight new A220-100s also on direct order with Airbus. The new A220s will replace Air Niugini’s Fokker aircraft.

The national carrier of Papua New Guinea extended the initial order for six A220-100s to eight in May 2025.

Air Niugini originally placed an order for six A220 aircraft in 2023, in addition to signing lease agreements for three A220-300s with Azorra.

In May 2025, Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales of Airbus’ Commercial Aircraft business, said: “We are committed to working closely with the airline as we support its fleet renewal program. The A220 is quite simply the most efficient aircraft in its size category, with a wider and spacious cabin and the range to fly non-stop to any destination on the carrier’s network.”

Reflecting its purpose to move people forward in life, Cathay is working towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2050 and transitioning towards more circular use of resources and circular solutions.

Cathay General Manager of Sustainability Grace Cheung said, “Sustainability is essential to the future of aviation. The issues are complex and can only be addressed by moving forward thoughtfully through collaboration with customers, business partners, suppliers, regulators, communities and our people. ​ ​

“Only with our collective efforts can we go further together. We are honoured to be recognised for our endeavours as we continue to chart a path forward with sustainability leadership at the forefront.”

Cathay’s sustainability strategy focuses on addressing the impact of climate change through fleet modernisation, increased fuel efficiency, and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, it aims to reduce cabin waste by promoting a more circular use of resources and implementing recycling initiatives.

Circular economy and waste management

Cathay continues to make progress in adopting more circular solutions for resource use. In particular, Cathay Pacific has committed to reducing its reliance on single-use plastics (SUP), with a pledge to cut the use of passenger-facing SUP items from 7.7 pieces per passenger in 2019 to 1.5 pieces by the end of 2025. As of the end of 2024, Cathay Pacific’s SUP usage had been reduced to 2.6 pieces per passenger.

In-flight, Cathay has introduced enhanced approaches to boost the recycling of water bottles, with over 1.4 million plastic bottles by weight recycled since these enhanced measures were introduced in 2024. Meanwhile, all water bottles on outbound flights from Hong Kong are made with 100% recycled plastics (rPET) to improve the circularity of plastic use in Cathay’s operations. To further reduce plastic waste, the airline has been exploring alternative materials, such as recycled paper for wrapping headphones and blankets instead of plastic. Trials are also being conducted to examine the implementation of more reusable serviceware in the economy class cabin to minimise single-use items in-flight.

Climate action and alternative fuels

The industry widely considers SAF as the most critical lever for decarbonising aviation. Cathay launched its Corporate SAF Programme in 2022 to help accelerate the transition to SAF, enabling corporate partners to address their indirect emissions associated with air travel and airfreight services. In recent years, Cathay has successfully conducted uplifts of SAF onto its flights at both Hong Kong and other airports worldwide.

This year, Cathay has announced three new offtake or partnership agreements. This includes partnering with Sinopec to refuel some of Cathay Pacific’s flights departing from Hong Kong International Airport with blended SAF, with SK Energy for some flights departing South Korea, and with DHL Express to uplift blended SAF onto some flights operated by its express all-cargo carrier Air Hong Kong at Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports. ​

In addition, Cathay has joined hands with partners from across the value chain to promote the development of a supportive SAF policy at its Hong Kong hub. ​",https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-9.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:22.498044

The Ethanol to Jet Fuel Market was valued at USD 320.64 Million in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 857.51 Million by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 17.64%. As the aviation industry intensifies efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, ethanol-derived jet fuel is emerging as a significant solution within the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ecosystem.

Key Market Drivers

Decarbonization Mandates in the Aviation Sector

The increasing urgency to decarbonize the aviation industry is a primary factor fueling the ethanol to jet fuel market. Aviation contributes 2-3% of global CO? emissions, a figure expected to grow alongside air travel demand. To achieve net-zero targets by 2050, international bodies like ICAO and national governments are mandating the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

Ethanol-based SAF, particularly via the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process, delivers lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional jet fuel. Policy frameworks like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offer tax credits of up to USD 1.75 per gallon for qualifying SAF, with ethanol positioned advantageously due to its availability and lower carbon intensity. In the EU, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation requires a progressive increase in SAF blending, from 2% in 2025 to 63% by 2050, which opens substantial opportunities for ethanol-based fuels.

Key Market Challenges

High Capital and Operational Costs

The ethanol-to-jet fuel market faces significant financial barriers due to high capital and operating costs associated with ATJ technology. Building a commercial-scale ETJ facility demands substantial investments ranging from USD 300 million to USD 600 million, depending on the capacity and technical specifications. In addition to the capital expenditure, the ongoing operational costs remain elevated due to the complex conversion processes, high energy inputs, and maintenance of advanced catalytic systems. Feedstock costs, especially for cellulosic and second-generation ethanol, also add to the expense. While some relief is provided by SAF subsidies and tax credits, their limited duration and scope reduce their effectiveness. Emerging economies lack comparable support mechanisms, hindering global scalability. As most projects are still in pilot or demonstration stages, long-term viability hinges on both technological breakthroughs to reduce costs and the establishment of stable, long-term policy incentives.

Key Market Trends

Shift Toward Cellulosic and Waste-Based Ethanol Feedstocks

An important trend in the ethanol to jet fuel market is the transition toward using cellulosic and waste-derived ethanol as feedstock. Unlike first-generation ethanol sourced from food crops, cellulosic ethanol is derived from non-food biomass such as crop residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste. These advanced feedstocks comply with stringent sustainability and carbon reduction guidelines under frameworks like the EU RED II and the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. Cellulosic ethanol can deliver GHG reductions of up to 90% over conventional jet fuels, making it highly attractive for SAF production.

Companies like Blue Biofuels and LanzaTech are at the forefront of leveraging lignocellulosic and waste gases to produce ethanol, which is then converted into jet fuel. Technological advances in enzyme efficiency and microbial fermentation are improving conversion yields, while financial incentives for ultra-low carbon fuels are encouraging broader adoption. This trend not only improves environmental performance but also reduces dependency on food-based crops, aligning with circular economy principles.

Sacrificing for sustainable development The green aviation revolution is no longer a luxury for wealthy nations - it is a strategic battleground for survival in global aviation.
Accepting short-term hardship is essential to avoid exclusion and to build a strong, sustainable aviation sector for future generations.","While debates about green transportation in Hanoi’s urban areas are grabbing public attention, a more specialized sector has long been quietly advancing its green transformation: Vietnam’s civil aviation industry.

Labeling the green transition in aviation as a ""playground for the rich"" is not without basis, considering the staggering costs involved.

Yet, Vietnam’s aviation sector remains firmly committed to its ""green path"" under the guiding spirit of “Transition, sacrifice, and sustainable development.”

An irreversible global journey

The world is navigating a turbulent energy transition. Global climate policy remains inconsistent, as exemplified by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change under President Donald Trump.

Yet paradoxically, the U.S. continued to engage in sector-specific mechanisms like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Funding for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) research remained intact, signaling a technological and market shift that transcends short-term political agendas.

Vietnam has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the global community. At COP26, the country boldly pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This wasn’t just a political declaration - it has since been institutionalized through national strategies, planning, and action plans in every sector, with strong direction from the Party and Government.

Most recently, at the P4G Summit in Vietnam, General Secretary To Lam emphasized the country’s strategic vision of green growth built on three pillars: green institutions as the foundation, green technology as the breakthrough engine, and green human resources as the core. This vision serves as the guiding principle for the entire transition process, with the aviation sector playing a crucial role.

A quiet journey and a 30% emissions cut

Few people are aware that Vietnam’s aviation green transition did not begin with the rise of CORSIA or SAF. The industry had already completed a ""first phase"" of its green transition over several years, quietly but effectively reducing emissions.

This initial success stemmed from business decisions and operational optimization, ensuring aviation safety and security while also benefiting the environment and economy. It served as a vital emissions buffer, showcasing the industry’s technological and management capabilities. However, the achievements of this “win-win” phase may obscure the massive financial and technological hurdles ahead, which will require direct investment and short-term sacrifice.

One of the most effective emissions-reduction strategies is investing in new-generation aircraft that are more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly. Vietnamese airlines have proactively made this a strategic priority, both to enhance competitiveness and to fulfill environmental responsibilities.

Vietnam Airlines, the national carrier, was among the first in the Asia-Pacific region to operate both Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB wide-body aircraft. These aircraft not only offer better passenger experiences but also consume up to 25% less fuel than their predecessors, significantly cutting CO2 emissions.

Meanwhile, Vietjet Air has focused on optimizing its narrow-body fleet with Airbus A321neo aircraft - among the most efficient single-aisle jets globally. Each A321neo can cut CO2 emissions by over 5,000 tons annually and reduce noise by up to 50% compared to older models. The use of Pratt & Whitney GTF engines further boosts fuel savings by 15-17%, contributing to the airline’s Net Zero 2050 strategy.

Beyond fleet upgrades, Vietnam’s aviation sector has embraced a revolution in air traffic management by applying advanced technologies aligned with ICAO’s roadmap.

Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) technology enables aircraft to follow optimized flight paths using satellite navigation instead of ground-based beacons. This shortens flight distances, reduces flying time, and conserves fuel - ultimately lowering emissions. Vietnam is currently implementing PBN at all 22 airports nationwide, improving the national airspace network’s efficiency.

Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) is a shared digital platform enabling real-time coordination between airport operators, air traffic control, airlines, and ground services. Successful A-CDM implementation at Noi Bai and Tan Son Nhat airports has raised on-time performance to 94%, reduced taxi times, minimized congestion, and significantly cut fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

Based on international aviation benchmarks, these efforts have helped reduce CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometer by about 30% compared to early 2000s technology and flight management practices. This is not only a remarkable environmental achievement but also a sign of Vietnam’s solid technological foundation for entering the next, more challenging phase of the green transition.

A new frontier: CORSIA and the SAF revolution

While the first phase of the transition was driven by economic and operational needs, the current phase is marked by a shift from voluntary actions to compliance with international regulations. Public attention and policy pressure surged with the emergence of CORSIA and SAF.

These developments represent the visible tip of a larger iceberg - where national commitments must be fulfilled through specific and costly actions. Vietnam’s early and voluntary participation in these mechanisms reflects a strategic move, not passive compliance. It’s an effort to turn pressure into opportunity by restructuring the industry, improving competitiveness, and attracting green finance.

CORSIA, established by ICAO, is a market-based mechanism helping global aviation reach net zero by 2050. Meanwhile, SAF is considered the ""golden key"" for long-term emission reduction. Made from renewable sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and algae, SAF can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60% to 94% over its lifecycle compared to traditional Jet A1 fuel.

Recognizing the importance of these changes, Vietnam has taken proactive steps. The country officially registered and was confirmed by ICAO to join the voluntary phase of CORSIA starting January 1, 2026 - demonstrating responsibility while allowing time to prepare and seek international support before mandatory participation begins in 2027.

In May 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated its first SAF-powered commercial flight from Singapore to Hanoi and pledged to comply with SAF requirements for EU-originating flights. Vietjet Air has also flown SAF-powered routes from Ho Chi Minh City to Melbourne and Seoul, reaffirming its commitment to sustainability.

Petrolimex Aviation became the first Vietnamese company to import and refuel SAF, laying the groundwork for a domestic green energy supply chain. At a broader level, the Vietnam Petroleum Institute (VPI) is researching local biomass sources and suitable SAF production technologies, aiming for partial domestic supply in the future.

The biggest challenge: Financial burden

International compliance will undoubtedly bring huge operating costs. For example, under the voluntary phase of CORSIA (2024-2026), a major Vietnamese airline may need to spend between USD 13 million and USD 92 million on carbon credits, depending on market fluctuations.

Similarly, the EU’s ReFuelEU requirement for a mandatory 2% SAF blend on outbound flights could add roughly USD 4.8 million annually to Vietnam Airlines' European route fuel costs. These rising costs will inevitably be passed down partially to airfares, impacting airline competitiveness and customer choices.

With major markets like the EU implementing environmental regulations, green transition is no longer optional. Without compliance, Vietnamese airlines risk losing access to European routes - cutting off vital cargo channels and isolating the industry from global trade. Thus, this is a calculated sacrifice: short-term profitability must give way to long-term survival, sovereignty, and self-reliance in an evolving world.

Compounding this challenge is Vietnam’s lack of large-scale SAF production technology and supply chain expertise. Heavy reliance on expensive imports poses energy security and cost risks. Currently, SAF costs two to six times more than Jet A1 fuel, while global supply meets only 0.1% of total demand. This remains a monumental obstacle for Vietnamese aviation.

Sacrificing for sustainable development

The green aviation revolution is no longer a luxury for wealthy nations - it is a strategic battleground for survival in global aviation. Today’s costs should be seen not as losses, but as investments in economic sovereignty and future market access. Accepting short-term hardship is essential to avoid exclusion and to build a strong, sustainable aviation sector for future generations.

Vietnam’s history is marked by generations who sacrificed for independence, freedom, and unity. Today, in a new era, we face a different kind of battle - a silent one against climate change. The journey toward a green future demands a different kind of sacrifice: economic trade-offs, perseverance, and resilience.

This is not the aviation industry’s burden alone - it’s a national mission. Under the leadership of the Party and Government, and with the support of the people, Vietnam’s aviation sector is moving swiftly to build a green institutional framework, invest in green technology, develop domestic SAF production, and train a new generation of experts and engineers to master emerging technologies.

Green transition is not an expense but an investment in the future. With determination and ambition, Vietnam’s aviation industry will rise above this challenge, soaring not only through greener skies but also along a sustainable development path - asserting Vietnam’s role as a responsible and visionary global player.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/9/12/vietnams-aviation-goes-green-a-costly-journey-for-a-sustainable-future-692.png?width=0&s=p4tac0TohRplY2Wa2k_PfA,N,,2025-09-12 06:56:27.363087

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 14 May 2025 and, at the time of writing, is at Report stage (having been amended in Committee).

It introduces powers for the government to set up and operate the RCM to support SAF production (SAF being defined broadly as ""aviation fuel that is renewable transport fuel"") in the UK, including:

Powers to designate a government-owned company as the counterparty, and to direct the counterparty to enter into revenue certainty contracts;

Powers to impose a levy on aviation fuel suppliers to fund the revenue certainty mechanism, and to impose fines for suppliers that fail to pay the levy (£100,000 or 10% of turnover, whichever is less) - the low level of fine (£100,000) suggests that the levy itself will be low, otherwise there would be no incentive to pay it;

Powers to develop detailed regulations, including on levy administration, eligibility for contracts, and transparency requirements.

The devil will of course be in the detail of those regulations and these could take some time to develop. They will need to address how the reference price for SAF will be determined (as there is currently no recognised market index for SAF in the UK) and how long the subsidy period will be. The Bill gives the Government power to direct the counterparty to enter revenue certainty contracts for 10 years, but this can be extended by secondary legislation.

The government intends for all the required legislation for the revenue certainty mechanism, including the regulations made under the act, to be in place by the end of 2026. So, watch this space for further consultations as the regulatory landscape is shaped.

What Happened at SAF Bill Committee Stage

Debates focused on the impact on competition, the design of the RCM and the potential impact on ticket prices, among other issues:

multiple witnesses, including airline representatives, expressed scepticism about the £1.50 passed on cost figure and suggested the actual cost to passengers would be much higher;

some stakeholders fear the levy could negatively affect the competitiveness of the UK aviation sector, particularly in comparison to other nations without similar mandates and funding mechanisms. Complexity or lack of transparency around the levy calculation may exacerbate this;

another concern – one particularly raised by airlines – highlighted the risk of supply shortages, particularly of advanced (second and third generation) SAF. Witnesses warned that, without sufficient domestic production, airlines could face crippling buy-out penalties, which would increase costs without achieving decarbonisation goals;

there were also questions raised about the intellectual property in UK-developed fuels being lost overseas.

Concluding Comments

The aviation industry has been mainly supportive of the Bill and the need for a RCM to support SAF scale-up and commercialisation. However, some trade bodies are worried the levy will increase the costs to passengers, given that fuel bills already make up around a third of an airline's costs. Some had wanted the scheme to be funded through the industry's contribution to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Others are calling on the government to prioritise PtL fuel (third generation SAF) in the RCM, rather than the more established fuel types.

Next steps

The SAF Bill gives broad powers to set up the RCM, but the regulations to be made under the Bill once it has become an Act will set out the detail of how the scheme will work. So we will keep an eye out for consultations on those.

Air Niugini receives first Airbus A220

Air Niugini, the national carrier of Papua New Guinea, has taken delivery of its first Airbus A220-300 aircraft, which it is leasing from Azorra. The airline becomes the 25th operator of the A220 worldwide, which is now in service with carriers across five continents.

The aircraft, named “People’s Balus”, departed the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mirabel on its delivery flight to Port Moresby, with planned stopovers in Vancouver, Honolulu and Fiji. The delivery marks a significant milestone in Air Niugini’s fleet modernisation programme, which includes eight Airbus A220-100 aircraft on direct order from Airbus and three Airbus A220-300 aircraft being leased from Azorra.

The aircraft’s special livery commemorates the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea’s independence. The intricate design was created by a dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters, who applied 11 distinct colours using a specialist airbrushing technique.

The Airbus A220 is set to become the centrepiece of the airline’s regional and international fleet, offering a new standard of operational efficiency and passenger comfort. Its exceptional efficiency, combined with a spacious cabin and the range to serve a variety of destinations, makes it an ideal choice for the carrier’s network and its broader ambitions for long-term growth.

The Airbus A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF engines, delivering a 25% reduction in carbon emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target for all aircraft to be able to operate with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

As of the end of August 2025, Airbus has secured more than 940 orders for the Airbus A220 from over 30 customers and has delivered more than 440 aircraft. The A220 is already operating on more than 1,800 routes to over 480 destinations worldwide, underscoring its leading position in the small single-aisle market.

They underlined the need for a conducive ethanol policy “right up front”, citing the success of the 2018 National Biofuel Policy.
The national biofuel policy enabled India to go from 5 per cent blending in 2019-20 to 20 per cent by 2025-26.
The industry executives urged the government to finalise a national SAF policy by the end of this financial year, calling it a low-hanging fruit to cut aviation emissions by 50-60 per cent.
Earlier this week, Down To Earth (DTE) reported that the Indian government is finalising a national SAF policy and a roadmap through 2050 to meet CORSIA mandates and become an export hub.","India could achieve self-sufficiency in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030 and even emerge as a major export hub, industry stakeholders said at a recent discussion on decarbonising aviation, while seeking urgent policy support and financial incentives from the government.

“By our calculations, we should have a mandate SAF requirement of 350 to 500 million litres which translates to 700 million litres to a billion litres only of ethanol by 2030,” Sameer Sinha, chief executive of sugar business at Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd, said at the India Sugar and Bio-Energy conference. “There is a huge potential in the feedstock that’s available…our ethanol has low carbon intensity (CI)…we have immediate self-sufficiency for the country for our SAF mandate.”

“We can be a very competitive centre for export of SAF because of the proximity to the large aviation hubs of Middle East such as Dubai, Singapore and especially given the low CI value of our ethanol,” he added.

They underlined the need for a conducive ethanol policy “right up front”, citing the success of the 2018 National Biofuel Policy.

The national biofuel policy enabled India to go from 5 per cent blending in 2019-20 to 20 per cent by 2025-26. ""So, that's a remarkable thing of what an optimised policy can do,” the producer noted. They also called for pricing clarity and mandated offtake.

“If I look at the current pricing of aviation turbine fuel at Rs 90 per litre, our ask should be somewhere around 2.75 times, and if we consider 2G ethanol, it would be in the range of 2.5-3.5 times,” he said.

Industry demanded capital subsidies, preferential pricing for first plants, higher debt-equity ratio (3:1), accelerated depreciation, tax holidays and stacking of state incentives, alongside airport storage, blending and distribution infrastructure upgrades. Airlines must also share the initial cost burden, they said.

“If it's a domestic airline, our calculation shows it would hardly be Rs 200-300 per passenger in terms of increase,” the producer said.

They also flagged the urgency of putting carbon accounting and certification systems in place for compliance under International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) framework.

“An 80-tonne-per-day plant would cost around Rs 1,400 crore, and take about three and a half years at least to make. This means that the first SAF plant, even if we start now, can only be ready in 2029,” he noted.

Kanika Chawla, SAF strategy and business development at Airbus India and South Asia, said it was supporting both producers and airlines in SAF adoption.

“Our current aircraft are capable of flying with approximately 50 per cent of SAF, and our target is that by 2030, we increase that to 100 per cent SAF,” she said, adding that India must “look at SAF from an innovative lens” and treat it as an “ecosystem where the producers, the airline, the regulators need to work unanimously”.

The industry executives urged the government to finalise a national SAF policy by the end of this financial year, calling it a low-hanging fruit to cut aviation emissions by 50-60 per cent.

Earlier this week, Down To Earth (DTE) reported that the Indian government is finalising a national SAF policy and a roadmap through 2050 to meet CORSIA mandates and become an export hub.

By partnering with Haffner Energy, Luxaviation aims to establish a new standard for how business aviation can effectively drive the scale-up of sustainable fuel production.
For Haffner Energy, the agreement is instrumental in facilitating the financing of its SAF projects across Europe.
Philippe Haffner, CEO of Haffner Energy, noted that long-term offtake agreements are among the most crucial conditions for securing financing for SAF production facilities.
Haffner Energy has already announced the development of several SAF projects, including sites in France and Iceland, with full-scale production expected to be reached by 2030.","In a significant move to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry, business aviation powerhouse Luxaviation Group and pioneering biomass-to-clean-fuels company Haffner Energy have announced a non-exclusive, 15-year offtake agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The deal, which includes fixed volume and price terms, represents a critical step forward in moving from aspirational commitments to tangible, long-term solutions for sustainable aviation.

The partnership is an extension of an existing collaboration that began earlier this year when Luxaviation expressed interest in SAF Zero, a dedicated entity focused on promoting and producing sustainable aviation fuels. This new agreement solidifies their joint commitment to making SAF more accessible and widely used across Europe.

Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group, emphasized the importance of the deal, stating, ""This agreement marks a decisive move from vision to reality."" He highlighted that securing a long-term SAF supply is not just an operational investment for Luxaviation but a firm commitment to its clients and the broader industry's future. By partnering with Haffner Energy, Luxaviation aims to establish a new standard for how business aviation can effectively drive the scale-up of sustainable fuel production.

Luxaviation, which operates one of the largest private aircraft fleets globally, has a comprehensive three-pronged strategy for decarbonization. This includes improving fuel efficiency, actively increasing the use of SAF and electrifying ground operations, and offsetting remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The company has been tracking its progress since 2021 through its annual sustainability report and further demonstrated its dedication by launching the ""Go-to-Zero"" Investment Fund in 2023 to foster SAF production.

For Haffner Energy, the agreement is instrumental in facilitating the financing of its SAF projects across Europe. Philippe Haffner, CEO of Haffner Energy, noted that long-term offtake agreements are among the most crucial conditions for securing financing for SAF production facilities. Such agreements guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable price over extended periods, providing the financial certainty needed to build new production plants.

Haffner Energy has already announced the development of several SAF projects, including sites in France and Iceland, with full-scale production expected to be reached by 2030. This timeline aligns with the next stage of the European SAF mandate, which will require a minimum 6% blend of SAF in jet fuel.

Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are active members of Project SkyPower, an international, CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF, underscoring their leadership and collaborative spirit within the industry.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-12 05:57:38.027932

The initiative, led by Mexico’s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), aims to convert the vast quantities of sargassum washing ashore each year into biofuel, helping airlines meet their fuel-blend obligations under ICAO’s CORSIA framework and national mandates. The plan was unveiled during a recent ministerial summit on regional environmental action, with SEMARNAT calling for multinational cooperation to tackle what it described as “a phenomenon without borders.”

Sargassum has long plagued the Caribbean coastline, releasing toxic gases as it decomposes and costing local communities millions in clean-up operations. In May 2025 alone, a record-breaking 39 million tons of the algae were recorded in the Caribbean Sea, reaching as far as the Atlantic Ocean. The University of South Florida’s Optical Oceanography Laboratory reported “significant inundation events” across the region, including Mexico’s popular tourist destinations.

At the state level, Quintana Roo has already broken ground on a Comprehensive Sargassum Sanitation and Circular Economy Centre. Initially focused on biogas production, the facility is expected to evolve toward SAF processing. According to Nopalimex bioenergy director Miguel Ángel Aké Madera, 500 tons of sargassum can yield 20,000 cubic metres of biogas—equivalent to the daily fuel sales of a typical Mexican petrol station. “This is not a marginal solution—it is a scalable one,” Aké told Wired.

Mexico’s approach differs from other regional experiments by proposing a state-backed commercial supply chain. While Puerto Rico and other Caribbean nations have explored algae-to-energy conversion, Mexico could become the first to institutionalise sargassum as a SAF feedstock.

The aviation sector is watching closely. With IATA forecasting a need for 120 billion litres of SAF annually by 2050, feedstock availability remains a critical bottleneck. Sargassum offers several advantages: it is non-edible, grows rapidly without farmland, and its collection actively mitigates environmental damage in tourism-dependent economies.

For airlines operating in Latin America and the Caribbean, the prospect of a locally sourced SAF is particularly attractive. Not only does it support decarbonisation goals, but it also aligns with broader ESG strategies and regional sustainability commitments.

While Mexico’s sargassum-to-SAF programme is still in its early stages, the political momentum and private-sector interest suggest rapid development.

Introduction

All forms of aviation fuel are byproducts of crude oil. Jet fuel's main purpose is to power aircraft; its energy content and combustion quality are important fuel performance characteristics; other critical performance attributes include lubricity, stability, volatility, and non-corrosiveness, among others. Fuel serves as a source of energy as well as a hydraulic fluid in engine control systems and a coolant for certain fuel system components. Bio jet fuel, another name for sustainable fuel, is becoming more and more popular. Depending on the raw components and production technology, it possesses qualities comparable to conventional jet fuel but a lower carbon footprint when used to power aircraft. It can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle as compared to traditional jet fuel. Producing bio-jet fuel from waste materials can boost aircraft performance, help the environment, and open up new business opportunities for farmers.

Growing crops for fuel comes with challenges

Crops for sustainable aviation fuel will be the subject of much debate. Where to plant them, will farmers invest in them and how food and fuel prices will be impacted must be discussed.

Now, agricultural drones are “taking off” (pun intended).

Whether farmers are looking to use drones for field monitoring, field mapping, livestock management, seeding or even spraying, it is important to know the laws and regulations about their use in agriculture.

The use of drones, also called remotely piloted aircraft systems, is federally regulated in Canada, primarily by Transport Canada based on rules in the Canadian Aviation Regulations and other relevant legislation.

Other legal documents that affect drone use are the Aeronautics Act and the Canadian Criminal Code, to name a few.

Based on public consultation, Transport Canada has announced that new and expanded regulations have been passed, some of which will come into effect this Nov. 4.

The Government of Canada’s website is a great place to learn more about the requirements necessary to pilot a drone in Canada.

Currently, there are three “levels” of operating certificates for drone pilots: basic, advanced and level 1 complex.

To determine whether they need a basic, advanced or level 1 complex license, operators should consult Transport Canada or talk to a lawyer.

Some drones, for example, do not require a license or to register the drone, while other types of drone uses require drone registration, pilot certification, ground school, online exams and other types of requirements.

The size and planned use of a drone impact the type of certification operators will need.

Currently, drones that weigh more than 250 grams must be registered and marked.

There are penalties, such as fines, for drone users who do not comply with the registration and marking requirements.

The new rules taking effect in November will expand the privileges for some drone pilots, expand the options for certification for “lower-risk” operations that go beyond the visual line-of-sight and provide new technical standards for special flight operations, to name a few.

Implementing drone technology on the farm requires proper licensing and training. Be sure to consult the Canadian standards and regulations or to consult a lawyer if you have questions about drone use.

While seed and fertilizer application is generally allowed using drones, application of chemicals is regulated by federal legislation and Health Canada.

Producers and agriculture industry leaders should consult Health Canada when determining what products are allowed for the use in drone applications.

Health Canada has distinguished pesticides approved for application by aircraft from those that can be applied by drone.

Currently, only products with the labeled terms “remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) are allowed for use in drones under the Pest Control Products Act.

Those who use pest control products must follow the regulations set out by the federal government and, for registered products, subject to the regulations; they must follow the directions on the label (recorded in the register).

Currently, the list of registered products approved for RPAS (drone) use include four larvicides and one herbicide. This list is subject to change as products are reviewed or registered.

Safety to humans and potential risks to the environment are among the government’s considerations when products are being evaluated, or re-evaluated, for pesticide registration.

To determine if the product that you want to spray is suitable for RPAS use, consult the Health Canada label search tools. It is important that pesticide users follow governmental rules and regulations about pesticide use. Non-compliance could lead to penalties.

The loosening of the Transport Canada rules on drone use coming into force this year, plus Health Canada’s continued analysis of registered products, may result in expanded on-farm drone technology use. We recommend having a good understanding of the rules and regulations around this technology when considering its use.

Maddhu Khanna, an environmental economics professor with the University of Illinois, outlined some of the latest research on SAFs from annual energy crops such as energy sorghum to high-yielding perennials such as miscanthus, switchgrass and energy cane.

Based on the research to date, producing sustainable aviation fuel, or SAFs, from energy crops will cost two to three times more than petroleum jet fuel, said Khanna, who spoke at the International Consortium on Applied Bioeconomy Research conference in Saskatoon earlier this summer.

Drone use in agriculture requires understanding the rules

Whether using drones for field monitoring, mapping, livestock, seeding or even spraying, it is important to know the laws and regulations for their use in agriculture.

It will also need either mandates that require the aviation industry to comply with high biomass or high prices for farmers to grow what could be high-risk propositions.

“A lot of those policies actually need to deal with the initial establishment cost because that is a huge part of the upfront cost of planting these energy crops, and that’s what causes them to be risky,” she said.

SAF researchers and entrepreneurs are already facing stiff challenges.

The United States hopes to increase production of SAFs, gradually reducing dependence on petroleum until 2050 when it expects the entire aviation industry to go 100 per cent SAF — a projected 35 billion gallons (132.5 billion litres) by that year.

That’s a tall order. Khanna said current SAF production is about 20 million gallons (about 76 million litres).

“That’s a significant ramp-up in production that’s needed.”

Food production for fuel in the U.S. is already at a tipping point that could compromise food production for humans. Khanna said 30 per cent of the country’s corn is already earmarked for ethanol, while about 40 per cent of its soybean oil is produced for biodiesel.

The level of SAF production that the U.S. expects would require feedstocks other than human-consumable food, she said. That’s why the U.S. Department of Energy is pressing for a non-food feedstock route in its roadmap toward SAF goals, including “energy crops” grown expressly for that purpose.

Among these energy crops is energy sorghum, an annual grass that grows 14 to 15 feet every year and that Khannu said only needs to be planted every 10 to 15 years.

“They have a lot of very environmentally appealing features,” she said.

“They could actually be sustainable aviation fueling that produces close to zero or negative carbon intensity. And they also can reduce nitrogen leaching.”

The question is where to grow them.

A check in energy sorghum’s favour is its ability to grow on marginal land. However, there’s still a problem: at some point, according to Khannu’s projections, there will be instances where it will be more productive to grow energy crops on cropland, in the process re-igniting arguments over land use.

“Bioenergy crops will be produced from an economic perspective. They will be produced somewhat on marginal land, somewhat on cropland,” she said.

Some have suggested abandoned agriculture land as a venue for energy crop growth. Aside from the fact that this category barely exists in Canada’s landscape today, soil health advocates fear carbon and ecosystem service loss when switching to cropland.

“And not only are you going to lose the carbon in the soil that has already been stored, but after we convert it, it will not have the opportunity to accumulate carbon that would have otherwise been accumulated,” said Khannu.

She has a partial solution to the land-use question around SAFs and energy crops.

The U.S. has a partial equilibrium economic model called Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model (BEPAM) that, when linked with a biogeochemical model, can be used to help determine where energy crops can be grown, be it cropland, marginal land or non-crop land.

The researchers discovered through BEPAM that an attempt to meet the U.S.’s 35 billion-gallon mandate using advanced biofuel would cost US$1.40 per litre of SAF in 2016 dollars ($1.90 today, according to the U.S. Inflation Calculator).

“The corresponding price of petroleum jet fuel was 34 cents per litre in 2016 dollars, so the price of SAF would be more than five times higher,” she said.

The economic model helped the researchers understand how much land would be needed to produce energy crops to meet SAF production goals and its implications for food crop prices.

“We look at all the different ways in which these feedstocks affect greenhouse gas emissions through the life cycle: the emissions from producing the crops, soil carbon effects, (how) the indirect land-use change affects the savings we get by displacing petroleum jet,” says Khannu.

From there, they calculated the net carbon impact of SAF and compared it to the GHG sequestration savings there would have been if the land was left alone.

“And so what we see here is that the carbon intensity of SAF goes down as the price of sustainable aviation fuel goes up. It allows more energy crops to be produced, which have much lower carbon emission intensity.

“And so the carbon intensity of SAF goes down (and it) goes down even further as we allow non-cropland to be converted to grow energy crops.”

“To sequester carbon by allowing the land to convert into SAF feedstocks, you can actually get a much greater reduction that’s many times greater than keeping the land residence.”

However, this process also introduces a spanner in the works: less cropland for food driving higher consumer prices.

“And because of that, corn and soybean prices will go up, looking at the overall crop price index. So with a 35 million gallon mandate, crop prices would go up … 30 per cent, so that’s kind of the trade-off that would be involved.”

All of this comes back to incentivizing farmers to grow energy crops, she said, and that will take money.

“It takes one to three years to plant and to grow them. Farmers have to commit to a crop that’s going to take 10 to 15 years to pay back and in the meantime, you’re losing the opportunity of benefits from having other crops.”

Farmers who are risk-adverse to investing in energy crops will need higher prices for biomass and SAF to be willing to produce those crops instead of corn and soybeans, said Khannu. This will raise the cost of SAF.

“So when we put all of that into the model and then we (ask), what do those supply curves look like from these crops, there is a substantial reduction in the amount of SAF that could now be produced.

“So instead of producing 120 billion litres, we’re more than 50 billion litres, so that’s when the cost (of SAFs) is going to go up because of that risk aversion.”

Energy sorghum is sold in Canada. Om Dangi, president of Agricultural Environmental Renewal Canada (AERC), points to Canadian Sweet Sorghum Hybrid (CSSH) 45, a sorghum suitable for biofuel that can be converted into SAFs.

AERC is an Ottawa-based hybrid seed company with a focus on research, development and commercialization of environmentally friendly and economically promising crops, according to its website.

CSSH-45 is recommended for one-time harvesting to make silage or green chop for dairy and beef animals.

The AERC website says it has “very high potential” for its “juice,” which aids in the production of ethanol and biodiesel.

“It is grown just like sugarcane,” says Dangi, who bred the variety using conventional breeding methods.

“It’s mature in 98 days.… You can extract easily 50 per cent juice through the total biomass.”

It can be grown in semi-arid areas for silage production following juice extraction.

Dangi says climate change has allowed this sorghum to be grown in places where it previously couldn’t be grown.

The areas of Canada that can support CSSH-45 lie between Canada’s 43rd north latitude to its 53rd north latitude, which means it can be grown in areas from British Columbia to Quebec.",https://foodindustrynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-FIN-Fav-3-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-12 04:56:24.212221

Luxaviation, one of the world's leading private aviation groups, has announced a groundbreaking, long-term agreement with an Icelandic e-fuel innovator, marking a significant leap forward in the industry's pursuit of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This strategic partnership is poised to accelerate the adoption of cleaner aviation solutions and underscore the growing momentum behind decarbonizing air travel.

The collaboration between Luxaviation and its Icelandic partner – a company at the forefront of producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from renewable energy sources – represents a pivotal moment for private aviation and the broader aerospace sector. This agreement not only secures a vital supply of eco-friendly jet fuel for Luxaviation's extensive fleet but also signals a strong commitment from a major player in business aviation to drive tangible progress towards net-zero emissions.

The Imperative for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The aviation industry, a vital engine of global connectivity and economic growth, faces immense pressure to reduce its environmental footprint. Carbon emissions from aviation are a significant concern, and the quest for decarbonizing aviation has become a top priority for governments, regulators, and industry stakeholders alike. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely recognized as the most viable short-to-medium term solution to achieve this goal.

Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil fuels, SAF is produced from a variety of renewable sources, including agricultural waste, used cooking oil, municipal solid waste, and, crucially for this partnership, e-fuels generated through renewable electricity and captured carbon. These alternative aviation fuels can significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions compared to traditional kerosene, with some SAFs offering up to an 80% reduction.

Luxaviation's Vision for a Greener Skies

For Luxaviation, a company operating a diverse fleet of aircraft across the globe, the transition to sustainable aviation is not just an environmental imperative but a strategic business decision. The group has been actively exploring and investing in various green aviation initiatives, and this long-term SAF agreement is a testament to its proactive approach.

""This partnership with our esteemed Icelandic e-fuel innovator is a cornerstone of our long-term sustainability strategy,"" stated a spokesperson for Luxaviation. ""We recognize the critical role SAF plays in reducing aviation's environmental impact, and this agreement ensures our continued access to this vital fuel source. We are committed to leading by example within the private jet sector and demonstrating that luxury and sustainability can indeed go hand-in-hand.""

The decision to partner with an Icelandic e-fuel producer is particularly strategic. Iceland's abundant renewable energy resources, primarily geothermal and hydropower, provide an ideal environment for the production of green hydrogen, a key component in the creation of e-fuels. This geographical advantage allows for the generation of clean electricity needed to power the electrolysis process that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, and subsequently, to synthesize synthetic kerosene using captured carbon dioxide.

The Power of E-fuels: A Game Changer for Aviation

E-fuels, also known as synthetic fuels or power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, are a particularly promising pathway for aviation decarbonization. They offer several distinct advantages:

Scalability: Unlike some first-generation biofuels that may compete with food production or have land-use limitations, e-fuels can be produced at scale, provided sufficient renewable energy and carbon capture infrastructure are in place.

Drop-in Capability: E-fuels are chemically identical to conventional jet fuel, meaning they can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without the need for significant modifications. This ""drop-in"" capability is crucial for rapid adoption.

Carbon Neutrality Potential: When produced using 100% renewable electricity and captured CO2, e-fuels offer the potential for a truly circular and carbon-neutral fuel cycle. The CO2 emitted during combustion is effectively recycled from the atmosphere or industrial processes.

Energy Security: E-fuels can reduce reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets and enhance energy independence for nations.

The Icelandic innovator is reportedly leveraging cutting-edge technologies to optimize the production of e-fuels, focusing on efficiency and cost-effectiveness to make sustainable aviation more accessible. This focus on technological advancement is key to overcoming the current cost premium associated with SAF.

Key Highlights of the Luxaviation-Icelandic Innovator Partnership:

Long-Term Commitment: The agreement signifies a multi-year commitment, providing Luxaviation with predictable access to SAF and supporting the Icelandic company's production ramp-up.

Focus on E-fuels: The partnership specifically targets the production and supply of e-fuels, highlighting the growing importance of this advanced SAF pathway.

Geographic Advantage: Iceland's abundant renewable energy resources offer a significant advantage for e-fuel production.

Industry Leadership: Luxaviation's proactive stance demonstrates leadership within the business aviation industry and sets a benchmark for other operators.

Accelerating SAF Adoption: This deal is expected to catalyze further investment and innovation in the SAF market, driving down costs and increasing availability.

Navigating the Challenges: The Road Ahead for SAF

While this agreement is a cause for celebration, the broader SAF market still faces hurdles. The primary challenge remains the cost of sustainable aviation fuel, which is currently higher than conventional jet fuel. This price differential necessitates government incentives, such as tax credits and mandates, to encourage widespread adoption.

Furthermore, the scale of SAF production needs to increase dramatically to meet the growing demand from the aviation sector. This requires substantial investment in new production facilities and a robust supply chain for feedstocks. Carbon capture technologies are also crucial for e-fuel production, and their deployment needs to accelerate.

The regulatory framework for SAF is also evolving. Governments worldwide are setting targets for SAF blending mandates, which will further stimulate demand. Industry bodies are working to standardize SAF certification and ensure its environmental integrity.

Despite these challenges, partnerships like the one between Luxaviation and its Icelandic e-fuel innovator are vital for driving progress. They send a clear signal to the market about the demand for SAF and encourage further investment in research, development, and production.

The Impact on Private Aviation and Beyond

This collaboration is particularly significant for the private aviation sector. As a segment of aviation often associated with luxury and high-net-worth individuals, there is increasing scrutiny on its environmental impact. By securing a long-term supply of SAF, Luxaviation is demonstrating that it is possible to maintain the convenience and flexibility of private jet travel while minimizing its carbon footprint.

This move could inspire other private jet operators and charter companies to follow suit, accelerating the adoption of SAF across the entire business jet market. It also benefits the wider aviation ecosystem, including aircraft manufacturers and airport operators, by providing a clearer path towards decarbonization.

The implications extend beyond just business aviation. As SAF production scales up and costs decrease, it will become more accessible for commercial airlines as well, playing a crucial role in their emission reduction targets. This trend is vital for achieving the ambitious goals set by organizations like IATA (International Air Transport Association) for a sustainable air transport system.

Looking Towards a Sustainable Future

The partnership between Luxaviation and its Icelandic e-fuel pioneer is a powerful example of how collaboration and innovation can drive meaningful change in the aviation industry. It underscores the growing commitment to green aviation and the critical role of advanced SAF technologies like e-fuels.

As the world continues to prioritize sustainability, the aviation sector is at a critical juncture. Agreements like this offer a glimpse into a future where air travel can continue to connect the world, but with a significantly lighter environmental touch. The journey towards net-zero aviation is complex, but with strategic partnerships and a clear focus on innovation, the skies are indeed becoming greener.",https://multisite-public.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/news/DIM/luxaviation-powers-up-with-landmark-saf-deal-for-greener-aviation-91116.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 23:56:49.966368

Soybean is king Biodiesel can be made from soybean oil, used cooking oil or animal fat.
But in Illinois, soybean is king.
The state is the nation’s largest producer of the crop, according to the Illinois Soybean Association.
The U.S. biodiesel industry started growing in the early 1990s when Missouri soybean farmers began trying to commercialize the fuel.","On an idyllic summer morning, a Chicago Park District truck sat in front of Adler Planetarium readying for another day of keeping the city’s lakefront clean. Cyclists zipped past a breathtaking view of the iconic skyline on glittering Lake Michigan. But the park district’s seemingly humble refuse truck was also remarkable: It’s powered by biodiesel derived from soybeans.

About 80 park district vehicles are fueled by biodiesel blends made from refined soybean oil. That’s about 25% of its diesel fleet, which includes service and forestry trucks, tractors and mowers.

The parks department uses various kinds of clean energy for its vehicles and equipment. It started using soybean-based biodiesel blended with regular diesel in 2011. The liquid fuel can supplement regular diesel often used in heavy vehicles.

“It performs better than standard diesel, and the power is the same. It also benefits the health of our employees and park visitors,” Mike Dimitroff, manager of cultural and natural resources for Chicago Park District, said.

Eco-friendly biodiesel made from refined soybean oil boosts Illinois, the country’s largest producer of the crop.

Advocates tout biodiesel’s health and environmental benefits because it dramatically reduces air pollution compared to petroleum-based fuels. Biodiesel emits 50% to 80% less carbon than regular diesel.

“It gives the greatest carbon reduction per dollar spent,” Pete Probst, president of Chicago-based consultancy Indigenous Energy, said.

Soybean is king

Biodiesel can be made from soybean oil, used cooking oil or animal fat. But in Illinois, soybean is king. The state is the nation’s largest producer of the crop, according to the Illinois Soybean Association.

Illinois is already the country’s third-largest producer of ethanol, typically derived from corn and which complements gasoline in passenger vehicles. Overall, the U.S. commercial ethanol industry is older and far larger than biodiesel.

But biodiesel is growing and has potential for many kinds of transportation, including freight and shipping. Most U.S. soybeans are used to produce livestock feed and much is exported. Yet biodiesel creates an additional revenue stream for farmers and agriculture businesses.

Domestic markets for soybeans are especially appealing since tariffs have sharply disrupted international trade this year. Soybean farmers, including in Illinois, are especially vulnerable to volatility.

China, the largest export market for American soybeans, is the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. In response, China threatened retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products it imports, the majority of which are agricultural products, including soybeans.

An advantage of biodiesel is that liquid fuels have more power and can run longer than electric batteries, Probst said. That’s critical for heavy-duty use, “especially in hard-to-electrify sectors like rail, marine and long-haul trucking,” he said. “Biodiesel is a great starting point for heavy-duty fleets looking to decarbonize while electric technology catches up.”

Eighty percent of a soybean is protein, which creates soy meal. The other 20% is oil that can be refined for cooking, industrial use or fuel. However, markets for soybean oil are more limited.

But biodiesel demand has grown due to favorable government policies. Last year, 5.9 billion gallons of biodiesel were produced in the U.S., compared to 3 billion gallons in 2021, according to Clean Fuels Alliance America.

The industry aims to produce more than 6 billion gallons by 2030, said Jeff Earl, director of state governmental affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance.

Illinois has been a national leader in biodiesel for more than 20 years. In 2003, the state implemented a 6.25% sales tax exemption for fuel blended with biodiesel, making it cheaper, or the same price, as conventional diesel for consumers.

“The sales tax exemption has been a great success in boosting biodiesel in the state,” Earl said.

For biodiesel to be eligible for Illinois’ tax break, the blend threshold must be 17% . On April 1, 2026, the threshold will rise to 20%.

Biodiesel works in even higher blends. Seven park district trucks run on 100% biodiesel. Several of them service the city’s lakefront to minimize fumes for pedestrians, runners and cyclists.

Illinois was the country’s third-largest producer and consumer of biodiesel as of 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, after Iowa and Missouri.

The U.S. biodiesel industry started growing in the early 1990s when Missouri soybean farmers began trying to commercialize the fuel. Missouri soybean commodity groups funded biodiesel research and development and in 1992, founded the National SoyDiesel Development Board, which was renamed Clean Fuels Alliance.

Today, more than half of U.S. biodiesel production capacity is in the Midwest, primarily in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.

Over the years, biodiesel technology has improved and disproved misconceptions about performance. Certified biodiesel blends of 20% and below work without modifying vehicles and fuel pumps, Probst said.

Vehicles fueled with biodiesel “have logged billions of problem-free miles in all kinds of Illinois weather, including sub-zero temperatures,” according to the Illinois Soybean Association.

Incobrasa

Since 2021, the U.S. soybean crushing industry has invested more than $6 billion to expand capacity by more than 25% in response to growing biofuel demand, according to the National Oilseed Processors Association.

That includes companies such as Incobrasa Industries in Gilman, nearly two hours south of Chicago. Its soybean crushing and oil refining plant is the state’s largest biodiesel production facility, according to Incobrasa. Chevron Renewable Energy Group also has biodiesel plants in Danville and Seneca.

Incobrasa sources crops from 4,600 Illinois farms within a 50-mile radius. It stores tons of soybeans in massive silos and processes them in enormous industrial machines on its 800-acre site.

The company is in the midst of a big expansion that will add 80 million gallons of annual biodiesel production capacity by 2030 to its current capacity of 75 million gallons.

It will also more than double annual soybean crushing capacity from 40 million bushes currently to 98 million. Incobrasa expects to broaden sourcing from soybean farmers within an 80-mile radius.

Inside one of its facilities, machines whir as Incobrasa bottles white-label vegetable oil sold in retail stores nationwide. It also makes vegetable oil for USAID that is shipped to countries such as Yemen, South Sudan and Somalia, said Kerry Fogarty, Incobrasa’s quality control manager.

Demand for soybeans as food isn’t growing, but the biodiesel market is, said Aluizio Ribeiro, Incobrasa’s president. There is even more growth potential for using biodiesel in trains and ships, he added.

Aviation fuel made from biodiesel is also promising, said Stan Born, national director of the American Soybean Association and a farmer based in Lovington. But the sustainable aviation fuel industry “is still relatively young and needs support to get its legs,” Born said.

Biodiesel is also vulnerable to shifting government policies. Trump’s budget bill, signed in July, phases out many clean energy subsidies but was largely favorable toward biodiesel.

Brazilian-owned Incobrasa expanded into the U.S. with its Gilman facility in 1995. Initially, the plant crushed beans for soy meal and cooking oil; the commercial U.S. biodiesel market didn’t exist yet.

“We still had a great deal of soybean oil that needed a market. Biodiesel was the answer,” Fogarty said.

In 2004, Incobrasa added an oil refinery and a packaging facility for food-grade vegetable oil.

Today, about 90% of Incobrasa’s biodiesel is distributed in Illinois, Ribeiro said. That benefits the company because shorter supply chains are more efficient. Biodiesel can be found at mainstream gas stations that sell diesel, such as BP and Road Ranger.

Incobrasa is also insulated from trade wars and market volatility, Ribeiro added. The domestic biodiesel industry is shielded from tariffs, which are roiling U.S. farmers who rely on export markets. About 85% of Incobrasa’s soybeans come from farmers in Illinois with the rest sourced from nearby states, he said.

Biodiesel also creates valuable jobs in the rural economy. Incobrasa is the biggest employer in Iroquois County, said Rick Theesfeld, mayor of Gilman, which has a population of approximately 1,500. Incobrasa employs about 200 people and will add 100 jobs after its expansion.

“Places like this help our economy,” State Rep. Jason Bunting, R-Ill, said during a tour of Incobrasa’s facility this summer. “It keeps people here in the state so they don’t move out. It’s a huge shot in the arm to my district and this economy,” said Bunting, who is also a farmer growing corn and soybeans near Emington.

Born, of the American Soybean Association, grows soybean and corn on his farm in Lovington, about an hour from Champaign. He grew up on a farm and returned to growing in 2010, after he retired from his career as a Caterpillar executive.

For farmers, biodiesel creates more demand and diverse markets for soybeans as well as better prices for them, Born said. The fuel is also environmentally friendly.

“About half of the oil refined from my beans goes to this market so it’s a critically important end-use,” Born said. “The more demand we have, the better our markets become.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/685c87f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2900x1523+0+54/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2Fa4%2F232fe8c3481fae76fbb4e3312dda%2Fsoybeans-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 21:56:33.496534

The airline becomes the 25th global operator of the A220, which is now flying with carriers on five continents.

The aircraft, dubbed ""People's Balus"", departed the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mirabel for a delivery flight to Port Moresby, with scheduled stops in Vancouver, Honolulu and Fiji. The delivery represents a significant milestone in Air Niugini’s fleet modernisation programme, with eight A220-100s on direct order with Airbus and three A220-300s being leased from Azorra.

The aircraft’s special livery marks the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Papua New Guinea. The intricate design was brought to life by a dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters who worked to apply 11 distinct colours using a special airbrushing technique.

This delivery highlights the A220’s strong position in its segment, combining the longest range (6,700km) with the lowest fuel consumption in its class, - 25% less than previous-generation aircraft. The A220-100, which serves the 100-135 seat market, is a crucial component of this modern airliner family, while the larger A220-300 is tailored for the 120-160 seat segment. This Air Niugini A220-300 is configured to accommodate a total of 138 passengers, a testament to its flexibility and suitability for the carrier's network.

The A220 is poised to become the centrepiece of the airline's regional and international fleet, providing a new level of operational efficiency and passenger comfort. Its unmatched efficiency, coupled with a spacious cabin and the range to connect various destinations, positions it as an exemplary fit for the carrier's network and its overarching objectives for long-term growth.

The airframe integrates 40% advanced materials, resulting in a lighter-weight aircraft. The A220 also incorporates optimised aerodynamics with a newly designed nose and tail cone, both of which contribute to reducing drag. In fact, the A220 has the smallest fuselage wetted area -the surface directly in contact with the air- in its class.

The A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF™ engines, offering a 25% reduction in carbon emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target for all aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

As of the end of August 2025, Airbus has secured more than 940 orders for the A220 from over 30 customers, and has delivered over 440 aircraft. The A220 is already flying on more than 1,800 routes to more than 480 destinations worldwide, confirming its leading position in the small single-aisle market.

The announcement came a day after the governing Liberals announced an extension to a power-purchase agreement between N.L. Hydro and Corner Brook Pulp and Paper that sees the Crown utility purchase power from the company at inflated prices.

Liberal Premier John Hogan, describing the Placentia Bay refinery as an important provincial asset, announced the repayable loan in a news release on Thursday afternoon.

""The on-site production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel offers proven alternatives to fossil fuels,"" he wrote.

""Our financial support will assist in a return to operations and support the hardworking employees as they continue their jobs and the economic benefits to the region remain.""

The refinery suspended production in early 2025, blaming unexpectedly low margins and the removal of tax credits in the United States.

The company retained its roughly 240 full-time workers during the shutdown, and the refinery was kept in idle mode, allowing a quick restart in June.

The news release says Braya requested a loan to support continued maintenance of the facility during the shutdown.

The government money is being used for upgrades, feedstock expansion and market diversification.

Braya will have five years to repay the loan.

Braya CEO Todd O'Malley admitted it's been a challenging time for the refinery. He added that the company is seeking ""further support"" from the federal government to ""level the playing field for renewable producers such as Braya and are hopeful for a robust response to pair with this constructive approach from the province.""

Glenn Nolan, president of USW Local 9316, said the loan is ""great news for [the union], Braya, our workers, surrounding communities, contractors and the Newfoundland and Labrador economy.""

""Our refinery will benefit from this loan which will help us to succeed in the renewable markets. [The union] would like to thank our government for working with Braya and USW in building a long future for our renewable refinery.""

The loan will offset up to $2 million of Braya's labour costs and up to $1 million of eligible non-labour costs in the province to a maximum monthly drawdown on the loan of $3 million.

According to the news release, the provincial government's financial liability under the environmental agreement indemnity provided to Braya will be reduced by the loan principal and interest outstanding for the period that the amounts are outstanding.

The facility is a former crude oil refinery and is owned by a group that includes Cresta Fund Management, North Atlantic Refining Corp., which is managed by Silverpeak, and Energy Capital Partners.

The refinery started operating in February 2024, with a production capacity of up to 18,000 barrels per day.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.6899183.1689267702!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/braya-come-by-chance-refinery-drone-aerial-cbc.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-11 18:56:29.465415

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The above video first aired in January 2025.)

The facility, built on a 1,600-acre former plywood mill site, represents a significant expansion from USA BioEnergy's initial 2022 announcement of a $1.7 billion facility. The company finalized the purchase of the former Kirby Mill site in January.

""We are excited to add two of the world's leading technology providers to our team,"" said Tony Wedell, USA BioEnergy's chief operating officer, in the news release. ""We are creating the best fully integrated solution in the advanced fuels industry.""

The biorefinery will process one million tons of biomass annually using responsibly sourced forest thinnings as feedstock. The facility will also include a 100-megawatt wood-fired power plant and hydrogen production unit, according to Newton County Judge Ronald J. Cochran.

The location provides access to abundant raw materials according to USA BioEnergy CEO Nick Andrews. ""It's right in the middle of Newton County, which is the most densely populated county of southern yellow pine plantations in east Texas,"" Andrews previously stated.

The project builds on USA BioEnergy's 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines announced in late 2023 for up to 680 million gallons of synthetic paraffinic kerosene. When blended with fossil jet fuel to meet international standards, this quantity could yield 2.59 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel.

In contrast to biofuels, PtL is not based on biological feedstocks.
PtL Cost: Currently USD $8–10 per liter, which is many orders of magnitude above the cost of fossil kerosene.
PtL fuels represent a longer-term solution: carbon-neutral, scalable, and infrastructure-ready when renewable energy and CO₂ capture are at an industrial scale.
The SAF future will not be about either-or but about biofuels being today's solution on the ground and PtL tomorrow's scalable foundation.","DALLAS — The world's aviation sector is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Since air travel accounts for 2% to 3% of total CO2 emissions, air transport is now law- and market-mandated to switch to low-carbon fuels.

While hydrogen power and electrification hold long-term promise, neither technology is currently mature enough to propel long-range aircraft. Therefore, the fastest path is Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs).

The two leading areas of debate in SAFs are biofuels, produced from renewable organic biomass feedstocks, and power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, which are artificially created using captured carbon dioxide and renewable power.

Both provide significant emissions benefits, are drop-in compatible with existing engines and equipment, and are certified for use in aircraft. They are fundamentally different, however, in terms of cost, technology readiness, and scalability.

What Are Biofuels?

Bio-based SAFs are produced from biological materials, such as waste cooking oil, animal fat, and agricultural waste. HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) is the most developed process that converts oils and fats into hydrocarbons that are virtually identical to Jet A.

Other nascent pathways include:

Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ): Ethanol or isobutanol transformed into synthetic kerosene.

Gasification + Fischer–Tropsch (FT): Biomass is gasified into syngas, which is then converted into liquid fuel.

Advanced Generations: Utilizing algae or microbes to produce lipids that can be processed into jet fuel.

HEFA-based fuels have been ASTM-approved since 2011 and are now being used in commercial operations globally. Airlines have commercially operated over 450,000 SAF-fueled flights, nearly all on HEFA blends.

What Is PtL?

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels, also known as synthetic e-fuels, are produced by combining green hydrogen (generated through electrolysis using renewable electricity) with captured CO₂. Through methods such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, this provides synthetic kerosene chemically identical to traditional jet fuel.

In contrast to biofuels, PtL is not based on biological feedstocks. Its principal inputs, renewable electricity and CO₂, are theoretically boundless. In theory, PtL could grow to supply global aviation needs without competing with food or agricultural land use.

However, the process is both expensive and energy-intensive. Present pilot plants produce small quantities at prices significantly higher than those of biofuels, not to mention fossil Jet A.

Emissions Reduction Potential

They both have high emissions reduction potential, but in different ways.

Biofuels: Lifecycle CO₂ savings vary between 60–80% depending on the feedstock. Waste oils have the highest savings; crop-based feedstocks could have reduced savings because of fertilizer and land conversion effects.

PtL: Provides 90–100% lifecycle savings, as burning releases only the CO₂ fixed during production. This depends on whether 100% of the energy for electrolysis and capture comes from renewable sources.

This renders PtL theoretically climate-neutral, whereas biofuels yield immediate, pragmatic reductions.

Costs, Scalability

Biofuels

Cost: Currently 2–5 times costlier than Jet A.

• Scalability: There's a limited supply of feedstock. Even if all available waste oils were used, they could only meet about 2-3% of aviation's fuel needs.

• Market Outlook: According to IDTechEx, SAF capacity – primarily based on HEFA – is expected to reach around 57 million tonnes per year by 2035, with HEFA dominating the market in the near future.

PtL

Cost: Currently USD $8–10 per liter, which is many orders of magnitude above the cost of fossil kerosene.

Scalability: Theoretically unlimited but limited by renewable electricity supply and CO₂ capture technology.

Market Outlook: PtL deployment on a large scale is anticipated after 2030, as the cost of renewable energy and electrolyser decreases.

Infrastructure, Compatibility

Both fuels have the major benefit that they are drop-in fuels, with no need for modifications to current aircraft or airport fueling infrastructure.

Biofuels: Already mixed up to 50% with Jet A to ASTM D7566. Compatible with existing refineries through co-processing.

PtL: The same as Jet A at the molecular level and thus directly compatible. However, infrastructure for electrolysis and CO₂ capture has not been developed at scale yet.

Industry Example

Biofuels in Operation

In 2011, KLM flew the world's first commercial HEFA-powered flight using used cooking oil, paving the way for the uptake of bio-SAF. Multiple airlines, including United, Delta, and Singapore Airlines, have since entered multi-year offtake agreements with producers.

Regulatory Drivers

European Union: With a strong preference for advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels, the ReFuelEU mandate calls for 2% SAF blending by 2025, 1.2% by 2030, and 70% by 2050.

United States: With the help of tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the SAF Grand Challenge seeks to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030.

ICAO CORSIA: Biofuels and PtL are recognized as acceptable methods of reducing emissions on international flights.

These measures are propelling investment across both categories, albeit near-term supply is expected to be weighted towards biofuels.

Challenges in Deployment

Biofuels

Feedstock Competition: Waste oils also serve the road transport and chemical industries.

Land Use Pressure: Crop-based feedstocks pose a threat to deforestation and food price inflation.

Supply Limits: Even with optimistic assumptions, biofuels cannot service long-term aviation demand alone.

PtL

Energy Intensity: To produce one liter of PtL, significant quantities of renewable electricity are required.

Cost Barrier: Without subsidization, PtL is economically uncompetitive.

Technology Scale: Electrolysis and carbon capture are not yet constructed to the scale of aviation demands.

Market Outlook: 2025–2035

IDTechEx predicts that production of SAFbiofuels and PtL together will reach over 57 million tonnes per year by 2035 at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2025.

2025–2030: SAF will be dominated by HEFA biofuels based on existing feedstocks and refinery compatibility.

2030–2035: PtL projects will expand, particularly in regions with high availability of renewable energy, such as Northern Europe, Chile, and Canada.

After 2035: As the cost of renewable electricity decreases and carbon capture enhances, PtL may become the dominant SAF source.

Conclusion

For aviation, the decarbonization problem is pressing and multifaceted. Biofuels provide short-term reductions, backed by mature supply chains and mandatory regulations. However, they have inherent limitations in the availability of feedstocks, so they serve as a bridging solution rather than a long-term solution.

PtL fuels represent a longer-term solution: carbon-neutral, scalable, and infrastructure-ready when renewable energy and CO₂ capture are at an industrial scale. Punitively expensive for now, the momentum picks up as demonstration projects show it can be done.

The SAF future will not be about either-or but about biofuels being today's solution on the ground and PtL tomorrow's scalable foundation. The effective management of that transition will determine whether flying can meet its net-zero by 2050 pledge while remaining safe and efficient enough to keep the world connected.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68c304a210cdda0f3df3a09c_17-027%20Image%20from%20NASA(1).webp,N,,2025-09-11 14:56:24.574522

GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTS JAPAN MARKET Coming back from a trade mission this week to Japan, Nebraska Gov.","WOOD RIVER, Neb. (DTN) -- Leaders from the Nebraska Farm Bureau on Wednesday shared their concerns about high input costs and weak commodity prices, though they stopped short of suggesting more farmer aid may be needed.

Meanwhile, Nebraska's governor, fresh off a trade trip to Japan, touted potential biofuel sales to the country.

Farm Bureau held a roundtable at Husker Harvest Days to highlight some of the challenges farmers face while advocating for year-round E15 legislation, more trade deals and livestock expansion to ease some of the pressures on producers.

""As I've been walking around the show here the last day and a half, the thing that keeps popping up -- that people keep asking about or stopping me to talk about -- is just the high input costs,"" said Mark McHargue, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau. ""I know that on our farm in particular, when I look at the bills and the checks that I write, it's going to be one of the highest per-acre input costs that I'm going to have over my 30-plus years of farming.""

Nebraska Farm Bureau economist and policy analyst Abygail Streff noted that since 2020, soybean input costs have climbed 61% per acre, and corn inputs are up 41%. Farm equipment prices have gone up 69% since 2020.

""That's huge. We've never seen that before,"" Streff said, adding, ""That's a huge cost to producers and something that we're feeling, and the farm economy is definitely reflecting that to us.""

Bruce Williams, a farmer in eastern Nebraska, added that his operation is feeling the pressure from higher inputs that aren't being offset by crop prices. ""We don't have the commodity prices to go with the input prices, so it's creating more pain in the farming environment.""

Going into 2026, Williams said cash flow is the biggest issue facing farmers, and that's going to create a ripple effect when it comes to next year's operating loans. ""Farmers are feeling it on the cash flow, and that's where they're going to feel it the most, and it's going to affect funding for next year,"" he said.

Chad Nienhueser, who farms in central Nebraska, said interest rates are becoming a bigger problem, as they have doubled in the last five years. ""It's a lot more of a problem in our cash flow situation,"" Nienhueser said.

Nationally, agricultural loans average about 7.29% this year, Streff noted. ""That creates a huge amount of strain, and that's a huge input cost,"" Streff said. ""In general, it's just taking a lot more money to put the same crop in.""

TOUTING E15 LEGISLATION

McHargue highlighted the need to grow both domestic and foreign markets. He said one of the quickest ""win-win"" moves would be for Congress to finally approve year-round E15 nationally. He and others were in Washington, D.C., last week advocating for lawmakers to act.

E15 has continued to sell in the summer through annual waivers approved by EPA, but McHargue said many retailers want a permanent fix before they start putting in blender pumps and the full tanks necessary for 15% ethanol.

""Retailers won't make the investment in tanks unless it's permanent,"" McHargue said. ""If we make it permanent, they'll go ahead and make those investments, and then we can really get that moving.""

GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTS JAPAN MARKET

Coming back from a trade mission this week to Japan, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, said in a separate talk on Wednesday that Japan is looking to aggressively buy more ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan is about a 12-billion-gallon gasoline market, and with a 10% ethanol blend, that's about 1.2 billion gallons.

""I think I met with five or six governors in Japan and simply said, 'Look, it's really important that we do business together, that you don't buy ethanol from Brazil because when it really gets down to crunch time, Brazil is not going be there.'""

Pillen said Nebraska biofuel producers are better positioned than biofuel producers in surrounding states to market aviation fuel to Japan going forward as well.

Pillen stressed the need for more value-added agriculture rather than loading corn and soybeans onto rail and barges to export to China.

""We want to process every kernel higher, whether it is through cattle or through ethanol or through sustainable aviation fuel,"" Pillen said.

Pillen and state Agriculture Director Sherry Vinton also pointed to parts of the Trump administration's trade deal with Japan that spells out $550 billion in investments that Japan is expected to make in the U.S.

Streff highlighted Nebraska's reliance on exports, noting the state shipped $7.9 billion in agricultural goods in 2023, ranking first in beef and hides and third in corn and processed grains.

""We have products the rest of the world needs,"" she said, pointing to China and Japan as key buyers. But she cautioned that trade disruptions could hit Nebraska harder than surrounding states. ""With agriculture being our main economic driver, anything that hurts those markets would obviously affect us.""

FARM BILL PRIORITIES

McHargue, a pork producer, also pressed Congress to deal with California's Proposition 12 as lawmakers try to pass several provisions of the farm bill that were not part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. McHargue called Prop 12 a trade barrier between states that limits sales of pork into California.

""It's a barrier that stops Nebraska from fully trading the products we grow here,"" he said.

Separately, Pillen was also discussing the capital needed to help young people get into agriculture. He said the Farm Service Agency (FSA) needs to increase the limits on farm ownership and operating loans for younger producers. Pillen said he has talked with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins about that issue, though those caps are also set in the farm bill.

Reasonably Opposed Michael McAdams, president of the ABFA, came out in July against the idea of reducing RIN values by 50% for foreign feedstocks.
Many ethanol producers are not as focused on 45Z’s foreign feedstock exclusion as they are the policy’s forthcoming roll out.","The recently enhanced 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which now extends through 2029, will provide four full years for the biofuels industry to follow through on investments and projects meant to grow capacity, says Paul Winters, director of public affairs and federal communications for Clean Fuels Alliance America, a trade group representing U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers. The landmark extension, enhancement and clarification of 45Z should also provide a significant benefit to American farmers and domestic biofuel producers of all kinds thanks to one rather contentious adjustment.

Under the new version of the policy framework, 45Z credit eligibility is limited to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada (USMCA). Lawmakers had initially proposed to place no geographical limits on feedstock eligibility but would have reduced the value of the credit by 20% for non-USMCA inputs. That changed when the language on feedstock eligibility was updated prior to Senate passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)—signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4—which made non-USMCA fuels and feedstocks altogether ineligible.

Producers utilizing foreign inputs for domestic biofuel production were ostensibly disappointed with the foreign feedstock exclusion, as 45Z’s value was stripped from their business plans. They had no time to lament the loss, however, with another battle over RIN values already upon them.

In mid-June, shortly before OBBBA’s passage, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard revisions—the so-called “Set 2” Rule—laying out two years of renewable volume obligations (RVOs), overhauling various elements of the program, addressing volumes lost through small refinery exemptions and, notably, differentiating between foreign and domestic fuels and feedstocks.

The agency’s proposal introduces a new two-tier structure for RIN valuation, granting U.S. biofuels and feedstocks full credit while assigning only 50% RIN value to foreign equivalents. According to the EPA, this framework is intentionally designed to favor American producers and limit the RFS value for imports. If implemented as proposed, imported renewable fuel or fuel made domestically with foreign feedstocks would generate half the RINs of purely domestic renewable fuel. And the reduction would apply to all foreign-produced biofuel, including product coming from Canada and Mexico.

The EPA is framing the proposed change on feedstock RIN allocation percentages as having a correlation to national security and North American economic benefit. “The reduction of RINs generated for import-based renewable fuel reflects the reduced economic and energy security benefits provided by these fuels relative to renewable fuels produced domestically using domestic feedstocks,” EPA said.

The public comment period on the proposed 2026-’27 RFS program closed Aug. 8—all the expected trade groups submitted their input—and finalization of the plan is tentatively slated for Oct. 31.

Winters and CFAA have applauded the decision for the foreign feedstock provision. Others, including the Advanced Biofuels Association, have not only voiced their displeasure with the proposal, but produced research to back up their objections to the penalty on foreign feedstock.

Majority Approval

Reducing the RIN value associated with fuels and feedstock sourced outside the U.S. will support domestic oilseed processors, protect the investments they’ve made, and keep more of the value of U.S. crops here at home, Winters says.

“The feedstock limit will require farmers and oilseed processors to adopt new record-keeping and traceability requirements,” Winters points out. “It remains to be seen how onerous those requirements are, or could become under a different administration.”

The EPA believes the new feedstock-tracking requirements will be “minimally burdensome.” Under the new rule, domestic renewable fuel producers will be required to keep records of feedstock purchase transfers including bills of sale, delivery receipts and other forms. The documents will identify the feedstock’s point of origin and impact every biofuel producer generating RINs. According to the EPA, the feedstock point of origin would depend on the feedstock type and where it is grown, produced, generated, extracted, collected or harvested.

Planted crops, cover crops and crop residues could use the location of the feedstock supplier—the entity providing the feedstock to the producer—as an acceptable point of origin. A grain elevator, for example, would suffice, the EPA says.

For oil derived from planted crops, a crushing facility supplying a biodiesel producer would work. Fats, oils and greases, along with municipal solid waste, could be verified by providing the location of a processing facility. A landfill or digester would be enough for biogas. The harvest site of woody biomass would qualify. For all feedstocks, the point of origin would need to be included in the renewable fuel batch reports.

U.S. ethanol trade groups such as Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association are generally supportive of biofuel feedstock policy that limits any unfair advantage a foreign feedstock provider might have over U.S. growers and suppliers. In fact, ethanol trade groups advocated for harmonizing 45Z and RFS feedstock provisions, citing the benefits of limiting eligible feedstocks, under both policies, to those originating in USMCO. They also asked the EPA to exempt corn and sorghum from proposed RFS feedstock tracking requirements. As proposed, limiting the RIN value of foreign product is a domestic advantage that comes with some work. But the EPA believes point-of-origin tracking, for the most part, will be something most producers will already be doing, whether to tap 45Z tax credits or access low-carbon markets.

Reasonably Opposed

Michael McAdams, president of the ABFA, came out in July against the idea of reducing RIN values by 50% for foreign feedstocks. He says the drafted rule could threaten continued investments, limit consumer access to American-made fuels and artificially inflate prices. ABFA believes the foreign feedstock reduction would also make it harder for U.S. advanced biofuel producers, including those targeting SAF, to meet the projected volume obligations (RVOs) or continue on with their plans for production.

GlobalData Agri analyzed the issue on behalf of the ABFA, releasing a study titled “Lipid Feedstocks Outlook to 2030 and RVO Analysis.” The study concluded that, although the majority of growth in biomass-based diesel (BBD) supply can come from domestic feedstocks, imports will continue to be needed across the sector.

“The gulf in value created by the proposed RIN system will push up prices to consumers and limit growth in the BBD market,” the report said.

According to the ABFA, reducing credit values for foreign-based RINs would effectively create a $250 to $400 per-metric-ton premium for domestic feedstocks, which may sound good to suppliers and growers, but not biofuel producers or consumers.

While vocalizing industry concerns about reduced RIN values for foreign fuels and feedstocks, McAdams also expressed hope that the U.S. Department of the Treasury—which oversees 45Z—could still revise the foreign feedstock exclusion of the production tax credit before it is fully implemented.

Like McAdams, Winters is also eyeing Treasury’s handling of the policy, and the pace at which it gets the new version of 45Z going. “Producers are already trying to adapt to the new rule and put in place feedstock contracts for the start of 2026,” Winters says. “They need proposed and final rules from Treasury immediately so they can calculate the incentives relative to state and international markets for different feedstocks.”

Priorities Beyond the Dust-Up

Troy Bredenkamp, senior vice president of government and public affairs at the RFA, says the biofuels industry is widely pleased with the way 45Z enhancements shook out, along with the EPA’s proposed 2026-’27 RVOs. He says a wide swath of congressional leaders, along with key figures within the Trump administration, see an opportunity with both policies. “Of all of the Inflation Reduction Act credits that were passed in the Biden Administration, 45Z was one of the only tax credits to survive and get extended,” he says.

Many ethanol producers are not as focused on 45Z’s foreign feedstock exclusion as they are the policy’s forthcoming roll out. In addition to other favorable enhancements, the RFA was pleased that the new version makes the tax credit transferable for producers. In the previous version, it was not.

Bredenkamp also cites the importance of eliminating indirect land-use change (ILUC) as a variable used to calculate carbon intensity scores. “For corn ethanol, that is a little over six CI points,” he says. “That was enough to move a majority of our member plants from being just outside the program (i.e., qualifying for the 45Z credit) to being in it. That’s significant.”

According to Bredenkamp, his team performed an analysis that revealed if the ILUC factor had remained in the 45Z policy framework, most corn ethanol plants would have remained at a score of above 50, enough to keep them out of qualifying for 45Z.

Fastmarkets, a commodity info and tracking provider, called the ILUC removal a bright spot as well. “The updated policy makes crop-based oils financially viable, expanding the feedstock pool, reducing supply risk and strengthening domestic supply chains, ultimately encouraging scaled production and long-term investment,” the company said.

CI scores are calculated by using the GREET model, which accounts for the greenhouse gas emissions of each step in the biofuels supply and production chain. Previous versions applied an ILUC value into the calculations. The lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit. And under the new 45Z framework, biofuel producers can earn a tax credit of up to $1 per gallon.

For SAF producers, the new 45Z structure lessens the total tax credit value they can earn. Plus, SAF producers cannot receive overlapping tax credits, and there are no longer premiums for SAF. Previous versions of the 45Z framework would have provided an extra 75 cents per gallon.

Bredenkamp, a Nebraska resident who farms outside of York, says the one wildcard with 45Z is whether the climate-smart ag provisions initiated under the Biden administration will resurface. There is currently no language that would require or incentivize any climate-smart ag practices by a feedstock provider (such as no-till or cover cropping).

Now that 45Z is in the policy rollout loop, Bredenkamp and the rest of the ethanol industry are focusing on year-round E15.

“E15 is our top priority,” he says from his home in Nebraska, following a long stint in D.C. this past summer. In the fall, Bredenkamp will head back to D.C., continuing to push for year-round, nationwide E15. “We need to find a legislative vehicle that the provision can be attached to,” he explains. “There are very few legislative bills that move as a single subject.”

Finding a must-pass piece of legislation near the end of the year can be difficult, he says, but there are options. Appropriations bills or continuing resolutions that keep the government running are great options for the team to include a year-round E15 policy.

To explain the importance of an E15 year-round policy, Bredenkamp points to the bumper corn crop in Nebraska, Iowa or South Dakota in August. “This could be a corn crop for the record books,” he says. “That scenario will only help emphasize the need for our domestic markets to increase demand for that product.”

SAF is critical to achieving this, as the majority of emissions from aviation are from fuel.","Provectus Biofuels Inc. plans to produce 100 million litres of low-carbon jet fuel per year in Alberta by tapping into abundant sources of agricultural waste from local farmers as feedstock.

Based in Prince George, B.C., the project developer has secured a letter of intent for 160 acres of land in Vegreville, a town approximately 100 kilometres east of Edmonton.

There, Provectus has designs for its Dobrojet project, where it aims to generate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The fuel emits less greenhouse gas compared to conventional counterparts. Provectus anticipates its production will offset 274,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of taking over 59,000 cars off the road for a year.

An aviation climate action plan released by the Canadian government in 2022 lays out a goal to have 10 per cent of Canada’s jet fuel supplied by SAF by 2030.

“The reality is that what is driving adoption and consumption is the regulations impacting the aviation industry,” Tom McMillan, vice-president of business and investment development at Provectus, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada.

SAF, he added, “is the only way to decarbonize air travel.”

From forestry to agriculture

Provectus was co-founded by president and CEO Jon Jaque and director Don Shewchenko in 2021. Jaque, who also participated in the interview, has a background in information technology, real estate development and developing projects in the green energy and renewable natural gas sectors.

Jaque and Shewchenko assembled a team that became Provectus to “move forward in a parallel space” to the renewable natural gas industry, he said.

The company’s initial plan was to draw from forestry biomass in British Columbia. But the province’s forestry is in “flux,” Jaque said. Provectus looked east to Alberta because “there’s a certain level of ease in the agricultural sector for assembling the required biomass,” he continued.

Wheat straw, the byproduct from harvesting grain, is produced in large, reliable volumes by Alberta’s farms. An investor deck created by Provectus says 3.4 million tonnes of wheat straw are harvested annually within 100 kilometres of Vegreville. Dobrojet is expected to consume 165,000 tonnes of wheat straw per year, McMillan said.

The leftovers from wheat harvests will be gasified in a low-oxygen, high-temperature environment to generate synthesis gases. The gases will be converted to methanol, then reformed and distilled into SAF.

The pitch deck shows Provectus targeting 30 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of its SAF, less than half of the British Columbia government’s target for 80 grams by 2030.

Dobrojet's flight path

The feasibility studies for Dobrojet have been completed. Provectus is now preparing for the front-end engineering design (FEED) study.

To secure the funding for the FEED phase, the company is taking steps to finalize offtake and supply agreements, license the technology for producing SAF, and establish a proof of concept, McMillan said.

After the FEED study, Provectus will be better informed to move toward the final investment decision, then project stage financing to raise money for construction.

The hope is to begin the FEED study within three to six months, McMillan said, with the study itself taking 12 to 18 months. The final investment decision is then expected to take six months. If the investment is secured, construction is projected to take two to three years to complete.

The construction is expected to cost $845 million, with Provectus expecting to have financial support from both governments and private equity groups focused on renewable energy, McMillan said.

The size of Dobrojet has yet to be finalized, but 80 to 100 people are expected to be employed at the facility.

Provectus is in talks with airlines, fuel distributors and airports as potential customers. Most of the companies are Canadian firms, Jaque said, with some international businesses also taking an interest.

A need to scale-up SAF production

There is a case for Dobrojet to be Provectus’ hub for SAF production, McMillan said, fed by “spoke” feedstock facilities that will produce methanol to supply Dobrojet. Such spokes would likely be in Alberta and British Columbia.

Facilities like Dobrojet will be needed to meet global ambitions of decarbonizing aviation, an industry the International Energy Agency says was responsible for 2.5 per cent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2023.

The Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels developed a plan to produce one billion litres of SAF per year in the country by 2030, drawing from renewable feedstocks such as forestry and agricultural wastes, industrial fats, oils and grease, municipal solid wastes and captured carbon dioxide.

Airline members of the Montreal-based International Air Transport Association (IATA) committed to net-zero from their operations by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources – such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, or even captured carbon dioxide combined with green hydrogen. Unlike experimental fuels, SAF is a “drop-in” replacement, meaning it can be blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 and used in today’s aircraft engines and airport fuel systems without modifications.

On a lifecycle basis, SAF can cut carbon dioxide emissions by 50–80% (or more) compared to fossil jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production process. It also contains fewer impurities like sulfur and aromatics, which leads to cleaner combustion, fewer soot particles, and reduced contrail formation. This is an essential factor in determining the impact of Aviation on the world’s climate.

SAF is certified under American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D7566/D1655)

Why Airbus and Boeing are investing in SAF?

1) Protecting the value proposition of their fleets

Airlines need aircraft that are compatible with 100% SAF so they can comply with mandates and decarbonization plans without waiting for new propulsion architectures. Both OEMs publicly target 100% SAF capability by 2030, and run large test programs (e.g., A380 and A350 on 100% SAF; 777/787/737 programs in Boeing’s Eco-Demonstrator).

2) Catalyzing supply with capital and demand signals

Airbus: Strategic partnerships and co-investments (e.g., up to $200M with Qantas to seed an Australian AF industry; collaboration with Lanza Jet / Jet Zero pathways). Airbus also uses SAF in its own operations (more than 11 million liters in 2023) and supports offtake structuring for customers.

Boeing: Multi-million-gallon SAF procurements for its operations (e.g., 5.6 million gal in 2023; 5.4 million gal in 2024 via book-and-claim), partnerships across the value chain (Alder Fuels, EPIC, World Energy, Neste), and extensive Eco Demonstrator testing on high-blend and 100% SAF.

ASTM-approved SAF pathways (2025)

To ensure safety and performance, all Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) must meet strict certification standards. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has approved several pathways that define how SAF can be produced, blended, and used in commercial aviation.

The table below outlines the current ASTM-approved pathways, their feedstocks, and blending limits as of 2025.

Pathway Common name Typical feedstocks Max blend in spec fuel FT-SPK (A1) Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene Municipal solid waste, ag residues, biomass-to-syngas 50% HEFA-SPK (A2) Hydro-processed Esters & Fatty Acids Used cooking oil (UCO), tallow, non-food lipids 50% SIP (A3) Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (from sugars) Sugars to farnesane 10% FT-SPK/A or FT-SKA (A4) FT with aromatics Adds synthetic aromatics 50% ATJ-SPK (A5) Alcohol-to-Jet Ethanol or iso-butanol 50% (pathway-dependent) CHJ (A6) Catalytic Hydro-thermolysis Jet Lipids 50% HC-HEFA (A7) Hydro-carbonized HEFA (algal) B. braunii lipids 10% ATJ-SKA (A8) Alcohol-to-Jet with aromatics Adds synthetic aromatics 50% Co-processing (D1655) Petroleum unit CO2 processing Lipids/biogenic oils in refineries 5% biogenic content in batch

Source: NREL (2024) – ASTM Annex Pathways; U.S. DOE AFDC – SAF pathways overview

100% SAF: When aromatics are present (via SAK/SKA) and other spec properties are met, aircraft can mechanically operate on neat SAF. Certification to use 100% SAF in regular service is the next step, targeted by both OEMs this decade.

What does the future hold for SAF?

The future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) depends heavily on scaling up production, reducing costs, and fostering collaboration across the industry. In the short term, SAF will continue to make up only a small share of jet fuel usage due to high prices and limited feedstock. However, advances in power-to-liquid technologies, which combine green hydrogen with captured CO2, along with new feedstocks like algae and municipal waste, are expected to bring costs down and expand availability. This, coupled with regulatory mandates in regions such as the EU and the U.S, will accelerate SAF’s shift from niche adoption to a mainstream aviation fuel by the 2030s

In the longer term, SAF will serve as a critical complement to hydrogen and electric propulsion, particularly on long-haul routes where current alternatives remain technically and economically challenging. Airbus and Boeing’s push to certify their fleets for 100% SAF ensures the infrastructure will be ready once supply scales up. More than a temporary fix, SAF is a cornerstone of aviation’s net-zero strategy, and its growth will depend on sustained cooperation among governments, manufacturers, airlines, fuel producers, and even travelers to drive the industry’s sustainable future.

Syllabus: GS3/Environment; Energy

Context

India is formulating a national policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) alongside a long-term roadmap through 2050, as part of its efforts to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2070.

About the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

It is a bio-based alternative to fossil-derived jet fuel that can be produced from non-edible oils, used cooking oil, algae, and agricultural waste.

Need For A National Policy on SAF

Global Compliance & Enabling International Certification: ICAO’ CORSIA becomes mandatory for participating states from 2027.

Airlines operating international flights between ICAO member states need to be required to offset their carbon emissions above a set baseline, ensuring compliance with global emissions reduction goals.

India currently lacks an Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) benchmark within the CORSIA framework, unlike Brazil (sugarcane) and the US (corn).

Potential and Opportunities

India has proposed blending targets of 1% by 2027; 2% by 2028; and 5% by 2030 for SAF in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), initially for international flights.

By 2030, achieving the 5% SAF blending target would require about 6 billion litres of ethanol, if no other feedstocks are considered.

Support Feedstock Cultivation & Supply Chain Development: According to Deloitte’s 2024 report ‘Green Wings: India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Revolution in the Making’:

India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by FY40.

Investments required: ₹6–7 lakh crore ($70–85 billion).

Emission reduction potential: 20–25 million tonnes annually.

The Indian Sugar & Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) is working on blending strategies.

It has partnered with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of sugarcane-based SAF using syrup, molasses, and bagasse.

Challenges

Cost and Classification: SAF costs nearly 3 times more than conventional jet fuel, while synthetic SAF (Power-to-Liquid) can be 7 times costlier.

SAF is still classified under fossil fuels, and reclassification under the bioenergy sector would allow access to existing incentives, such as those under the Gobardhan scheme.

Technological Gaps: SAF production requires advanced infrastructure and R&D.

Limited access to sustainable biomass like molasses, bagasse, and used cooking oil.

Efforts & Initiatives Related to SAF in India

Institutional Framework: The policy is being jointly steered by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA).

MoPNG: Focus on production, feedstock development, and certification.

It has constituted a Bio-Aviation Turbine Fuel Programme Committee to promote SAF adoption.

MoCA: Responsible for implementation, airline obligations, airport readiness, and compliance with global standards such as ASTM D7566 and CORSIA.

Indian Oil Corporation aims to start producing 35,000 tonnes of SAF per year from used cooking oil, sourced from large hotels, restaurants, and food chains.

India is collaborating with the US under the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP), which includes SAF-focused workshops on R&D, certification, and market development.

CSIR–Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) has developed SAF using indigenous feedstocks such as palm stearin, sapium oil, algae oil, karanja, and jatropha.

It has received provisional certification from the Centre for Military Airworthiness & Certification (CEMILAC) for use in military aircraft.

Conclusion and Way Forward

India’s SAF policy is not just an environmental necessity but a strategic opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation. With strong collaboration between government, industry, and research, India can advance toward its net-zero goals.

There is a need to accelerate the release of a comprehensive National SAF Policy with clear mandates and regulatory guidelines.

The partnership makes DHL Express shipping services available at all SingPost outlets as well as DHL’s own network.

In Singapore, DHL Express operates four service centres, plus over 160 retail drop-off points and almost 1,500 locker pick-up locations. DHL Express parcel drop-offs at SingPost outlets have doubled since a 14-outlet pilot in March 2025.

In addition to the convenience of the expanded drop-off options now available, DHL shipments deposited at SingPost outlets include complementary participation in the express service provider’s GoGreen Plus service.

This reduces the greenhouse gas emissions associated with international air shipments by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) via a ‘book and claim’ model.

DHL can thus directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within its network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported with the assets using these fuels, the company explained.

DHL recently committed to purchasing 9.5m litres of SAF made in Singapore, marking its first SAF purchase for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport and one of Asia’s largest SAF deals in the air cargo sector.

The SAF will account for about 35% to 40% of the overall fuel usage of DHL Express’ five Boeing 777 freighters based at the South Asia Hub at Changi.

DHL Express customers can also select more sustainable packaging options at SingPost outlets.

DHL Express Singapore managing director Christopher Ong said: “The collaboration with SingPost not only brings DHL Express’ cross-border shipping services in Singapore closer to our customers but also empowers them to participate in our sustainability journey together.”

SingPost group chief operating officer Neo Su Yin added: “Our partnership with DHL Express represents a significant strategic collaboration to enhance the utilisation of SingPost’s logistics infrastructure and post office network.

”Through this alliance, we are able to introduce new and emission-reduced international service options that address evolving customer needs, in line with SingPost’s ongoing commitment to innovation and sustainability.”",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/1/9/11719_source_dhl_express_11_9_25_936187.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 12:56:42.740169

Vegreville, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - September 11, 2025) - Provectus Biofuels Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Provectus"") today announced the Company has signed a non-binding letter of intent with a regional Alberta airport that sets out indicative terms under which both parties intend to negotiate a definitive long-term offtake agreement for renewable sustainable aviation fuel produced from Provectus' Dobrojet Biofuels facility once operational.

The letter of intent is for the offtake of up to10 ML of renewable jet fuel conforming to ASTM D1655 (or a successor standard) and fully certified for use as Jet A-1 after blending, meeting all additive and quality requirements applicable at the time of delivery. This represents 10% of the total projected production capacity at Provectus' planned Dobrojet Biofuels facility that is to be sited in Vegreville, Alberta. Deliveries are expected to commence in 2029.

""Forward thinking airports and airlines, that are aware of the impact of global regulations and the current constraints on renewable sustainable jet fuel supply, recognize the urgent need to secure low-carbon aviation fuel for their future fuel supply portfolio,"" said Jon Jaque, CEO of Provectus. ""The growth in low-carbon aviation fuel volumes under binding contract continue to outpace the addition of actual production capacity globally. As the growing gap between supply and demand causes the price premium on forward volumes to expand further, we expect to add additional offtake agreements to our portfolio.""

This is enabled by the ‘book & claim’ approach, which lets DHL directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within the logistic company’s network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported with the assets using these fuels.

Recently, DHL Express committed to purchasing 9.5 million liters of SAF made in Singapore, marking its first SAF purchase for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport and one of Asia’s largest SAF deals in the air cargo sector.

In addition to DHL shipping services, customers can opt for more sustainable packaging options at these outlets, including 100% recyclable, FSC-certified DHL brown boxes in multiple sizes to suit varying packaging needs. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an internationally recognized mark that guarantees that the cardboard is sourced from responsibly managed forests worldwide.

Through this partnership, customers can also start dropping off their DHL parcels at all post offices. Since the pilot in March, parcel drop-offs at SingPost outlets have doubled, demonstrating strong customer appreciation for convenient shipping options. DHL Express parcels deposited at SingPost outlets are collected daily without additional charges, ensuring reliability and efficiency. This collaboration underscores DHL and SingPost’s commitment to enhancing customer experience by expanding accessibility. It also signifies the benefits of utilising SingPost’s logistics infrastructure and extensive footprint.

Christopher Ong, Managing Director for DHL Express Singapore, said, “The collaboration with SingPost not only brings DHL Express’ cross-border shipping services in Singapore closer to our customers but also empowers them to participate in our sustainability journey together. To be the leader in emission-reduced logistics operations, we are constantly looking for ways to operate more sustainably while enhancing our customers’ experience. We are thrilled to work with SingPost to bring more value-added services to our customers in Singapore.”

“Our partnership with DHL Express represents a significant strategic collaboration to enhance the utilisation of SingPost’s logistics infrastructure and post office network. Through this alliance, we are able to introduce new and emission-reduced international service options that address evolving customer needs, in line with SingPost’s ongoing commitment to innovation and sustainability,” said Neo Su Yin, Group Chief Operating Officer, SingPost.

This partnership also enhances DHL Express’ holistic efforts to improve customer experience by expanding customer touchpoints for both parcel drop-off and pick-up. In Singapore, DHL Express operates four service centres and offers its services at over 160 DHL retail drop-off points and almost 1,500 locker pick-up locations for customers across the island. Together, the integration with SingPost’s expansive presence maximises infrastructure usage and seamlessly connects global and local logistics into the daily lives of Singaporeans.

Le « SAF » ou Sustainable Aviation Fuel, est depuis longtemps érigé en mesure phare de la décarbonation du transport aérien, qui communique très largement sur le sujet. IATA annonce même sans sourciller que les SAF couvriront 65% des besoins de l’industrie à l’horizon 2050, contre… 0.3% en 2024.

Qu’en est-il vraiment, et faut-il développer les SAF un peu, beaucoup… ou pas du tout ?

C’est quoi exactement, le SAF ?

Pas un SAF, mais des SAF

Il existe aujourd’hui plusieurs façons de produire du SAF. Pour schématiser, il existe deux grandes familles de SAF :

Les biocarburants (ou Bio-SAF) : Ce sont pour le moment principalement les HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), huile de cuisson usagée et graisse animale, globalement plus vertueux que les carburants de première génération, utilisés par le secteur automobile (huile de colza…etc). Il persiste néanmoins une zone d’ombre sur ces derniers, qui ne sont pas vraiment encouragés mais sont autorisés sous certaines conditions. A cette catégorie de bio-SAF s’ajoutent le Fischer-Tropsch (FT, utilisant de la biomasse ou des déchets municipaux) ainsi que les ATJ “Alcohol to Jet” avec l’éthanol comme matière première

Les carburants synthétiques (ou e-SAF, e-fuels, Power-to Liquid-PtL) : grand espoir et grande promesse du secteur, ils sont très peu utilisés aujourd’hui. En gros on mélange de l’hydrogène à du CO2 dans un procédé, on le verra, très énergivore. On peut enfin classer dans cette catégorie le FT ou ATJ lorsqu’on ajoute du H2 pour optimiser le ratio carbone-hydrogène (dans ce cas on parle aussi de e-BioSAF, qui font parfois l’objet d’une catégorie à part entière)

Aujourd’hui, et en dépit d’une communication assez large sur le sujet, les e-SAF, FT ou ATJ sont très peu utilisés, puisque les HEFA (huiles de cuisson usagées, graisses animales…), représentent pas moins de 95% de la production mondiale de SAF. C’est-à-dire, rappelons-le, 95% de… pas grand chose puisque les SAF ne couvrent que 0.3% des besoins du secteur.

On pollue vraiment moins ?

Imaginez que vous preniez un appareil consommant exclusivement du SAF : et bien les émissions de cet avion dans le ciel seront… exactement les mêmes qu’un appareil volant au kérosène !

C’est-à-dire que la combustion de SAF pollue autant que la combustion de kérosène… En revanche, sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie, la pollution est théoriquement moindre, et peut même être réduite de 85%

L’idée étant que la plante (utilisée pour fabriquer l’huile de cuisson par exemple) a absorbé du CO2 pendant sa vie et ne fait que le relâcher pendant la combustion. Mais ne pensez pas que vous ne polluez pas quand vous volez au SAF, c’est faux (et, on le verra, cette matière première pourrait être utilisée ailleurs…)

Enfin, il est également possible que les SAF aient un effet bénéfique sur la réduction des traînées de condensation, mais davantage de recherche est nécessaire sur ce sujet complexe des effets hors CO2.

Un avantage technique indéniable

Les SAF présentent incontestablement un sérieux atout technique : ils peuvent être utilisés directement (si mixés avec du kérosène) dans les moteurs existants et ne nécessitent donc pas de R&D sur les moteurs eux-mêmes. Aujourd’hui, on autorise jusqu’à 50% de SAF sur des vols commerciaux, et des recherches sont en cours pour pouvoir passer à 100%.

Et ça coûte cher, le SAF ?

Oui. Les écarts de prix varient significativement selon les régions, mais en gros, le SAF coûte entre 2.5 et 5 fois plus cher que le kérosène (il est plus cher en Europe qu’aux Etats-Unis, principalement du fait d’incitations fiscales moins élevées et de critères de durabilité plus élevés). Cet écart de prix est régulièrement évoqué par le secteur comme problème majeur empêchant une production massive de SAF (en premier lieu par l’IATA qui accuse régulièrement les gouvernements pour leur manque d’initiative en la matière). Mais il n’en est rien – le coût du SAF est finalement un sujet assez secondaire qui, on le verra, arrive assez loin derrière un écueil autrement plus problématique : les limites physiques auxquelles l’industrie du SAF va immanquablement se heurter.

Le SAF, c’est plus durable. Vraiment ?

Même si l’on ignore le (pourtant très important) sujet de justice sociale (est-il légitime d’utiliser de précieuses ressources pour l’aérien alors que 80% des gens ne prennent jamais l’avion), le SAF, d’un point de vue purement environnemental, prête clairement à débat :

Rappelons d’abord, que dans l’analyse de l’impact environnemental du SAF, il est nécessaire de considérer à la fois les émissions directes (combustion) et les émissions indirectes (exemple l’huile de palme qui contribue à la déforestation en Indonésie), cf le graph ci-dessous.

On voit donc bien que tous les process de fabrication ne sont pas “propres” et que leur impact CO2 peut parfois être supérieur à celui du kérosène. Néanmoins, quand le processus est vertueux, les gains de CO2 semblent réels : l’huile de cuisson usagée ou les e-fuels produits à partir de renouvelables génèrent effectivement jusqu’à 85% d’économies de CO2. Mais alors, où est le problème ?

On commence à parler du maïs et du soja…

Peu voire pas utilisés aujourd’hui pour la production de SAF, le maïs et le soja commencent à faire leur apparition en Amérique du Nord, et leur bilan carbone est très discutable (cf ci-dessus). Aux Etats-Unis, Lanzajet prévoit d’ores et déjà la production prochaine de 350.000 tonnes de biocarburants produits à partir d’éthanol de maïs, à la fois pour du biodiesel… et pour du SAF.

C’est d’ailleurs le moment de signaler que les règles ne sont pas les mêmes partout sur le globe : si l’Union Européenne via son projet Refuel EU exige une baisse d’émissions de 65% pour la certification SAF, le modèle CORSIA lui (appliqué à peu près partout ailleurs), se contente d’une baisse de 10% sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie, ce qui ne démontre pas une ambition démesurée, particulièrement quand on connaît les difficultés pour obtenir un calcul précis en la matière.

Une fraude massive à l’importation ?

En Europe, les SAF sont majoritairement produits à partir d’huile de cuisson usagée. Et 80% de cette huile est importée d’Asie, principalement de Chine. Or, une (énorme) suspicion existe sur la qualité de cette huile, en réalité plus que probablement de l’huile de palme.

En Malaisie, on exporte 3 fois plus… que ce qu’on collecte ! Et comme il existe en Chine un marché parallèle d’huile de cuisson, il est également très probable qu’une partie de l’huile collectée soit en réalité de l‘huile de palme, explique T&E. En résumé, il n’est pas exagéré de dire que plusieurs avions ayant volé avec du SAF récemment ont pollué davantage que s’ils avaient volé avec du kérosène…

Et même si ils sont “propres” : faut-il promouvoir les BioSAF ?

La fraude à l’importation d’huile de cuisson asiatique est un sujet majeur qui a finalement eu assez peu d’échos dans l’industrie ces derniers mois. Mais quand bien même ce sujet n’existerait pas, on peut légitimement se questionner sur l’intérêt environnemental de ces biocarburants.

Passons sur les huiles de cuisson ou les graisses animales : elles représentent certes des débouchés précieux pour les fast-foods ou l’industrie de la viande (dont il faudrait surtout réduire la consommation pour atteindre l’accord de Paris) mais le secteur aérien lui-même reconnaît que les HEFA vont rapidement plafonner.

En revanche, les fameux procédés FT ou ATJ, censés produire de grandes quantités de SAF (voir plus loin), vont générer des besoins colossaux en matière première, résidus agricoles ou déchets forestiers qui servent actuellement d’autres usages (production de matériaux biosourcés, chauffage, retour au sol…). Cette pression sur des écosystèmes déjà fragiles (les forêts souffrent déjà du changement climatique) peut légitimement susciter des craintes puisque l’agriculture et la sylviculture sont déjà responsables du dépassement de 4 des 9 limites planétaires (perte de biodiversité, perturbation des cycles biogéochimiques, changement d’usage des sols et utilisation de l’eau douce).

Procès d’intention ? La fraude massive à l’huile de palme mentionnée plus haut, ou le récent reportage d’Hugo Clément sur la maïs et les méthaniseurs montre que le secteur des biocarburants n’a pas été particulièrement vertueux jusqu’ici.

Les fuels synthétiques : une inefficacité énergétique qui pose sérieusement question

Bien qu’attractif sur le papier, le process de fabrication des e-fuels est extrêmement énergivore (capture CO2, électrolyse de l’eau…), et ainsi très inefficace d’un point de vue énergétique, avec un rendement final compris entre 10 et 20% (16% selon l’ICCT).

C’est un problème absolument fondamental, car il signifie que, pour une quantité donnée d’énergie propre (exemple des renouvelables), on économise quasiment 10 fois plus de CO2 en remplaçant du charbon par cette électricité verte qu’en produisant des fuels synthétiques, comme le montre le graph ci-dessous

Dès lors surgit une question simple : pourquoi devrait-on allouer cette précieuse énergie verte à un secteur qui génèrera des économies de CO2 bien moindres que si elle était allouée à d’autres industries ? Question fondamentale que n’importe quel gouvernement devrait se poser…

“SAF” ou “carburants alternatifs” ?

Si tout n’est pas à jeter dans l’univers du SAF, on voit donc bien qu’il soulève des questions (majeures) sur sa durabilité réelle. C’est pourquoi on peut légitimement s’interroger sur l’adjectif “sustainable” de l’acronyme SAF. Le terme de carburant alternatif, ou AJF / AAF en anglais (alternative Jet/Aviation Fuel) serait plus en phase avec la réalité. C’est d’ailleurs le terme que commencent à employer certains scientifiques dans leurs publications.

Plus spectaculaire : la justice néerlandaise récemment condamné KLM pour greenwashing suite à sa campagne “fly responsibly”. Le SAF y est explicitement mentionné comme trompeur, le terme étant “trop absolu”.

L’éléphant dans la pièce : la quantité de SAF nécessaire rend illusoire toute mise à l’échelle

Entre le moment où vous avez commencé à lire cette phrase et le moment où vous la finirez (2 secondes), le secteur aérien aura brûlé environ… 28.000 litres de pétrole. La consommation du secteur s’élève en effet à 1.2 milliards de litre par… jour soit 14.000 litres par… seconde.

On sent donc d’ores et déjà que tout remplacer par des SAF s’annonce « challenging » comme disent les Américains. D’autant plus que IATA prévoit également un trafic passager plus que doublé (+144%) d’ici à 2050 !

Les biocarburants : tout le monde est (à peu près) d’accord

Aujourd’hui, c’est l’huile de cuisson usagée qui est principalement utilisée pour la production de SAF. Petit calcul rapide : à supposer qu’un McDonald’s collecte 20 Litres d’huile par jour, et que le rendement est optimal dans la production de SAF, il faudrait donc environ 60 millions de McDonald’s dans le Monde pour couvrir les besoins actuels, et environ 180 millions pour 2050. Aujourd’hui, il y a dans le monde… 40.000 McDonald’s. Néanmoins, reconnaissons que le secteur lui-même admet que les quantités de HEFA vont très bientôt plafonner, comme l’a souligné SkyNRG récemment.

En revanche, ce genre de calcul a le mérite de mettre en lumière les quantités faramineuses de matières premières nécessaires à la production massive de SAF. Car en matière de biocarburants (bio-SAF) on aboutit forcément à des ordres de grandeur tout aussi dantesques si l’on parle de FT ou d’ATJ, qui utilisent notamment des résidus forestiers ou des déchets agricoles, sans compter tous les écueils mentionnés précédemment (conflit d’usage, limites planétaires, etc).

Mais ici aussi, la majorité des acteurs du secteur reconnaît que le volume de biomasse disponible va forcément plafonner à un moment donné. C’est là qu’entrent en jeu les carburants synthétiques.

Les carburants synthétiques (ou E-fuels ou Power-to-Liquids – PTL)

C’est LE grand espoir du secteur. Ci-dessous les prévisions de SkyNRG (producteur de SAF) pour le marché européen à l’horizon 2050. Les e-fuels (PtL) se taillent la part du lion

Et il est vrai que, à première vue, avec un gain de CO2 de l’ordre de 85%, les carburants synthétiques semblent promis à un brillant avenir. Mais cette hypothèse ne résiste pas à une froide règle de 3 concernant l’énergie nécessaire pour produire des e-fuels à grande échelle.

A l’horizon 2050, en prenant en compte les prévisions de trafic de IATA, et avec une hypothèse optimiste de 27% de gain d’efficacité énergétique, le secteur consommerait l’équivalent de 800 milliards de litres de pétrole par an, soit 625 millions de tonnes.

Or, on l’a vu, le processus de production des e-SAF est très énergivore (car très inefficace, beaucoup de pertes d’énergie). Ainsi, il faut compter environ 30 MWh d’électricité pour produire une tonne d’e-SAF. Couvrir l’ensemble des besoins du secteur par du e-fuel nécessiterait donc 18.750 TWh d’énergie. C’est-à-dire quasiment les deux tiers de l’électricité mondiale produite en 2024.

Mais attention, pour que le process soit propre, cette énergie doit être « propre » elle aussi, donc exclusivementproduite avec des renouvelables ou du nucléaire. Si l’on considère qu’un réacteur nucléaire produit 7 TWh / an, il faudrait donc environ 2700 nouveaux réacteurs nucléaires pour couvrir l’ensemble des besoins du secteur. Alors certes IATA ne table “que” sur 65% d’approvisionnement en SAF d’ici 2050 : on passerait alors à 1750 réacteurs, chiffre tout aussi ubuesque.

Et en France alors ?

La consommation de kérosène en France tourne autour de 7 millions de tonnes par an (niveau pré-covid atteint de nouveau en 2024). En admettant que le trafic départ France augmente « seulement » de 44% (la croissance devrait davantage porter sur les pays émergents), et en conservant le gain d’efficacité de 27% évoqué plus haut, les besoins en carburant n’augmenteraient que légèrement (7.4 millions de tonnes par an) d’ici 2050. Le besoin en électricité (verte) s’élèverait donc à 222 TWh par an, soit près de la moitié de la consommation actuelle du pays.

On peut alors s’amuser à effectuer les mêmes calculs que précédemment : il nous faudrait… 32 nouveaux réacteurs nucléaires, exclusivement dédiés à l’aviation pour être totalement “neutre” en carbone.

Encore plus parlant peut-être, on peut également comparer ces chiffres au scenario “Futurs énergétiques 2050” de RTE, qui, dans sa version originale, prévoyait en tout et pour tout 100 TWh d’électricité allouée au transport, une grande partie étant prévu pour… les voitures électriques.

Question : pense-t-on sérieusement que l’on va ajouter 222 TWh à ce scenario ? (ou ne serait-ce que 144 TWh si on estime que les e-SAF doivent couvrir 65% des besoins)

Entendons-nous bien : on parle ici d’ordres de grandeur tellement délirants qu’ils pourraient prêter à sourire si la situation n’était pas aussi grave. En tout état de cause, une production de masse de SAF est rigoureusement et physiquement impossible dans les délais impartis (avant 2050). Mais c’est un mensonge qui se diffuse allègrement, année après année au sein de l’industrie.

Le secteur aérien et les SAF : des décennies de mensonges

Si vous avez un doute sur la crédibilité de promesses futures faites par une personne ou par une institution, il est parfois bon de faire un saut un arrière et d’évaluer le sérieux des promesses… passées. Or, le moins que l’on puisse dire, c’est que le secteur aérien traîne un lourd passif en la matière.

Dans une étude parue en 2022, on découvre que sur 50 promesses en matière environnementale (faites par les compagnies, les autorités…etc), 49…n’ont pas été tenues. En ce qui concerne plus particulièrement le SAF, sur les 165 projets annoncés (souvent en grande pompe) ces 12 dernières années, seulement…36 ont vu le jour. Et tout récemment (septembre 2025), Shell vient d’annoncer qu’il abandonnait son projet d’usine de SAF à Rotterdam.

A tout seigneur tout honneur, l’Association Internationale du Transport Aérien (IATA) se taille la part du lion, avec un florilège de promesses toutes plus aberrantes les unes que les autres en matière de SAF. Citons la principale : un objectif de 10% de SAF « d’ici 10 ans ». Une promesse datée de … 2007. Or, en 2018 la part du SAF dans les besoins du secteur était de… 0.01%.

Il faut ici bien réaliser ce qu’est un objectif raté d’un facteur 1.000 : imaginez que vous créiez votre propre entreprise, et promettez au banquier un chiffre d’affaires de 1.000.000€ d’ici 10 ans. Vous revenez 10 ans plus tard et vous avez généré… 1.000€. Mais vous accusez le marché, les gouvernements, les compagnies qui n’en font pas assez. Derrière, vous promettez au banquier des chiffres encore plus ubuesques, et devinez quoi, celui-ci vous déroule le tapis rouge !

Et bien c’est exactement ce qui se passe avec l’IATA : non content d’avoir raté dans les grandes largeurs tous ses objectifs en matière de SAF, la puissante association annonce maintenant un objectif à… 65% pour 2050.

Question : de qui se moque-t-on ? Quand la mascarade va-t-elle cesser ?

Car au final, le problème n’est pas tellement le SAF en lui-même : il est techniquement possible de produire du SAF de qualité, et même si une mise à une telle échelle est totalement impossible, on peut considérer que les quelques % de gains de CO2 générés par le SAF seront toujours bons à prendre. Mais enchaîner à longueur d’années les promesses de décarbonation à grande échelle grâce au SAF permet surtout d’éluder la seule et unique solution viable : celle de limiter ou de réduire le trafic aérien. Un peu, finalement, à l’image de la compensation carbone (je pollue un max mais ne vous inquiétez pas, je compense toutes mes émissions donc je suis neutre en carbone), qui a permis pendant des années aux multinationales de ne pas revoir en profondeur leur business model, et, in fine, de gagner du temps.

Ce temps qu’on l’on n’ a plus…

Conclusion

S’il ne faut pas probablement pas tout jeter dans les SAF, et qu’une certaine quantité peut contribuer à réduire les émissions du secteur, ce ne sera que de manière limitée.

En effet, les SAF posent de sérieuses questions de conflits d’usage, remettant en cause leur utilité même : S.Becken, B.Mackay and D.S.Lee n’hésitent pas à affirmer que “leur développement est problématique, car il entre en concurrence avec les terres nécessaires à l’élimination du carbone par la nature, et avec les énergies propres susceptibles de décarboner plus efficacement d’autres secteurs. De ce fait, la production de SAF compromet l’objectif mondial de limitation du réchauffement climatique ; un conflit qui n’est reconnu ni dans les plans de développement, ni dans le débat public.”

Mais surtout, les prévisions éhontées du secteur, l’IATA en tête, touchent au scandaleux. Le moindre calcul sérieux montre de manière limpide qu’une production de masse telle qu’annoncée par l’industrie est purement impossible. Aujourd’hui, les SAF sont donc tout simplement une réponse extrêmement pratique utilisée depuis quasiment 20 ans (voir les promesses de l’IATA en 2007) par le secteur quand on lui demande comment il va décarboner son activité.

The award recognizes the airline’s comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, reducing carbon emissions, and integrating circular solutions into both its inflight and cargo operations.

Cathay’s Sustainability Vision: Achieving Net-Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050

As part of its long-term sustainability strategy, Cathay Pacific has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline’s vision reflects a broader shift in the aviation industry towards more sustainable practices, focusing on reducing its environmental impact while ensuring the continuation of high-quality service. The airline is leveraging modern technology, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and fleet modernization as key levers to accelerate its transition to a greener future.

In a statement from Grace Cheung, Cathay Pacific’s General Manager of Sustainability, the airline emphasized that sustainability is a crucial element in shaping the future of aviation. Cheung noted that these efforts can only succeed through collaboration with customers, business partners, suppliers, regulators, and communities. By collectively working towards sustainability, the airline believes it can continue its journey to becoming an industry leader in climate action.

Circular Economy and Waste Management: A Key Focus

In addition to its efforts to curb emissions, Cathay Pacific has placed a significant focus on transitioning to a circular economy within its operations. The airline has made substantial progress in reducing its reliance on single-use plastics (SUP), which have long been a source of concern in the aviation industry.

In 2019, the airline’s use of passenger-facing single-use plastic items amounted to 7.7 pieces per passenger. Since then, the airline has made impressive strides, reducing its use to 2.6 pieces per passenger by the end of 2024. By the end of 2025, Cathay Pacific has pledged to reduce this number even further, aiming for just 1.5 pieces per passenger.

To further minimize its environmental footprint, Cathay Pacific has introduced a variety of measures to reduce plastic waste inflight. Over 1.4 million plastic bottles have been recycled since the introduction of a new water bottle recycling initiative in 2024. Additionally, 100% of the water bottles on outbound flights from Hong Kong are now made from recycled plastic (rPET), a significant move towards enhancing the circularity of plastic use in its operations. The airline has also been exploring alternative materials, such as recycled paper for packaging items like headphones and blankets, further minimizing its plastic waste.

In-flight, Cathay Pacific is experimenting with the use of reusable serviceware in the Economy class cabin. This initiative is currently in trial phases and aims to reduce reliance on single-use plastics, offering a more sustainable dining experience for passengers.

Climate Action and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been recognized as one of the most crucial solutions to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation industry. In line with this, Cathay Pacific launched its Corporate SAF Programme in 2022, encouraging corporate partners to reduce their carbon footprints by purchasing SAF for their travel needs.

Since the program’s inception, Cathay Pacific has made great strides in integrating SAF into its operations. The airline has successfully conducted SAF uplifts at Hong Kong International Airport and several other airports worldwide. This year, Cathay Pacific has announced three new SAF partnership agreements:

Sinopec to supply SAF for certain flights departing from Hong Kong.

SK Energy to provide SAF for flights departing from South Korea.

DHL Express to supply SAF for flights operated by its Air Hong Kong cargo carrier at several airports, including Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi.

These new agreements contribute to the airline’s long-term commitment to SAF and its goal of reducing the carbon footprint of air travel.

Sustainability Efforts in Cathay’s Cargo Operations

Cathay Pacific has also extended its sustainability efforts to its cargo operations. At the Cathay Cargo Terminal, the airline is piloting the use of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) for its non-electric cargo tractors, reducing carbon emissions in its ground operations. The airline was the first cargo terminal in Hong Kong to adopt 50% recycled plastic for cargo cover sheets used for export shipments. Additionally, it currently recycles 100% of the plastic sheets used for import cargo shipments, contributing to its broader waste reduction efforts.

The Future of Sustainability in Aviation

As Cathay Pacific continues to strengthen its sustainability efforts, the airline remains committed to integrating circular economy principles and climate action into all aspects of its business. From reducing plastic waste to investing in sustainable aviation fuel, the airline’s comprehensive strategy is helping lead the way for the industry.

With its emphasis on collaboration, innovation, and long-term sustainability, Cathay Pacific is poised to continue making a positive impact on the environment and the aviation industry at large. This commitment, paired with its success in earning recognition in the 2025 Sustainability Awards by Airline Ratings, underscores the airline’s role as a leader in sustainable aviation.

Conclusion: A Green Future for Aviation

In an era of heightened environmental awareness, Cathay Pacific stands out as a leader in implementing sustainable practices within the aviation sector. Its focus on reducing carbon emissions, minimizing plastic waste, and increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel showcases the airline’s dedication to protecting the environment while continuing to provide high-quality service to its passengers. By embracing circular economy principles and working with industry partners to drive change, Cathay Pacific is setting the stage for a more sustainable and eco-friendly future for aviation.

ASEAN nations see strong potential in developing bioenergy, with opportunities to export to markets such as Europe and boost trade revenues.

However, industry leaders warn that clean energy progress in the region has slowed. Fossil fuel subsidies, unstable energy policies, and aging grid infrastructure remain major obstacles, adding uncertainty to investment.

Three advantages position ASEAN for biofuel growth

Speaking at the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC), Ahmad Adly Alias, Vice President of Refining, Marketing and Trading at Malaysia’s Petronas, said Southeast Asia is well-positioned for biofuel exports thanks to easy access to feedstock, rising production capacity, and growing demand. If production exceeds local demand, ASEAN could emerge as a net exporter to Europe.

He noted that transport demand in the Asia Pacific will drive biofuel consumption to an estimated 250 million liters by 2030—the fastest growth globally. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production alone could reach 4 million tons annually, opening new revenue streams for the region.

Energy majors across ASEAN are already expanding into biofuels. Petronas, Italy’s Eni, and Japan’s Euglena are jointly building a biorefinery in Johor, Malaysia, slated to start operations in late 2028 with an annual capacity of 650,000 tons. Thailand’s PTT and Bangchak are also actively developing biofuel projects.

Malaysia’s Petronas and other major ASEAN energy players are already expanding into biofuels. (Photo: Petronas)

Energy transition stalls, industry calls for clear policy

Despite progress, ASEAN’s energy transition faces significant roadblocks. Executives at APPEC highlighted that surging power demand from data centers, fossil fuel subsidies, and stalled renewable auctions are stifling green investment.

Lawrence Wu, CFO of EDP Renewables Asia, said subsidies for coal and the politicization of electricity and energy are among the biggest barriers.

Nitin Apte, CEO of Singapore-based Vena Energy, added that while renewable demand has quadrupled, policy—not technology—is the main bottleneck. He stressed that clear permitting processes and timelines would allow companies to assess risks. But uncertainties around auction rules or the bankability of power purchase agreements (PPAs) continue to raise investor concerns.

On data centers, Apte noted that operators prioritize reliable energy supply over carbon intensity.

Besides, both executives agreed that delays in securing permits are inflating financing costs. They urged ASEAN nations to provide long-term, predictable policies and roadmaps to unlock investment.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1757580677622215710.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 08:56:52.071703

That footprint includes everything from methane in cows’ burps and decomposing food in landfills to nitrous oxide released by fertilizers.
Our natural planet has become an agricultural planet, and we’re going to need 50 percent more food by 2050.
We’re going to need to make even more food with even less land and hopefully less mess as well.
You explore lots of big climate solutions, everything from plans to grow food indoors in vertical farms to meat alternatives made from fermented fungi.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and WBEZ, a public radio station serving the Chicago metropolitan region.

When veteran journalist Michael Grunwald set out to write his third book, he was determined not to produce a “Debbie Downer.” And he hasn’t. That’s surprising considering his latest book, We’re Eating the Earth: The Race to Fix Our Food System, wrestles with an increasingly thorny question: Can the world’s food systems be transformed in time to feed everyone without destroying the ecosystems that sustain us?

The math is brutal. With the global population projected to hit 10 billion by 2050, experts warn we will need to produce at least 50 percent more calories than we did in 2010. That surge in demand, he writes, is the equivalent of handing a dozen extra Olive Garden breadsticks to everyone alive — every single day.

But the food systems that produce, process, package, and distribute crops and meat will need to accommodate the staggering demand and are already a primary driver of the climate crisis. The industry is currently responsible for about a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. That footprint includes everything from methane in cows’ burps and decomposing food in landfills to nitrous oxide released by fertilizers.

To that end, Grunwald’s new book is a sustained search for the ideas that could kick off the next Green Revolution and provide new, climate-friendly ways of producing food. Many of these solutions, including using farmland to grow crops for biofuels instead of food, regenerative agriculture practices that restore carbon in soil, and replacing meat with fermented fungi, have fallen short, failed, or gone bankrupt. Still, Grunwald makes the case that it’s far too early to call it quits.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Q. The book starts with your protagonist, Tim Searchinger, a longtime environmental lawyer on a crusade against ethanol, the biofuel made from crops like corn. What is it about ethanol that so effectively drives home agriculture’s climate problem?

A. The sort of punch line is that ethanol and other biofuels are eating an area about the size of Texas, and agriculture is eating about 75 Texases worth of the earth. But what Tim discovered was that the climate analysis of ethanol was ignoring land use. The problem is that when you grow fuel instead of food, you are going to have to replace the food by growing more somewhere else, and it’s probably not going to be a parking lot. It’s going to be a forest, or a wetland, or some other carbon-storing piece of nature. That had been forgotten because the climate analysis just treated land as if it were free. The real message of the book is that land is not free — there’s a lot of it on Earth, but not an infinite amount.

Q. So this gets to your idea that to feed our growing population, we’ll need to increase the yields of the farmland already in production or otherwise risk increasing our agricultural footprint. What does the drive to increase agricultural yield mean for the natural lands we have left?

A. Two out of every 5 acres of the planet are cropped or grazed, while only 1 out of every 100 acres is covered by cities or suburbs. Our natural planet has become an agricultural planet, and we’re going to need 50 percent more food by 2050. We’re on track to eat a lot more meat, which is the most land-intensive form of food. So we are on track to deforest another dozen Californias’ worth of land by 2050, and we don’t have another dozen Californias’ worth of forest to spare. It’s a very simple idea — this notion that we need to make more food with less land — but it’s a really hard thing to do. We’re going to have to reduce our agricultural emissions 75 to 80 percent over the next 25 years, even as we produce more food. That means that we can’t keep doing the same thing and expecting different results.

Q. So far, the Trump administration has increased the renewable fuel mandate — a 20-year-old rule, which requires gasoline sold in the U.S. to be blended with renewable fuels like ethanol — and worked to make it harder to put wind and solar on farmland. Are we digging the hole deeper?

A. The first thing the Trump administration has done is call for a massive expansion of soy biodiesel, as well as an expansion of sustainable aviation fuel, which is mostly made from corn and soybeans. Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture is on a campaign against the use of farmland for wind and solar. It’s incredibly short-sighted, because even though it is true that there is a cost to using land to make electricity rather than making food, it’s extraordinarily efficient compared to other forms of land use for energy, such as biofuels. Because we are so far away from figuring out the food and climate problem, one of the things we really need to do is accelerate the parts of the energy and climate problem that we have figured out — particularly solar, and wind as well. Those are really efficient and quite cheap ways of solving our energy and climate problems. Obviously, Trump’s going the opposite direction.

Q. You seem to have a real appreciation for the kind of output industrial agriculture can crank out. Where does Big Ag fit into the future of our food system?

A. Look, they treat people badly. They treat animals horribly. They often make a really big mess. They’re responsible for a lot of water pollution and air pollution. They use too many antibiotics. They’re always fighting climate action. Their politics really suck, right?

People hate factory farms, I get it. But factories are good at manufacturing a lot of stuff, and factory farms are good at manufacturing a lot of food, and agriculture’s number one job over the next 25 years is going to be manufacturing even more food than we’ve made over the last 12,000. I don’t say that these industrial approaches are necessarily the only way to get high yields. I went to Brazil, and I saw how some ranches there are using some regenerative practices that are helping them get really kick-ass yields — and if they’re five times as productive as a degraded ranch, then they’re using only one-fifth as much of the Amazon. We’re going to need to make even more food with even less land and hopefully less mess as well.

Q. You explore lots of big climate solutions, everything from plans to grow food indoors in vertical farms to meat alternatives made from fermented fungi. Each has hit a wall. Do you see this as a failure of political will or that people’s food preferences and personal diets are harder to change than previously imagined?

A. I wrote about two dozen really promising solutions, and none of them has panned out yet. That is a bummer. I say that kind of laughing, but I do believe that human beings kind of suck at making sacrifices for the good of the planet, but we’re really good at inventing stuff. And some of these solutions, whether it’s alternative fertilizers made from gene-edited microbes, alternative pesticides made from using the mRNA technology behind the COVID-19 vaccine to constipate beetles to death, or these guys who are trying to use artificial intelligence and supercomputers and genomics to reinvent photosynthesis, there are really smart people working on this stuff.

One thing you could also say is that a lot of government money went into helping to solve the energy problem, and you don’t see that right now in food. But these are solvable problems, and there are a lot of people smarter than me who think that there are technological solutions that can really move the needle. I’m an honest enough reporter to have to point out that none of these really has any traction yet, but I’m an idealistic enough optimist to think that these smart people are going to figure out some cool shit and bring it to scale at some point.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/eating-earth-michael-grunwald.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-11 08:56:57.462412

The collaboration brings together two of the world’s leading technology providers to deliver a fully integrated, large-scale alternative fuels solution.

At the heart of the project, JM’s FT CANS technology, in partnership with bp, and Honeywell UOP’s FT Unicracking process technology will be utilized. Both technologies leverage the Fischer-Tropsch pathway to convert biomass into high-quality SPK that can be blended with conventional jet fuel while adhering to rigorous aviation industry standards.

The Bon Wier facility is expected to process one million tons of sustainably sourced biomass annually, primarily forest thinnings, into approximately 65 million gallons of transportation fuels, including SAF. In addition to the core conversion technologies, Honeywell’s Experion® PKS Distributed Control System (DCS) and integrated safety systems will be implemented to optimize plant performance, reliability, and operational safety.

Tony Wedell, Chief Operating Officer of USA BioEnergy, emphasized the significance of the collaboration, stating, “We are excited to add two of the world’s leading technology providers to our team. Together, we are creating the most comprehensive and integrated solution in the advanced fuels sector.” CEO Nick Andrews further highlighted the project’s environmental and operational impact: “By using responsibly sourced forest thinnings alongside carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with Johnson Matthey and Honeywell enables a fully integrated alternative fuels solution that advances sustainability in aviation.”

Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey, noted, “The Bon Wier project is another exemplary deployment of FT CANS at scale, reinforcing decarbonization efforts in air travel while supporting domestic energy and fuel security, as well as job creation.” Rajesh Gattupalli, President of Honeywell UOP, added, “This collaboration demonstrates Honeywell’s commitment to overcoming feedstock limitations in SAF production and scaling technologies that broaden feedstock options, contributing to U.S. energy security.”

This project follows several recent milestones in sustainable aviation fuels. USA BioEnergy has signed a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for up to 680 million gallons of SPK, which, when blended with conventional jet fuel, could yield 2.59 billion gallons of SAF—supporting the International Air Transport Association’s net-zero emissions target for 2050. Meanwhile, JM and Honeywell were also chosen by DG Fuels for a new SAF facility in Minnesota, using the same FT CANS and FT Unicracking technologies. JM’s Catalyst Technologies portfolio has now secured ten to eleven large-scale wins in the 2024/25 financial year, further reinforcing its leadership in sustainable fuel technologies.

It is important to note that Honeywell’s previously announced plan to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business is separate from this collaboration, with discussions related to that acquisition proceeding as part of routine business operations.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-11 08:57:03.118776

With many SAF projects stalling at pilot stage, there is a generational opportunity for the UK to lead in more sustainable aviation fuels, create thousands of future-proof jobs, and attract over £10billion in investment by 2030.

PA Consulting’s latest global report, Cacophony to Symphony: Successfully scaling sustainable aviation fuel, draws on insights from nearly 600 senior leaders across airlines, airports, investors, producers, regulators and policymakers.

It found that SAF is seen as “more than just sustainability goals” with 77% saying it could assist with job creating and 57% stating it is critical to energy security.

Almost all of the leaders (96%) said SAF was “essential” to aviation decarbonisation. But only 34% said they believed widespread adoption was possible by 2030.

In addition, 52% said airports didn’t have a SAF strategy, and almost half (45%) don’t have a net zero roadmap.

Kata Cserep, Global Aviation Lead at PA Consulting, said:

“The UK has a huge opportunity at its fingertips to become a leader in sustainable aviation fuels. While the introduction of a Revenue Certainty Mechanism is a welcome move, it needs to be rolled out as soon as possible and ideally be paired with other policy measures which organisations included in the SAF ecosystem have said they are looking for.

The plan was announced by Pertamina Vice President Director Oki Muraza at the Katadata Sustainability Action for the Future Economy (SAFE) 2025 forum in Jakarta on Wednesday, September 10, 2025.

“We aspire to build a green refinery that can produce 100 percent SAF,” Oki said, while adding that the project could become a new economic hub for Indonesia.

He expressed hope that Indonesia would emerge as a regional hub for SAF. “If Japan and South Korea need SAF, they can source it from Indonesia,” he noted.

Currently, Pertamina produces SAF from used cooking oil (UCO) at its Cilacap refinery. Oki confirmed that production would soon expand to the Dumai and Balongan refineries, giving Indonesia three facilities capable of processing UCO into SAF.

Indonesia’s annual bioavtur demand is around 6 million kiloliters, similar to Singapore’s consumption.

Pertamina has already completed its maiden SAF-powered flight using UCO-based fuel produced at its facilities. The demonstration was carried out by Pertamina’s airline subsidiary, Pelita Air, on the Jakarta–Bali route on August 20, 2025.

Pertamina President Director Simon Aloysius Mantiri said the company’s SAF product has secured the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) in line with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), covering UCO collection, refinery production, and distribution.

This will be achieved through encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuel (‘SAF') for domestic flights. This is the first state aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of SAF and represents a significant step towards decarbonizing the aviation sector, aligning with both national and EU climate objectives.

The Danish scheme

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It will be in place until 31 December 2027. The goal is to support at least one domestic air route using 40% SAF, which is very close to the current technical limit of 50%. This exceeds the minimum set by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which requires fuel suppliers to achieve a minimum share of 2% during the scheme period.

Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark. The scheme includes rules to prevent overcompensation, namely by ensuring that supported SAF is excluded from parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive, and by prohibiting the use of SAF that has already received subsidies from Denmark, other EU member states, or third countries.

The Commission's assessment

The Commission assessed the scheme under EU state aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (‘TFEU'), which enables member states to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the Guidelines on state aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (‘CEEAG'), which allow member states to support measures reducing or removing CO2 emissions.

The Commission found that:

The scheme is necessary and appropriate to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector in line with national and EU environmental targets.

The scheme has an incentive effect, as airlines benefitting from the measure would not use SAF to the same extent without the public support.

The aid has limited impact on competition and trade within the EU. It is proportionate as the aid will be limited to the minimum necessary, given the use of a competitive bidding process. Denmark committed to ensure that the aid delivers overall CO2 reductions and that it does not merely displace emissions from one sector to another.

On this basis, the Commission approved the Danish scheme under EU state aid rules.

Background

The 2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission will assess the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU.

The Guidelines create a flexible, fit-for-purpose enabling framework to help member states provide the necessary support to reach the European Green Deal objectives in a targeted and cost-effective manner. The rules involve an alignment with the important EU's objectives and targets set out in the European Green Deal and with other recent regulatory changes in the energy and environmental areas and will cater for the increased importance of climate protection.

More information will be made available under the case number SA.102731 in the state aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of state aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.

“We were just chatting, and I said I live now in the United States,” she recalls. “She’s like, ‘Oh, you should go to this amazing event. It’s fantastic.’”

Synkovska, who recently joined the organization as its portfolio director, says that brief interaction made her realize that the event was so meaningful that “some random woman tells another woman — you must go.”

The 14th Women in Agribusiness Summit is set for Sept. 22-24 in Orlando, Fla. With more than 1,000 delegates expected to attend, Synkovska says education will once again be a main aspect of the event with key topics focusing on commodities markets — from field to fuel.

“We will be talking a lot about such important topics as weather, impact, risk management, and meat and poultry market trends,” Synkovska says.

The event features 60 speakers, many deemed innovators in their space. A favorite of Synkovska’s is Karen Braun, chief market analyst for Zaner Ag Hedge, who is passionate about education, statistics and charts. During the keynote presentation, she will offer insights into the global agricultural markets.

Another making Synkovska’s list is Global Ag Protein CEO Emily French, who brings 29 years of experience as a trader, analyst and broker to the event and will unpack commodity exchanges. She’ll offer attendees a look at what’s ahead for the 2026 global markets.

This year the Women in Agribusiness Summit adds a sustainable aviation panel.

“We’re going to go really deep into the whole topic of biofuels and regulation, and in particular about sustainable aviation, fuel market changes,” Synkovska adds.

Beyond the educational sessions

A key highlight for the event is the networking opportunities available for attendees, with a chance to interact with international delegations from Brazil and Europe.

“You can’t be successful professionally if you don’t have an expanded network, and if you don’t know how to build and keep your network warm and alive,” Synkovska says.

In addition, there will be breakout sessions both on- and off-site. “We want [women] to network and communicate more,” she adds. “It’s easier when you’re in a small room.”

The gathering brings together diverse perspectives from across the industry, including a sizable proportion (over 30%) of C-level executives. For Synkovska, that atmosphere helps foster unity and shared purpose among attendees.

“When you’re in the room of 1,000 successful, smiling, supportive women, when you’re surrounded by professionals ... it creates the whole vibe, the whole atmosphere, when you feel like you belong, when you feel like it’s a power behind you, and you’re surrounded by the powerful, inspirational women.”

As the 14th Women in Agribusiness Summit approaches, Synkovska reflects on how a chance encounter in London ultimately led her to the event.
