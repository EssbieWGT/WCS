Vietnamese low-cost carrier Vietjet has finalized a major deal with Airbus for twenty A330-900 widebody jets, reinforcing its long-term strategy to grow internationally over the next ten years.

The agreement was formalized in Hanoi, where Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Airbus International President Wouter van Wersch signed the order. The contract exchange took place during the official visit of French President Emmanuel Macron, witnessed by both him and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.

This significant fleet addition marks a pivotal step in Vietjet’s broader expansion roadmap. The widebody aircraft will empower the airline to boost frequency on heavily traveled routes across the Asia-Pacific and lay the groundwork for launching new long-haul services, including anticipated future connections to Europe.

Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “Modern Airbus aircraft, with the latest levels of efficiency and lower fuel consumption, have accompanied Vietjet’s growth and will continue to support our global flight network expansion. Vietjet remains dedicated to delivering greater connectivity and sustainable air travel for millions of passengers and around the world.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales Commercial Aircraft at Airbus said: “Vietjet has established itself as one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, bringing low fares with warm Vietnamese hospitality. We are proud that the carrier has selected the A330neo as its widebody aircraft of choice to build on its success, and we look forward to continuing our partnership as Vietjet expands its reach.”

Vietjet Doubles A330neo Order to Forty Aircraft in Strategic Expansion of Its Long-Haul Ambitions

Vietjet is making bold moves to solidify its position in the global aviation market by doubling its firm order for the Airbus A330neo wide-body aircraft. The Vietnamese low-cost carrier has now committed to a total of forty A330neo aircraft, marking a significant expansion from its previous order. This strategic decision not only enhances Vietjet’s long-haul capabilities but also reflects its broader vision to transform from a regional operator into a formidable player in international markets.

This new order complements Vietjet’s existing order of ninety-six A320neo Family aircraft, demonstrating a balanced approach in building both short-haul and long-haul operations. Currently, the airline’s operational fleet consists of one hundred fifteen Airbus A320 Family narrow-body aircraft and seven A330-300 wide-bodies, underscoring its strong and exclusive relationship with Airbus. Vietjet’s reliance on an all-Airbus fleet ensures operational consistency, cost efficiency, and simplified maintenance procedures—key factors for sustained profitability and growth.

Vietjet’s A330-300s are already active on several popular international routes, including long-haul destinations such as Australia, India, and Kazakhstan. These routes are particularly significant as they align with the airline’s goal of tapping into high-demand travel corridors and meeting the needs of both leisure and business travelers. Onboard, passengers benefit from a premium experience, especially in Business Class, where they enjoy superior comfort, more spacious seating, and a wider selection of inflight services. Vietjet’s commitment to customer satisfaction is evident in how these wide-body aircraft are configured to elevate the overall flying experience.

With its expanding A330 fleet, Vietjet is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the international air travel market. The A330-900, which is part of the Airbus A330neo family, represents the latest in aviation technology. It is powered by advanced Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and offers an extended range of up to 7,200 nautical miles—or about 13,300 kilometers—on a single flight. This range allows Vietjet to connect Vietnam with far-flung global destinations without compromising on efficiency or fuel economy.

Inside, the A330neo features the cutting-edge Airspace cabin—Airbus’s signature design known for maximizing passenger comfort and setting new standards in cabin experience. The Airspace interior offers wider seats, increased personal space, larger overhead bins, customizable ambient lighting to reduce jet lag, and access to the latest in inflight entertainment and high-speed connectivity options. These features make long-haul travel more enjoyable and underscore Vietjet’s aspiration to provide premium experiences at low-cost prices.

Environmental responsibility is also a key aspect of the A330neo’s appeal. The aircraft is built with sustainability in mind and is currently certified to fly using up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus has set a goal to achieve 100% SAF capability by the year 2030, aligning with global efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. Vietjet’s choice of the A330neo fits within this broader framework, helping the airline reduce emissions while expanding operations.

As of April 2025, Airbus had received more than 1,800 orders for the A330 Family from over 130 airlines worldwide. The popularity of the aircraft reflects the confidence airlines have in its versatility, efficiency, and passenger-friendly features. For Vietjet, doubling its A330neo order is not just a fleet expansion—it is a statement of intent. The airline is clearly preparing for a new phase of growth, one that will see it compete more aggressively in long-haul markets while offering enhanced services and maintaining its cost-competitive edge.

With global air travel continuing to rebound and expand, Vietjet’s investment in the A330neo is both timely and visionary. As passenger demand rises and expectations for onboard experiences grow, Vietjet is equipping itself with the tools to not just keep up—but lead the charge into a new era of international aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-2025-05-26T111756404-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 02:56:09.475140

Montevideo | BioEconomía* | Todo El Campo | La escena podría parecer salida de una novela de ciencia ficción ecológica: residuos de construcción convertidos en combustible para aviones. Pero no se trata de una utopía, sino de una realidad en desarrollo en Japón, donde Sumitomo Forestry y Rengo Co. se han aliado para producir bioetanol a partir de madera, con el objetivo de abastecer la creciente demanda de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Sumitomo Forestry, uno de los mayores conglomerados japoneses en gestión forestal, arquitectura sustentable y desarrollo de viviendas de madera, aportará los residuos provenientes de sus obras de construcción. Por su parte, Rengo Co., una histórica empresa con sede en Osaka dedicada al packaging, el reciclaje de papel y el desarrollo de materiales de biomasa, liderará el desarrollo tecnológico y la producción.

BIOETANOL A PARTIR DE MADERA: HOJA DE RUTA Y ESCALA INDUSTRIAL

El proyecto contempla establecer una alianza estratégica entre ambas compañías para diciembre de 2025, con vistas a alcanzar una producción anual de 20.000 kilolitros de bioetanol a partir de 2027. La materia prima serán residuos de madera certificada según el esquema internacional Corsia (**), lo que garantiza su origen sostenible para el uso en aviación.

La conversión del material lignocelulósico a etanol se llevará a cabo utilizando tecnología desarrollada por Biomaterial in Tokyo, una filial de Rengo especializada en innovación química a partir de biomasa. La producción tendrá lugar en la sede y planta de Taiko Paper, otra subsidiaria de Rengo que actualmente se dedica a fabricar papel para embalaje y reciclar residuos industriales.

MÁS QUE BIOCOMBUSTIBLE: UN MODELO CIRCULAR.

Lo que distingue a esta iniciativa es su ambición de ir más allá del biocombustible. En paralelo al etanol, se generarán subproductos como lignina, un componente clave de la madera que podría transformarse en pinturas residenciales y otros insumos para la construcción sostenible. De este modo, las empresas buscan cerrar el ciclo del uso de recursos forestales, maximizando su aprovechamiento en línea con los principios de la bioeconomía circular.

UNA TENDENCIA QUE CRECE.

El interés japonés por el bioetanol no se limita a esta alianza. A comienzos de este año, Nippon Paper Industries -una de las mayores compañías papeleras del país- se unió a Sumitomo Corporation, gigante del comercio y la inversión internacional, y a Green Earth Institute (GEI), una empresa biotecnológica que desarrolla tecnologías fermentativas para convertir biomasa en productos renovables. Juntos formaron la empresa Morisora Bio Energy.

El objetivo de esta nueva sociedad es construir una planta semi-comercial en la fábrica de Nippon Paper en Iwanuma, en la prefectura de Miyagi. Allí se emplearán recursos forestales sostenibles de la región de Tohoku -como restos de aserraderos- para producir más de 1.000 kL de bioetanol al año a partir de 2027, utilizando procesos fermentativos patentados por GEI.

LECCIONES DE JAPÓN: ¿PUEDE EL RESIDUO FORESTAL SER ORO LÍQUIDO?

Este doble avance muestra una hoja de ruta clara: con infraestructura, tecnología y visión, los residuos de madera pueden transformarse en un activo clave para la transición energética. El enfoque integral de empresas como Sumitomo Forestry y Rengo, sumado a las capacidades biotecnológicas de GEI, plantea un nuevo paradigma donde el bosque no solo da sombra y madera, sino también energía limpia para volar.

En un mundo que necesita soluciones urgentes para descarbonizar el transporte, el ejemplo japonés propone una alternativa concreta, replicable y sustentable: mirar al residuo como el punto de partida de la innovación.

A relatively new plant to Australia called Carinata is changing the biofuels industry, and trials are happening now west of the Great Dividing Range.

Cotton growers have been giving it a go as a rotation crop.

The results are pretty golden so far.

Carinata oil, when refined, is considered a 'drop-in' replacement for existing fossil fuels: the biofuel can be used without updating or retrofitting current machines, and blends with existing fossil fuels.

Biofuels: replacement fossil fuels, usually bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, made out of sustainable biogenic resources. Everything from wood offcuts, to agricultural by-products, used cooking oil or beef tallow and even algae can be turned into biofuels.

Queensland Government's definition of Biofuels

Cream of the Crop

Carinata looks similar to canola; bright yellow flowers on towering green stems.

It's grown in winter and suits drier soil types.

It boasts lower water needs than Canola, due to a longer rootstock.

The crop is being pitched as an emerging option for broadacre farmers over winter.

Having a 'cover crop' is being adopted by many growers looking to reduce topsoil losses, in between their traditional cropping seasons.

The oil from the Brassica family plant is classed as non-food: unlike Canola, it can't be consumed by humans.

Harvest and crushing

Currently, once matured and harvested, Carinata is shipped to Europe for processing. There are no operational processing facilities in Australia yet.

The grain is processed into two products: biofuel, and high protein plant feed for stock.

Biofuel use has already been written into EU's aviation fuel regulations, and Asia has indicated it will follow.

In Australia, Qantas has committed to using 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its overall fuel mix by 2030.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Produced from sustainable feedstocks and is very similar in its chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.

BP's definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry has shown serious interest in Carinata-derived biofuel.

Plant Power

The plant's pre-commercial trials in Australia are being overseen by Nufarm.

Rachel Palumbo is Nufarm's Global General Manager for seeds, and is hopeful Australia could become a world-leader.

""Australia has the land, resources, and expertise to lead in renewable fuels, sustainable agriculture, and homegrown manufacturing,"" she said.

""In South America, farmers already produce low-carbon fuel at scale. With the right support Australian growers can do the same.

Growers benefit from having a profitable break crop that improves soil health

Government support needed

Earlier this year, the Australian Government announced it would invest $250 million into low-carbon liquid fuels.

""This funding will drive innovation and open new opportunities for farmers to supply feedstocks like Carinata,"" Ms Palumbo said.

The Queensland Government has also shown interest in the blooming industry, recently commissioning Deloitte to review global SAF markets.

The 2024 report found:

""Australia's SAF industry is still in its infancy and this is unlikely to change on the scale needed to support decarbonisation without government intervention and a proactive industry.""

Ms Palumbo also pointed to government-driven SAF mandates as a crucial step to fostering a local biofuels industry.

""We need a clear policy framework so Australian-grown biofuels can support local industries, just as Australian-grown canola already does for European biofuels.""

""This is a proven, sustainable, and scalable option for securing our fuel future while supporting growers and cutting emissions,"" Ms Palumbo said.",https://farmers.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carinata-in-flower.png,N,,2025-05-26 00:56:41.264883

Σύμφωνα με εκτιμήσεις του κλάδου η αυξανόμενη ζήτηση καυσίμων τα επόμενα χρόνια θα οδηγήσει σε αύξηση των επενδύσεων έως το 2030, παρά το γεγονός ότι τη διετία 2023-2024 σημειώθηκε σημαντική κάμψη.

Τα «πράσινα» καύσιμα αναμένεται να βρεθούν στο επίκεντρο αυτών των επενδύσεων καθώς η πρόσμιξη τους στις βενζίνες, το ντίζελ, τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα και τα καύσιμα ναυτιλίας, αποτελεί υποχρέωση που επιβάλλουν οι κανονισμοί της ΕΕ όχι μόνο για τους χρήστες αλλά και για τους παραγωγούς που πρέπει να προετοιμαστούν κατάλληλα.

Αεροπορικά καύσιμα

Στο επίκεντρο των συζητήσεων αυτή την περίοδο βρίσκονται τα «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα μέσω της εφαρμογής του ευρωπαϊκού κανονισμού ReFuelEU από το 2025, με αρχικό ποσοστό πρόσμιξης SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) 2%. Το ποσοστό αυτό προβλέπεται να αυξηθεί στο 6% το 2030, για να φθάσει σταδιακά στο 70% το 2050.

Οι ελληνικές εταιρίες διύλισης HelleniQ Energy και Motor Oil ήδη από τις αρχές του 2025 διαθέτουν αεροπορικά καύσιμα με πρόσμιξη 2% SAF.

Μάλιστα η HelleniQ Energy από το 2021 εφάρμοσε ένα πιλοτικό πρόγραμμα διαθέτοντας καύσιμα με πρόσμιξη SAF στην Aegean για τις πτήσεις της από το αεροδρόμιο Μακεδονία της Θεσσαλονίκης. Το καύσιμο προέρχονταν αρχικά από τη φιλανδική εταιρεία Neste, αλλά ο ελληνικός όμιλος συνεργάζεται πλέον με ολοένα και περισσότερους προμηθευτές.

Το SAF είναι αεροπορικό καύσιμο που παράγεται από ανακυκλωμένα έλαια, λίπη, ή οργανικά απόβλητα και μπορεί να μειώσει τις εκπομπές έως και κατά 80%, χωρίς να απαιτείται τροποποίηση στους κινητήρες των αεροσκαφών.

Για την παραγωγή του η HelleniQ Energy προωθεί τη δημιουργία μονάδας για «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα με παραγωγή 150.000 τόνων ετησίως, ποσότητα που υπερβαίνει τις ανάγκες της ελληνικής αγοράς γεγονός που σημαίνει ότι σημαντικές ποσότητες θα κατευθυνθούν σε εξαγωγές. Η μονάδα θα βασιστεί σε πρώτες ύλες όπως τα υπολείμματα τροφών, τα τηγανόλαδα και τα ζωικά λίπη, ακολουθώντας το ευρωπαϊκό μοντέλο που αποκλείει προϊόντα που ενδέχεται να επιβαρύνουν την τροφική αλυσίδα.

Παράλληλα στη Θεσσαλονίκη, η HelleniQ Energy δημιουργεί το Green Hub North Project το οποίο στοχεύει να εξελιχθεί σε κόμβο παραγωγής υγρών καυσίμων χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ. Εξάλλου η επεξεργασία πρώτων υλών φυτικής προέλευσης στις υπάρχουσες μονάδες αποθείωσης, επιτρέπει την παραγωγή «πράσινου ντίζελ».

Στον ναυτιλιακό τομέα, η Helleniq Energy έχει ξεκινήσει την παραγωγή μείγματος ναυτιλιακού καυσίμου (mazut) με βιοντίζελ, χρησιμοποιώντας αποκλειστικά απορρίμματα ελαίων. Η χρήση βιοκαυσίμων στη ναυτιλία εντάσσεται στο πλαίσιο του FuelEU Maritime, με τις εταιρίες να αναζητούν τρόπους συμμόρφωσης ενόψει της ενσωμάτωσης του τομέα στο Σύστημα Εμπορίας Εκπομπών.

Παραγωγή βιοκαυσίμων

Σε ανάλογο μήκος κύματος η Motor Oil προωθεί τη δημιουργία εγκαταστάσεων προηγμένων βιοκαυσίμων, με στόχο την παραγωγή άνω των 250.000 τόνων ετησίως. Επιπλέον, βρίσκονται στα σκαριά επενδύσεις για την ανάπτυξη e-μεθανόλης, με προγραμματισμένη παραγωγή 25.000 τόνων έως το 2029.

Το 2022 ο όμιλος εξαγόρασε την Elin Verde με αντικείμενο την παραγωγή και εμπορία βιοκαυσίμων, η οποία διαθέτει εργοστάσιο παραγωγής βιοντίζελ στη ΒΙ.ΠΕ Βόλου, ενώ ελέγχει και την «Πράσινο Λάδι» που δραστηριοποιείται στη συλλογή και εμπορία χρησιμοποιημένων μαγειρικών ελαίων και ζωικών λιπών (που αποτελούν την πρώτη ύλη για τα βιοκαύσιμα).

Το κόστος των συγκεκριμένων καυσίμων αλλά και κυρίως η ανεπάρκεια πρώτων υλών είναι από τα κυριότερα προβλήματα στην παραγωγή και τη χρήση τους. Αξίζει αναφερθεί ότι το κόστος του SAF αρχικά ήταν πενταπλάσιο από το απλό καύσιμο αεροπορίας και σήμερα είναι διπλάσιο. Βεβαίως το χαμηλό ποσοστό πρόσμιξης μειώνει δραστικά την επίπτωση στην τελική τιμή του προϊόντος.

Persidangan Kemuncak ASEAN 2025 yang bakal berlangsung pada 26 dan 27 Mei 2025 di Pusat Konvensyen Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) menjadi titik tolak penting dalam sejarah rantau ini. Dengan Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN, perhimpunan ini membawa satu naratif besar melalui temanya – “Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan”. Tema ini bukan sahaja mencerminkan aspirasi serantau, malah selari dengan prinsip Malaysia MADANI yang diterajui oleh YAB Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

Peranan Sejarah Malaysia dalam ASEAN

Malaysia merupakan negara pengasas ASEAN sejak tahun 1967. Sepanjang dekad-dekad yang lalu, negara ini telah memainkan peranan penting dalam mempromosikan kerjasama serantau, keamanan dan pembangunan ekonomi. Sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN buat kali kelima, Malaysia membawa pendekatan progresif yang menggabungkan elemen kemanusiaan dan keterangkuman sosial. Hal ini merupakan satu pendekatan yang amat diperlukan dalam dunia pasca-pandemik dan perubahan iklim yang drastik.

Makna Tema “Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan”

Tema ini menggabungkan dua nilai teras:

 Keterangkuman (Inclusivity) menekankan kepada penyertaan menyeluruh semua golongan masyarakat tanpa mengira latar belakang – termasuk wanita, golongan orang kurang upaya (OKU), belia, warga emas, dan masyarakat luar bandar. Keterangkuman ini juga mencakupi penglibatan negara-negara anggota ASEAN dalam membuat keputusan kolektif tanpa dominasi oleh negara tertentu.

 Kemampanan (Sustainability) pula merujuk kepada pembangunan yang menjaga keseimbangan antara keperluan ekonomi, kelestarian alam sekitar, dan kesejahteraan sosial. Dalam erti kata lain, kemajuan mesti diwarisi oleh generasi masa depan tanpa menjejaskan sumber sedia ada.

Langkah-Langkah Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025

1. Pengukuhan Ekonomi Digital dan Rantaian Bekalan Inklusif

Malaysia memimpin inisiatif Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA), satu rangka kerja pertama di ASEAN bagi menyelaraskan ekosistem digital antara negara anggota. Ini bukan sahaja membuka peluang pekerjaan dan pelaburan, malah memberi akses kepada masyarakat luar bandar dan golongan mikro-PKI untuk terlibat dalam ekonomi digital.

Selain itu, pihak kerajaan turut menekankan ekonomi gig dan pembelajaran sepanjang hayat bagi memastikan semua golongan, termasuk belia dan OKU, tidak tertinggal dalam perubahan ini.

2. Agenda Alam Sekitar dan Tenaga Lestari

Malaysia telah mengemukakan beberapa inisiatif termasuk pengeluaran Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), pelabuhan hijau, dan grid tenaga karbon rendah merentas ASEAN. Usaha ini diselaraskan dengan Pelan Peralihan Tenaga Nasional dan aspirasi Net-Zero 2050. ASEAN turut menyokong pembangunan ekopelancongan dan pertanian lestari sebagai sumber pertumbuhan hijau baharu.

Selain itu, Malaysia juga akan mengadvokasi kerjasama serantau yang lebih erat dalam tindakan iklim, tenaga hijau dan pembangunan mampa. Lebih memberansangkan, Malaysia kini merupakan hab utama global bagi pengeluaran komponen solar fotovoltaik (PV), dengan enam daripada sepuluh syarikat pengeluar PV terbesar dunia beroperasi di negara ini.

Hal ini melambangkan menifestasi Malaysia yang komited sepenuhnya terhadap peralihan hijau, bukan sahaja dalam negara malah merentasi Asia Tenggara. Kita terus memperjuangkan dasar, teknologi dan amalan lestari yang memberi manfaat kepada ASEAN secara keseluruhannya.

3. Pengarusutamaan Golongan Rentan dan OKU dalam Dasar Serantau

Satu aspek penting yang ditekankan Malaysia ialah penglibatan aktif golongan OKU dalam pembangunan. Melalui pelaksanaan Rangka Tindakan ASEAN mengenai Keterangkuman Sosial (ASEAN Enabling Masterplan 2025), Malaysia mengambil langkah untuk menyediakan infrastruktur mesra OKU, peluang pekerjaan, serta sokongan kesihatan mental dan fizikal.

Antara program yang dilaksanakan termasuk sokongan sosial berbentuk latihan digital, insentif majikan mesra OKU, dan kempen kesedaran di institusi awam dan pendidikan.

4. Pendidikan Inklusif dan Penglibatan Belia

Malaysia menekankan kepada keterlibatan belia sebagai agen perubahan. Pendidikan rentas sempadan, biasiswa ASEAN, dan program pertukaran budaya dijadikan platform memupuk semangat serantau dan toleransi. Dalam masa sama, pendekatan STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) turut digalakkan bagi melahirkan tenaga kerja berkemahiran tinggi yang inklusif gender dan etnik.

5. Pengukuhan Tadbir Urus Serantau dan Rangka Dasar MADANI

Kepimpinan Malaysia dalam ASEAN 2025 juga menjadi pentas untuk mempromosikan nilai-nilai MADANI dalam konteks antarabangsa. Ini termasuklah:

 Kemampanan melalui dasar peralihan tenaga dan ekonomi hijau

 Kesejahteraan melalui agenda sosial yang menyeluruh

 Keterangkuman dalam pembentukan dasar awam dan diplomasi rakyat

Aspirasi MADANI ini diterapkan dalam sidang kemuncak melalui pelibatan pelbagai sektor – awam, swasta dan masyarakat sivil – dalam proses perundingan dan pelaksanaan dasar.

Kajian Perbandingan dan Sokongan Serantau

Negara jiran seperti Thailand dan Indonesia menyambut baik pendekatan Malaysia. Thailand misalnya, menyatakan sokongan terbuka terhadap visi keterangkuman Malaysia, khususnya dalam pelibatan masyarakat tempatan dan penjagaan biodiversiti serantau. Indonesia pula melihat Malaysia sebagai rakan kongsi penting dalam menstrukturkan ekosistem digital dan pemerkasaan komuniti melalui inisiatif ekonomi hijau.

Cabaran dan Syor Penambahbaikan

1. Jurang Digital antara Kawasan Bandar dan Luar Bandar Cabaran:

Melalui laporan Biro Perdagangan Antarabangsa Amerika mengenai Malaysia pada tahun 2024 menyatakan, walaupun kadar penembusan internet di kawasan bandar Malaysia mencapai 92%, kawasan luar bandar masih ketinggalan dengan hanya 68% akses internet. Jurang ini menghalang penyertaan penuh komuniti luar bandar dalam ekonomi digital, pendidikan dalam talian, dan perkhidmatan kerajaan elektronik.

Syor:

 Pelaksanaan Audit Inklusiviti Digital: Menilai dan mengenal pasti kawasan yang memerlukan peningkatan infrastruktur digital.

 Peningkatan Peruntukan untuk Pendidikan Keterangkuman Digital: Menyediakan latihan dan sumber kepada komuniti luar bandar untuk meningkatkan literasi digital.

 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta: Mendorong pelaburan dalam infrastruktur digital di kawasan kurang liputan melalui insentif dan kerjasama strategik.

2. Kesedaran tentang Kelestarian Alam Sekitar dalam Kalangan Industri Kecil dan Sederhana (PKS)

Cabaran:

The Malaysiaan Reserve melaporkan walaupun kesedaran ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) dalam kalangan PKS Malaysia meningkat dari 14% kepada 80% dalam dua tahun terakhir, banyak PKS masih menghadapi cabaran dalam melaksanakan amalan lestari sepenuhnya.

Syor:

 Penyediaan Panduan ESG yang Mudah Difahami: Memperkenalkan panduan ESG yang disesuaikan dengan keperluan PKS untuk memudahkan pelaksanaan.

 Insentif Kewangan dan Sokongan Teknikal: Menyediakan geran, pinjaman mudah, dan bantuan teknikal kepada PKS yang berusaha mengamalkan kelestarian.

 Program Latihan dan Kesedaran: Mengadakan bengkel dan seminar untuk meningkatkan pemahaman PKS mengenai kepentingan dan manfaat amalan lestari.

3. Penglibatan Orang Kurang Upaya (OKU) yang Masih Bersifat Simbolik

Cabaran:

Walaupun terdapat dasar seperti ASEAN Enabling Masterplan 2025, penglibatan OKU dalam pembangunan sosial dan ekonomi masih terhad dan sering bersifat simbolik dan terdapat syor supaya keteribatan OKU mesti dipertingkatkan dengan beberapa syor berikut.

Syor:

 Memperluas Akses Kesihatan dan Infrastruktur Mesra OKU: Meningkatkan kemudahan awam dan perkhidmatan kesihatan yang mesra OKU di seluruh negara.

 Pelaksanaan Audit Inklusiviti dalam Semua Dasar ASEAN: Menilai sejauh mana dasar-dasar sedia ada memenuhi keperluan OKU dan membuat penambahbaikan

yang diperlukan.

 Memperkenalkan Indeks ASEAN-MADANI: Membangunkan penanda aras untuk menilai kemajuan keterangkuman dan kemampanan, termasuk penglibatan OKU, di peringkat serantau.

Dengan mengatasi cabaran-cabaran ini melalui syor-syor yang dicadangkan, Malaysia dapat memimpin ASEAN ke arah masa depan yang lebih inklusif dan lestari, selaras dengan aspirasi tema &quot;Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan&quot; serta prinsip Malaysia MADANI.

Penjajaran dengan Aspirasi Malaysia MADANI

Aspirasi Malaysia MADANI yang menekankan nilai-nilai kemampanan, kesejahteraan, dan keterangkuman sosial sejajar dengan tema ASEAN 2025. Melalui kepimpinan dalam ASEAN, Malaysia berpeluang untuk mempromosikan nilai-nilai ini di peringkat serantau, memperkukuh perpaduan dan kemakmuran bersama.

Kesimpulan: Harapan dan Aspirasi Rakyat Malaysia

Persidangan Kemuncak ASEAN 2025 merupakan medan penting bagi Malaysia memperlihatkan kepemimpinan berwibawa yang bukan sahaja berpaksikan ekonomi dan geopolitik, malah nilai-nilai kemanusiaan dan rahmah. Dengan menekankan aspek keterangkuman dan kemampanan, Malaysia boleh menjadi contoh kepada dunia bahawa pembangunan yang bersifat menyeluruh dan lestari mampu menjadi realiti.

Sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025, Malaysia memainkan peranan penting dalam memacu pembangunan serantau yang inklusif dan lestari. Melalui pelbagai inisiatif dalam bidang Ekonomi digital, kemampanan alam sekitar, keterangkuman sosial, dan infrastruktur, Malaysia berusaha untuk memastikan bahawa tiada siapa yang ketinggalan dalam arus pembangunan. Penjajaran dengan aspirasi Malaysia MADANI memperkukuh lagi komitmen negara untuk membina masyarakat yang adil, makmur, dan berdaya tahan di peringkat serantau.

Rakyat Malaysia, khususnya golongan muda dan OKU, mengharapkan bahawa inisiatif ini tidak hanya tinggal sebagai slogan atau dokumen dasar, tetapi diterjemahkan ke dalam tindakan konkrit dan berkesan.

Kedua langkah tersebut menjadi kunci bagi perusahaan dalam menghadapi situasi geopolitik yang sangat dinamis dalam beberapa waktu terakhir.

Sejumlah kondisi geopolitik masih menjadi sorotan bagi aktivitas perdagangan global. Kebijakan tarif, perang antara Rusia dan Ukraina, ketegangan India dan Pakistan, hingga konflik kawasan di sejumlah negara di Timur Tengah yang tak kunjung mereda, adalah contoh dinamika yang berdampak cukup besar saat ini.

Sebagai antisipasi menghadapi kondisi itu, PIS terus memperkuat lini bisnis dengan strategi terukur. PIS akan mengungkap racikan perusahaan itu secara menyeluruh di ajang Indonesia Maritime Week (IMW) 2025 yang akan digelar pada 26–28 Mei 2025 di Jakarta.

Direktur Perencanaan Bisnis PIS Eka Suhendra menyampaikan, “Ekspansi pasar dan diversifikasi kargo masih menjadi landasan strategi PIS dalam menghadapi dinamika geopolitik yang begitu fluktuatif. Langkah ini kami ambil untuk mencegah ketergantungan perusahaan terhadap suatu pasar dan produk kargo tertentu.”

PIS terus memperluas rute pelayaran di domestik dan luar negeri. Hingga hari ini, rute pelayaran internasional PIS sudah mencapai 65 negara. Selain itu, PIS juga telah memiliki tiga kantor perwakilan di Singapura, Dubai, dan London. Dengan terus memperluas pasar dan layanan, PIS sebagai subholding dan bagian dari Pertamina Group, menegaskan posisinya sebagai pemain global di sektor logistik energi dan maritim.

“Keberhasilan langkah ini terbukti meningkatkan kontribusi pendapatan dari pasar non-captive hingga 64% sepanjang tahun 2024 dibandingkan tahun sebelumnya,” imbuh Eka.

Dalam setiap langkah strategisnya, PIS tidak hanya berorientasi pada pertumbuhan bisnis, tetapi juga pada kontribusi nyata bagi bangsa. Sebagai bagian dari BUMN logistik dan energi, PIS menjalankan peran penting dalam menjaga ketahanan energi nasional melalui rantai logistik laut yang andal dan berkelanjutan.

Dengan memperluas jangkauan dan diversifikasi layanan, PIS turut memperkuat posisi Indonesia sebagai poros maritim dunia serta mendukung terciptanya konektivitas laut yang efisien dan kompetitif, baik untuk kepentingan nasional maupun regional.

Di samping perluasan pasar, PIS juga terus menggencarkan diversifikasi produk. Meskipun tetap fokus terhadap bisnis inti dalam pengangkutan energi, PIS senantiasa menatap sektor lain yang memiliki potensi besar untuk digarap seperti halnya dry bulk.

“PIS aktif mengkaji berbagai produk di luar sektor energi sebagai diversifikasi produk angkutan kami.

A relatively new plant to Australia called Carinata is changing the biofuels industry, and trials are happening now west of the Great Dividing Range.

Cotton growers have been giving it a go as a rotation crop.

The results are pretty golden so far.

Carinata oil, when refined, is considered a ‘drop-in’ replacement for existing fossil fuels: the biofuel can be used without updating or retrofitting current machines, and blends with existing fossil fuels.

Biofuels: replacement fossil fuels, usually bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, made out of sustainable biogenic resources. Everything from wood offcuts, to agricultural by-products, used cooking oil or beef tallow and even algae can be turned into biofuels.

Queensland Government’s definition of Biofuels

Cream of the Crop

Carinata looks similar to canola; bright yellow flowers on towering green stems.

It’s grown in winter and suits drier soil types.

It boasts lower water needs than Canola, due to a longer rootstock.

The crop is being pitched as an emerging option for broadacre farmers over winter.

Having a ‘cover crop’ is being adopted by many growers looking to reduce topsoil losses, in between their traditional cropping seasons.

The oil from the Brassica family plant is classed as non-food: unlike Canola, it can’t be consumed by humans.

Harvest and crushing

Currently, once matured and harvested, Carinata is shipped to Europe for processing. There are no operational processing facilities in Australia yet.

The grain is processed into two products: biofuel, and high protein plant feed for stock.

Biofuel use has already been written into EU’s aviation fuel regulations, and Asia has indicated it will follow.

In Australia, Qantas has committed to using 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its overall fuel mix by 2030.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Produced from sustainable feedstocks and is very similar in its chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.

BP’s definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry has shown serious interest in Carinata-derived biofuel.

Plant Power

The plant’s pre-commercial trials in Australia are being overseen by Nufarm.

Rachel Palumbo is Nufarm’s Global General Manager for seeds, and is hopeful Australia could become a world-leader.

“Australia has the land, resources, and expertise to lead in renewable fuels, sustainable agriculture, and homegrown manufacturing,” she said.

“In South America, farmers already produce low-carbon fuel at scale. With the right support Australian growers can do the same.

Growers benefit from having a profitable break crop that improves soil health

Government support needed

Earlier this year, the Australian Government announced it would invest $250 million into low-carbon liquid fuels.

“This funding will drive innovation and open new opportunities for farmers to supply feedstocks like Carinata,” Ms Palumbo said.

The Queensland Government has also shown interest in the blooming industry, recently commissioning Deloitte to review global SAF markets.

The 2024 report found:

“Australia’s SAF industry is still in its infancy and this is unlikely to change on the scale needed to support decarbonisation without government intervention and a proactive industry.”

Ms Palumbo also pointed to government-driven SAF mandates as a crucial step to fostering a local biofuels industry.

“We need a clear policy framework so Australian-grown biofuels can support local industries, just as Australian-grown canola already does for European biofuels.”

“This is a proven, sustainable, and scalable option for securing our fuel future while supporting growers and cutting emissions,” Ms Palumbo said.",https://farmers.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carinata-feilds-photo-credit-Nuseed.png,N,,2025-05-26 01:56:13.164558

So, what do we know about the changes in the global footprint of companies and government policies towards foreign business and trade?
Business executives would do well to recall Deming’s dictum: stakeholders that claim that the polycrisis changes everything should be asked to provide hard evidence.
For international business nowadays those risks are just as likely to arise at home than from abroad.
But what executives must not do is allow narrative alone to induce a retreat from foreign markets.","One example is a recent speech by Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s deputy prime minister, finance minister and former foreign minister, in which she re-examines the results of spending “three decades building an interconnected global economy” .

The view that flows from some of this thinking is that the international footprint of companies must be rethought because executives failed to take proper account of risks evident in today’s fraught world.

And the drum beat from certain key policymakers is relentless. Apparent “weaponization” of trade ties by China and Russia has put wind in their sails, as Mark Leonard shows in his 2021 book The Age of Unpeace. This has led to calls for supply chains to be designed with “just in case” considerations in mind rather than with “just in time”.

Senior national security officials from Germany, the US, and the UK are on record twisting the knife further – adding an “us versus them” angle to corporate deliberations on supply chain reconfiguration. In a speech in London in July, 2022, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Christopher Wray, said that China posed a “far more complex and pervasive threat to businesses than even most sophisticated company leaders realize” .

Other policymakers are not content with leaving it to international business to adjust (or not) as they see fit; they have begun to take action. US Commerce and Treasury Secretaries now advocate a “friend-shoring” approach to recasting international supply chains. This has been backed up by controversial tax incentives in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the US.

For their part, the European Commission has adopted a policy of “Open Strategic Autonomy,” an approach that puts more emphasis on the last word rather than the first two. One of the first policymakers to call for action was late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose government set up in April 2020 a $2 billion fund to encourage Japanese firms to shift factories out of China..

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added fuel to the fire to those claiming that globalization has gone too far. Western businesses operating in Russia were urged to divest, lest they be accused of “trading with the enemy”. Yet the reality has been more complicated. Straight divestment has consequences. The chairman of one large pharmaceutical company told me that they should not leave Russia and punish their customers, the logic being: why should a sick Russian be denied Western medicines because of Putin’s war?

From the start, forward-looking analysts and executives saw Western government sanctions on Russia and the concomitant pressure exerted on business as a dress rehearsal for the disruption to corporate plans that would follow a future Chinese attempt to forcibly reunite with Taiwan.

The question is whether this drum beat of criticism is actually prompting widespread retreat from globalization in terms of corporate decisions and of government policy capable of shaping those decisions. At this point, there are good reasons for doubting that broad-based retreat is occurring or, perhaps more importantly, on the cards.

Adding to the rhetoric is the awkward fact that most trusted sources of information on business and policy developments publish facts long after key decisions were taken. It was notable that during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments did not have up-to-date information on the where to source medical equipment.

When it comes to the data waymarkers of globalization, the US Department of Commerce publishes quite detailed statistics on the global footprint of American multinationals with a three-year lag. Global cross-border data on goods shipments is obtainable from the United Nations, for example, but comes with a minimum 12-month lag.

Moreover, only twice a year does the World Trade Organization publish reports on the policy steps taken by governments – and much of the policy relevant to business isn’t covered in those WTO reports. No international organization has a mandate to collect detailed information on policies affecting service sectors or the digital economy. In these circumstances, when credible information is either non-existent or delivered very late – and to paraphrase the oft-used maxim – a narrative can get halfway around the world before the truth can get its shoes on.

So, what do we know about the changes in the global footprint of companies and government policies towards foreign business and trade? The best advice here is to pierce the veil of rhetoric and demand hard facts on what is changing on the ground. As renowned US engineer and statistician W. Edwards Deming once said: “In God we trust. All others must bring data.”

Yes, foreign direct investment – a prominent manifestation of globalization – is growing more slowly than domestic capital expenditures. But this has been the tendency since 2005, well before the Global Financial Crisis, the US-China trade war, and the current polycrisis.

Beyond the tariffs imposed during the US-China trade war (where total trade affected amounts to less than 5% of world goods trade) and this year’s Western sanctions on Russia, calculations based on the Global Trade Alert database reveal that just 5.6% of world goods trade is affected by protectionist measures that single out another nation’s exports.

When it comes to government policies towards foreign business and trade, awarding corporate subsidies is the most common form of government favoritism around the world (not just in China). Some of that largesse is designed to shore up competitive positions in home markets, some in foreign markets. But few state incentives exist to repatriate factories from abroad.

When governments put money on the table to reconfigure supply chains, compared to the corporate stakes involved, the sums are trivial. Japan’s scheme mentioned earlier garnered a lot of headlines because of its budget envelope – but it turned out that, on average, Japanese firms that benefited received less than $15 million each. The recent CHIPS and Science Act in the US includes tens of billions of dollars of incentives to set up semiconductor fabs in the country, yet industry analysts are unanimous in saying that these sums are a fraction of the costs borne by business.

At least four studies of sourcing patterns of those medical goods scarce at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic – including a peer-reviewed examination of the issue by me in 2020, and another by European Centre for International Political Economy senior economist Oscar Guinea the same year – revealed very few cases where most supplies came from China. Little remarked upon was the fact that mask shortages and the like quickly subsided once Chinese factories geared up production in mid-2020.

While some Western politicians and foreign policy analysts reckon that the world is on its way to a definitive split between rival democratic and autocratic blocks, the reality is that democratic nations crimp the exports of other democratic nations proportionally more than they do from autocracies. Yet, the reluctance of US and EU officials to contemplate new binding trade deals shuts off one-way democratic nations could form a block that could create meaningful gains for international business.

Many companies said after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that they were exiting or planned to. Some large multinationals did, but a surprising number remain, and some of those that fully divested have even negotiated clauses to buy their assets back later.

What to make of this? Globalization and cross-border supply chains have been traduced. To the extent that trade and investment flows have been weaponized, this is localized and doesn’t merit a systemic rethink. Business executives would do well to recall Deming’s dictum: stakeholders that claim that the polycrisis changes everything should be asked to provide hard evidence. Officials have yet to follow through on their advocacy of decoupling, so there is a mismatch between rhetoric and actions taken. Furthermore, business isn’t retreating wholesale from emerging markets.

FBI Director Wray was right to encourage accurate risk assessments in his speech. But this applies to policy risks as well as to the loss of intellectual property in China. For international business nowadays those risks are just as likely to arise at home than from abroad. Risk assessment should be based on best available evidence. Executives should first identify which emergent geopolitical risks pose the greatest threat to their existing business models (not all do) and then seek out the experts prepared to piece together disparate information and insights on relevant policy dynamics.

From time-to-time, executives and board members should schedule discussions on how they would react to different contingencies and whether to adjust their global footprint to “known unknows” as the late Donald Rumsfeld would have put it.

Globalization will continue to evolve. But what executives must not do is allow narrative alone to induce a retreat from foreign markets.",https://www.imd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alexandr-podvalny-FvBVVf0ctnk-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 22:56:41.376558

Kim Reynolds' desk. A number of those pieces of legislation directly impact agriculture.

Biofuels

In early May, Reynolds increased funding for the Iowa Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Program. In July, the annual support will rise from $10 million to $14 million. The Iowa Soybean Association said the funds will be used to help gas stations and other fueling sites update their equipment to use renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.

“Increasing demand and accessibility for biodiesel is a top priority for Iowa farmers,” Suzanne Shirbroun, ISA president and farmer from Farmersburg, said in a press release. “A strong biodiesel market helps support our state’s thriving agriculture industry by increasing the per-bushel price of soybeans.”

Iowa is the top producer of both ethanol and biodiesel. The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says those fuels account for $5.7 billion of the state's GDP.

Property Taxes

Iowa Corn Growers Association Vice President of Government Relations Kevin Studer said farmers will not see property tax relief this year from the state legislature. He said it's an institutional part of the state's government, but also a place the organization's members would like to see reform.

""It's not a very sexy issue, but it's one that's very vital to our members,"" Studer said. ""It's kind of like, yes, if you have $7 corn, that's awesome, but if you get property taxes and all your input costs and everything keep creeping away at your at your balance sheet, that's always a negative from our standpoint.""

CO2 Pipelines

HF 639, a bill that places more requirements on carbon dioxide pipeline projects, was passed by the state legislature. On Thursday, ethanol industry members and a number of farmers held a press call asking the governor to veto the legislation.

It makes changes to common carrier classification, requires non-renewable CO2 project permits and additional industry input for the pipelines.

Mike Jerke is the CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, an ethanol plant in southwest Iowa. He says all the landowners involved with their CO2 project have agreed voluntarily. He said the permit limit is a deal-breaker.

""The existing language in statute said the maximum was 25 years, but then the death blow is you cannot renew a permit if you're transporting liquefied carbon dioxide. You cannot renew it,"" Jerke said.

Der Industriekonzern treibt gezielte Portfolioanpassungen voran – mit einem klaren Fokus auf nachhaltige Technologien und profitables Wachstum. Doch was steckt hinter den jüngsten Transaktionen, und wie positioniert sich das Unternehmen für die Zukunft?

Ausstieg aus dem Schutzausrüstungsgeschäft

In einem strategischen Schritt hat Honeywell sein Geschäft mit persönlicher Schutzausrüstung (PPE) für 1,325 Milliarden Dollar in bar an Protective Industrial Products verkauft. Diese Entscheidung markiert den vollständigen Rückzug aus dem PPE-Markt und soll das Portfolio des Unternehmens optimieren. Ziel ist es, sich stärker auf Kernbereiche mit höherem Wachstumspotenzial und besserer Cash-Generierung zu konzentrieren.

Milliarden-Deal für nachhaltige Technologien

Parallel zum Verkauf kündigte Honeywell die Übernahme des Katalysatortechnik-Geschäfts von Johnson Matthey für rund 2,42 Milliarden Dollar an. Diese Akquisition soll das Energiesparte des Konzerns entscheidend stärken, insbesondere die UOP-Sparte, die auf Katalysatoren und Prozesstechnologien spezialisiert ist.

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.
A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.
The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.
The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.","When Formula 1 cars nudge speeds of 330 kilometres per hour next year, hundreds of millions of people will witness existing engines and infrastructure working with a fuel once considered futuristic.

The fuel burning inside the turbocharged V6 engines won't be gutted from the Earth like traditional fossil fuels; instead, most will be chemically synthesised and involve the recycling of existing carbon dioxide — making it close to carbon neutral.

""It would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent,"" Liam Parker said, chief communications officer at Formula 1.

""The technical analysis shows zero drop in performance, so you're racing green, you're providing a solution for the automotive sector and the wider consumer, but you're also giving the public and the fans what they want.""

Five different companies — many of them sponsors — will be supplying the 100 per cent synthetic and biofuel to the 11 teams on the grid, once again positioning Formula 1 as the breeding ground of the kind of innovation that trickles to road cars and other vehicles.

Industry stakeholders believe these low-carbon liquid fuels provide a window of opportunity for Australia, claiming it can help connect the vehicles, ships and planes of today to a net-zero tomorrow, and create a multi-billion-dollar domestic manufacturing industry that would also bolster the nation's fuel security.

""We estimate the Australian low-carbon liquid fuel market could be in the order of $36 billion a year by 2050, and a feedstock market of about $15 billion,"" said Rupert Maloney, executive director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), a Commonwealth-funded investment firm backing green initiatives.

What makes synthetic and biofuel different?

There are two main types of low-carbon liquid fuels: synthetic and biofuel.

Both of them source carbon from the atmosphere when they're being developed, effectively recycling it once it is burned by an engine.

But whereas biofuel is processed from organic material such as sugarcane, used cooking oil and sawmill residue, the latest synthetic fuel doesn't affect food production.

It chemically synthesises the elements that make fuel: hydrogen and carbon.

The hydrogen is split from water in a process powered by renewable electricity, while the carbon is either captured from the air using emerging technology, extracted from algae, or gleaned from sustainable sources like waste.

The domestic biofuel industry is already growing as local feedstock is exported internationally, but industry stakeholders believe synthetic fuel has greater scale-up potential.

Global companies want to make synthetic fuel in Australia

At least two companies are looking at manufacturing synthetic fuel in Australia — HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) and Zero Petroleum — with each expected to start construction on plants in 2026.

HIF is aiming to produce 100 million litres of synthetic fuel a year once its manufacturing plant is up and running in 2030 — about 500 times more than its concept plant in Chile.

The company, which counts Porsche among its investors, claims it is spending about $2 billion constructing the plant in Tasmania.

""What we look for are locations where the feed stocks that we need to make this product are available and are also cost efficient,"" said Ignacio Hernandez, chief executive of HIF Asia Pacific.

""One of the main ingredients that we need is renewable energy, and Australia is well known globally for having a big renewable energy potential.""

Meanwhile, Zero Petroleum — founded by former F1 engineer Paddy Lowe and chemical engineer Nilay Shah — is examining the feasibility of building a plant in South Australia.

The facility would produce up to 10 million litres of synthetic aviation fuel, gasoline and diesel a year.

It works with our cars today, but will we use it?

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.

But there's disagreement on whether the fuel would be used in the nearly 16 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

How much it costs at the bowser will be a key determinant.

A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.

""The cost of the product will come down, and eventually you're able to transition to 100 per cent synthetic, without impacting materially the cost to the final consumer,"" Mr Hernandez said.

A key factor in the price coming down is the cost of renewable electricity, as wind and solar farms would power the manufacturing process to keep the carbon footprint as low as possible.

""We need very low renewable energy costs in order to get that hydrogen price down,"" Max Temminghoff said, Mineral Resources Lead at the CSIRO Futures.

""And then on the other flip side is the carbon dioxide. Pulling that out of the atmosphere currently is technologically not as mature and is a bit expensive, so that's what the CSIRO is working on.""

Betting on electric vehicles and new infrastructure

Instead, there is a concerted effort to transition cars and the infrastructure powering them to electric — but there's a long way to go to meet the CSIRO's target of 97 per cent by 2050.

The latest data from the federal government, dated January 2024, reveals there are 15.7 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

One per cent — or 159,460 — were electric.

Vehicles powered by petrol or diesel made up 95.5 per cent — or 14,958,462 vehicles.

""There will be an existing fleet of internal combustion engines, we think, still operating at that point [in 2050], and there needs to be a solution for those cars,"" HIF's Mr Hernandez said.

Sustainable fuel could be used in vehicles that are hard to electrify

The demand, policy and money opportunities suggest synthetic fuel will be used to power trucks driving interstate, ships travelling across oceans and planes flying internationally.

""By 2050, about 30 billion litres in Australia will likely be hard to electrify and will likely require low carbon liquid fuels or other decarbonisation technologies,"" the CEFC's Mr Maloney said.

The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.

Qantas imported 1.7 million litres of sustainable fuel in early May, hoping to blend it at a ratio of 18 per cent with traditional jet fuel.

The airline claims it could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland, reducing carbon emissions by 3,400 tonnes.

But it had to shop overseas, importing the biofuel from Malaysia.

""The creation of a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation,"" said Vanessa Hudson, the chief executive of Qantas Group.

Manufactures say updated policy will drive investment

The federal government is hoping to foster a low-carbon liquid fuel manufacturing industry in Australia, announcing $250 million in grants in March.

""Australia has the know-how and skills to meet the crucial task of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation, heavy transport and mining that rely on liquid fuels,"" Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

But the industry is asking for the kind of regulations popping up in other parts of the world, including mandates that would require select sectors to blend a percentage of synthetic fuel with their current fossil stock.

""Some of the mandates that are getting rolled out across Asia are in the order of 1 per cent blend, so it will not have a large impact on end use pricing,"" Mr Maloney said.

""It provides an investment signal back to the production side of the market to develop these facilities, and that brings down the cost.""

HIF's facility could produce enough synthetic fuel to meet a quarter of Tasmania's demand, Mr Hernandez said, but instead it'll likely export supply to other countries.

""There are other markets in the world that have more advanced regulation to support the uptake of these products,"" he said.

Australia relies on liquid fuels for more than half of its energy demand, according to federal government data, but the number of local refineries has dwindled from seven to two.

The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.

""Currently we import about 80 per cent of our refined fuels and we get those fuels through pretty extensive supply chains that are exposed to a range of geopolitical risks,"" the CSIRO's Mr Temminghoff said.

""Being able to produce our fuels locally means that we have more control over the variables that go into the price.

""We really see this opportunity as fleeting.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0bf9183b303ef09f6430416b77d65dfe?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1863&cropW=3312&xPos=4&yPos=92&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-05-25 15:56:07.373927

High costs have discouraged potential offtakers, dampening interest in the idea of extracting hydrogen from renewable resources instead of simply squeezing it from natural gas or coal. However, China did not get the memo…

China’s Excellent Green Hydrogen Adventure

Three weeks ago, S&P Global took note of a new hydrogen report posted by China’s National Energy Administration. Although China continues to produce a prodigious amount of hydrogen from from fossil resources, the nation’s green hydrogen footprint is growing into a market force to be reckoned with.

“China now accounts for 50% of global green hydrogen production capacity,” S&P summarized. The strong showing suggests that competition from Chinese producers is one reason why diversified energy stakeholders in the US and elsewhere have rolled back their plans for renewable H2, to concentrate on their traditional business.

Further wracking nerves among green H2 producers in other regions is China’s pursuit of patents. Earlier this month the Asia-Pacific news organization Recessary was among those taking note of an analysis by the Japanese firm Astamuse, indicating that China has been scrambling to file renewable hydrogen patents at a furious pace since 2020, when the nation announced its carbon targets.

“The large number of patents has driven down the cost of hydrogen production equipment in China to just a quarter of that in Europe,” Recessary noted, referring to electrolyzer systems powered by renewable energy, which deploy electricity and a catalyst to push hydrogen gas from water (see more green H2 background here).

Scaling Up Green Hydrogen For Green Ammonia

Rounding out the news from China, last week the firm Envision Energy announced that the global testing and inspection firm Bureau Veritas has certified its forthcoming 500-megawatt Chifeng facility in Inner Mongolai for industrial-scale renewable ammonia, to be produced with green hydrogen. The facility began limited production last year and is on track to reach full volume this September.

Although much attention has been paid to the role of green hydrogen as a fuel for fuel cell vehicles of various sorts, hydrogen is also an industrial input with a firm grip on the ammonia fertilizer field, and that is where another opportunity lies. Last week Envision reached an agreement with the leading Japanese infrastructure and commodities trading firm Marubeni, indicating that the demand for green ammonia can support industrial scale electrolyzer systems.

“The project uses Envision’s advanced electrolyzer technology, powered by wind and solar, to produce 300,000 tons of green ammonia annually, making it one of the world’s first and largest commercial projects of its kind,” Envision explained.

“It is a testament to how innovation and sustainability can go hand-in-hand – from our advanced electrolyzer technology to the use of 100% renewable power, we’re redefining what’s possible in green hydrogen and ammonia production,” emphasized Envision VP Frank Yu in a press statement.

Meanwhile, Over Here In The USA …

The US is one of those other regions where green hydrogen producers are getting a case of the yips, though not particularly on account of forthcoming competition from China. Instead, the call is coming from inside the house.

Just a few years ago, hydrogen stakeholders were anticipating a bonanza of federal and investor support through the new $7 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. Launched during the Biden administration, the initiative was supposed to stimulate and diversify hydrogen production across the US. The program included space for natural gas extraction as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but much of the emphasis was on renewable hydrogen, including biomass resources as well as water electrolysis.

Trump put the program on ice after taking office, except for the natural gas end of things. Shocker!

Still, outside of the program some green hydrogen projects have wriggled through. Earlier this year, for example, the startup TalusAg launched a green ammonia venture in Iowa, featuring a reproduceable business model aimed at producing ammonia fertilizer locally for rural markets.

The E-Fuels Solution: Follow The Money … To Texas

The emerging e-fuels (aka electrofuels) industry is another source of support for the global green hydrogen market. E-fuels stakeholders began drifting into Texas several years ago, lured by copious wind and solar resources along with access to seaports and inland energy infrastructure.

The e-fuels industry leverages green hydrogen and captured carbon to produce synthetic, drop-in replacements for liquid fuels, with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) being a priority target.

The California startup Infinium was among the first to foray into Texas. The company’s Project Pathfinder e-fuels operation is already up and running in Corpus Christie, and neither competition from China nor the frowning face of the Trump administration has stopped it from moving forward with plans for a second facility.

On May 19 the company dropped word that construction has begun on Project Roadrunner in Texas, near the city of Pecos. The venture was publicized after Infinium closed on financing from A-listers Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products,” Infinium enthused.

Infinium already has offtake relationships with American Airlines here in the US, and with the UK firm IAG, which owns British Airways, Aer Lingus. IAG has already agreed to import its eSAF to the UK.

“Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market,” Infinium emphasized.

If all goes according to plan, production will begin in 2027, with power supplied from a nearby wind farm under the umbrella of NextEra Energy Resources. Infinium also anticipates that the system will overproduce hydrogen, enabling it to pursue additional offtake agreements for green hydrogen as well complete e-fuels.

Green Hydrogen: The Electrolyzer Factor

Infinium has tapped the Massachusetts firm Electric Hydrogen to supply its turnkey “HYPRPlant” electrolyzer system to produce the green hydrogen for Project Roadrunner. According to Electric Hydrogen, the pre-assembled solution can cut the installed cost of green hydrogen by up to 60%, compared to conventional electrolyzers systems. Electric Hydrogen also pre-tests the system before shipping it out, relieving producers from on-site troubleshooting.

In March, Electric Hydrogen announced that its electrolyzer system will be manufactured by the Texas firm Titan Production Equipment. Regardless of global trends, the firm is confident that opportunities persist here on its home turf and in Europe as well.

“The partnership with Titan illustrates how growth in the hydrogen industry creates opportunities for expansion of energy businesses and jobs in Texas,” Electric Hydrogen noted in a press statement.

Perhaps they are on to something. Despite President Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” energy policy, longtime oil and gas stakeholders have been casting around for new business in the clean energy field, and Titan is a good example.

The division boasts strong expertise in catalyst systems that cut emissions, reduce industrial waste, and improve efficiency across chemical manufacturing, refining, and renewable energy.

This move positions Honeywell as a leader in producing blue hydrogen, blue ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel, directly addressing increasing global regulations for cleaner fuels.

Johnson Matthey is using most sale proceeds to reward shareholders and refocus its business strategy, following a streak of divestitures for a leaner operation.

The deal marks a pivotal shift toward large-scale decarbonization and strengthens both companies’ roles in shaping the future of sustainable industrial technology.

A sleek, steel future glimmers on the horizon as Honeywell International positions itself at the heart of the global push for cleaner energy. The industrial titan—long known for shaping industries from aerospace to advanced materials—has made a bold move, agreeing to purchase Johnson Matthey’s catalyst technologies division for £1.8 billion ($2.4 billion). This transaction, executed entirely in cash, signals not just a merger of assets but the convergence of ambition and expertise, shaking up the landscape of sustainable fuel solutions.

Inside the walls of Johnson Matthey’s London headquarters, teams of engineers and chemists have spent decades refining catalyst systems. These innovations don’t just boost profits—they slash waste, curtail emissions, and vastly improve efficiency in chemical manufacturing, refining, and renewable energy applications. With 1,900 employees spread from London to India and the U.S., the unit reported a robust £86 million operating profit last year, notching a nearly 23% increase over the previous period—a testament to the surging demand for cleaner industrial processes.

On the global stage, regulators are sharpening their focus on green mandates. Honeywell’s acquisition is a direct response to mounting pressure: both governments and consumers want cleaner fuels now. Honeywell’s CEO, Vimal Kapur, envisions an energy ecosystem where advanced catalysts play starring roles in producing blue hydrogen, blue ammonia, and renewable aviation fuel—each representing crucial steps in slashing global carbon footprints while fueling economies.

For Johnson Matthey, already a cornerstone of the UK’s FTSE 250, the sale marks an inflection point. By channeling £1.4 billion of the proceeds back to shareholders and retaining a fraction for leaner, more strategic operations, the company is carving out a sharper, more focused identity. This deal follows a decisive streak of divestitures, including a $700 million sale of its medical device components arm in early 2024.

Teams of elite advisers from Latham & Watkins and Slaughter and May are smoothing the legal terrain, while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup orchestrate the numbers behind the scenes. Yet above the legal fine print and boardroom negotiations, the key narrative takes shape: two industrial powerhouses aligning, pooling technology and talent, and accelerating the global race for scalable, commercial clean energy.

The key takeaway: This acquisition isn’t a mere reshuffling of corporate cards. It’s a calculated leap toward decarbonizing some of the world’s most energy-intensive sectors. As catalyst technology takes center stage, Honeywell deepens its commitment to tangible, sustainable innovation, potentially shaping how the world will fuel its future. In a marketplace chasing not just profit but purpose and progress, the stakes have never been higher—or the competitive landscape more exhilarating.

The Iowa Legislature approved House File 639 on May 12. The bill was presented by its proponents as a measure to protect Iowa landowners from the use of eminent domain. The rights of landowners are important, and the state Legislature was the appropriate forum to discuss this issue.

However, House File 639 does not address the matter effectively. Instead of focusing solely on the eminent domain concern, the enacted language will significantly affect — and potentially terminate — projects for reasons unrelated to eminent domain. These provisions will obstruct CO2 sequestration projects that are socially acceptable and beneficial to landowners, ethanol producers, farmers, and citizens.

Therefore, Gov. Kim Reynolds should veto the bill.

Here are some specific issues with House File 639:

Section 9. This provision would alter Iowa Code Section 476.33 to permit intervention in any Iowa Utilities Commission proceeding by state lawmakers, other elected officials, or residents with a ""minimally plausible interest."" There is no definition provided for “minimally plausible interest,” and no geographic restrictions, allowing for potential delays from unrelated entities opposed to agricultural production or proposed projects.

Section 11. This adds insurance requirements for a permittee, in Code Section 479B.13A : “The surety or insurance policy must fully cover … any loss from negligent or intentional discharge from the pipeline.” Insurance coverage for an intentional violation of a permit is not available for purchase, as such a product does not exist.

Section 15. Section 479B.14, subsection 2, would be amended to limit the permit duration to 25 years. It states, ""The commission shall not renew a permit granted to a pipeline that transports liquefied carbon dioxide."" This amendment would eliminate access to markets such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel after the 25-year period.

Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, which we oversee, has been part of the ethanol success story in Iowa since 2009. The company has a significant economic impact on southwest Iowa. The organization employs about 70 people, annually purchases more than 40 million bushels of corn from local farmers, engages with various trades and support entities, and distributes dividends to its 814 shareholders. Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy employees, directors, and shareholders are deeply concerned that the passage of House 639 will have significant adverse effects on our Carbon Capture and Sequestration project currently in progress and will severely restrict the company’s future market opportunities.

Following a comprehensive assessment of sequestration pipeline alternatives, the Board of Directors finalized an agreement with Tallgrass, a leading infrastructure company managing over 10,000 miles of pipelines nationwide. Tallgrass has repurposed an existing pipeline for CO2 transportation that traverses across Nebraska to sequestration sites in Wyoming. Due to Southwest Iowa’s strategic location in Council Bluffs, the company can join ethanol plants in Nebraska to utilize this pipeline.

Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy has already received 100% of the easements from landowners along the pipeline for right-of-way that will allow the pipeline construction. All the easements were voluntary. SIRE and Tallgrass have followed the Iowa Utilities Commission requirements for pipelines that are less than 5 miles long and filed our permit application on Feb. 18, 2025. SIRE has entered into a contract to build the CO2 capture and compression equipment on site at an expected cost of about $45 million. And the company has acquired the necessary equipment and intends to commence construction in the fall of 2025.

The Tallgrass pipeline project, which includes Southwest Iowa, will compensate landowners with an initial payment, and annual royalties based on the volume of CO2 transported through the pipeline. Local communities and fire departments will benefit from Tallgrass’ “community benefits agreement,” which includes $600,000 for training and equipping first responders on the Trailblazer pipeline route and a donation of $500,000 to nonprofits in the counties on the route. The Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy ethanol plant will be able to access low-carbon markets such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel, and farmers will have an improved market for the corn they grow.

House File 639 poses a threat to these developments.

In conclusion, we acknowledge that the Legislature is the appropriate forum for addressing matters such as landowner rights. However, House File 639 fails to consider projects like ours, where all easements are entirely voluntary. The adverse economic impacts to Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy are significant and cannot be overlooked.

It is imperative that Reynolds veto House File 639.

Il Brasile è il settimo produttore mondiale di petrolio ma è anche un Paese capace di estrarre dal cilindro sorprendenti risorse per generare energia pulita. Vale la pena citare il bacino amazzonico, che è la più grande riserva di acqua dolce del pianeta, e l’infinita varietà di piante tropicali messa a disposizione da un territorio immenso e ricco di biodiversità. L’ultima trovata suggerisce un binomio fantascientifico: usare una pianta parente dei friarielli per far volare gli aerei. Spieghiamoci meglio: il cavolo d'Abissinia, detto anche senape abissina (nome scientifico “Brassica carinata”), è della stessa famiglia della colza, dei cavolfiori e dei broccoli, e si può coltivare come sovescio invernale, cioè tra una coltura e l’altra, tanto che in Sudamerica è chiamato «la soia d’inverno» per le sue proprietà oleaginose da sfruttare negli intervalli del raccolto della materia prima più conosciuta, di cui il Brasile è peraltro primo produttore mondiale.

Ora il Paese sudamericano si candida a diventare anche il primo produttore mondiale di “carinata”: secondo Nuseed, l’azienda statunitense che ne detiene la maggiore quantità di germoplasma, la produzione brasiliana esploderà del 900% quest’anno, passando da 10mila a 100mila tonnellate. Da questa pianta praticamente sconosciuta si può estrarre biocombustibile per soddisfare la crescente domanda di Saf - Sustainable Aviation Fuel – e raggiungere l’ambiziosissimo traguardo che il settore aereo mondiale si è posto, cioè di diventare al 100% carbon free entro il 2050. Insomma, una pianta utilizzata per la rotazione colturale può rivoluzionare il trasporto aereo, ad oggi responsabile di circa il 3% delle emissioni globali di CO2 prodotta dall'attività umana. Un dato che può sembrare piccolo ma che in termini assoluti è significativo, considerando che l'aviazione ha raddoppiato le sue emissioni di anidride carbonica dal 1990 al 2019.

Quando la “carinata” è matura, è in grado di assorbire carbonio e restituire nutrienti al terreno, riducendo le emissioni ad effetto climalterante. In 3 tonnellate/ettaro di granella raccolta vi è circa un 36,8% di olio: si tratta di un rendimento inferiore a quello della colza e del lino, però con maggiori concentrazioni di acido erucico, il che rende l'olio non commestibile ma appunto molto adatto ad usi industriali oltre che come fertilizzante naturale dei terreni, facilitando l’attività agricola. La “carinata” infatti è particolarmente resiliente e si adatta a condizioni climatiche estreme, come quelle del Brasile che è uno dei Paesi più esposti agli effetti del riscaldamento globale, registrando continuamente ondate di calore, siccità, inondazioni. La sua capacità di migliorare la salute del terreno è inoltre un grande alleato contro l’uso di fertilizzanti chimici e il Brasile ha bisogno pure di questo, dato che è il primo esportatore mondiale di ben 10 commodities agricole (caffè, carne bovina, zucchero, etc) ma che nel 2024 ha registrato il record di pesticidi: il governo ne ha autorizzati 663, nel 2000 erano solo 82.",https://www.avvenire.it/c/2025/PublishingImages/3d77e0dea76a4704a89a9579350a71e3/cari.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 07:56:13.477122

State-run leading oil refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is immediately investing Rs 1086 crore in its two-year-old subsidiary, Terra Clean, to develop 4.3 gigawatt (GW) of renewable capacity, in addition to the one GW RE capacity planned earlier. Currently, IOC already has an RE capacity of 238 MW. Plans are to reach 31 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, which will also include biofuels, carbon capture and green hydrogen.

Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), India’s second-largest oil marketing company, plans to develop 10 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2040. Recently, it awarded two contracts to set up wind farms of 50 MW each to power its refineries in Mumbai and Bina, Madhya Pradesh.

State-owned HPCL is set to invest up to Rs 50,000 crore to boost its renewable energy portfolio to 10 GW by 2030, through its subsidiary HPCL Renewable & Green Energy Limited (HPRGE). The company aims for 1 GW capacity by 2025-26 and is establishing solar power plants and a biofuel portfolio.

National energy carrier GAIL (India) Ltd, which is planning to develop 3 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, has already commissioned its first green hydrogen facility in Vijaipur, Madhya Pradesh. GAIL and private sector AM Green, a subsidiary of the AM Green Group promoted by Greenko founders, are jointly developing renewable energy of up to 2.5 GW and green chemical projects. GAIL has also teamed up with Cummins for hydrogen and energy transition projects.

Another state-owned oil and gas firm Oil India Limited (OIL) has formed a subsidiary Oil Green Energy, to pursue RE projects, including geothermal, wind, hydro, solar, tidal, and waste energy. Plans are to spend Rs 25,000 crore in near future, including in ethanol plants.

Metafuels and Evos Rotterdam are working together to take the next steps to progress the development of the project. Evos is a liquid energy and chemicals storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol—its planned production facility in Denmark. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 liters of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 liters per day.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe. It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonization is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative e-SAF pathways.

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion. The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes.

aerobrew SAF plants can process bio-methanol or e-methanol interchangeably, allowing the production of bio-SAF or e-SAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals. Bio-methanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while e-SAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonization.

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a Final Investment Decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or e-fuels, driven by strong regulatory support. Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050.",,N,,2025-05-25 03:56:07.476156

Zorzoli analizza un articolo di Susanna Tamaro che parla di sostenibilità e cambiamento climatico

Lo scorso 21 marzo il Corriere della Sera ha pubblicato un articolo, intitolato “L’ansia green non salverà il pianeta”, ad opera dell’autrice di romanzi bestseller Susanna Tamaro. Dopo aver affermato di essere sempre stata in prima linea nella difesa della natura, come testimoniano la sua casa da 25 anni alimentata da energia solare, l’utilizzo della bicicletta per spostamenti locali e di una piccola auto ibrida per quelli più lunghi, e vivendo in campagna con l’autoproduzione di ciò che mangia, per cui “in un ipotetico paradiso dell’impronta carbonica volerei immediatamente nell’empireo dei cherubini”, la Tamaro, un po’ ottimisticamente, sostiene che 50 anni fa la preoccupazione per la salvaguardia dell’ambiente era patrimonio di una minoranza di appassionati, mentre ora coinvolge la stragrande maggioranza degli abitanti del pianeta.

GLI STRAVOLGIMENTI DEL CLIMA

Come scrive l’analista G.B. Zorzoli nell’ultimo numero della rivista Pianeta Terra, “occorre però ricordare che tutta la storia della terra e dell’evoluzione del vivente è stata segnata da stravolgimenti climatici, ma solo con l’irrompere dell’antropocene il rapporto si è unilateralmente sbilanciato” e saper sempre distinguere tra il bene e il male. Questa premessa l’autorizza a manifestare una grande inquietudine per alcune terapie che ci vengono prescritte per salvare il mondo.

IL CLIMA ITALIANO E IL CAPPOTTO TERMICO

“Che dire, ad esempio, del cappotto termico? In un Paese dal clima ormai tropicalizzato come il nostro, che senso ha fasciare le case con un materiale che impedisce la traspirazione dei muri, creando sacche di umidità pessime per la solidità degli edifici e per la salute di chi ci vive dentro?”.

Provi a suggerirlo ai trentini o ai valdostani. Questo è però solo l’antipasto. Secondo la Tamaro, in un Paese come l’Italia, ormai privo di vento (sic!), e custode di un patrimonio di bellezza ambientale e architettonica unica al mondo, le pale eoliche rischiano di essere un inutile scempio, anche perché “le pale rimarranno in testimonianza di un Paese che ha venduto la sua primogenitura di bellezza per un piatto di lenticchie”. Evidentemente troppo occupata a scrivere, Susanna Tamaro non ha tempo disponibile per documentarsi, dato che ignora l’obbligo di smantellamento dei parchi eolici a fine vita e, preoccupata, si chiede “quanta energia producono le pale tristemente immobili disseminate sul nostro territorio? Sarebbe utile saperlo, per capire se il gioco vale davvero la candela”.

LA QUESTIONE DELLE AUTO ELETTRICHE

Non contenta, la Tamaro se la prende anche con l’auto elettrica, “utilissima nelle città congestionate, se si ha la fortuna di possedere un garage con la ricarica, ma assolutamente folle se si decide di imporla a tutti mezzi di locomozione da qui a 10 anni, mentre non si fa mai menzione dell’ormai affollatissimo cielo in cui milioni di aerei scaricano quotidianamente i loro agenti inquinanti nell’atmosfera”; come se non esistessero i Sustainable Aviation Fuel e gli ETS per gli aerei.

Insomma, la Tamaro ci ricorda l’austriaca “eccellenza” a cui in “Sant’Ambrogio” finge di rivolgersi il poeta Giuseppe Giusti. “Che fa il nesci, Eccellenza? O non l’ha letto? Ah, intendo: il suo cervel, Dio lo riposi, in tutt’altre faccende affaccendato, a questa roba è morto e sotterrato”. Dopo di che, la Tamaro sferra il colpo finale: intorno al cosiddetto green si addensano importanti capitali.

LE PROPOSTE DI SUSANNA TAMARO PER CONTRASTARE IL CAMBIAMENTO CLIMATICO

Di conseguenza, forse per evitare indebiti arricchimenti, propone di dare per scontato che il cambiamento climatico è in atto e di utilizzare tutte le risorse tecnologiche e scientifiche che abbiamo a disposizione per mitigarne gli effetti. E, come esempi di soluzioni alternative, elenca la costruzione di dissalatori, la selezione di sementi capaci di crescere in ambienti avversi, l’utilizzo razionale dell’acqua piovana, le colture di frutti tropicali in Sicilia (non le pale eoliche, per carità).

LA POSIZIONE DI LUCIO CARACCIOLO DI LIMES

Con qualche mese di ritardo, Susanna Tamaro replica sostanzialmente le conclusioni di un altro intellettuale. Nel numero di novembre 2024 della rivista “Limes” da lui diretta, in un lungo editoriale, Lucio Caracciolo dichiara che “la battaglia contro la CO2 è perduta”. E, come risposta al presunto fallimento della politica di mitigazione, propone l’egoismo di gruppo: adattarsi per salvarsi, rendendo più resilienti le strutture e le infrastrutture del proprio Paese, in tal modo prolungandone la sopravvivenza, pur consapevoli che prima o poi il cambiamento climatico renderà comunque impossibile sopravvivere.

IL RUOLO DEGLI INTELLETTUALI

Nel suo saggio del 1927 “La Trahison des Clercs (“Il tradimento dei chierici”)”, Julien Benda, allora un importante opinion maker, criticò gli intellettuali francesi e tedeschi che tradivano il valore della giustizia e della democrazia, dedicandosi sempre più a “passioni politiche”, per alcuni la lotta di classe, per altri il nazionalismo. Allora gli intellettuali erano un punto di riferimento, in grado di orientare l’opinione pubblica.

Airbus sees Thailand not just as a hub for Aircraft Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) services but as a significant centRE for advanced technology and engineering within the region’s aviation sector.

Stanley pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing aviation market in the world, and Airbus forecasts a demand for about 20,000 new aircraft in the region over the next 20 years, accounting for half of the global aircraft demand. Thailand is identified as one of the largest markets within this growth, he said.

“This year, we expect to deliver a total of 820 aircraft globally, with the majority of orders coming from the Asia-Pacific region,” he said. “In Thailand, Airbus aircraft are operated by Thai Airways International, Bangkok Airways, Thai AirAsia, and Thai VietJet. Soon, Thai Airways will be launching its A321neo aircraft, featuring a new business-class seating configuration by the end of this year.”

Stanley further emphasised that Airbus is committed to supporting Thailand’s aviation industry, contributing to the country's economic development. The aviation sector in Thailand plays a key role in employment, with over 130,000 jobs and contributing over seven per cent to the country’s GDP before the Covid-19 pandemic. Thailand is also recognised as a leader in sustainability in the region.

Additionally, Airbus believes Thailand has the potential to produce more than five million tonnes of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) annually. The country’s agricultural sector, which can provide excellent raw materials for SAF production—such as molasses, rice straw, corn stalks, and animal waste—aligns with Airbus’s commitment to working with the Thai government and SAF producers to promote sustainable aviation fuel production.

To further underscore its commitment to Thailand, Airbus has invested in a new 1,200-square-metre office in the country, which also houses NAVBLUE, Airbus’s digital aviation operations unit. The new office will serve as a testing and verification centre for software solutions before delivery to global airline customers.

Caminho sem volta A última vez que Dr Antonio Martins pisou em Porangatu foi há mais de quatro décadas.
Além do coco, Dr. Antônio viu potencial em plantas nativas do Cerrado, como o babaçu e a macaúba.","A trajetória do médico goiano Antônio Carlos Martins da Cunha de 70 anos começa em Porangatu, Norte de Goiás, onde nasceu, passa por Londres, Áustria e termina – ou melhor, recomeça, com um projeto ambicioso para sua terra natal: transformar o município em um centro de referência na industrialização do Babaçu. O objetivo é produzir biocombustível (conhecido como “querosene verde”) e grafeno, revolucionando a economia local e promovendo o reflorestamento indireto do Cerrado.

Conhecido na Europa como Dr. Antonio Martins, o goiano concedeu uma entrevista exclusiva ao Jornal Opção, diretamente de Viena, capital da Áustria, onde vive com a mulher e os três filhos — todos médicos.

Durante a conversa, ele compartilhou detalhes de sua trajetória desde os 16 anos, quando conquistou uma bolsa para estudar na Inglaterra. Falou sobre sua formação em medicina pediátrica e engenharia de alimentos, sua atuação como empresário e os novos projetos que envolvem sua cidade amada, Porangatu.

“Eu não quero só visitar Porangatu. Eu quero retribuir. É uma responsabilidade com as minhas origens”, afirma Antonio Martins, que vive na Europa há mais de 40 anos. “Agora é a hora de devolver com trabalho e tecnologia.”

Raízes goianas e salto para a Europa

A família Martins tem longa história em Porangatu, pois faz parte da fundação da cidade. O bisavô de Antônio, Eusébio Martins, foi o primeiro prefeito da cidade. “A minha avó era da família Gonçalves da Cruz, muito tradicional na região. Martins se casava com Gonçalves, sempre foi assim.”

As memórias de infância em Porangatu são vívidas. “Mesmo morando em Goiânia para estudar, as férias eram todas lá. Saía de Goiânia às seis da manhã e chegava às dez da noite. Não tinha estrada. Às vezes o ônibus atolava, tinha que levar farofa porque não tinha comida no caminho”, conta, rindo.

Foi em meio a esse cenário que os pais de Antônio o incentivaram a estudar e explorar o mundo. Aos 16 anos, conseguiu uma bolsa para estudar medicina em Londres. “Trabalhava lavando privada à noite para pagar meus cursos. Fiz medicina, iniciei pediatria em Londres e depois vim para a Áustria. Aqui conheci minha esposa, estamos casados há 41 anos.”

Seus três filhos também seguiram a medicina – são radiologista, pneumologista e ortopedista.

Babaçu como ferramenta de transformação

Após a finalização do curso de medicina e a especialização em pediatria e instalado na Áustria, Martins fundou uma clínica, uma empresa e construiu estabilidade financeira. Agora, seu foco é o Babaçu – fruto abundante no norte do Brasil, mas pouco explorado economicamente.

“Quando vi que os árabes estavam investindo na Macaúba, em Minas Gerais para produzir querosene verde, pensei: ‘o Babaçu tem ainda mais potencial’. É aí que quero apostar.”

Com apoio técnico de instituições como o IBGE, Ministério da Agricultura e estudos da Embrapa, Antonio quer implantar em Porangatu uma indústria para transformar o Babaçu em biocombustível sustentável (SAF) e grafeno, material ultrarresistente e estratégico para indústrias de defesa e tecnologia.

Médico se torna referência internacional na produção de água de coco e biocombustível

Dr. Antonio que, além de pediatra, também é engenheiro de alimentos, transformou um projeto acadêmico em um império empresarial baseado na água de coco e aposta agora na produção de querosene verde e grafeno a partir de babaçu.

O médico, cientista e pesquisador, como se define, se destacou no combate à obesidade infantil e transformou um projeto científico em uma empresa que hoje distribui água de coco para 24 países da Europa. A Green Coco Europe, com sede em Nuremberg na Alemanha.

Dr. Antonio Martins, no entanto, ampliou a variedade de produtos derivados do coco e, além da água, passou a comercializar leite de coco, iogurte e cappuccino. Todos os produtos são veganos, ou seja, não contêm leite de origem animal.

Com mais de 35 anos de atuação na pediatria, o Dr. Antônio percebeu em seu consultório que a obesidade infantil crescia de forma alarmante. “A obesidade é um problema social, político e econômico. O número de dias que crianças e adultos perdem no trabalho ou na escola por doenças ligadas ao excesso de peso é imenso”, explica.

Especialista em endocrinologia, ele presidiu a Sociedade Europeia de Endocrinologia Pediátrica e voltou à universidade nos anos 1990 para estudar Engenharia de Alimentos. Durante esse período, descobriu o potencial da água de coco como alimento funcional e saudável — e fez dela o tema de sua tese de doutorado.

O principal desafio? Aumentar a vida útil do produto nas prateleiras. “Se o shelf life (prazo de validade) for curto, o supermercado não compra. Precisávamos chegar a pelo menos um ano de validade”, afirma. Ele conseguiu: desenvolveu e patenteou uma tecnologia de conservação e fundou com a esposa uma pequena empresa para vender água de coco em consultórios médicos. O negócio, no entanto, cresceu vertiginosamente.

Hoje, a empresa é líder de mercado na Europa e está em expansão para os Estados Unidos e Canadá. “Comecei pequeno, mas a demanda cresceu tanto que tive que abrir uma holding na Alemanha e buscar investidores. Hoje, distribuímos para 24 países na Europa e Oriente Médio”, conta.

Apesar de brasileiro, o médico não utiliza mais coco nacional. “O Brasil não atendia à quantidade nem à qualidade necessárias. Hoje, minha matéria-prima vem da Ásia, de fábricas nas Filipinas, Indonésia, Sri Lanka e Índia.”

Mas o aproveitamento do coco não se restringiu à água. Pensando em economia circular, Dr. Antônio Carlos buscou alternativas para o que era descartado como lixo: a fibra e a casca.

Agora, sua nova aposta é o biocombustível sustentável feito a partir dos resíduos do coco e do babaçu: o SAF (sigla em inglês para Sustainable Aviation Fuel), além da produção de grafeno, material valioso na indústria tecnológica e de defesa.

Impacto ambiental e social

O projeto de Martins não pretende apenas industrializar. Ele prevê um processo de recuperação ecológica, especialmente do cerrado. “O Babaçu é nativo. Só precisa não ser destruído. Onde tem um pé, nascem milhões em volta. O problema é que cortam para plantar soja”, explica.

Segundo ele, a iniciativa pode evitar o avanço da desertificação, recuperar nascentes e proteger a fauna. “É o bioma mais rico do Brasil. Tatu, tamanduá, siriema, lobo-guará… estão desaparecendo. O cerrado precisa de equilíbrio. E o Babaçu pode trazer isso.”

Martins destaca ainda que existe uma lei federal que protege as quebradeiras de coco de Babaçu, permitindo acesso ao fruto mesmo em terras privadas, o que reforça o papel social do projeto. “Hoje, o óleo do Babaçu não tem valor agregado. Mas com a industrialização, isso muda. É uma revolução social e ambiental.”

Babaçu é elo entre Cerrado e Amazônia e símbolo de futuro sustentável, diz pesquisador

Para o pesquisador, o Brasil abriga dois ecossistemas fundamentais para o equilíbrio ambiental do planeta: a Floresta Amazônica e o Cerrado. Entre esses dois biomas, ele destaca a existência de uma zona de transição extremamente rica em biodiversidade e com alto potencial para o desenvolvimento sustentável.

“O coco babaçu se destaca como um verdadeiro símbolo de regeneração e equilíbrio ecológico”, afirma Martins.

O Cerrado, segundo o especialista, é o “coração hídrico do Brasil”, por abrigar uma vasta biodiversidade adaptada ao clima seco e alimentar as principais bacias hidrográficas do país. “Infelizmente, mais da metade desse bioma já foi desmatada”, alerta.

É nesse contexto que o babaçu ganha protagonismo. De acordo com Martins, a palmeira nativa tem o poder de fazer a conexão entre os biomas brasileiros. “O babaçu é resistente, regenerador e cresce espontaneamente em áreas de transição. Ele representa uma ponte viva entre a Amazônia e o Cerrado”, explica.

O valor ambiental do babaçu é amplo: “Ele recupera solos degradados, previne a erosão, mantém a umidade e atrai fauna, contribuindo para o reflorestamento natural com espécies nativas.”

Além dos benefícios ecológicos, o babaçu também possui grande importância econômica e social. “A cadeia do babaçu gera renda para comunidades tradicionais e para milhares de mulheres quebradeiras de coco. Ela impulsiona a economia de base florestal, reduz o êxodo rural e promove a inclusão produtiva”, destaca.

Para o pesquisador, fortalecer essa cadeia produtiva é um dos caminhos mais promissores para a sustentabilidade no país. “Precisamos de políticas públicas consistentes e incentivos à bioeconomia, com foco na recuperação de áreas degradadas por meio de espécies nativas.”

Martins defende que preservar a Amazônia e o Cerrado deve ser uma ação conjunta. “O babaçu é o elo vivo entre esses dois biomas e um verdadeiro símbolo de um futuro sustentável. Proteger o babaçu é proteger os corações verdes do Brasil”, conclui.

O modelo de financiamento

Para viabilizar o projeto, Martins busca apoio institucional. “Existem recursos. A União Europeia pode liberar verbas se houver garantias. Tenho cartas de intenção de grandes empresas de defesa interessadas no grafeno. Mas também preciso do apoio político no Brasil”, diz.

Segundo ele, o BNDES e fundos ambientais são fontes possíveis. A proposta é montar uma parceria ampla, com participação de empresários, produtores e governo. “Não é o meu projeto. É o nosso projeto”, reforça.

Caminho sem volta

A última vez que Dr Antonio Martins pisou em Porangatu foi há mais de quatro décadas. Agora, articula com parentes e lideranças políticas locais, como o ex-deputado Carlos Rosenberg e o primo Elilmar Gonçalves – para viabilizar a instalação da indústria. “Estamos unindo forças. Sozinho não dá. É como o monumento do Palácio das Esmeraldas, com várias mãos levantando o mastro.”

Ele acredita que a iniciativa pode transformar Porangatu num polo industrial limpo e sustentável, com geração de empregos e valorização regional. “Porangatu pode ser a nova Arábia Saudita, mas do biocombustível.”

E conclui: “Se eu consegui trazer água de coco para a Europa, por que não vou conseguir isso? Só saio desse planeta depois de deixar esse projeto de pé”, afirma.

O salto para o biocombustível e o grafeno

Há cerca de 10 anos, Dr. Antonio Martins passou a investir na pesquisa de derivados do coco para produção de combustíveis sustentáveis. Com apoio do Instituto SENAI de Inovação (Cimatec), em Salvador, passou a desenvolver SAF — querosene verde para aviação.

“Todos os países estão criando legislações para reduzir as emissões de carbono. O Brasil, por exemplo, já exige que 1% do combustível de aviação seja SAF, aumentando a cada ano. Isso cria uma demanda bilionária”, explica.

Além do coco, Dr. Antônio viu potencial em plantas nativas do Cerrado, como o babaçu e a macaúba. “O babaçu é uma planta ancestral, com papel fundamental na conservação hídrica do Cerrado e da Amazônia. Sua casca dura pode ser carbonizada e transformada em grafite e, depois, em grafeno.”

O grafeno, destaca, é o material mais resistente do planeta e está presente em tecnologias de ponta — de telas sensíveis ao toque a componentes de drones e mísseis. “A Europa está se rearmando por causa da guerra na Ucrânia. A demanda por grafeno vai explodir.

Porangatu no centro da nova fase

O médico-empresário planeja agora um projeto de impacto ambiental, econômico e social: transformar sua cidade natal em polo de produção de biocombustíveis e grafeno. “Porangatu está no coração do Cerrado. A região é estratégica para o plantio de babaçu e macaúba, e pode se tornar referência mundial em energia limpa.”

Ele já abriu uma empresa no Brasil em parceria com um investidor do Ceará e mantém diálogo com grupos internacionais interessados em financiar a recuperação do Cerrado por meio de cadeias produtivas sustentáveis. “Só plantar árvores na Amazônia não basta. Sem o Cerrado, a floresta não sobrevive. Precisamos recuperar o bioma e dar valor econômico às plantas nativas”, defende.

A visão de Dr. Antônio Carlos vai além do lucro. Ele acredita que a sustentabilidade é o caminho para transformar realidades locais e enfrentar desafios globais. “O produto mais valioso hoje é a energia. E temos, aqui no Brasil, condições únicas para produzi-la de forma limpa, eficiente e sustentável.”

Com um pé na ciência e outro nos negócios, o médico de Porangatu se tornou uma ponte entre o conhecimento acadêmico e soluções de mercado que podem ajudar a frear as mudanças climáticas e impulsionar o desenvolvimento econômico verde.

Grafeno: o material do futuro que pode revolucionar a indústria e a tecnologia

Descoberto em 2004 pelos cientistas Andrei Geim e Konstantin Novoselov, o grafeno é apontado como um dos materiais mais promissores da ciência moderna. Composto por uma camada única de átomos de carbono organizados em estrutura hexagonal, ele é considerado o material mais leve e resistente já conhecido — e ainda se destaca pela alta condutividade elétrica e térmica.

A relevância da descoberta foi reconhecida com o Prêmio Nobel de Física em 2010. Desde então, o grafeno vem atraindo atenção global por seu potencial em diversas áreas. Com o objetivo de acelerar a pesquisa e aplicação comercial desse material, a União Europeia criou o projeto internacional “Graphene Flagship”, que investe em inovações tecnológicas baseadas nessa estrutura incomum.

Aplicações que já despontam

As possíveis aplicações do grafeno são amplas e impactam desde a indústria até o setor de saúde. Entre os usos com maior potencial, estão:

Modernização de redes elétricas;

Fontes de luz mais eficientes energeticamente;

Novos semicondutores para a chamada spintrônica;

Revestimentos anticorrosivos mais duráveis;

Sistemas de purificação e dessalinização da água;

Comunicação por meio de sistemas optoeletrônicos.

A pesquisa também avança para o uso do grafeno em estruturas de veículos, como carros, aviões e navios, com o objetivo de torná-los mais leves e resistentes. Em combinação com outros materiais, como borracha, o grafeno pode originar compostos condutores de calor, como uma borracha termicamente condutiva. Já foram desenvolvidas inclusive folhas de “papel de grafeno”, extremamente fortes e capazes de conduzir eletricidade.

Propriedades únicas

O grafeno possui uma combinação rara de características que o tornam objeto de estudo intensivo:

Mecânicas: mais resistente que o aço e altamente flexível;

Elétricas: excelente condutor de eletricidade, ideal para eletrônicos;

Térmicas: dissipa calor mais rápido que qualquer outro material conhecido;

Químicas: é quimicamente estável, com baixa reatividade.

Presente e futuro da aplicação

Hoje, o grafeno já começa a ser incorporado em protótipos de telas sensíveis ao toque, baterias, sensores biomédicos, materiais de construção e até mesmo na indústria da moda. Na saúde, promete avanços em próteses, tratamento de câncer e liberação controlada de medicamentos. No setor energético, é estudado para o desenvolvimento de supercondensadores e painéis solares mais eficientes.

Apesar de suas vantagens, a produção em larga escala do grafeno ainda enfrenta desafios, principalmente relacionados ao custo e à complexidade para manter a qualidade do material.

Potencial revolucionário

Pesquisadores acreditam que o grafeno pode causar uma revolução comparável à do silício nos anos 1950. Com sua combinação de leveza, resistência e condutividade, o material é visto como peça-chave para o avanço de diversas tecnologias nos próximos anos.

Grafeno avança na biomedicina com aplicações em diagnóstico, terapias e combate a infecções

O grafeno tem se destacado como uma promissora inovação na área da biomedicina, com aplicações tanto diagnósticas quanto terapêuticas. Na forma de óxido, o material apresenta alta biocompatibilidade e solubilidade, facilitando a administração precisa de medicamentos, como anti-inflamatórios e agentes anticancerígenos.

Sua excelente condutividade térmica permite o uso em tratamentos contra o câncer, com a destruição de tumores por meio de termolesão — técnica que utiliza calor para reduzir dores e tratar tecidos lesionados. Já estão em desenvolvimento roupas e acessórios médicos aquecidos com o material.

Além disso, folhas de grafeno funcionam como biossensores em dispositivos portáteis capazes de detectar doenças como câncer, epilepsia e Parkinson. Uma sonda desenvolvida por pesquisadores poloneses promete revolucionar exames de ECG, ao medir sinais diretamente do coração.

O grafeno também se mostra eficaz no combate a infecções, graças às suas propriedades antibacterianas, e pode ser base para novos desinfetantes e curativos. Na engenharia de tecidos, andaimes de grafeno têm se mostrado altamente resistentes e capazes de acelerar a regeneração celular e a diferenciação de células-tronco.

Novo, mas promissor

Você já imaginou recarregar seu smartphone em apenas 15 minutos e só precisar conectá-lo à tomada uma semana depois? Ou ainda poder dobrar, amassar e contorcer seu aparelho telefônico sem comprometer seu funcionamento? Pois é, tudo isso pode se tornar realidade em alguns anos, graças ao grafeno.

A descoberta ainda é recente, o que explica por que muitas pessoas ainda não conhecem esse material e seus benefícios. No entanto, em breve ele estará presente em nossos tablets, smartphones e outros dispositivos do dia a dia. A era do grafeno está apenas começando.

Pipeline bill threatens infrastructure and Iowa’s economy

Veto the anti-pipeline bill. Let’s get it right next year.

Iowa’s ethanol industry stands at a crossroads. For decades, we’ve fueled America’s cars with homegrown energy. But as electric vehicle sales rise — 1.3 million in 2024 alone, now nearly 10% of new cars — we must evolve to stay competitive.

Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — the biggest opportunity Iowa agriculture has seen in decades. Planes won’t run on batteries anytime soon, and SAF needs low-carbon, liquid fuel. That’s a lane Iowa ethanol can dominate, but only if we have the infrastructure to compete.

Carbon capture unlocks that path. By storing CO2 emissions from ethanol plants, we lower the carbon intensity of ethanol and qualify for the booming SAF market — a market projected to demand billions of gallons annually. That means stronger corn demand, more stability for farmers, and long-term investment in Iowa’s future.

This isn’t theoretical. More than 1,320 Iowans have voluntarily signed easements with Summit Carbon Solutions to make this future real. In some counties, voluntary participation is 70%, 80%, even 90%. These are farmers and landowners — people who understand exactly what’s at stake and are choosing to lead.

That’s what makes the legislation passed by the Iowa House and Senate so disappointing. It doesn’t get the job done. It doesn’t solve the problem. And it sets back the very industry it claims to support.

Today I am asking Gov. Kim Reynolds to veto this bill.

Not because she supports any one company, but because she supports Iowa’s largest industry — agriculture — and one of its most important products — ethanol. She knows what’s at stake for our state, and for the 42 ethanol plants already producing 4.6 billion gallons annually. Without access to SAF markets, we’re cutting off their future.

This bill is a step backward. It adds confusion, weakens our competitive edge, and threatens the kind of private investment Iowa needs to grow. And the unintended consequences are real. This bill doesn’t just apply to carbon pipelines — it affects all hazardous liquid infrastructure. If we start blocking one type of project, what’s next? Today it’s ethanol infrastructure — tomorrow it could be broadband, transmission lines, or even rural water systems. That’s a slippery slope Iowa can’t afford.

Let’s come back next year and do it the right way. Let’s bring agriculture, ethanol producers, landowners, and lawmakers to the table and find a real solution that balances property rights with progress. That protects our rural communities while paving the way for market access and long-term growth.

The sky’s the limit for Iowa — but only if we clear the runway. Governor Reynolds, veto this bill.

Bill Couser, Nevada

Pipeline bill threatens infrastructure and Iowa’s economy

House File 639, passed late in the 2025 session, would spell disaster for critical oil and gas pipelines and infrastructure development across Iowa.

Agriculture — the state’s top industry — is vitally dependent on affordable, reliable energy delivered by pipeline. Iowa has few natural gas or oil resources and no refineries. Yet, the natural gas and oil industry drives much of the economy in the state, supporting 117,000 jobs and nearly $10 billion in economic output.

More than 42,000 miles of pipelines lie beneath Iowa’s rich soil, quietly and safely delivering energy to working families, ag producers, and many other sectors. Certainty and stability are essential to maintain this critical infrastructure network.

House File 639 would undermine that. It creates sweeping intervenor rights, allowing Iowans with no direct stake to intervene and delay or derail infrastructure projects. This would inject immense uncertainty into a process that depends on predictability, threatening future investment.

Worse, the bill imposes unprecedented and unfeasible insurance mandates on pipeline developers. Companies must pay for coverage for residents who can’t get insurance or whose premiums go up before a permit is even issued. Developers have no reliable way to confirm who was affected, by how much, or even whether their project was behind the increase. And trying to discern these details raises serious privacy concerns.

House File 639 is poorly written, imposes impossible standards, and threatens Iowa’s infrastructure and economic future.

For these reasons and many more, Gov. Kim Reynolds must veto House File 639.

Once operational in 2027, the facility is expected to become the world’s largest producer of eFuels, generating 23,000 tonnes—or 7.6 million gallons—of sustainable aviation fuel and other low-emission fuel products annually, reports Mrt.

These fuels will be supplied to major customers, including American Airlines and IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Aer Lingus.

eFuels are synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels, made from waste carbon dioxide and renewable energy. They are chemically identical to traditional fuels but with a lower carbon footprint. “We use waste CO2 as a key input and have a strong partnership with Kinetik Holdings to make that happen,” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO of Infinium.

In addition to supporting clean fuel production, Project Roadrunner offers new revenue opportunities for oil and gas partners by transforming CO2 into a valuable product.

Schuetzle noted that Infinium has experience building in West Texas, calling the region’s labor force strong and local officials supportive. The project is expected to create a significant number of construction and permanent jobs in areas like operations, maintenance, logistics, and field management.

The plant will be powered by 150 megawatts of new wind energy secured through a long-term agreement with a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. It will also be connected to the local power grid, allowing for continuous 24/7 operations.

Infinium has selected Electric Hydrogen to supply the project’s 100-megawatt hydrogen production system, called HYPRPlant. The system will generate green hydrogen to help make synthetic aviation fuel and support future hydrogen-related projects.

“This is our first project with Infinium and an important step forward for our operations in Texas,” said Raffi Garabedian, CEO of Electric Hydrogen. “We build our equipment in Massachusetts and assemble it in Texas, which keeps us close to projects like Roadrunner while supporting local industries.”

He added that the contract demonstrates the growing ability of U.S. technology to produce clean hydrogen at an industrial scale for sectors such as aviation, trucking, and shipping.

Most of the fuel produced at the new facility will be exported, according to Schuetzle. “We see this following a similar path to liquefied natural gas—an abundant U.S. energy resource that powers both domestic needs and global demand,” he said.

Along with aviation fuel, Project Roadrunner will produce eDiesel, which is used by companies like Amazon in long-haul trucking, and eNaphtha, which will be sent to Europe for use in plastics manufacturing.

This is Infinium’s second facility in Texas. In 2023, the company became the first in the world to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels from its Corpus Christi-based Project Pathfinder.

KUCHING, May 24: Sarawak is looking to set up a central body to collect palm oil waste from all 85 mills across the State to make sure there’s enough volume to support downstream industries like biofuel and animal feed.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said he will discuss with Sarawak Minister for Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development Dato Sri Dr Stephen Rundi Utom and Sarawak Attorney-General Dato Sri Saferi Ali to review Sarawak’s laws on the matter.

“Because when it comes to waste like this, if everyone handles it in small separate groups, there is no economy of scale.

“Some people are not willing to contribute their waste. So, we have to look into the legal aspect,” he said when speaking during the launch of Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority’s (SALCRA) Kernel Crushing Plant held at Lubok Antu Palm Oil Mill, broadcast live by Sarawak Public Communication Unit (UKAS) on Facebook today.

Abang Johari further said the Sarawak government may need to make it mandatory—a combined effort between the private sector and the government—to establish a central entity to collect all this waste from the 85 mills.

“That way, we can ensure sufficient volume. When we have volume, we achieve economy of scale, and this allows us to produce the downstream products in a more sustainable way,” he added.

According to him, many mills only produce two or three tonnes of waste each—too little to be useful.

“But if we combine them all, we can get 100 tonnes. That’s where it becomes efficient,” he pointed out.

Earlier in his speech, Abang Johari explained how Sarawak aims to turn palm oil waste into valuable products that benefit smallholders and the State’s economy.

The first key product is animal feed made from the by-products of crushed palm kernels. This feed can be used for livestock such as goats, cattle, and chickens. The Premier highlighted that by integrating livestock farming with oil palm plantations, smallholders can increase their income streams—producing both palm oil and animal products on the same land.

The second product is biofuel, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from biomass derived from palm oil waste. This biofuel can power aircraft, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and supporting Sarawak’s goal of greener energy.

The third downstream product is hydrogen gas, which can be extracted during the processing of palm oil waste. Hydrogen has growing potential as a clean energy source for transportation and electricity generation, including use in Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART) public transportation.

By developing these industries, Sarawak aims to create a circular economy where waste is converted into valuable products—increasing sustainability and providing new income streams for local communities involved in palm oil farming.

Η επιλογή των διυλιστηρίων να επενδύσουν στα βιώσιμα αεροπορικά καύσιμα δεν είναι ούτε συγκυριακή ούτε επικοινωνιακή. Αντίθετα, αποτελεί απάντηση σε μια τριπλή πρόκληση. Πρώτον, οι υποχρεώσεις που απορρέουν από τον κανονισμό ReFuelEU καθιστούν τη συμμετοχή σε αυτή τη νέα αγορά αναπόφευκτη για όποιον θέλει να διατηρήσει μερίδιο σε κλάδους υψηλής κινητικότητας όπως η αεροπλοΐα. Δεύτερον, το SAF προσφέρει ένα από τα ελάχιστα σενάρια πραγματικής απανθρακοποίησης σε τομείς που δεν μπορούν να ηλεκτροδοτηθούν, γεγονός που το καθιστά στρατηγικό καύσιμο για τη νέα εποχή. Και τρίτον, τα διυλιστήρια αναζητούν νέα προϊόντα υψηλής προστιθέμενης αξίας, καθώς η ζήτηση για συμβατικά ορυκτά καύσιμα προβλέπεται να μειωθεί σταδιακά εντός της επόμενης εικοσαετίας. Η επένδυση στο SAF, υπό αυτή την έννοια, λειτουργεί ως αναβάθμιση της ίδιας της παραγωγικής τους ταυτότητας. Σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες, η αγορά δεν ζητεί μόνο συμμόρφωση, αλλά τεχνολογική επάρκεια, επενδυτική σιγουριά και προσβάσιμη πρώτη ύλη, προκειμένου τα βιώσιμα αεροπορικά καύσιμα να περάσουν από τη θεωρία στην πράξη.

Το σημείο εκκίνησης αυτής της μετάβασης εντοπίζεται σε μια τεχνολογία που μέχρι πρότινος λειτουργούσε περιφερειακά ως προς τον στρατηγικό σχεδιασμό: το βιοντίζελ. Στην Ελλάδα, η υποχρεωτική πρόσμιξη 7% FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) στο πετρέλαιο κίνησης παραμένει βασική υποχρέωση συμμόρφωσης με την ευρωπαϊκή οδηγία RED II. Από αυτή τη βάση εκκινεί η μετάβαση προς τα προηγμένα βιοκαύσιμα, με πρώτο σταθμό το SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Ο κανονισμός ReFuelEU Aviation της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης εισάγει νέο πλαίσιο υποχρεωτικής ενσωμάτωσης SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα, ξεκινώντας από 2% το 2025 και φθάνοντας σταδιακά στο 70% έως το 2050. Το SAF είναι jet fuel που παράγεται από ανακυκλωμένα έλαια, λίπη ή οργανικά απόβλητα και μπορεί να μειώσει τις εκπομπές έως και κατά 80%, χωρίς να απαιτείται τροποποίηση στους κινητήρες των αεροσκαφών.

Ήδη από το 2021, η Helleniq Energy συμμετείχε σε πτήσεις της Aegean με καύσιμο που περιείχε SAF, σε πιλοτική εφαρμογή πριν ακόμη τεθεί σε ισχύ η σχετική υποχρέωση. Η εμπειρία αυτή λειτούργησε ως δοκιμή αντοχής για το πιστοποιητικό εφοδιαστικής αλυσίδας, αλλά και για την τεχνική αξιοπιστία του καυσίμου. Σήμερα, προετοιμάζει την κατασκευή της πρώτης πλήρους μονάδας SAF στην Ελλάδα, στην εγκατάσταση της Ελευσίνας, με προγραμματισμένη δυναμικότητα 150 κιλών/ώρα. Η μονάδα θα βασιστεί σε πρώτες ύλες όπως τα υπολείμματα τροφών, τα τηγανόλαδα και τα ζωικά λίπη, ακολουθώντας το ευρωπαϊκό μοντέλο βιωσιμότητας που αποκλείει προϊόντα που ενδέχεται να επιβαρύνουν την τροφική αλυσίδα.

Η στρατηγική δεν εξαντλείται στην αεροπορία. Στη Θεσσαλονίκη, το Green Hub North Project φιλοδοξεί να εξελιχθεί σε κόμβο παραγωγής υγρών καυσίμων χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ. Εκεί αναπτύσσονται υποδομές για την παραγωγή HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και φωτοβολταϊκά. Η συν-επεξεργασία πρώτων υλών φυτικής προέλευσης στις υπάρχουσες μονάδες αποθείωσης, επιτρέπει την παραγωγή «πράσινου ντίζελ» χωρίς μεταβολές στον τελικό χρήστη ή στο σύστημα διανομής.

BP's decision raises questions about the commitment of major energy corporations to transitioning away from polluting, dirty energy sources.
The reason given was ""weaker-than-anticipated growth in the market"" for these cleaner alternatives.
Halting clean energy plans comes on the heels of a more strategic overhaul BP announced in February.
If major players don't actively invest in and champion the growth of cleaner alternatives, there won't be an economy or environment.","Oil giant BP has ceased a project to produce ""clean jet fuel"" at its Castellon refinery in Spain. The move signals a broader concern and shift in the company's approach to cleaner energy initiatives. BP's decision raises questions about the commitment of major energy corporations to transitioning away from polluting, dirty energy sources.

What's happening?

According to a Bloomberg News report cited by Reuters, BP paused its investment in producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the Spanish facility. The reason given was ""weaker-than-anticipated growth in the market"" for these cleaner alternatives.

Halting clean energy plans comes on the heels of a more strategic overhaul BP announced in February. The company revealed plans to increase its investments in oil and gas production while slashing spending on renewable energy projects by over $5 billion annually.

Why is BP's backpedaling on clean energy important?

This pivot from a major global energy player like BP is a significant blow to fighting planet-overheating pollution. SAF is considered a crucial tool for reducing the environmental impact of air travel. Moreover, aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

Slowing or ending investments in cleaner alternatives, while boosting oil and gas operations, denies the urgent need to transition to less polluting energy sources.

BP CEO Murray Auchincloss stated that the energy transition ""has not proceeded at the pace we would have thought,"" citing strong ongoing demand for oil and gas, per Reuters. His perspective might reflect current market dynamics.

Being economical instead of ecological can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If major players don't actively invest in and champion the growth of cleaner alternatives, there won't be an economy or environment.

The world needs to turn away from dirty fuels to avoid the worst consequences of an overheating planet. Extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and threats to global food security will occur otherwise. Relying on oil and gas without fostering alternatives delays this vital transition.

What's being done about corporate clean energy?

Despite these setbacks, the broader push for cleaner energy continues globally. Governments are implementing policies to encourage the production and adoption of sustainable fuels and renewable energy. Technological innovations — battery storage, green hydrogen, and SAF production — are advancing, making these options increasingly viable.

Consumers also play a role by supporting companies genuinely committed to sustainability. Both are advocating for stronger climate policies that reduce their carbon footprints. Conscious choices like sustainable travel, energy-efficient homes, or renewable energy projects all work toward this common goal.

Staying informed about corporate actions, like understanding greenwashing tactics, empowers individuals to hold companies accountable. While corporate strategies can result in poor decisions, the collective demand for a cleaner future remains a powerful catalyst for the right change.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BP-sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-rec8EtaVAw3YJbUIh.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 14:56:40.910719

Η κριτική στην Ε.Ε.
Πηγές της αγοράς εκφράζουν προβληματισμούς στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι, αναφέροντας χαρακτηριστικά ότι «η Ε.Ε.","Σε «σήμα κατατεθέν» της εσωτερικής αγοράς αναδεικνύονται τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα, σε συνέχεια της αυξανόμενης κίνησης του τουρισμού, με τα νούμερα να δείχνουν αυξητική τάση χρόνο με τον χρόνο.

Ενδεικτικά, πηγές της αγοράς αναφέρουν ότι η ζήτηση αεροπορικών καυσίμων έχει επανακάμψει και ξεπεράσει τα προ πανδημίας επίπεδα, με τη Helleniq Energy, επί παραδείγματι, να μετρά περισσότερες πωλήσεις στην εσωτερική αγορά έναντι των εξαγωγών.

Υπενθυμίζεται ότι, από 1ης Ιανουαρίου 2025, βρίσκεται σε ισχύ ευρωπαϊκός κανονισμός, σύμφωνα με τον οποίο τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα θα πρέπει να εμπεριέχουν 2% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ήτοι στοιχεία βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων. Σημειώνεται ότι η χρήση βιοκαυσίμων δεν αφορά χρήση τους κατά 100%, παρά μόνο συνδυαστικά με τα κανονικά καύσιμα.

Υπό το πρίσμα αυτό και στο πλαίσιο απανθρακοποίησης των μεταφορών, η Κομισιόν έχει υιοθετήσει μια συγκεκριμένη στοχοθεσία στην πορεία προς το 2050, με αυξανόμενους στόχους πρόσμιξης ανά πενταετία, ξεκινώντας από το 2% το 2025. Ειδικότερα, ο κανονισμός ReFuelEU Aviation προβλέπει υποχρεωτική ενσωμάτωση SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα με 2% φέτος και ακολούθως 6% το 2030, 20% το 2035, 34% το 2040, 42% το 2045 και 70% το 2050.

Ταυτόχρονα, οι στόχοι του ΕΣΕΚ για το SAF ανεβάζουν το μερίδιο από 1,0% το 2025 σε 41,9% το 2040, με προβλέψεις να δείχνουν εκρηκτική αύξηση της χρήσης ανανεώσιμων καυσίμων μη βιολογικής προέλευσης. Ο τομέας των αερομεταφορών είναι υπεύθυνος για το 2,5% περίπου των παγκόσμιων εκπομπών CO2 και το μερίδιο αυτό αναμένεται να αυξηθεί, καθώς αυξάνεται η ζήτηση για τα αεροπορικά ταξίδια. Ως γνωστόν, η Ε.Ε. έχει θέσει στόχο για μείωση των εκπομπών κατά 55% μέχρι το 2030 (Fit for 55 Package) και, στο πλαίσιο αυτό, προχωρά το σχέδιο αξιοποίησης SAF στις αεροπορικές μεταφορές. Ως SAF χαρακτηρίζονται αεροπορικά καύσιμα τα οποία είναι:

Συνθετικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα από ανανεώσιμο υδρογόνο και δεσμευμένο άνθρακα

Προηγμένα βιοκαύσιμα από απόβλητα και υπολείμματα κυρίως

Βιοκαύσιμα που παράγονται από έλαια και λίπη

Ανακυκλωμένα συμβατικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα. Σύμφωνα με ειδικούς της αγοράς, η αξιοποίηση SAF στις αερομεταφορές έχει δυνατότητα να μειώσει τις εκπομπές CO2 έως και 80%. Στην περίπτωση της Ελλάδας εφαρμόζεται ήδη σε πτήσεις της Aegean Airlines σε συνεργασία με την Helleniq Energy.

Χρειάζεται, βέβαια, να σημειωθεί ότι η εν λόγω δραστηριότητα, όπως επισημαίνουν πηγές της αγοράς με γνώση του θέματος, αν και σε πρωτόλειο επίπεδο ωρίμανσης ακόμη, τείνει να αποτελέσει εκ των βασικών δραστηριοτήτων για τα διυλιστήρια της Ευρώπης και δη της Ελλάδας, δεδομένης της πυκνότητας των αερομεταφορών.

Η κριτική στην Ε.Ε. Μια δεύτερη παράμετρος που θα κρίνει την ταχύτητα ανάπτυξης του κλάδου, καθώς και την εφικτότητα των στόχων που έχουν τεθεί σε ευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο, αφορά την πολιτική και θεσμική υποστήριξη που θα τύχει η εν λόγω δραστηριότητα.

Πηγές της αγοράς εκφράζουν προβληματισμούς στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι, αναφέροντας χαρακτηριστικά ότι «η Ε.Ε. επιδίδεται σταθερά στην αυστηροποίηση των κριτηρίων για τον ορισμό των βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων, όταν στην αντίπερα όχθη, στις ΗΠΑ, τα πράγματα εξελίσσονται πιο συντεταγμένα για την ωρίμανση του κλάδου».

Επένδυση στην Ελευσίνα

Whether it is mood lighting, in-flight entertainment, or power ports for personal devices, aircraft manufacturers ensure sufficient power is generated for onboard systems. This shift has significantly increased the demand for onboard electrical power throughout the cabin.

The magnitude of power consumption onboard aircraft primarily depends on the size of the aircraft (including cabin), the number of passengers, and the phase of flight. The onboard generators must produce sufficient power to facilitate all aircraft occupants during the flight.

Several cabin systems that run on electrical power, such as the environmental control system, lighting system, etc., are shared across the cabin. However, the power required for inflight entertainment systems, reading lights, and power ports depends on the usage. The electrical power requirement on smaller, narrowbody aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 family, ranges between 20 kW and 390 kW.

However, larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 777-300ER, require anywhere between 110 kW and 720 kW, depending on the occupancy rate and phase of flight. The Airbus A380, the world's largest commercial jet, requires between 180 kW and 1,250 kW. This article highlights power requirements for the most common cabin systems, including lighting, in-flight entertainment, and power ports for personal devices.

Electrical Power Requirements of a Boeing 777-300ER

The Boeing 777-300ER is a long-range widebody aircraft with a typical seating for 400 passengers in two classes. While the type has an exit limit of 550 passengers, airlines generally configure their planes to accommodate anywhere between 340 and 420 passengers. With a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 775,000 lb (351,533 kg), the aircraft can fly a range of 7,370 NM (13,649 km; 8,480 miles).

Two GE Aerospace GE90-115B turbofan engines power the aircraft, each generating up to 115,300 lbf (513 kM) thrust at takeoff. Since its launch, it has become a primary driver of the type's sales for the manufacturer and an economical long-haul workhorse for airlines. According to Boeing:

""The Boeing 777's unique combination of superior range, outstanding fuel efficiency, and passenger-preferred comfort has created long-range success for carriers around the world. And the 777-300ER now gives operators a perfect opportunity to extend that success. Recent upgrades further reduce costs and boost revenue, and the 777's flying experience is still number one with passengers. A more profitable fleet and more satisfied passengers. That's a better way to fly.""

The 777-300ER, like most other planes, features a range of systems that require electrical power. While this article covers only a handful of electrical systems, a comprehensive list of systems and equipment requiring electrical power is shown here.

On-seat Power Requirements of a Boeing 777-300ER

While some cabin systems require constant power regardless of the phase of flight or occupancy, on-seat power is based on occupancy and usage. On-seat systems typically include in-flight entertainment (IFE), personal reading lights, and power ports for personal devices.

Theoretically, demands for these systems vary from 50 W to 110 W per passenger, depending on the type of system and usage. Some passengers tend to use their personal devices and charge them onboard, while others spend more time using the in-flight IFE. According to a study published in the Aerospace Journal, researchers conducted passenger surveys and airline statistics to examine the media preferences of passengers during their flights. The study concluded,

""The findings indicated that 20% of respondents reported traveling for business purposes. For this group, it was assumed in the study that they would use their laptops during the flight and recharge them on board. The rest of the passengers spent 44% of the flight time using IFE and 46% using personal electronic devices (PEDs). In flight, 10% of passengers switched between IFE and PEDs. The study also presumed that passengers utilizing PEDs would charge them during the flight.""

As a general rule of thumb, laptops consume approximately 70 W, whereas personal handheld devices, including tablets, consume approximately 15 W. An IFE screen integrated into the back of the seats onboard Boeing 777-300ERs draws anywhere between 15 W and 20 W throughout the flight.

A large aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER, with its typical seating capacity, cabin length, and maximum takeoff weight, requires approximately 720 kW of electrical power for systems. Notably, taxi-out (before departure) and taxi-in (after landing) phases have the lowest electricity requirement, at 425 kW, whereas cruise has the highest, with 720 kW. Electricity power consumption during each phase of flight of a Boeing 777-300ER is shown here.

Advantages of Calculating Electric Power Requirements For Commercial Aircraft

Research indicates that global aviation is responsible for nearly 2.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions in the environment. This situation is only getting worse as global air traffic continues to grow. As such, estimating aircraft electrical power requirements allows aircraft manufacturers and aviation researchers to find alternative ways to source the required amount of energy for aircraft systems.

Electrical generators provide power produced through conventional engines, requiring fossil fuels that result in carbon emissions. Engine-driven generators are driven by the gearbox and the high-pressure spool of the engine. To achieve net-zero carbon emissions, hydrogen fuel cells are being used to curb the environmental impact. The technology uses electrochemical energy converters to convert chemical energy into electrical energy without emitting noise or other pollutants into the environment.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/main-image-16_9-52.png,N,,2025-05-24 13:56:12.552006

Αλλωστε, η υποχρεωτική ενσωμάτωση SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα ακολουθεί εκθετική τροχιά και σύμφωνα με το κανονισμό ReFuelEU Aviation της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης, το 2035 πρέπει να φτάσει στο 20%, το 2040 στο 34%, το 2045 στο 42% και το 2050 στο 70%.

Στη περίπτωση της Helleniq Energy, ο όμιλος εξετάζει τη δημιουργία στο διυλιστήριο του Ασπροπύργου μονάδας για πράσινα αεροπορικά καύσιμα με παραγωγή 150.000 τόνων ετησίως, ποσότητα που υπερβαίνει τις ανάγκες της ελληνικής αγοράς.

Στη πράξη, πρόκειται για επένδυση και με εξαγωγικό προσανατολισμό προς άλλες ευρωπαϊκές χώρες και έρχεται σε συνέχεια του πιλοτικού έργου με το οποίο η ΕΚΟ προμηθεύει ήδη εδώ και μια τριετία με SAF την Aegean στο αεροδρόμιο «Μακεδονία». Το καύσιμο προέρχονταν αρχικά από τη φιλανδική εταιρεία Neste που έχει εργοστάσια στο Ρότερνταμ και τη Σιγκαπούρη, αλλά ο ελληνικός όμιλος συνεργάζεται πλέον με ολοένα και περισσότερους προμηθευτές.

Στόχος για green hub στα καύσιμα

Κοιτάζοντας τη μεγάλη εικόνα, τα νέας γενιάς αεροπορικά καύσιμα αποτελούν ένα κομμάτι μόνο από την προσπάθεια της Helleniq Energy να εξελιχθεί σε όμιλο παραγωγής πετρελαιοειδών χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιοαιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ.

Στον Ασπρόπυργο έχει ήδη ολοκληρωθεί μια επένδυση σε βιοαιθέρες που παράγει 160.000 τόνους το χρόνο, ωστόσο το πλέον μεγαλόπνοο project αφορά τη μετατροπή του διυλιστηρίου της Θεσσαλονίκης σε πράσινο.

Σε αυτό δρομολογείται η δημιουργία ενός hub καθαρής ενέργειας, που θα παράγει green hydrogen, αμμωνία και ανακυκλωμένα πλαστικά, ενώ είναι έτοιμη να ξεκινήσει η παραγωγή 45.000 τόνων ετησίως πράσινου ντίζελ. Το συγκεκριμένο προϊόν θα προέρχεται από τη κοινή κατεργασία τηγανόλαδων και ορυκτού ντίζελ.

Στην αγορά των πράσινων καυσίμων κινείται δυναμικά και η Motor Oil που έχει εντάξει στο στρατηγικό της σχεδιασμό την παραγωγή τόσο προηγμένων βιοκαυσίμων (biofuels) όσο και συνθετικών καυσίμων (e-fuels).

Εδώ έχουν τη σημασία τους και οι συνέργειες μέσω της πλατφόρμας της Elin Verde που εξαγόρασε το 2022 με αντικείμενο την παραγωγή και εμπορία βιοκαυσίμων, διαθέτοντας μεταξύ άλλων εργοστάσιο παραγωγής βιοντίζελ στη ΒΙ.ΠΕ Βόλου αλλά και την «Πράσινο Λάδι» που δραστηριοποιείται στη συλλογή και εμπορία χρησιμοποιημένων μαγειρικών ελαίων και ζωικών λιπών (που αποτελούν την πρώτη ύλη για τα βιοκαύσιμα).

Σχήμα στήριξης και πρώτες ύλες

Το πανευρωπαϊκό, ωστόσο, παιχνίδι των νέας γενιάς καυσίμων όπως το SAF, παρ’ ότι η τεχνολογία είναι ώριμη και πιστοποιημένη, απαιτεί μεγάλους όγκους πρώτης ύλης με τις διαθέσιμες ποσότητες τηγανόλαδων, ζωικών λιπών και άλλων αποβλήτων να μην επαρκούν για να καλύψουν τους τεράστιους όγκους που απαιτούνται για την επίτευξη των στόχων του ReFuelEU Aviation.

Δίχως τη ταχεία ανάπτυξη νέων μονάδων επεξεργασίας και χωρίς τη δημιουργία ενός δικτύου συλλογής και προεπεξεργασίας αποβλήτων σε όλη τη χώρα, το στοίχημα δεν πρόκειται να κερδηθεί.

Το ίδιο ισχύει και για την ανάγκη παροχής κινήτρων στους δύο μεγάλους διυλιστηριακούς ομίλους προκειμένου να ενθαρρυνθεί η παραγωγή βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων χαμηλού ανθρακικού αποτυπώματος, η ζήτηση για τα οποία θα αυξάνεται όλο και περισσότερο από τις αερομεταφορές.

Η προηγούμενη πολιτική ηγεσία του ΥΠΕΝ είχε προκοινοποιήσει στην Κομισιόν πρόταση για σχήμα στήριξης της παραγωγής SAF στην Ελλάδα, καθώς η έγκριση της Γενικής Επιτροπής Ανταγωνισμού της EE (DG COMP) αποτελεί προαπαιτούμενο για να υπάρξει κρατική επιδότηση.

Το σκεπτικό ήταν ότι οι πόροι θα προέλθουν από το Ταμείο Εκσυγχρονισμού της ΕΕ, ένα νέο εργαλείο για τη στήριξη δράσεων απανθρακοποίησης που χρηματοδοτείται από τα έσοδα του Συστήματος Εμπορίας Δικαιωμάτων Εκπομπών Ρύπων, με τον συνολικό «κουμπαρά» για την Ελλάδα να εκτιμάται σε 1,32 δισ. ευρώ.

Στη προκειμένη περίπτωση, το σχέδιο αφορούσε τις κεφαλαιουχικές δαπάνες (capex) για την δημιουργία των μονάδων παραγωγής, καθώς οι πόροι δεν επαρκούν για να καλύψουν τη διαφορά του κόστους μεταξύ των συμβατικών ορυκτών καυσίμων και των ακριβών συνθετικών καυσίμων, κάτι που συνιστά πρόκληση για ολόκληρη την εφοδιαστική αλυσίδα των SAF, συμπεριλαμβανομένης και της αεροπορικής βιομηχανίας.

From its home at Dubai International Airport (DXB), the airline is celebrating its record $6.2 billion in recorded profit for the financial year ending March 31. How is the airline celebrating such a historic year?

Emirates, the hometown airline for Dubai, competes head-to-head with several other Middle Eastern heavyweights, namely Etihad Airways , Saudia, and Qatar Airways. Emirates has made a name for itself with the Airbus A380, which has flown to a number of key international destinations around the world and offers more seats between London and Dubai than many other carriers combined. It's news that $6.2 billion in annual profit for the 2024 financial year has made this one of the airline's strongest financial performances.

What Has Driven Such Strong Profits?

Emirates has seen a significant increase in revenue compared to the previous financial year; this has been driven by strong passenger demand, more efficient operations, and the continued rebound for long-haul travel in the post-pandemic world. In the last financial year, the airline transported more than 512 million passengers, resulting in an average load factor of 83% on most flights. This has demonstrated strong demand across its entire international network.

The airline's Chairman and CEO, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, has attributed Emirates' success to the carrier's ability to adapt to new travel trends, including the surge in premium bookings, and the introduction of its hotly anticipated premium economy cabin. The year's strong performance has reflected the resilience of the Middle Eastern carrier and its dedication to growing demand for high-quality air travel. Emirates, which is owned by the government of Dubai's Investment Corporation of Dubai, operates more than 3,600 flights a week from its home at DXB, with direct flights to more than 150 cities across 80 countries.

This year, Emirates continues to expand its international network from Dubai International Airport, one of the busiest airports on the planet. In 2025, Emirates will take off to several new destinations, including Da Nang (from June 2), Hangzhou (from July 30), Shenzhen (from July 1), Siem Reap (from June 3), and Tel Aviv (returning from October 1).

Rewarding Emirates Employees With A Big Bonus

Following Emirates' successful year, the airline will reward its employees with a six-month salary bonus. The carrier decided to give this very generous reward to recognize its staff's continued commitment and contributions to Emirates' overall success. This reward aligns with the airline's traditions of sharing profits with its employees during successful years. Emirates is the world's third-largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger kilometers, and the second-largest by freight tonne kilometers flown.

This benefit, distributed among its tens of thousands of employees, includes all ends of the spectrum, including cabin crew, pilots, ground staff, and administrative personnel. The airline has also enhanced its staff benefits by extending travel discounts and healthcare packages. The airline has reiterated that behind this bonus, its people have been instrumental in achieving such successful results in the last financial year.

The record figure of over $6 billion in profit is the best in the carrier's history and reaffirms the carrier as one of the world's most profitable airlines. The figures that concluded at the end of March represent a year-on-year increase of 18%, with the group's cash assets increasing 13% ($14.6 billion).

Investing In More Aircraft

Emirates is reinvesting huge capital from its financial success in accelerating its fleet modernization program. The Middle Eastern carrier has placed additional orders for the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X, these aircraft will further drive fuel efficiency and expand the airlines long-haul capabilities.

Emirates has also started retrofitting its existing Airbus A380 fleet (of which it has the largest in the world by a long shot), rejuvenating its cabins, and adding premium economy, a first for the airline in a push to respond to the ever-growing mid-tier luxury travel market. While the Airbus A380 is no longer in production, Emirates remains committed to the double-decker aircraft, deploying it on some of its most iconic and busiest routes, including London, Paris, Christchurch, and New York. Below is a list of aircraft on order with the carrier:

Currently, the Emirates fleet consists entirely of widebody aircraft, a model that the airline expects to continue. Several aircraft types already operate in the airline's network, including four Airbus A350-900, 116 Airbus A380-800, ten Boeing 777-200LR, and 120 Boeing 777-300ER.

Enhancing The Emirates Experience

Not only is Emirates expanding its global network by introducing a number of new routes, but the carrier is also leveraging its partnership with flydubai . The regional, low-cost carrier based at Dubai International Airport is Emirates' sister carrier, operating to a range of short—and medium-haul destinations from Dubai, such as those throughout the Adriatic and neighbouring Middle Eastern countries.

Emirates continues reinvesting in the passenger experience and has seen recent premium cabin upgrades. Expanded menus and dining options have been fueled through partnerships with Michelin-starred chefs, and those who like to sit back and relax with a good film can enjoy more than 6,500 channels on the airline's award-winning ICE entertainment system.

Fast Wi-Fi is also now available across the Emirates fleet, providing both business—and leisure-focused passengers with the ability to stay connected with friends and family around the world during flight. With Emirates being the largest A380 operator worldwide, 81 of its double deckers are progressively being retrofitted with its new premium economy seats.

Remaining Committed To The Carrier's Carbon Neutrality Goals

While Emirates will cash out millions with this year's bonus offer, the airline continues investing heavily in its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships and investments for more fuel-efficient aircraft, the airline will reach its net-zero carbon emissions target by the middle of the century.

Passengers and businesses using Emirates can also participate in this programme by offsetting their carbon emissions when booking. Here are some ways Emirates continues to make strides in lowering its carbon footprint:

Other initiatives that have supported this move to lower carbon emissions include electric vehicles in its fleet of cars that chauffeur its flight crew to and from their Dubai accommodations, which alone reduces around 14 tonnes of CO2 per month.

A Bright Future Is Ahead For Emirates

However you may look at it, Emirates's future looks bright. The carrier, synonymous with long-haul, luxury air travel, will head into the 2025 financial year with a stride in its step, coming off the back of a resounding 2024. The airline's $6.2 billion profit underscores its continued dominance in the aviation industry. As of May 2025, Emirates operates a fleet of more than 250 aircraft, with 300 planes expected to be delivered within the next decade.

Emirates' extensive international network, which operates to all six inhabited continents in the world, serves to most major cities across the globe, flying as far as Auckland, Sao Paulo, Toronto, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Cape Town, Antananarivo, Lyon, Oslo, Colombo, Prague, Hong Kong, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Moscow, to name just a few. The airline's dominance has been driven by its strong leadership team and a loyal workforce that is made up of more than 150 nationalities around the world. Many flight attendants and pilots strive to work for the carrier, lured in by free accommodation provided by the airline, chauffeur-driven vehicles to get to and from work, and living in the tourist mecca of Dubai, surrounded by glitz and glamour.

The airline is committed to innovation, where it continues to invest in new strategies and developments that will continue pushing the carrier's envelope. The latest employee bonus and continued fleet upgrades will support the airline's expanding global network, which has positioned the airline well to provide continued growth for the years to come. International travel demand remains high, and Emirates' strategic location in the Middle East allows the carrier to be within only a few hours of huge population centres. With the airline's ability to adapt and reinvest in its future, it is set to remain a key player in the market for decades.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/how-is-emirates-celebrating-its-record-6-billion-profit-performance-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:56:08.088099

Touching on Vietnam – Malaysia relations, the diplomat stressed that PM Chinh’s visit will help deepen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries.
Vietnam has positioned its people as the centre, subject, goal, driving force, and resource for sustainable national development.","In a recent interview with the press, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Do Hung Viet, also Head of ASEAN SOM of Vietnam, stressed that the trip, made at the invitation of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his spouse, is of significance as it coincides with the 30th anniversary of Vietnam’s ASEAN membership, marking the beginning of the nation’s regional and international process.

It demonstrates Vietnam’s strong support for Malaysia’s role as the ASEAN Chair this year and reflects the shared determination for build a community that embodies sustainability, inclusiveness, solidarity and strength while consolidating ASEAN’s central role in regional peace and stability, he said, highlighting Vietnam seeks to collaborate with other ASEAN member states to shape up strategic orientations and concrete measures to solidify regional cooperation foundation while elevating the bloc’s stature in the coming time.

Vietnam's three-decade ASEAN membership shows that it is increasingly mature, confident, and proactive in both regional bloc participation and broader international integration. This period has confirmed ASEAN as a cornerstone in Vietnam's foreign policy, with General Secretary To Lam emphasising in his speech at the ASEAN Secretariat in January that standing at a new historical starting point, Vietnam and ASEAN are working together towards ambitious goals.

Over the recent past, Vietnam has collaborated closely with other ASEAN nations in developing strategic documents, particularly the ""ASEAN 2045: Our Shared Future"" to be adopted by leaders at this summit. Vietnamese ministries actively contributed from the initial stages, balancing core principles like internal solidarity and ASEAN centrality while proposing innovative, practical ideas to create breakthroughs across all three pillars of politics-security, economy, and socio-culture, and cross-sectoral areas.

Vietnam’s leadership is evident through its role in organising the ASEAN Future Forums in 2024 and 2025, facilitating discussions on essential regional issues and substantively contributing to shaping ASEAN cooperation through 2045.

Themed “Inclusivity and Sustainability”, the 46th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits are expected to chart fresh pathways for regional cooperation.

Vietnam will work with other member states across three priorities, namely reaffirming multilateralism’s values while enhancing ASEAN’s central role in the region amidst strategic volatilities; launching a new roadmap for community building towards a self-reliant, innovative, proactive, and people-centred bloc; and promoting internal and external connectivity through expanded trade-investment cooperation and fair, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading systems, according to Viet.

Touching on Vietnam – Malaysia relations, the diplomat stressed that PM Chinh’s visit will help deepen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries. Leaders of both sides will exchange notes on specific orientations and measures to inject new momentum and develop the bilateral cooperation and connectivity in a deeper and more effective manner.

He went on to emphasise that the elevation of the bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership last November represents the most solid assessment and highest expectation for the Vietnam-Malaysia relationship.

Senior leaders of the two countries have maintained regular visits and exchanges, highlighted by General Secretary To Lam's official visit to Malaysia in 2024 and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to Vietnam for attendance at the second ASEAN Future Forum in February 2025.

Recent diplomatic engagement has intensified remarkably, with PM Chinh conducting two telephone conversations with his Malaysian counterpart within a single month to share assessments of the global and regional situation while discussing measures to promote bilateral cooperation and ASEAN collaboration.

Viet described economic cooperation as an important pillar in the Vietnam – Malaysia relationship, stating Malaysia currently ranks as Vietnam's third-largest trading partner within ASEAN and 9th globally, while also standing as Vietnam's third-largest investor among ASEAN countries.

Both countries share similar development aspirations and place people at the heart of national development. Vietnam has positioned its people as the centre, subject, goal, driving force, and resource for sustainable national development.

Similarly, Malaysia aims to become one of the world's top 25 countries in human development index within the next decade. This alignment, Viet said, demonstrates profound affinity between the nations extending beyond geographical proximity to encompass long-term development philosophy and priorities.

He expressed his belief that PM Chinh’s visit will also strengthen political trust between the two countries, remove bottlenecks, and outline concrete steps to bring into full play the Vietnam – Malaysia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for the benefits of the two countries’ people as well as for peace, stability, and development in the region.",https://media.vov.vn/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_en/public/2025-05/foreign%20ministry.jpg?v=1748102048,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:13.732429

We produced ~0.89 million tonnes of sugar in the Sugar Season (SS) 2023-24.
Do you consider the revision of the sugar Minimum Support Price (MSP) and ethanol pricing to be top priorities for the sugar industry at present?
With the FRP for sugarcane now revised to Rs 355/quintal (for Sugar Season 2025-26), revising sugar MSP to Rs 39.14/kg is critical to restore mill viability and ensure fair farmer returns.
Our primary focus right now is on strengthening ethanol production, in line with the Government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program.","With the recent hike in the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane, the sugar industry in India is urging the government to revise the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar as well as ethanol prices.

In June 2018, the Indian government set the MSP of sugar for the first time at Rs 29 per kg, when the FRP for sugarcane was Rs 2,550 per tonne. Since then, while the FRP has steadily increased, rising to Rs 3,550 per tonne for the 2025–26 season, the MSP of sugar has remained unchanged at Rs 31 per kg since February 2019.

In an exclusive interview with ChiniMandi, Tarun Sawhney, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd, highlights the urgent need to revise the sugar MSP and discusses key issues facing the sugar industry, as well as the company’s strategy and outlook.

Q. India has recorded a decline in sugar production this season compared to the previous year. What, in your view, are the main factors contributing to this drop?

India has recorded a decline in sugar production this season compared to the previous year—from 31.9 million tonnes in Sugar Season (SS) 2023–24 to an estimated 25.74 million tonnes in SS 2024–25 (as of May 15, 2025). This drop can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, adverse weather conditions in key producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka which led to lower sugarcane yields and reduced availability for crushing. Secondly, diversion of sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses in line with the Government’s biofuel targets, has also impacted sugar output. Additionally, the crushing season was shorter in some regions due to early exhaustion of sugarcane supplies. Improved plant cane yield and better sugar recovery in the latter half of the season have contributed to extended operations in Uttar Pradesh. Furthermore, special crushing operations in South Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are expected to commence, potentially adding 0.4 to 0.5 million tonnes of sugar to the final tally. Despite the decline in overall production, with a projected closing stock of 5.4 million tonnes and no domestic supply concerns, the industry remains confident about meeting demand and maintaining price stability.

Q. How do you assess the current trends in sugar consumption in India? Are there any change in demand?

The current trends in sugar consumption in India remain steady and largely stable, with no significant decline in domestic demand. Despite a drop in the sugar production there is no visible stress on supply, and price stability has been maintained, indicating that consumption levels have not drastically changed.

India typically consumes around 28 million tonnes of sugar annually, and this year’s projected closing stock of 5.4 million tonnes which will allow to comfortably meet country’s demand for sugar. There’s also no evidence of a demand surge or significant shift in consumption patterns. However, the industry remains watchful as seasonal demand tends to rise during summer months and festive seasons. In that context, continued operations in select mills in UP, TN, and Maharashtra into May are helping manage regional supply efficiently.

Q. How much important role do sugar and ethanol play in the overall business of Triveni Engineering & Industries?

We are one of India’s largest sugar producers, operating eight sugar plants across Uttar Pradesh. We produced ~0.89 million tonnes of sugar in the Sugar Season (SS) 2023-24. In our Alcohol business, we produced over 180 million litres of alcohol during the Financial Year 2023-24, through our five distillery facilities, also located in Uttar Pradesh. Among these, two facilities are multi-feed and can process both molasses and grains, ensuring operational flexibility.

Sugar and Alcohol contributes approximately 90% to our overall turnover. The remaining 10% comes from our engineering operations, which include manufacturing high-speed power transmission equipment such as gearboxes, and another business focused on water and wastewater treatment solutions.

Q. Do you consider the revision of the sugar Minimum Support Price (MSP) and ethanol pricing to be top priorities for the sugar industry at present?

Sugar prices have remained largely stable, with a recent modest uptick of 2–2.5%. However, five years of price stagnation—coupled with rising sugarcane, labour, and operational costs—have severely compressed industry margins. With the FRP for sugarcane now revised to Rs 355/quintal (for Sugar Season 2025-26), revising sugar MSP to Rs 39.14/kg is critical to restore mill viability and ensure fair farmer returns. At Triveni, we continue to lead by example with timely, arrears-free farmer payments.

Agronomic challenges, especially the red rot disease plaguing the CO238 variety, demand immediate investment in resilient sugarcane alternatives for North India’s 25 million farmers—making a sugar price hike even more necessary.

Similarly, ethanol remains a key pillar in farmer income, rural development, and national energy security. While pricing varies by feedstock, ethanol from sugarcane juice commands Rs 65.61/litre, B-heavy molasses Rs 60.73/litre, and C-heavy molasses recently revised to Rs 57.97/litre. The industry expected upward revisions for B-heavy and juice-based ethanol to ease value chain pressures.

India is on track to meet its 20% ethanol blending target, with NITI Aayog now exploring higher thresholds. Achieving these goals hinges on capacity expansion, underpinned by a sustainable ethanol pricing model.

Q. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to evolve, how is Triveni adopting these technologies to improve its production processes and operational efficiency?

To increase production, streamline procedures, and improve operational efficiency, Triveni Engineering & Industries Limited is adopting digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) as essential pillars of our transformation path. Across our sugar manufacturing and other business verticals, we have implemented a comprehensive digital strategy that incorporates cutting-edge technologies, intelligent automation, and advanced analytics.

A major milestone in this journey has been the establishment of our Digital Centre of Excellence (DCoE).

Q. Any future plans for Triveni to venture into biogas, SAF, or other areas of the bioenergy business?

At Triveni Engineering & Industries Limited, we’re deeply committed to supporting India’s energy transition, and our growing footprint in the bioenergy sector reflects that. Our primary focus right now is on strengthening ethanol production, in line with the Government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program.

Our production backbone includes five state-of-the-art distillation facilities strategically located across Uttar Pradesh. Notably, our grain-based plants also produce Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles (DDGS)—a high-protein animal feed by-product that has been well received by premium institutions.

While ethanol remains our immediate priority, we absolutely recognize the vast potential in emerging areas of the bioenergy space, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Compressed Biogas (CBG). India is entering a transformative phase—what many are calling an ethanol revolution—where second-generation biofuels, SAF, and CBG are expected to play a major role in the country’s long-term energy roadmap.

Though we haven’t announced specific initiatives in SAF or biogas just yet, we’re closely watching the developments in these areas and exploring opportunities that align with our capabilities and long-term sustainability vision. Our focus is on building scalable, high-impact solutions—and as the ecosystem evolves, we’re ready to diversify and lead wherever the opportunity arises.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tarun-Sawhney.jpeg,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:20.054675

KUCHING, May 24: Smallholders in Sarawak can boost their income by integrating livestock farming into their oil palm plantations, said Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg.

He explained that this integrated model allows farmers to generate two income streams from the same land—through the production of palm oil and livestock such as goats, cattle, or chickens.

“If we plant oil palm on one hectare of land according to the proper planting structure, there’s space between the trees.

“Why not raise animals in between? Chickens, goats or cattle,” he said when launching the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority’s (SALCRA) Kernel Crushing Plant at the Lubok Antu Palm Oil Mill today.

Abang Johari said the by-products from palm kernel crushing can be processed into animal feed, enabling farmers to feed their livestock at minimal cost using palm-based waste.

He pointed out that cattle prices have soared, with a single cow selling for up to RM12,000 during Hari Raya Aidiladha.

By turning palm waste into feed, rural farmers can rear livestock more affordably and profitably. From just one hectare of oil palm land, they can produce palm oil, raise animals, and feed their livestock at no additional cost.

“If we can produce more goats and cattle, we can export them overseas. That means more income. This is what we call waste-to-energy,” he added.

Abang Johari also highlighted that palm oil waste can be turned into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reducing reliance on fossil fuels to power aircraft.

“In Singapore, companies like Neste collect used cooking oil from restaurants and turn it into SAF. But in Sarawak, we are doing it using plantation waste, and the value goes back to the farmers,” he said.

He noted that the RM30 million allocated by the Sarawak government to SALCRA served as seed capital to establish the Kernel Crushing Plant in Lubok Antu, designed as a model to demonstrate how downstream activities can benefit smallholders.

“Oil palm smallholders are no longer just oil palm farmers. They can become livestock entrepreneurs too. And with two income streams, the village’s overall earnings will increase,” he said.

While the focus now is on livestock feed and SAF, Abang Johari revealed that kernel processing can also produce hydrogen gas—a clean energy source Sarawak aims to tap in future public transport systems like the Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART).

He also suggested automating waste handling in mills with conveyor belts to reduce labour and improve cleanliness.

Sarawak is the largest oil palm producer in Malaysia based on planted area.

Mærket bruger 29 millioner kroner på 3,8 millioner liter brændstof til resten af flåden.

McLarens Formel 1-biler er ikke de eneste, som kører på syntetisk benzin.

I en netop offentliggjort bæredygtighedsrapport, gør det tidligere britiske bilmærke det klart, at man i 2024 brugte millioner af kroner på syntetisk brændstof til resten af Formel 1-flåden.

Her i blandt lastbiler. Helt konkret skriver McLaren, der sidste år blev solgt til Abu Dhabi, at man sidste år købte Sustainable Aviation Fuel-certificeret brændstof for 29 millioner kroner.

Det svarer til 3,8 millioner liter. En mængde brændstof som McLaren har kunnet køre hele sin flåde af lastbiler, og dele af mærkets flyfragt, på det syntetiske brændstof.

SAF-brændstof fremstilles af affald eller fornybare kilder og kan reducere udledningen med op til 90 procent sammenlignet med almindeligt jetbrændstof, skriver Formel 1-holdet.

Når det så er sagt, stopper McLaren ikke ved brændstoffet. Ifølge bæredygtighedsrapporten er holdet oppe på nu at have genbrugt 37 procent af materialerne fra sidste års Formel 1-bil, McLaren MCL38, bliver genbrugt.

På den anden side er det ikke alt, er det ikke alt, der er røde roser i McLaren-garagen. Holdet riskerer nemlig at stå med en ekstremt stor udgift til det syntetiske brændstof lige om lidt.

“Additionally, as a multiracial nation with strong Chinese and Indian communities, Malaysia is uniquely positioned to leverage this diversity as a bridge into these ecosystems,” Ahmad Sabirin told SunBiz at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (Lima 2025) yesterday.

Ahmad Sabirin said Sirim is accelerating its global expansion by establishing more international offices, with the broader objective of enabling not only its own growth but also supporting the internationalisation of Malaysian small and medium enterprises.

Given the limitations of Malaysia’s relatively small market, Sirim is also strategically targeting the broader Asean region – with its population of about 680 million and substantial consumer base – as a key market, he said.

Touching on the aerospace sector, Ahmad Sabirin said as Malaysia assumes the Asean chairmanship this year, efforts are under way to position local aerospace players for regional growth, with a vision to expand beyond domestic government contracts and establish the country as a key aerospace hub in Southeast Asia – an ambition supported by ongoing collaboration between agencies such as Sirim, the Defence Ministry and regional investment partners.

“This year, Sirim is advancing its commitment to standard and technology diplomacy by extending its services to Asean member countries, including several least developed nations. Acknowledging the disparities within the region, Sirim aims to foster a more inclusive and vibrant ecosystem, with Malaysia taking a leadership role.

“Sirim hopes this initiative will align with the prime minister’s efforts to champion regional cooperation in technology, standards, and human capital development.

“In line with global sustainability goals, Sirim continues to position itself as a key enabler in Malaysia’s net zero ambitions –particularly through its long-standing work in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” Ahmad Sabirin said.

He added that Sirim is in discussions with Petroliam Nasional Bhd to explore the potential of utilising locally sourced biomass for the production of SAF, recognising its critical role in advancing Malaysia’s net-zero carbon by 2050 goal.

With an emphasis on increasing SAF adoption across sectors, including national defence, this initiative positions Malaysia as a potential pioneer in the global SAF framework, leveraging its readily available and cost-effective raw materials to support both domestic use and international supply.

“Currently, we are purchasing SAF at a higher cost. However, by shifting processing capabilities to our own country, we can export higher-value products instead of importing them, ultimately improving our trade balance through more strategic value-added production and exports,” Ahmad Sabirin said.

Last year, Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said Malaysia planned to start producing SAF in 2027, with an initial production capacity of one million tonnes per year.

The production capacity will gradually increase based on factory output and feedstock availability, the minister told parliament.

Malaysia, the world’s second-largest palm oil producer, is in a strategic position to become one of the world’s leading SAF producers, he was quoted saying in a Reuters report.

In April of this year, Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said Malaysia was set to boost its role in the global clean energy sector with the development of a world-scale SAF refinery.

The project is a result of a strategic partnership between Bin Zayed International and local biofuel pioneer FatHopes Energy.

Describing the partnership as a “game-changer” for the country’s energy and aviation sectors, Nik Nazmi said this investment would serve as a catalyst for far-reaching transformation.

“It heralds Malaysia’s arrival as a serious player in the global clean energy and low-carbon economy,“ he said at the project’s memorandum of understanding signing ceremony.

Asked about examples of Sirim’s research and development initiatives in the electric vehicle space, Ahmad Sabirin said, “For EV, we have the most complex system for the industries. Before implementing an EV system in Malaysia, patent approval is required, and it must be validated by the country’s designated petroleum and energy research institute.

“Following patent approval, all EV systems must undergo testing and certification by Sirim QAS, while battery development and testing are handled by Sirim Research – forming a comprehensive ecosystem to support national battery innovation.

“In parallel, Sirim is actively developing standards for hydrogen, particularly as several states begin hydrogen-related initiatives.

“Ensuring safety remains a top priority, with clear standards and consistent compliance frameworks being established to guide industry practices. Currently, much of the industrial focus is centred on advancing the EV sector,“ Ahmad Sabirin said.",https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x373/0c62/480d250/none/11808/VDEC/ahmad-sabirin-za_5235551_20250523174308.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:56:21.133573

“We need to look into our laws, because if waste is managed in scattered small groups, there is no economy of scale. Some may not want to give up their waste.

“So we need to consider making it mandatory, through a joint venture between the private sector and the government, to set up an entity that collects all waste from the 85 oil palm mills,” he said.

Abang Johari emphasised that waste volume is critical to achieving efficiency in downstream production, including the generation of biofuel, livestock feed, and even hydrogen fuel – all by-products of the palm oil industry.

“We need volume as with volume comes efficiency. Then we can sustainably produce the outputs I mentioned earlier.

“Only then can we create a green agricultural sector – non-polluting and well-managed.

“This will benefit all mills. If one place produces two tonnes, another three tonnes, it’s not enough.

“But if we combine them, it can reach 100 tonnes, which is an efficient volume to produce the desired outputs,” he said.

He highlighted Sarawak’s commitment to a circular economy, where waste is repurposed into valuable products to support sustainable agriculture in line with global Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, enabling Sarawak to earn premium prices for green products.

Abang Johari said that while Sarawak currently produces crude palm oil, mill effluent can be further processed into components of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

He cited Neste in Singapore, which turns used cooking oil into aviation fuel, as proof of waste’s revenue potential.

“Sarawak, meanwhile, uses raw materials directly from our plantations. That’s pure income going straight to our planters,” he said.

Over his impressive career, Thomson has been a key player in the establishment of the Canadian renewable fuels industry.
One of his many career highlights was establishing the BC Biodiesel Association (2005) and the Alberta Biodiesel Association (2006).
“These two entities led industry development in Western Canada, eventually becoming the Western Canada Biodiesel Association in 2014.
In 2015, the scope of representation expanded, and the association became Advanced Biofuels Canada Association (ABFC).","There are few people whose names are more synonymous with biofuels in Canada than Ian Thomson. Just ask Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada.

“Ian is a pioneer leader in the development of Canada’s renewable and low carbon fuel sector,” he said.

Ghatala cites Thomson’s dedication to the industry since 2002, when he first focused on the potential use of biodiesel for reducing emissions from diesel fuel engines.

“In 2002, I started looking at fuels and alternatives and zeroed in on biodiesel as something that had potential, but nobody was really doing anything with it in Western Canada,” Thomson said.

Over his impressive career, Thomson has been a key player in the establishment of the Canadian renewable fuels industry. One of his many career highlights was establishing the BC Biodiesel Association (2005) and the Alberta Biodiesel Association (2006).

“These two entities led industry development in Western Canada, eventually becoming the Western Canada Biodiesel Association in 2014. In 2015, the scope of representation expanded, and the association became Advanced Biofuels Canada Association (ABFC). ABFC is Canada’s leading renewable fuels industry organization, promoting the production and use of sustainable, low carbon fuel alternatives to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels,” Ghatala said.

Thomson served as president of the association from 2005 to 2024, stepping aside in 2025 to serve as past-president to assist the new executive team.

In 2005, Thomson co-founded the Canadian Bioenergy Corporation (CBEC), the first biodiesel distribution business in B.C. Ghatala said the company “quickly grew from importing 1,000 litres totes of U.S.-made biodiesel to establishing tankage at terminals in North Vancouver and Calgary, and shipping railcars as far east as Nova Scotia.”

While serving as president of CBEC, Thomson also worked on the Canadian biodiesel sector’s testing and standards work with the Canadian General Standards Board.

“The first quality standards for biodiesel and biodiesel blends were finalized around 2011, which were key to providing functional fuel assurance,” Ghatala said.

That same year, Thomson and his partners shut down CBEC to co-found Waterfall Advisors Group, which staffs ABFC’s operations and serves the Canadian biofuels sector with consulting expertise and coast-to-coast coverage.

Between 2010 and 2012, Thomson led the industry associations in assisting governments with adopting the first diesel fuel RFS blending regulations in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and federally with the Canadian Renewable Fuel Regulations.

“In 2013, B.C. finally implemented its ground-breaking Low Carbon Fuel Standard; and Ontario followed with its hybrid (RFS/LCFS) Greener Diesel Regulation in 2014,” Ghatala notes.

Thomson has also played a key role in helping develop what eventually became Archer Daniels Midland’s biodiesel project, which commissioned Canada’s largest biodiesel facility (320MLY) in Lloydminster, AB. in October 2013.

“At that point we had enough demand, we reckoned, to build a plant. So, with a small group of other colleagues, put together a company that eventually co-adventured with a large global agribusiness company to build the Lloydminster biodiesel plant run by Archer Daniels Midland,” Thomson recalled.

Over the next 12 years, Thomson continued to lead the way in the growth of the renewable fuels sector with milestones such as:

Assisting with the six-year regulatory development phase of the Clean Fuel Regulations that were finalized in June 2022, and became effective July 1, 2023;

Helping develop the first low carbon fuel regulations in Quebec (2023); and B.C.’s new LCFS statute and regulation (2024); which is Canada’s most stringent fuel regulation, and includes the first SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) mandate in the Americas.

“The regulations referred to above were ground-breaking achievements in Canada, and, over 2010 to 2024, they have proven to be the most successful mechanism to reduce GHGs from fossil fuel use in transportation,” Ghatala said.

Thomson gives kudos to his colleagues of two decades including dedicated and deeply knowledgeable association staff. He also flags the indispensable work of provincial governments, especially B.C., Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, and Quebec, and the federal government for helping create a friendlier environment.

“The provinces have taken real leadership in getting regulations that give the kind of assurances that people who have capital and aspirations to build production assets need,” Thomson said. “The federal government undertaking the Clean Fuels Regulations starting in 2016, and wrapping up in 2022, was great work. It took longer than we had hoped, and ended up coming full circle back to a pretty basic local carbon fuel standard, but that was a real highlight.”

Seeing the clean fuel sectors collaborating recently has also been a highlight.

“It’s way too easy for people in the alternative fuel space to feel like they have to compete with each other,” he said. “I mean, at the end of the day, they compete. But first you’ve got to collaborate to get a market, and I think we’ve seen some really effective collaborations in Canada.”

When asked what advice he would offer the next generation looking to become active in the renewable fuels sector, Thomson says to be prepared for two steps forward and one-and-a-half steps back.

“I talk with people who are graduating from engineering programs or getting into them, or wanting to get into this space, and they think everything’s going to go hydrogen. They think everything is going to go electrification,” he said. “The view that many of us in the clean fuels space have is there’s going to be a long road for high energy density, low carbon liquid fuels. Whether those are fossil fuels with significantly lower their carbon emissions, biofuels produced out of refineries with co-processing or renewable diesel, or biofuels produced in standalone biofuel plants with low carbon intensity increasingly made from a wider range of feedstocks than just agricultural crops, the need to fuel internal combustion engines is going to be around for a long time.” •",https://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lifetime-Achievement-Awards-Ian-Thomson.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:51.032490

Honeywell International has agreed to purchase Johnson Matthey’s catalyst technologies business for about $2.3 billion. It plans to combine the business with its UOP subsidiary to create a chemical process engineering and catalysis giant.

Johnson Matthey’s catalyst business generated $930 million in sales during the company’s most recent fiscal year. The business specializes in processes related to synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and is a leading provider of technology for making syngas-derived products such as ammonia, methanol, and formaldehyde.

In recent years, the UK-based firm has been applying its know-how to low-carbon chemical production. For instance, it says its autothermal reforming technology for making hydrogen from natural gas can be easily integrated with carbon capture and storage.

Honeywell’s UOP unit had 2024 sales of about $2.6 billion from processes and catalysts for refining and petrochemicals. UOP has a particularly strong position in aromatics and derivatives. It is also active in olefins with its Oleflex propane dehydrogenation technology. In recent years, UOP has added sustainable chemistry technology, such as the Ecofining process it developed with Italian energy company Eni. Ecofining makes diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste fats and oils.

Last November, UOP and Johnson Matthey signed an agreement to join forces in Fischer-Tropsch and methanol routes to fuels from feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, residual biomass, and biogas.

“Acquiring Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business will provide our customers a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to transition their businesses to high-value products with lower emissions,"" says Ken West, president of Honeywell's Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment, in the company’s announcement of the deal.

Honeywell is in the middle of an ambitious portfolio transformation that includes spinning off its Aerospace Technologies and Advanced Materials businesses. The latter business, which generated $3.8 billion in sales in 2024, makes refrigerants and Spectra ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fiber.

Johnson Matthey has been under pressure to streamline from major shareholder Standard Investments, an affiliate of Standard Industries, which owns the catalyst firm W. R. Grace. In December, Standard Investments called on Johnson Matthey to conduct a strategic review that could include the sale of all or part of itself. Standard didn’t respond to a request for comment on Johnson Matthey’s plan to sell the catalyst business.

With the sale of the catalyst technologies business to Honeywell, Johnson Matthey will be focused on its Clean Air business, which makes vehicle emissions catalysts, and platinum group metal services.

The sale price, Johnson Matthey CEO Liam Condon says in a statement, allows the company “to realise a very attractive valuation for this business that fully reflects its strong long-term growth prospects.”

Nearly 90% of the proceeds from the transaction will be paid out to shareholders. “We would expect a strong positive share price response,” says Jefferies stock analyst Charlie Bentley in a note to clients about the deal.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Honeywell-buying-Johnson-Matthey-catalyst-technologies-business---86771?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-05-24 05:56:39.826537

Given China is Airbus' largest single-country market, it will strengthen local collaboration with suppliers to promote SAF use as a potential replacement for conventional jet fuel, which can achieve carbon reductions of around 80% over its life cycle using conventional jets.

Key Highlights:

Airbus supports China’s efforts to build a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, citing the country’s strategic advantages.

China’s available feedstock could support SAF production of up to 12 million metric tons annually by 2030.

Airbus continues to deepen partnerships with China, expanding its A320 final assembly line in Tianjin.

Claire Kauffmann, Head of SAF and carbon dioxide removal at Airbus, added that China has useful advantages with plentiful feedstock, such as waste cooking oil and agricultural waste, rapidly-developing renewable energy infrastructure, and stable policy support. These drivers provide a good foundation for the sustainable aviation fuel industry to prosper in a sustainable way, she said.

The legislation adopts a series of amendments to the Texas Business Organizations Code (TBOC), which governs Texas corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships and other legal entities, that are designed to make Texas more attractive for entity formation and redomestication.

Senate Bill 29

On May 14, 2025, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 (S.B. 29) into law with immediate effect. The changes to the TBOC enacted by S.B. 29 clarify areas of existing Texas law and strengthen a company’s defenses against certain types of shareholder litigation.

Business Judgment Rule Statute

S.B. 29 enacts new Section 21.419 codifying the “business judgment rule” presumption. The statute applies automatically to public corporations (any corporation with a class or series of voting shares listed on a national securities exchange) and includes an option for any private corporation to “opt-in” by including an affirmative election in its governing documents.

Directors and officers of corporations that are subject to the statute are presumed to have acted (1) in good faith; (2) on an informed basis; (3) in furtherance of the interests of the corporation; and (4) in obedience to the law and the corporation’s governing documents, in taking or declining to take any action on any matters of the corporation’s business.

Further, the statute provides that neither the corporation nor any of its shareholders has a cause of action against a director or officer as a result of any act or omission in the person’s capacity as a director or officer unless (1) the claimant rebuts one or more of the codified presumptions and (2) it is proven by the claimant that (A) the director’s or officer’s act or omission constituted a breach of the person’s duties as a director or officer and (B) the breach involved fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act or a knowing violation of law.

Advance Independence Determination

S.B. 29 also overhauls provisions of the TBOC relevant to the evaluation and approval of certain conflict of interest transactions.

Specifically, the new legislation expressly empowers a board of directors of a public corporation or a private corporation that has opted-in to the business judgment rule statute (new Section 21.419) to form a committee of independent and disinterested directors to review and approve transactions involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and a controlling shareholder, director or officer, and to petition the Texas Business Court (or the district court in the county in which the corporation’s principal place of business in Texas is located, if that county is not located within an operating division of the Texas Business Court), to seek an advance determination as to whether the directors on the committee are independent and disinterested.

The court’s determination in such a proceeding is dispositive in the absence of evidence not presented to the court that one or more of the directors is not independent and disinterested with respect to a particular transaction involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and a controlling shareholder, director or officer.

Minimum Ownership Threshold for Derivative Actions

S.B. 29 allows public corporations and private corporations that have opted-in to the business judgment rule statute and have 500 or more shareholders (at the time the derivative proceeding is instituted) to proscribe, in the corporation’s certificate of formation or bylaws, a minimum ownership threshold for shareholders that are eligible to bring a derivative lawsuit, provided that such minimum ownership threshold does not exceed three percent of the corporation’s outstanding shares.

Limitation of Books and Records Demands

For public corporations and private corporations that have opted-in to the business judgment rule statute, S.B. 29 provides that a shareholder is not entitled to bring a books and records demand if it is reasonably determined by the corporation that the demand is in connection with (1) an active or pending derivative proceeding in the right of the corporation that is or is expected to be instituted or maintained by the holder or the holder’s affiliate or (2) an active or pending civil lawsuit to which the corporation or its affiliate and the holder or the holder’s affiliate are or are expected to be adversarial.

S.B. 29 also clarifies that, for all Texas corporations, “e-mails, text messages or similar electronic communications, or information from social media accounts” are not records that may be subject to a books and records demand, unless the particular communication effectuates action by the corporation.

Limiting Recovery of Attorney’s Fees in “Disclosure Only” Settlements

Under existing provisions of the TBOC, a court may order a corporation to reimburse a plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and other litigation costs incurred in a derivative proceeding if it is determined that the proceeding has resulted in a “substantial benefit” to the corporation. Under S.B. 29, the provision is amended to provide that additional or amended disclosures made to the shareholders, regardless of materiality, are not a “substantial benefit” to the corporation.

Waiver of Jury Trial

S.B. 29 codifies the right of a Texas entity to contain in its governing documents a provision waiving the right to a jury trial concerning any “internal entity claim,” which is a claim of any nature, including a derivative claim, that is based on, arises from, or relates to the internal affairs of the entity.

Exclusive Forum Selection

S.B. 29 also codifies the right of a Texas entity to contain in its governing documents a provision stipulating one or more courts in Texas as the exclusive forum and venue for “internal entity claims.”

Class and Series Voting Rights

S.B. 29 eliminates certain mandatory separate class and series voting requirements, providing greater flexibility for a Texas corporation to structure its voting rights among different classes and series of stock. The amendment addresses one of the more significant hurdles that corporations seeking to redomicile in Texas have historically encountered, as the rigidity of the prior regime was often incompatible with the way voting rights are typically structured in certain types of corporations with multiple classes or series of stock.

Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships

While S.B. 29 will have the greatest impact on Texas corporations, the legislation also includes a number of analogous reforms for Texas limited liability companies and limited partnerships.

Senate Bill 1057

Senate Bill 1057 (S.B. 1057) was signed by Governor Abott on May 19, 2025, and will become effective on September 1, 2025. While not as expansive as S.B. 29, S.B. 1057 allows public companies with a specific nexus to Texas, either due to the location of its principal office or its decision to list its shares on one of the new Texas-based stock exchanges, the ability to “opt-in” to a statute that applies minimum ownership requirements to shareholder proposals.

A Texas corporation is eligible to opt-in to the statute by adopting an amendment to its governing documents if it (1) has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (2) is admitted to listing on a national securities exchange; and (3) either (A) has its principal office in Texas or (B) is admitted to listing on a Texas-based stock exchange.

Once a corporation has opted-in, in order to be eligible to submit a proposal on a matter to the shareholders for approval, a shareholder or group of shareholders must (1) hold an amount of voting shares of the corporation equal to at least (A) $1 million in market value or (B) three percent of the corporation’s outstanding voting shares; (2) hold the shares for a continuous period of at least six months before the date of the meeting and throughout the duration of the meeting; and (3) solicit the holders of shares representing at least 67 percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote on the proposal.

Summary

The changes implemented by S.B. 29 and S.B. 1057 represent a significant evolution in Texas corporate law. We expect the changes will promote new entity formation in Texas and will influence many companies organized in Delaware and other jurisdictions to consider a move to Texas. We also expect many existing Texas companies to adopt amendments to their governing documents to take advantage of various features of the new legislation.

The company plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel, state officials said.
It plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system, company officials said.

Officials with the Louisiana Economic Development office announced the deal Friday morning with Oklahoma-based Green Fuels Operating PC that will occupy the former Evangeline Processing Facility along the Mermentau River in the southwest part of the parish.

The company will invest $110 million to transform the facility into a net-zero emissions facility and employ 60 with an average salary of $80,000.

An announcement from Clean Refineries Inc., which claims GFO as an operating subsidiary, last week indicated the plant would employ 160 and have an average salary of more than $105,000.

GFO handles the company’s daily operations at specific sites and will be over the Acadia site, a company spokesperson said. The $110 million price tag is only part of what is planned for south Louisiana, the spokesperson said.

It has a $1 billion commitment to building net-zero emissions refining facilities throughout the state.

“This project is a major first step in a much bigger effort,” Green Fuels Operating spokesperson Madison Beam said.

The company plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel, state officials said. The existing facility has 15 storage tanks that have a capacity to exceed 350,000 barrels and will remain operational while the new GFO refining unit is developed.

It plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system, company officials said. It will also source local crude to support regional producers alongside feedstock delivered via pipeline and barge.

Construction is expected to begin in November and be complete in May 2026.

“We are thrilled to welcome Green Fuels to Acadia Parish, and we’re excited that their arrival will bring good-paying jobs for our residents,” Acadia Police Jury President Beau Petitjean said. “This facility has a long history in Acadia Parish, and seeing new investment in a legacy industrial refinery is a testament to the strength of our community and the potential for new development.”

The company received a competitive incentive project from LED, including the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

“Under Louisiana’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, it is critical that we keep pace with the changing needs of the industry, including reopening and reenergizing legacy operations like Canal Companies with technology-driven strategies,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said.

In December Green Fuels Operating announced a similar refinery project in northern Oklahoma that will make jet fuel and farm-grade diesel that will be able to bought on site, reports indicate. That facility is expected to employ 30-35.

The company says its net-zero emission technology system is revolutionizing oil refining with its odor-free clean refining technology to become a world leader in low-cost, environmentally responsible hydrocarbon processing solutions.

GFO facilities produce locally needed supplies of sustainable fuels, including diesel, jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel, marine-grade bunker fuels, road and roof asphalt binders.

“America's energy independence requires more than just drilling,” GFO CEO Derek Wiliamson said. “It demands that we refine our own oil here at home rather than shipping it overseas only to buy back finished fuels at premium prices.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/e6/1e678e79-80bf-5ebe-8a6c-2a54fd543a74/6435701dc8413.image.jpg?crop=1776%2C932%2C0%2C116&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-24 05:56:48.635872

In the business jet market, the resulting data troves—hours flown, mission profiles, maintenance touchpoints—feed algorithms that refine residual-value forecasts and influence insurance underwriting.","Chicago, May 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global business jet market was valued at US$ 20.83 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach 29.75 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.04% during the forecast period 2025–2033.

The business jet market entered 2024 with demand finally matching the calmer rhythm typical before 2020, yet orderbooks remain anything but sluggish. According to GAMA’s February 2024 shipment report, OEMs delivered 730 aircraft in 2023 and have penciled in 755 deliveries for 2024, supported by a backlog of roughly 3 100 jets—its highest level in nearly a decade. Corporate operators that delayed upgrades during the pandemic are now executing multi-year replacement schedules, particularly for aircraft manufactured between 2003 and 2009 whose maintenance costs ballooned once flight activity rebounded in 2021-2023. ARGUS TraqPak data underscore this shift: flight hours for jets older than fifteen years fell by 210 000 cycles in 2023, while hours on aircraft younger than five years climbed steadily. In the business jet market, that behavioral change signals a sustained pull for newer models, even though overall utilization growth has leveled.

OEM production lines are adjusting accordingly. Bombardier moved Global 5500 final assembly to its modernized Toronto facility, unlocking slots for more Global 8000 units. Embraer’s São José dos Campos plant, already running two shifts, has added a dedicated Phenom 100EV line to capitalize on entry-level demand. Meanwhile, Gulfstream is maintaining G400 certification timing by reallocating engineers from the nearly complete G800 program. Such realignments reveal an industry prioritizing throughput without overheating. By creating delivery positions in the 2026-2027 window, manufacturers are meeting fleet-renewal needs while insulating the business jet market from the boom-and-bust cycles that characterized earlier decades.

Ultra-Long-Range Jets Dominate Backlogs, Challenging Traditional Large-Cabin Leaders Across OEMs

A granular look at business jet market orderbooks shows that ultra-long-range models—those capable of 7,000 nautical miles or more—capture the lion’s share of fresh commitments in the business jet market. Gulfstream’s G700 accounts for nearly 580 firm orders, Bombardier’s Global 8000 has crossed the 300-order mark since its 2022 launch, and Dassault records 132 Falcon 10X positions ahead of first flight. These figures eclipse the combined backlog for traditional large-cabin types such as the G500/600 and Falcon 8X. The narrative is being driven by multinational firms seeking nonstop links between second-tier financial centers: think Los Angeles–Riyadh or Singapore–San José.

Equally significant, performance extras are no longer the sole differentiator. Cabin cross-sections above eight feet, lower 4,000-foot-equivalent pressurization, and certified altitude ceilings of 51,000 feet are proving decisive in purchase committees. In the business jet market, passengers care less about shaving ten minutes off flight time and more about arriving rested and connected. OEMs are therefore embedding dual-band Ka-satcom antennas, predictive maintenance gateways, and inflight humidification systems as baseline, not optional. The success of this segment is reshaping portfolio strategies: Textron Aviation has shelved studies for a Citation Longitude+ and is instead evaluating an all-new platform to stretch beyond 6 500 nautical miles. Meanwhile, engine makers Rolls-Royce and GE Honda Aero are accelerating next-generation core demonstrators aimed squarely at 20,000-pound-thrust applications, underscoring how the ultra-long-range wave is redirecting R&D dollars across the entire market landscape.

Corporate Sustainability Pivots Investment Toward SAF-Compatible Engine Platforms In Fleets

Environmental scrutiny is reshaping board-level aviation policies faster than any regulation. By March 2024, 27 U.S. airports consistently supplied sustainable aviation fuel, while total global SAF deliveries to business aviation reached 300 million liters, reports the Air Transport Action Group. Multinational corporations such as Microsoft, Gucci, and Siemens have begun contractually mandating that charter providers document SAF uplift per mission. Consequently, fleet managers assessing new purchases now give ample weight to fuel-burn baselines and feedstock compatibility. In the business jet market, that tilt has dramatically favored platforms powered by Rolls-Royce Pearl and Pratt & Whitney PW800 series engines, both certified for 100% SAF blends.

Concrete investment follows principle in the business jet market. Three Fortune 100 companies placed launch orders for Bombardier’s EcoJet technology demonstrator after the Canadian OEM disclosed wind-tunnel data showing a 20-meter span blended-wing body and laminar flow savings of about 1 000 pounds of fuel on a 4 000-nautical-mile leg. At the operational level, the market logged 14 500 book-and-claim SAF transactions in 2023—triple the 2021 tally and a figure already surpassed in the first four months of 2024. The market is also exploring electric taxi systems and lightweight cabin materials: F/LIST delivered 60 ship-sets of bio-resin sidewalls to two OEMs this year, demonstrating that sustainability influences not only propulsion but every specification line item. For decision-makers, the message is unambiguous—decarbonization is no longer peripheral; it is a central filter guiding purchase approvals and residual-value expectations in the evolving business jet market.

Pre-Owned Inventory Rebounds, Reshaping Pricing And OEM Production Strategies Today

After historic scarcity in 2022, the pre-owned channel is swinging back toward equilibrium in the business jet market. JetNet iQ’s Q4 2024 briefing lists 1,098 business jets actively for sale, up from 730 a year ago yet still below the 1,600 listings considered “normal” prior to 2020. Average aircraft age on market—17.4 years—and time to sell—198 days—provide granular clues to buyer sentiment: value shoppers remain disciplined, but any aircraft with deferred maintenance languishes. This incremental supply has moderated ask prices, which settled at a median $13.2 million by April 2024. That transparent correction is welcome news for corporate flight departments budgeting replacements.

OEMs are monitoring every uptick. Gulfstream dialed back G650ER production from 36 to 28 units for 2024 to avoid overlap with gently-used 2018 airframes returning from private equity owners. Textron Aviation, by contrast, saw improving Citation Latitude residuals as a green light to add seven additional white-tail slots. Such nimble responses underscore a broader truth in the business jet market: the health of the pre-owned segment directly governs factory cadence. In the market, stakeholders now treat inventory metrics with the same gravity once reserved for macro-economic indicators. Brokers expect listings to approach 1 300 jets by year-end, but they also predict more first-time owners drawn by improved choice and transparent maintenance records thanks to digital logbooks. Thus, resurgent pre-owned supply is not a harbinger of downturn; rather, it is a pressure-relief valve keeping the market balanced and credible.

Regional Hotspots Show Divergent Growth Drivers And Delivery Profiles Patterns

Region-specific data illuminate why a single global narrative rarely suffices. North America maintained its traditional lead in the business jet market with 430 deliveries in 2023, fueled by strong corporate profits and the convenience of 5 000 paved runways suitable for jets. Europe followed with 160 units, though sanctions-related airspace constraints over Russia altered routing patterns and nudged some owners toward longer-range types. Asia-Pacific recorded 72 deliveries, with India absorbing 18 of them—its highest intake on record—as family-owned conglomerates upgraded to midsize cabins to reach Africa nonstop. Meanwhile, the Middle East and North Africa accepted 40 aircraft, boosted by sovereign funds demanding ultra-long-range models for travel to the Americas. Latin America rounded out the tally with 28 deliveries, where Mexico’s fractional start-ups ordered Phenom 100EVs to serve high-elevation strips.

These granular figures reveal distinct purchase rationales in the business jet market. Whereas U.S. buyers in the market emphasize dispatch reliability, European owners increasingly highlight emissions compliance under the EU ETS cap. In Asia-Pacific, availability of skilled crews is paramount; operators spent the first quarter of 2024 recruiting 250 additional pilots, many from commercial airlines retrenching capacity. The Middle Eastern market, by contrast, measures value through bespoke cabin finishes and quick-change medevac kits. For stakeholders, acknowledging these disparate drivers is essential when forecasting opportunities or deciding where to allocate maintenance bases. A one-size-fits-all strategy no longer suffices; rather, the business jet market requires region-tuned offerings, financing terms, and support infrastructures to capture latent demand and ensure enduring customer satisfaction.

Digitalization And Cabin Connectivity Emerge As Prime Differentiators For Buyers

In 2024, connectivity has advanced from amenity to prerequisite in the business jet market. Inmarsat counts 4,500 active Jet ConneX Ka-band terminals, up 600 units year on year, while Gogo reports 1,375 Avance L5 installations. Corporate travelers treat uninterrupted video conferencing as non-negotiable; thus, aircraft lacking dual-provider redundancy face longer selling cycles. Equally transformative is predictive maintenance. Dassault’s FalconScan and Gulfstream’s PlaneConnect Fleet are now logging more than 18 terabytes of aircraft-health data every week. These streams feed digital twins that forecast component lifetimes down to singular flight legs, cutting unscheduled events. In the business jet market, such dependability translates directly into retained value and higher dispatch rates.

Cabin interfaces follow suit. Touchless controls, OLED lighting zones, and AI-assisted voice commands powered by Collins’ Venue CMS upgrade packages are penetrating retrofit programs. Moreover, cloud-based weight-and-balance apps and Bluetooth-enabled e-tasters for baggage compartments shorten pre-flight checks, enhancing operational efficiency. The uptick in digital sophistication is not purely technical; it is commercial. Financing agreements now routinely stipulate that borrowers keep flight-data-monitoring subscriptions active, allowing lessors real-time insight into asset utilization. Put simply, the business jet market treats connectivity and data transparency as baseline value propositions that influence charter rates, residual curves, and even insurance premiums. Decision makers ignoring this shift risk fielding aircraft perceived as technologically dated well before their airframe hours suggest obsolescence.

Supply Chain Constraints Easing, But Skilled Labor Gaps Remain Persistent

Parts shortages that hampered 2022 production have largely moderated. Honeywell reduced average lead times for TFE731 turbine blades to 210 days, down from 265, while Spirit AeroSystems cleared its 1,800-unit backlog of G500/600 fuselage barrels. Nevertheless, the business jet market still contends with labor bottlenecks. NBAA’s 2024 workforce study shows 13 000 open positions for A&P technicians across North America, and Embraer’s executive-jet division cites mechanic vacancies as the sole factor limiting Phenom output. OEMs are responding with apprenticeship partnerships at Wichita State, Savannah Technical College, and École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile, collectively training 1 200 students this year.

Materials availability is another nuance. Toray’s carbon-fiber allocation for private-airframe customers is stable, yet Grade-5 titanium forgings used in wing spars remain scarce, forcing Dassault to re-sequence Falcon 10X build blocks. At the same time, avionics suppliers are normalizing chip inventories: Garmin now guarantees 16-week delivery for G3000 processors, aiding on-time completions at Eclipse and HondaJet. Still, risk lurks in concentrated sub-tier vendors; a fire at a single resin plant in March 2024 briefly halted cabin floorboard production across three OEMs. Thus, vigilance is critical. Stakeholders must strengthen dual-sourcing, invest in additive manufacturing, and, most of all, attract and retain skilled labor. Only through such holistic resilience can the business jet market transition from reactive production adjustments to a sustainable cadence that meets customer expectations without compromising quality.

Leasing And Fractional Ownership Expand Access, Redefining Utilization Metrics Globally

Leasing and fractional models are rewriting the rulebook on ownership economics. NetJets operates a fleet that surpassed 1 000 aircraft in January 2024, while Flexjet’s tally stands at 270, both posting record-high flight schedules. VistaJet reported 220 000 program hours flown in 2023 and is on pace to exceed that by mid-November 2024. Ascend by Cirium counts 280 business jets under operating lease worldwide, up from 190 in 2021, reflecting stronger appetite among banks and alternative lenders. These structures offer capital-light entry points for companies hesitant to place full purchase orders yet unwilling to depend on ad-hoc charter.

Their impact ripples beyond financing. Fractional operators drive aircraft at least twice as intensively as corporate owners, pushing mid-life airframes into heavy checks sooner and thus generating MRO demand. High utilization also accelerates cabin refresh cycles, spurring interior-modification revenue streams. In the business jet market, the resulting data troves—hours flown, mission profiles, maintenance touchpoints—feed algorithms that refine residual-value forecasts and influence insurance underwriting. New entrants such as France’s OpenJet and Dubai’s JetLease also employ app-based booking platforms that integrate carbon calculators and slot-availability forecasts, satisfying the modern traveler’s craving for transparency. For decision makers, the lesson is clear: integrating leasing or fractional options into fleet strategy not only optimizes capital but also aligns with shifting expectations of flexibility, sustainability, and digital convenience that now define the forward-looking market.

As we detailed in Just A Little Bit Better, the first step in Infinium’s process (see graphic above) is the production of green hydrogen, one of the two feedstocks for the eFuels process. Green hydrogen is produced by separating the hydrogen and oxygen of water molecules using an electrolyzer that is powered by renewable energy. The next step is to combine that hydrogen with the other feedstock, carbon dioxide (CO2).

Project Roadrunner will convert waste CO2 and use 150 MW of new wind generation capacity secured from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

The fuels produced will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported. Under an agreement with airline group IAG, the SAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under a recently enacted SAF mandate, which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK be sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.",,N,,2025-05-23 17:56:39.649762

GFO will install new Net Zero Emissions Technology and develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit.

Construction is expected to begin in November and be completed in May 2026.

ACADIA PARISH, La. – Green Fuels Operating PC (GFO) announced it will invest $110 million to transform the historic Evangeline Processing Facility in Acadia Parish into a Net Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) refinery. The company is expected to create 60 direct new jobs with an average annual salary of $80,000, more than 80% higher than the parish average wage.

In addition to Green Fuels deploying its NZET technology at the shuttered Acadiana facility, which first opened in 1957, GFO plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel. The existing facility located in the unincorporated community of Evangeline is outfitted with 15 storage tanks that have a total capacity exceeding 350,000 barrels, and will remain operational while the new GFO refining unit is developed.

“Under Louisiana’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, it is critical that we keep pace with the changing needs of the industry, including reopening and reenergizing legacy operations like Canal Companies with technology-driven strategies,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “GFO’s innovative NZET technology does just that, and their decision to modernize this historic facility shows that Louisiana is positioned to win, diversifying our thriving energy sector and keeping us a leader in U.S. energy production.”

The company plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system. It will also source local crude to support regional producers alongside feedstock delivered via pipeline and barge.

“America’s energy independence requires more than just drilling — it demands that we refine our own oil here at home rather than shipping it overseas only to buy back finished fuels at premium prices,” GFO CEO Derek Williamson said. “Our revolutionary NZET refining technology solves the 150-year-old problem of refinery emissions, enabling us to build clean refineries in the communities where oil is produced, creating local jobs and energy security.”

GFO expects to start construction at its first Louisiana location in November and complete the project in May 2026. Once completed, the company said the upgraded facility will further position it as a leader in low-carbon energy production.

“We are thrilled to welcome Green Fuels to Acadia Parish, and we’re excited that their arrival will bring good-paying jobs for our residents,” Acadia Police Jury President Beau Petitjean said. “This facility has a long history in Acadia Parish, and seeing new investment in a legacy industrial refinery is a testament to the strength of our community and the potential for new development.”

“Green Fuels Operating’s $110 million investment is a game-changer for Acadia Parish,” Acadia Parish Chamber of Commerce & Economic Development President & CEO Elizabeth I. Miller said. “This project brings together innovation, sustainability, and economic opportunity in a way that honors our energy legacy while forging a bold path forward. We’re proud to see this kind of forward-thinking development choosing Acadia Parish — creating quality jobs, revitalizing a historic asset, and reinforcing our position as a hub for cutting-edge energy solutions.”

To win the project in Acadia Parish, LED offered a competitive incentive project, including the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

“We’re thrilled to see this significant investment coming to Acadia Parish, revitalizing a historic facility while bringing next-generation energy technology to our region,” One Acadiana President and CEO Troy Wayman said. “GFO’s investment is a perfect example of how Acadiana’s energy legacy and future are deeply connected.

From reducing emissions to promoting greener technologies, industry players must navigate complex regulations, funding constraints, and evolving customer expectations.

At the forefront of this transition is the International Air Cargo Association (TIACA), which spearheads initiatives to guide businesses—large and small—toward more sustainable operations. In this exclusive C-Suite interview, Glyn Hughes, TIACA’s Director General, shares his insights on the industry’s key challenges, the role of collaboration, and the concrete steps TIACA is taking to drive long-term sustainability in air cargo.

Leadership and innovation in sustainability For TIACA, sustainability is a broad commitment that extends beyond carbon emissions. Speaking about the TIACA BlueSky program, Hughes emphasises, “Each organisation should establish a strategy specific to their operation, encompassing environmental, waste, people, efficiency, and community aspects.” Designed to support businesses on their sustainability journey, the program assesses their current performance across key criteria. It provides a personalised dashboard with targeted insights, guiding organisations on areas for improvement.

Global collaboration for a greener future Sustainability in air cargo requires a collective effort, and TIACA has made partnerships a core part of its strategy. “TIACA very much focuses on collaboration and partnerships,” Hughes says. The organisation shares its Insights Report, Roadmap to Industry Sustainability, and other key resources across the industry. Additionally, TIACA works closely with ESG experts and hosts the annual TIACA Sustainability Awards to highlight innovative solutions driving environmental progress.

Navigating challenges in sustainable air cargo

Achieving sustainability goals is not without obstacles. “Information overload is as challenging as lack of information,” Hughes points out, noting that regulations such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, CORSIA, EU ETS, CSRD, and ReFuelEU, create complexities for businesses, particularly smaller ones. “Carbon Offsetting is a good example,” Hughes shares. “Some smaller organisations would like to offset their emissions, either on a shipment level or for a complete business activity.” To help make that process simple, TIACA launched an Invest in Climate Action platform, enabling companies to purchase carbon credits and invest in sustainable projects in developing regions.

Projects making an impact

TIACA is actively leading several initiatives to make sustainability more accessible. “As mentioned, we have our annual Sustainability Survey, Industry Sustainability Roadmap, BlueSky assessment program, Climate Action platform, and a newly launched Training library which provides numerous ESG and general cargo training solutions,” Hughes outlines. These programs offer industry-wide assessments and targeted tools to help companies take concrete steps toward sustainability.

The future of sustainable air cargo Looking ahead, TIACA is aligning its efforts with global net-zero goals. “TIACA fully supports industry net-zero by 2050 targets. We also advocate for enhancing industry action in support of the United Nations 17 SDGs,” Hughes states. This includes pushing for greater investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and the global accessibility of SAF technology.

Beyond SAF, alternative energy sources will also play a crucial role. “SAF will need to grow exponentially from the less than 1% we see today to about 65% of industry fuel usage to help achieve the net-zero target by 2050,” Hughes says. He also emphasises the importance of green hydrogen, electrification for ground transport, and AI-driven efficiency improvements in making air cargo operations more sustainable.

Tracking progress and measuring success TIACA’s sustainability surveys provide valuable insights into industry progress. “On the positive side, the industry has taken huge steps to reduce usage of single-use plastic, and has invested heavily in modern energy-efficient fleets of aircraft and ground vehicles,” Hughes shares. However, he also notes a growing gap: “We are seeing fragmentation with larger organisations having dedicated teams and strategies in place, while smaller organisations find it more of a challenge.”

Supporting smaller businesses Bridging this gap, TIACA is helping SMEs access tailored sustainability solutions. “The BlueSky program is the best vehicle as it allows a company to receive specific personalised dashboards highlighting what they are doing well and where they need to provide more attention,” Hughes explains. By providing SMEs with structured insights and resources, TIACA ensures that sustainability is not just for major players but for businesses of all sizes.

A vision for sustainable air cargo As the industry continues its journey toward sustainability, Hughes underscores the importance of a responsible and inclusive approach. “The role air cargo plays in supporting the global economy is crucial in enabling enhanced global prosperity for all. So, we must safeguard this industry by being responsible, good global citizens,” he says. Beyond environmental impact, sustainability must also address social factors, creating opportunities for all, “regardless of gender, religion, academic background, or physical abilities.”

The power of collective action For Hughes, collective action is not just beneficial—it’s essential. “Sustainability is increasingly becoming a key enabler of business with partners, customers, employees, regulators, and financial institutions demanding action. We should all therefore do what we can,” he urges. He stresses that the industry’s collective efforts will not only drive meaningful change but also help demonstrate to regulators that air cargo is capable of managing its own sustainability journey, potentially reducing the need for additional regulation.

As TIACA continues to lead the charge in sustainability, its initiatives, partnerships, and strategic programs will play a critical role in shaping the air cargo industry’s greener future.

They revealed how the use of a different catalyst material can overcome issues with current Li-CO₂ batteries, making them more commercially viable and eco-friendly.

Li-CO₂ batteries are considered to be the next frontier energy-storage technology because of their ability to greatly outperform today’s lithium-ion batteries. They have a high energy density and reduce carbon emissions by absorbing CO2. But key challenges to making the batteries commercially viable include wearing out quickly, failing to recharge and relying on expensive rare materials such as platinum.

Recharging a Li-CO₂ battery requires breaking down lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃), which is formed as part of the chemical reaction, to release lithium and CO₂.

“One of the biggest challenges with these batteries is something called ‘overpotential’ – the extra energy needed to get the reaction going. You can think of it like cycling uphill before you can coast,” explained Siddharth Gadkari, co-author of the study and lecturer in chemical process engineering.

To overcome this ‘overpotential’ requires printing the right catalyst material on the porous positive electrode. Yet these catalysts are typically made from expensive, rare metals.

The team found an alternative catalyst, caesium phosphomolybdate (CPM), which is low-cost and can be manufactured at room temperature.

To understand how CPM worked, the researchers dismantled the battery after charging and discharging to study the chemical changes inside. They found that Li₂CO₃ could be reliably built up and removed, essential for long-term use.

Computer modelling then revealed how CPM offered the ideal surface for key chemical reactions. The material was shown to make the battery stable for 107 cycles, while storing 2.5 times the amount of charge of a lithium-ion battery.

“What we’ve shown is that CPM flattens that hill, meaning the battery loses far less energy during each charge and discharge,” said Gadkari.

Daniel Commandeur, study co-author, said: “What’s exciting about this discovery is that it combines strong performance with simplicity.

“We’ve shown that it’s possible to build efficient lithium-CO₂ batteries using affordable, scalable materials – no rare metals required. Our findings also open the door to designing even better catalysts in the future.”

If commercialised, these batteries could help cut emissions from vehicles and industrial sources – and scientists even imagine they could operate on Mars, where the atmosphere is 95% CO₂.

The Surrey team will now conduct further research into how these catalysts interact with electrodes and electrolytes. They will also focus upcoming tests on evaluating how the battery performs under different CO₂ pressures.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_battery-space-green-energy-charge-icon_Credit_Dima-Zel_shutterstock_1786180883_800x500.png?itok=QgPebtzL,N,,2025-05-23 17:56:49.912969

The all-cash transaction, valued at £1.8 billion, will integrate the UK-based catalyst and process technology provider into Honeywell’s Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) segment.

The deal enhances Honeywell’s ability to serve the refining and petrochemical markets while enabling it, for the first time, to deliver a comprehensive suite of technologies for producing low-emission fuels. These include sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), blue hydrogen, and blue ammonia — all central to energy security and decarbonization strategies worldwide.

“The acquisition of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business broadens Honeywell’s role as a world-class technology provider of critical energy needed to drive growth into the future,” said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. “As demand for diversified sources of energy continues accelerating, we will better enable Honeywell to offer the innovation our customers need.”

Complementary technology and expanded reach

Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies segment brings over 1,900 employees and a global footprint, with headquarters in London and operations across the U.S., Europe, and India. The business specializes in catalyst manufacturing and licensing of process technologies, directly complementing Honeywell’s UOP unit, which already supplies catalysts and process solutions to the refining and petrochemicals sectors.

By combining the two portfolios, Honeywell will expand its installed base and gain access to new, high-growth end markets. Customers will benefit from integrated offerings that span technology licensing, engineering, services, and catalyst supply — all designed to convert hydrocarbon and renewable feedstocks into valuable products with lower carbon intensity.

“As we continue to expand and evolve our ESS portfolio, acquiring Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business will provide our customers a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to transition their businesses to high-value products with lower emissions,” said Ken West, President and CEO of Honeywell’s ESS segment.

Strategic realignment continues

The acquisition forms part of a broader transformation at Honeywell, which is repositioning its portfolio around three core growth areas: automation, aviation, and energy transition. Earlier this year, Honeywell announced plans to spin off its Aerospace Technologies and Advanced Materials businesses, creating three standalone public companies, each with focused strategies and markets.

Since December 2023, Honeywell has undertaken several major transactions to reshape its industrial portfolio. These include acquiring Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, the LNG business from Air Products, Sundyne, and Carrier Global’s Access Solutions division. Concurrently, the company has moved to divest its Personal Protective Equipment business, which is expected to close by mid-2025.

These transactions align with Honeywell’s capital deployment strategy and aim to drive organic growth, simplify operations, and strengthen the company’s core capabilities in technology and process automation.

Accelerating the energy transition

Honeywell’s growing ESS division has become a cornerstone of its push into cleaner, more efficient energy solutions.

E3 Lithium, Pure Lithium Progress Lithium Extraction, Battery Technology

Initial results of a study show lithium concentrate made by E3 Lithium can produce battery-ready lithium metal anodes using Pure Lithium’s technology, according to a May 22 news release.

As part of the study, E3 said several variations of its lithium chloride concentrate were used to make lithium metal anodes at Pure Lithium’s Boston facility. The lithium chloride was electrodeposited as pure lithium metal onto a copper substrate to create battery ready anodes, which were then assembled by Pure Lithium into batteries.

“The results of this study concluded that an easily producible version of E3’s lithium concentrate provided the most cost-effective feedstock for use in Pure Lithium’s batteries,” E3 said in the release. “It also demonstrated the robustness of Pure Lithium’s process, showing no performance differences between batteries made using lithium chloride from E3’s Leduc Brines, and those made from Pure Lithium’s standard sources.”

Results, according to the news release, showed the brine streams all achieved a very high purity level, greater than 99.9% pure lithium metal; and cells achieved over 500 cycles to date.

E3 said it continues to collaborate with Pure Lithium to develop and plan an integrated process capable of delivering the highest purity, lowest cost lithium metal anodes.

USGS: Geothermal Energy in Nevada’s Great Basin Could Play Larger Role

(Reuters) Geothermal energy in the Great Basin of Nevada and adjoining states could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply, the U.S. Geological Survey said May 22.

The projected 10% would be a major increase, considering geothermal energy currently contributes less than 1% to the nation’s power supply, the agency said in a note.

“Provisional assessment shows potential for 135 gigawatts of baseload power—if current technology works at scale in Nevada and 5 adjoining states,” it noted.

Geothermal energy refers to heat generated within the Earth that can be harnessed for uses including heating, cooling and electricity generation.

With adequate technological advancements in coming years, the geothermal potential in the Great Basin is sufficient to fulfill a significant portion of the nation's electrical requirements, the agency added.

Following the assessment in the Great Basin, the next region to be evaluated will be the Williston Basin in North Dakota, according to the agency.

Deutsche ReGas Gets EU Funding for Lubmin Hydrogen Project

(Reuters) Deutsche ReGas on May 21 said it will receive 112 million euros (US$126.97 million) worth of public grants from the EU’s Hydrogen Bank for a renewable hydrogen project at Lubmin on Germany’s Baltic Sea coast.

The grant comes under EU funding schemes to promote electrolysis processes that use carbon-free electricity to kick-start a local economy producing hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels.

ReGas said the hydrogen production at Lubmin, for which the funding will be spread over 10 years, can cut 1.6 MMmt of CO2.

The EU subsidy is designed to help to close price differences between green hydrogen production costs and conventional energy prices.

The funding was awarded in a 992 million-euro auction, the second for the Hydrogen Bank, in which 15 projects from five countries were awarded money, ReGas said in a statement.

ReGas is a private developer and operator of energy infrastructure, including floating storage and regasification units and hydrogen electrolyzers.

The Lubmin plant, located near where ReGas used to import LNG on a floating reception terminal in the aftermath of the 2022 energy crisis, aims to make use of access to offshore wind energy and Baltic Sea water that can be used in the electrolysis process to make hydrogen. It is also close to both power transmission grids and a new hydrogen core transport network, set to start between 2025 and 2032.

""These solutions support our goal for 100% clean and renewable energy and will add new generation to the grid in these markets,” said Urvi Parekh, global head of energy for Meta.

The agreements lift AES’ contractual arrangements with major global hyperscalers to 10.1 gigawatts (GW), the company said.

“By providing energy solutions that offer fast time-to-power and low-cost electricity, we continue to be the partner of choice for companies, like Meta, at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation,” said AES President and CEO Andrés Gluski.

TotalEnergies Flips On Its Largest Solar Project in Europe

Paris-based oil major TotalEnergies has inaugurated a cluster of five solar projects in Seville, Spain, that together make the company’s largest solar field in Europe.

Combined, the solar projects have an installed capacity of 263 MW and the ability to produce 515 gigawatt hours per year of electricity, the company said May 22 in a news release. That is equivalent to the amount needed to power 150,000 households. The field has about 400,000 bifacial solar panels with trackers.

Olivier Jouny, senior vice President of renewables at TotalEnergies, said the project contributes to Spain’s goal of having renewables make up 80% of its energy mix by 2030. “With our 1,700 employees in Spain, we are building a competitive integrated power portfolio that combines renewables and flexible gas-fired power plants to deliver clean firm power to our customers,” Jouny said.

Most of the electricity produced will be sold via long-term power purchase agreements, and the rest sold on the wholesale market.

India’s Reliance to Start Solar Module Factory This Year, Exec Says

(Reuters) Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries will start its solar photovoltaic modules factory this year, a company executive said May 22.

“We are today building three bigger factories ... in order to produce clean energy requirements,” said Partha P. Maitra, president of strategy and initiatives at Reliance Industries.

India has been scrambling to meet its clean energy targets after falling short in 2022.

Over the past year, the country has ramped up investments in the sector, but needs to double capacity additions over the next five years to meet its target of 500-GW non-fossil power capacity by 2030, a Global Energy Monitor report showed.

Reliance aims to eventually scale up solar module capacity to 20 GW per year, Maitra said.

Its battery and micro power electronics factory will start next year, he said.

“If it happens we will be the no. 2 solar PV producer in the world. We will produce roughly 14% of total solar PV modules outside China,” the executive said.

Doral Renewables Secures $1.5B in Financing for Mammoth Solar Projects

Philadelphia-based Doral Renewables has closed on $1.5 billion of debt and tax equity financing for solar projects that are part of its 1.3-GW Mammoth Solar facility, the company said May 19.

The construction financing is for the Mammoth South, Mammoth Central I and Mammoth Central II projects, which each have a capacity of 300 MW and long-term power purchase agreements with utilities in place. Combined, the three solar projects—located in Indiana’s Pulaski County—will utilize more than 1 million U.S.-made solar panels, Doral said in the news release.

“We are thrilled to close these landmark financings in support of the construction of the remaining three phases of our Mammoth Solar project,” Doral Renewables CFO Evan Speece said.

KeyBanc Capital Markets, Banco Santander and HSBC Bank USA acted as coordinated lead arrangers for the $1.3 billion construction debt financing for the projects, which consisted of $412 million of construction-to-term loan facilities, $614 million of tax equity bridge loans and a $259 million letter of credit facility, according to the release

Doral also executed its first tax equity with Truist Bank, which made a more than $200-million tax equity commitment for Mammoth South.

Marathon Capital Markets served as the tax equity adviser, while McDermott Will & Emery provided legal counsel to Doral. CCA Group served as the tax equity adviser and Milbank LLP provided tax equity legal counsel to Truist. Norton Rose Fulbright provided legal counsel to the lenders, according to the release.

The three solar projects are scheduled to begin commercial operations in fourth-quarter 2026.

Wind

Equinor, Polenergia Agree on Polish Offshore Wind Project

(Reuters) Norway’s Equinor and Poland’s Polenergia made a final investment decision for the project to build two wind farms off the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea, the Warsaw-based company said May 19.

The two farms, each with a generation capacity of 720 MW are set to cost a total of about 6.4 billion euros (US$7.20 billion) and start generating power in 2027 and be completed in 2028.

Investors—including PGE, Orlen, Equinor and Ørsted—are developing 6 GW of offshore capacity along the Polish coast set to come online by 2030. Auctions for projects in the second round are planned for 2025.

Poland is boosting offshore potential in the Baltic Sea estimated to be as high as 33 GW, according to the Polish Wind Energy Association.

Denmark Plans Offshore Wind Tender with up to $8.3B Subsidy

(Reuters) Denmark will launch an offshore wind tender with a capacity of 3 GW, enough to power three million homes, its energy ministry said May 19, offering subsidies to developers of up to 55.2 billion Danish crowns (US$8.32 billion).

The offshore wind industry has grappled with skyrocketing costs, higher interest rates and supply chain bottlenecks—prompting governments to halt or postpone tenders due to a lack of interest from bidders.

“We need more secure green power and energy to make Denmark and Europe independent of energy from Russia,” Energy Minister Lars Aagaard said in a statement.

The bids offered in the tender will determine the level of subsidy needed, with a cap set at 55.2 billion crowns over 20 years.

“It is the bid price and the development of electricity prices that determine whether it will be necessary to support the projects, or whether money will come to the state,” the ministry said.

Denmark in January announced it would halt all ongoing offshore wind tenders to revamp its model, saying that a framework where no subsidies were offered did not work under existing market conditions.

A month earlier, the Nordic country failed to attract any bids in its biggest offshore wind tender yet, with analysts pointing to a rigid auction model and a failure to adapt to a changed economic reality for renewable energy projects.

Infinium will be using Electric Hydrogen's HYPRPlant technology in its Project Roadrunner, which will produce sustainable aviation fuel and other eFuels at a location near Pecos.

Robert Schuetzle, Infinium chief executive officer

""We do use waste CO2 as an input and have a great partner in Kinetik Holdings.""

Project Roadrunner will also provide revenue streams for its oil and gas partners by turning CO2 into a commodity.

He noted the company has built facilities in West Texas before and found it to be a great experience with a great labor market. Reeves County has also been business-friendly, he added.

The project will create a number of jobs in West Texas. Schuetzle said it will create many construction jobs and jobs for its contractors. Long-term, it will create jobs in operations, maintenance, logistics and field management.

Currently under construction, Roadrunner has secured 150 megawatts of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement. Schuetzle said Infinium also has the ability to tap into the electric grid so the plant can run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Infinium selected electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100-megawatt HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility, but will also have the capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities. Electric Hydrogen’s proprietary electrochemical stacks are built at its Massachusetts gigafactory while the chemical process modules are manufactured in Texas.

Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s chief executive officer and co-founder

""This cutting-edge project exemplifies how low-cost, industrial-scale clean hydrogen production will drive new markets for American-made fuels and support the buildout of domestic manufacturing facilities.""

A majority of the sustainable aviation fuel that will be produced will be exported, said Schuetzle.

""I see us being similar to the way liquefied natural gas grew — an abundant U.S. resource that generates fuel and exports it,"" he said.

In a defining moment for the aviation industry’s sustainability journey, Etihad Airways has stepped into the spotlight by co-hosting the IATA Regional Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Workshop 2025 in Abu Dhabi, the heart of aviation innovation in the Middle East. Held on May 22–23, this high-stakes gathering of global airline leaders, policymakers, and environmental strategists marks a turning point in the push for a greener future in flight.

As aviation grapples with mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediate, viable solution. But SAF adoption is still in its infancy. High costs, limited availability, and fragmented policies remain major hurdles. The Abu Dhabi workshop aims to break through those barriers—with urgency and purpose.

Building a SAF-Powered Future Begins in Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi, already known for bold moves in clean energy and future-forward aviation, provided a fitting stage for this workshop. With Etihad co-hosting alongside IATA and the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority, the event positioned the emirate as a regional champion for climate-aligned aviation.

The two-day agenda brought together airlines, airports, fuel producers, and regulators to focus on one mission—scaling sustainable fuel at speed. Discussions centered on policy harmonization, operational challenges, and the economics of SAF implementation.

What’s Driving the SAF Conversation in 2025?

Demand for air travel is back. But so are climate concerns. Industry leaders now face a critical inflection point: grow without compromise. That’s where SAF comes in.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. It’s the aviation sector’s most powerful tool in meeting global climate targets. However, to move from pilot projects to mainstream adoption, key systems must align—supply chains, certifications, financial models, and regulatory frameworks.

That’s why this workshop matters. It’s more than a networking event—it’s an engine for action.

From Strategy to Implementation: Inside the Workshop

Participants explored the latest global policy trends shaping SAF uptake. Experts dissected the SAF lifecycle assessment, ensuring that what’s labeled “sustainable” actually delivers measurable climate benefits.

The event also unveiled the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, which includes tools for tracking fuel usage, verifying claims, and aligning with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) compliance.

Moreover, the introduction of the CADO SAF Registry and SAF Matchmaking platform showcased how digital innovation can boost transparency, collaboration, and investment in the SAF space.

Etihad’s Role: More Than a Host—A Climate Catalyst

Etihad isn’t just participating—it’s leading. The airline has been at the forefront of sustainable aviation, conducting SAF trials, investing in fuel research, and aligning its fleet strategy with long-term emissions goals.

By co-hosting this IATA workshop, Etihad reinforced its commitment not only to climate leadership but to regional transformation. It’s sending a signal to other Middle Eastern carriers, policymakers, and investors: the time for SAF isn’t “someday”—it’s now.

Why Collaboration Is the Only Way Forward

One of the workshop’s central messages was clear—no single actor can scale SAF alone. The entire aviation value chain must come together: airlines, refineries, airports, government agencies, and financiers.

Scaling production, reducing costs, and improving accessibility will require shared risk, bold policy, and a common goal. And workshops like this accelerate that alignment.

More importantly, creating price parity with fossil fuels is essential. Until SAF becomes commercially practical, even the most climate-conscious carriers face impossible economics.

The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Passengers and the Planet

As airlines incorporate more SAF into their operations, travelers will feel the impact. Some may soon have the option to offset emissions directly by selecting SAF-powered flights. Corporate travel programs may start demanding SAF usage. Ticketing systems could evolve to reflect a new layer of eco-conscious booking.

Beyond the customer experience, the adoption of SAF contributes to real-world environmental gains—cleaner air, lower emissions, and more resilient ecosystems. And every flight powered by SAF moves the industry closer to a net-zero future.

A Defining Year for Aviation’s Green Transition

A scathing short-seller report from Culper Research accused the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft company of systematically misleading investors about its development progress. The report alleges everything from timeline misrepresentations to questionable flight test claims.

As someone who covers Archer Aviation regularly, I'll admit the report raises some legitimate concerns that deserve investor attention. But after reviewing the evidence and considering the broader context, I'm not selling my shares. Here's why.

Aviation timelines are notoriously optimistic

Let's start with the elephant in the room: Yes, Archer Aviation's publicly stated development timelines are likely highly optimistic. The company has repeatedly accelerated its commercial launch targets, most recently promising United Arab Emirates (UAE) operations by late 2025 despite originally targeting 2026.

But here's the thing: This is incredibly common in the aviation industry, and doubly so for an entirely new form of flight like electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner was delayed by more than three years. Airbus's A380 faced similar setbacks. SpaceX has missed countless launch deadlines (though they eventually deliver). The Federal Aviation Administration's certification processes are notoriously unpredictable.

When you're pioneering electric aircraft that take off like helicopters and fly like airplanes, delays should be expected -- not shocking. The real question isn't whether Archer Aviation hits every timeline. It's whether the company is making credible technical progress toward commercial viability.

The ""fraud"" thesis feels overblown

Culper Research's core argument is that Archer Aviation is purposely misleading shareholders. They've taken what could be called a ""short sell with receipts"" approach -- citing documented timeline discrepancies and selectively analyzed footage as evidence of deception.

I'll give Culper credit: They did their homework. The inconsistencies between Archer Aviation's public statements and internal communications with the Salinas Fire Department are concerning and merit clarification. The photos showing Archer Aviation's Midnight aircraft in partial assembly in April 2025, shortly after claiming it was ""fully assembled,"" deserve a direct response.

Unfortunately, Archer Aviation's response so far has been defensive and dismissive. In its only public refutation of these claims as of this writing, the company stated: ""Christian Lamarco has a reputation for 'shorting and distorting' various stocks. Culper is not a credible research institution... His claims are baseless.""

That's not good enough. Investors aren't looking for character attacks -- they're looking for specifics. A transparent response about development challenges and certification progress would go much further in restoring confidence.

That said, Culper's leap from timeline slippage to deliberate fraud feels like a stretch. There's a meaningful difference between aggressive projections and systemic deceit. Most of what Culper surfaces reads like standard aerospace growing pains -- ambitious messaging on the front end; reality catching up on the back end.

The UAE launch is essentially immaterial

Much of the current controversy revolves around whether Archer Aviation can launch commercial operations in the UAE by late 2025. But here's a crucial point: The UAE launch is essentially irrelevant to the long-term thesis.

The core opportunity is FAA certification for operations in the U.S. -- where the real demand, revenue potential, and infrastructure scale exist. A pilot program in Abu Dhabi may help build brand equity or validate operational procedures, but it won't meaningfully change Archer Aviation's long-term value.

In fact, it's increasingly clear that the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are shaping up to be the real commercial debut. If Archer Aviation can operate aircraft safely and reliably during the Games, that could serve as a massive proof of concept for urban air mobility.

Premier partners don't waste time on questionable technology

This is where Culper's short thesis starts to crack. If Archer Aviation's technology were truly broken or years behind, why are serious industry players lining up to back it?

Palmer Luckey's Anduril Industries just signed an exclusive agreement with Archer Aviation to co-develop hybrid vertical aircraft for the Department of Defense. Luckey isn't known for backing unproven concepts. His defense start-up beat out Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman in the Air Force's autonomous systems program.

Then there's Palantir Technologies, which signed on to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into Archer Aviation's flight systems and manufacturing stack. CEO Alex Karp personally announced the partnership at Palantir's AIPCon event.

United Airlines and Stellantis also re-upped their investments in Archer Aviation earlier this year, as part of a $430 million funding round. United brings operational expertise. Stellantis brings scale manufacturing and capital discipline.

These companies don't enter long-term agreements lightly. If Archer Aviation's aircraft were fundamentally unworkable, these partnerships wouldn't exist.

Defense vs. commercial development timelines

One point the short report largely ignores: Defense applications follow different timelines and certification pathways than commercial passenger transport.

Archer Aviation already has a $142 million contract from the U.S. Air Force and is delivering aircraft for evaluation. These defense-grade aircraft don't need FAA certification for combat or logistics roles. That means Archer Aviation could begin generating real revenue from defense use cases while commercial approval is still pending.

The Anduril partnership enhances this pathway. Military applications of electric vertical takeoff and landing technology could materialize faster than passenger mobility, giving Archer Aviation a second viable market.

A long-term investment remains long-term

Let me be clear: Archer Aviation has always been a high-risk, long-duration investment. The recent share price surge doesn't change the fundamental truth that aviation is hard, slow, and unforgiving.

Designing a new type of aircraft is hard. Certifying it is harder. Building out infrastructure and proving commercial viability? That's the ultimate challenge.

But that's also why the opportunity exists. If Archer Aviation succeeds, it won't just sell a few aircraft -- it will redefine how people move across congested urban corridors. The market potential remains enormous.

Culper's report is a useful reminder to stay grounded in execution realities. But it doesn't invalidate the broader thesis. Archer Aviation remains one of the best-positioned players in a field that could reshape the future of mobility.

The investment thesis remains intact

Yes, Archer Aviation faces real challenges. And yes, investors deserve a more substantive response to Culper's allegations.

But the long-term reasons to own this stock are unchanged. Strategic partnerships with heavy hitters Anduril, Palantir, United Airlines, and Stellantis point to real traction. Defense contracts offer an alternative path to revenue while the FAA certification process plays out. And the 2028 Olympics are a credible commercial milestone.

I didn't invest in Archer Aviation because I thought they'd hit every target on time. I invested because the upside of electric vertical flight is massive -- and because Archer Aviation is building serious partnerships to make it happen.

That's why I'm holding my shares.

HON has been actively following its business transformation strategy that aims to unlock value for its shareholders. As part of the strategy, the company recently sold its Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) business to Protective Industrial Products, Inc. (“PIP”).

PIP, a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment Partners, is engaged in manufacturing and distributing PPE products globally. It’s worth noting that the transaction was valued at $1.325 billion and was carried out in cash.

The divestiture will enable Honeywell to focus more on its core businesses and realign its operating segments to three megatrends, which are automation, the future of aviation and energy transition. The company’s PPE divestment follows the sale of its Lifestyle and Performance Footwear business in 2021 and allows it to exit the PPE sector.

Concurrently, Honeywell declared its plan to acquire Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business unit for £1.8 billion in cash. Based in London, UK, the Catalyst Technologies business provides catalysts for the chemicals and energy industries with operations in the United States, Europe and India.

The inclusion of Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies unit will enable HON to strengthen its UOP business and grow its installed base across the petrochemical and refining catalysts. The buyout will allow Honeywell to provide solutions for the production of low-emission fuels like sustainable aviation fuel, sustainable methanol, blue ammonia and blue hydrogen. HON will incorporate the Catalyst Technologies business into its Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) segment.

Honeywell anticipates the buyout to be accretive to its earnings in the first year, strengthen the ESS segment’s growth potential and create cost synergies. Management expects the transaction to be completed in the first half of 2026, conditioned on the fulfillment of certain customary closing conditions.

Zacks Rank & Price Performance

Honeywell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s Aerospace segment is witnessing solid momentum, driven by strength in the defense business and growth in air transport flight hours. Strong demand across the commercial aviation aftermarket business is aiding the segment.

In the past year, HON stock has gained 12% compared with the industry’s 7.9% growth.

However, weakness in the Process solutions business, due to lower demand for smart energy and thermal solutions, has been affecting the Industrial Automation segment's performance. Also, softness in the productivity solutions and services business, owing to lower demand in Europe, remains a concern.

When it comes to the airline industry, reputation is everything. It influences loyalty, attracts new passengers, drives revenue growth and shapes brand strength in an increasingly competitive market.

Word of mouth, online and off, still remains one of the most powerful factors in how reputations are built, maintained, or damaged. At CARMA, a global media intelligence and reputation consultancy, we set out to understand what really drives airline reputation in today’s climate. Focussing on two of the most emotive topics, accessibility and sustainability, we analysed how they are reflected across the media, in social media conversations and passenger perception.

For our study with Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX), we conducted a comprehensive year-long study tracking more than 55,000 articles across traditional and social media. The analysis covered 12 leading global airlines, including British Airways, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic across the UK, US, UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.

It will come as little surprise that sustainability remained one of the most pressing issues in aviation throughout last year, given the industry’s environmental footprint. The topic received significant media attention, with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dominating much of the conversation. The broader landscape includes a range of other initiatives, from sustainable aircraft interiors and low-impact materials to innovations aimed at reducing carbon emissions across the travel experience.

Overall, the study found over half (53%) of news and mentions of aviation-related sustainability had positive sentiment, reflecting increasing recognition and encouragement of the industry’s efforts. Neutral sentiment made up a quarter (25%) of news and negative coverage stood at 22%, showing a mix of both optimism and scrutiny. Interestingly, the UK led the charge in discussions around sustainability, with 37% of coverage, closely followed by the US at 36%, highlighting the strong focus on aviation sustainability in these regions. Here, the breakdown of sentiment highlights the growing importance of sustainability in the airline sector, not just as an operational priority, but as a reputational driver closely tracked by both the media and passengers. Positive responses to meaningful sustainability efforts and achievements suggest these initiatives are well received and increasingly expected.

Our study also found that while discussions around inclusivity and accessibility in aviation have increased over recent years, reflecting greater awareness of passengers’ diverse needs, the volume of media discussions is relatively low. In 2024, accessibility accounted for just 1.2% of airline coverage and 2% of social media posts, suggesting that while accessibility is recognised as important, it has not yet broken through as a dominant media trend. Most of the coverage was neutral in tone (61%), with 30% positive and only 9% negative. The UK led in accessibility-related reporting with 43% of all coverage, followed by the US at 37% and the UAE at 11%.

One of the biggest spikes in accessibility reporting occurred last September, when Virgin Atlantic received widespread attention for its partnership with deaf Gladiators star Jodie Ounsley and deaf twin content creators, Hermon and Heroda Berhane. The trio were invited to test and provide feedback on recent improvements made for deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers, with insights to be shared with the airline’s Accessibility Advisory Board. The strong media response of 197 articles in just one day shows how impactful a major airline’s efforts can be, especially when tied to authentic partnerships with influential figures. Perhaps most importantly, it reflects a growing appetite for meaningful accessibility advancements within the industry.

As the airline industry faces increasing demand (and scrutiny) for sustainability and accessibility, it is clear that innovation and collaboration will be key drivers of success. For airline professionals, designers and aviation interiors experts, there is an opportunity to influence the future of passenger experience by shaping environments that are not only sustainable but also inclusive.

The growing attention on these topics in mainstream and social media signals a shift in passenger expectations and demands. However, while sustainability has steadily gained traction in media narratives, accessibility still receives comparatively limited attention. To bring these conversations further into the spotlight, airlines and industry players must be more proactive in amplifying their work, turning thoughtful design and meaningful initiatives into compelling, shareable stories.

For professionals across the sector, this is an opportunity to lead with innovative thinking, leveraging both sustainability-driven solutions and inclusive strategies. Those who embrace these challenges will not only enhance their brand reputation but will also help shape the future of air travel.

I thank Co-chairs Craig and Pocan and congratulate Co-chairs Hinson, Fedorchak, and Budzinski for joining me to strengthen this bipartisan caucus and continue working to inform our colleagues in the House of the value of biofuels for American energy abundance.”

“Increasing the production and availability of homegrown biofuels is a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to the all-of-the-above energy policy we need to stay ahead,” said Co-chair Craig. “I’m proud to be relaunching the Biofuels Caucus alongside my bipartisan colleagues this Congress so we can continue our work to lower prices at the pump, create opportunities for local producers and strengthen our energy security.”

“Biofuels are key to Iowa’s economy and key to American energy dominance,” said Co-chair Hinson. “Since coming to Congress, I have worked tirelessly to expand access to Iowa biofuels and support Iowa’s biofuels producers by fighting to secure permanent year-round E15, increase biofuels blending targets, and replace foreign energy with homegrown biofuels. I’m honored to co-lead the biofuels caucus and will continue working with President Trump and other caucus members to increase domestic energy production and support Iowa agriculture.”

“I am glad to join my colleagues in the Congressional Biofuels Caucus,” said Co-chair Pocan. “Corn growers in Wisconsin deserve to have an even playing field in the market dominated by the oil and gas industry. This Caucus will showcase how biofuels can help us reach our emissions reduction goals while investing in rural jobs and infrastructure.”

“Biofuels are a growing part of America’s energy strategy and another way North Dakota is helping fuel the world,” said Co-chair Fedorchak. “It’s an honor to serve as a co-chair of this bipartisan caucus to advance policies that will help expand domestic energy production, empower rural America, and deliver practical solutions for North Dakotans.”

“I came to Congress to be a strong voice for the people of Central and Southern Illinois—especially our hardworking farmers. Few issues are more critical to their success than strengthening the biofuels industry and expanding market opportunities,” said Co-chair Budzinski. “That’s why promoting the use of homegrown, sustainable biofuels has been a central focus of my work in Congress, and I’m looking forward to continuing that commitment as co-chair of this bipartisan caucus.

The Congressional Biofuels Caucus advocates for policies which reflect the capacity of American biofuels producers to meet the demand for reliable and affordable liquid fuels while growing rural economies, high-paying jobs, and value-added markets for agricultural commodities. The caucus recognizes biofuels are key to American energy independence and responsible stewardship of our resources.

Additional members of the caucus include: Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-SD), Darin LaHood (R-IL), Jim Baird (R-IN), Scott Peters (D-CA), Tom Emmer (R-MN), Andre Carson (D-IN), Ann Wagner (R-MO), Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO), James Comer (R-KY), Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), Sam Graves (R-MO), Don Bacon (R-NE), Mike Bost (R-IL), Pete Stauber (R-MN), Michelle Fischbach (R-MN), Randy Feenstra (R-IA), Marianette Miller Meeks (R-IA), Zach Nunn (R-IA), Mike Flood (R-NE), Eric Sorensen (D-IL), Brad Finstad (R-MN), Tracey Mann (R-KS), Derrick Van Orden (R-WI), Mark Alford (R-MO), Sharice Davids (D-KS), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-MI), Brian Jack (R-GA), and Mark Messmer (R-IN).",https://media-chadronradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/05/Adrian-Smith-Logo.png,N,,2025-05-23 11:56:43.868345

Keolis Commuter Services, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s operations and maintenance partner for the Commuter Rail, has launched an alternative fuel pilot utilizing renewable diesel for some locomotives. Usage of renewable diesel will cut emissions and reduce the system’s carbon footprint, helping the Commonwealth reach emissions reduction goals.

Developed in partnership with the MBTA, the pilot includes all locomotives that lay over at the Newburyport Commuter Rail facility, which are now being fueled with Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil. HVO is a much more sustainable alternative as it’s made from vegetable oil and animal fats and emits less carbon than fossil diesel.

“We’re pleased to partner with Keolis on this renewable diesel pilot as we continuously seek ways to reduce our carbon footprint,” said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng. “Testing alternative fuel sources for our Commuter Rail fleet joins other efforts at the T to lower our carbon emissions, and we look forward to evaluating the results of the pilot as we continue to increase resiliency across the system.”

“Getting people out of their cars and onto the train is a great first step, and we need to do more if we are going to reach the Commonwealth’s emissions goals,” said Abdellah Chajai, CEO and General Manager of Keolis. “This pilot program is a great opportunity to utilize an innovative new approach and can reduce CO2 emissions by more than 70% for these locomotives compared to fossil diesel. We’re pleased to partner with the MBTA to make this pilot project a success.”

So far, Keolis has seen steady locomotive performance with the use of renewable diesel. At the end of the pilot program, Keolis and MBTA will evaluate the performance of the renewable fuel and decide if it can be expanded to other locations across the Commuter Rail system.

Renewable diesel allows the MBTA and Keolis to more rapidly make strides towards cutting the Commuter Rail’s carbon footprint with the existing fleet.

Keolis Commuter Services has operated and maintained the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s commuter rail system, the sixth largest commuter rail operation in North America, for over ten years. KCS is a subsidiary of Keolis North America (KNA), both headquartered in Boston, and employs approximately 2,500 people throughout the region. KCS and KNA are part of Keolis Group, an innovative global leader in transit services with more than a century of passenger transportation experience and operations in 13 countries.

These shifts won’t just change how climate targets are set - they’ll reshape what climate leadership looks like beyond compliance.","This article has been provided by Ruaridh Welsh, consultant at EcoAct, a subsidiary of Schneider Electric.

In March, the SBTi launched the draft of its revised Corporate Net-Zero Standard for public consultation.

The update marks an important step forward in aligning corporate net-zero strategies with climate science. With changes to how companies are categorised, strengthened expectations on emissions reduction, and new guidance on removals and transparency, the draft standard aims to close the credibility gap in climate target-setting.

This revision comes amid growing concern about the gap between global climate ambition and action. Despite over 90% of global GDP being covered by national net-zero pledges, the UN’s latest Emissions Gap Report suggests the world remains on track for a 2.7°C rise this century. For businesses, this makes the case for more credible, science-aligned pathways clear—and urgent.

At EcoAct, we believe that true leadership in sustainability isn’t about ticking boxes or meeting minimum standards. It’s about delivering tangible, impactful results that align with global priorities. While it is still under consultation, businesses delaying action in anticipation of the upcoming guidance may fall behind, whereas early movers who have built science-based reduction strategies and are already implementing robust climate transition plans will be better positioned to adapt.

Here’s what the revised standard means for your business.

A more inclusive standard that reflects company context

One of the most notable changes is the introduction of differentiated requirements based on company size and geography. Larger businesses in high-income countries are classified under Category A and must meet all the standard’s criteria. Meanwhile, smaller firms in lower-income regions are placed in Category B, where some elements of the standard become optional.

This is a shift toward a more inclusive, globally relevant framework. For large corporates, the message is clear: the flexibility of earlier years is gone. With more resources comes more responsibility, and full compliance is expected. For smaller businesses, especially those operating in emerging markets, the updated approach offers recognition of their more limited capacity to act.

For all companies, this change underscores the importance of understanding not just what the standard requires, but why. It’s no longer just about meeting a benchmark. It’s about doing so in a way that reflects your operating context and your capacity to lead.

What this means for existing and planned targets?

If you’re setting near-term targets now, you can continue to use the current Corporate Net-Zero Standard (Version 1.2) and Near-Term Criteria (Version 5.2) until the end of 2026. Targets set under the existing frameworks will remain valid for five years or until the end of 2030, whichever comes first.

From 2027, companies will be expected to use Version 2.0 to set both near- and long-term targets. The SBTi has committed to developing a transition process for companies with validated targets in 2025–2026 to align with the new standard.

If you have existing near-term targets, these remain valid through to 2030, unless they are set beyond, which will need to be updated. For long-term targets, guidance is still forthcoming, and more clarity is expected during the second public consultation later this year.

In the meantime, companies should continue to act in line with current guidance. Early action will still lay a strong foundation for alignment with the revised standard.

What’s changing for Scope 3?

Scope 3 emissions remain a critical focus. For Category A companies, near-term targets covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3 are mandatory. However, long-term Scope 3 targets are not currently required, though this requirement could evolve with the consultation process.

This doesn’t mean Scope 3 can be deprioritised. Businesses should continue to improve data collection, value chain engagement and focused reduction strategies. In many sectors, Scope 3 accounts for the majority of emissions so it’s critical to address them even where long-term targets are not yet mandatory.

The draft standard also moves away from the previous percentage-based boundary approach (67% for near-term targets and 90% for long-term targets) to a more focused approach that prioritises the most relevant emission sources. Companies will need to identify ‘significant scope 3 categories’ (those representing 5% or more of total scope 3 emissions) and ‘emissions-intensive activities’ in their value chain. This shift aims to make scope 3 targets more effective at driving transformation where it matters most.

Additionally, the standard places greater emphasis on non-emission metrics and alignment targets. This includes measures such as the percentage of procurement from net-zero-aligned suppliers or the share of revenue from net-zero-aligned products. These alignment indicators offer alternative ways to demonstrate progress, particularly valuable for companies facing data challenges or those offering climate solutions.

Where do residual emissions come in?

The draft standard requires companies to neutralise any residual emissions that remain at the net-zero target year and thereafter. For Scope 1 residual emissions, companies are offered three proposed options:

1. Set mandatory removal targets alongside abatement targets

2. Receive recognition for voluntary removal targets

3. Address residuals through additional reductions, removals, or a combination of both

For Scope 3, Category A companies must ensure residual emissions are neutralised either by the responsible value chain partner or by providing support to enable their neutralisation.

All options limit removals to the small portion of emissions projected to remain at the net-zero year, typically less than 10% of base year emissions. Removals must meet high-integrity sustainability and quality criteria, with more specific standards to be developed through the consultation process.

Businesses already investing in high-quality removals may find themselves well aligned with the draft’s direction. Early planning will allow companies to integrate these requirements into their financial and strategic climate planning.

Where do carbon credits and BVCM fit in?

The draft continues to recognise Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM) as important, while maintaining a clear separation from the requirement to neutralise residual emissions at the net-zero target year.

BVCM activities, such as investing in climate solutions, financing external reduction projects, and purchasing carbon credits remain encouraged as valuable contributions to global climate goals. The SBTi is actively using the consultation process to gather feedback on how to better recognise BVCM, set reporting requirements and integrate these efforts into corporate climate strategies.

Notably, the guidance recommends that companies should aim to address 100% of their remaining emissions in line with recognised third-party frameworks, and also take responsibility for historic emissions. Companies are encouraged to look to broader frameworks such as the VCMI or ISO14068 to guide their current BVCM efforts.

Bottom line for businesses: The direction is clear and so is the call to action

While much of the standard is still under consultation, the direction is unmistakable: greater ambition, earlier action and more accountability are all on the horizon. Companies should not wait for the final version to begin aligning strategies with the emerging requirements.

The draft also introduces stronger requirements for data quality, with an emphasis on improving the traceability of emissions data over time. Category A companies will need to obtain third-party assurance of their GHG emissions inventory, including for relevant Scope 3 emissions sources.

Now is the time to assess your categorisation, revisit Scope 3 strategies, plan for removals and ensure your transition plan is robust and transparent.

It’s an uphill battle but it’s still gaining momentum.

Addressing climate change by reducing the carbon footprint of venues and tours is a growing concern, with transportation one of the largest sources of emissions.

According to a 2022 report by the UK-based Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, a typical arena tour can generate more than 5,500 tons of carbon dioxide and an audience can create more than 1,100 tons of CO2 per tour.

For artists and sports teams, air travel – private jets and commercial flights – is the biggest contributor with talent, crews and equipment flying long distances.

Ground transport – tour buses and semis – also add emissions, especially for large-scale productions requiring dozens of trucks. Audience travel to and from shows and games accounts for a large portion of total emission, reaching as high as 80%.

Artists including Billie Eilish and Coldplay, promoters and venue operators are trying to mitigate the impact with Eilish leading environmental activism with two new Overheated conferences planned for the UK and Germany, and Coldplay publishing a carbon report that aims to significantly reduce emissions.

According to the band’s website, Coldplay pledged to cut their tour’s direct emissions by more than 50% compared to their 2016-2017 outing and they are working with their partners and suppliers to reduce their impact and emissions as much as possible.

“We’ve teamed up with DHL as the tour’s official logistics partner in order to minimize emissions from freight and transportation. As leaders in the field of sustainable transport and logistics, DHL support the tour by offering solutions to minimize logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts, from advanced biofuels in the air to electric vehicles on land,” the band stated via the website.

Concert trucking can embrace sustainability by prioritizing best practices that can minimize their environmental impact including regular maintenance, which ensures trucks are in optimal condition for better fuel use. Many companies are investing in newer, more fuel-efficient models and adopting technology to track and reduce fuel consumption. Tours are also using trucks powered by renewable natural gas and biodiesel or hydrogenated vegetable oil. Trucking companies are also training drivers to minimize idling, which consumes a significant amount of fuel.

By prioritizing efficient fleet management, adopting alternative fuels and limiting time spent idling, concert tours can minimize their environmental impact.

Green transportation can also include train travel, electric buses and limiting flights.

According to Liverpool FC’s The Red Way report issued on Earth Day (April 22), the team made significant steps to reduce emissions from travel, including eliminating 100% of carbon emissions from domestic team flights through investment in sustainable aviation fuel. The club also uses hydrotreated vegetable oil to fuel team buses, which creates a reduction in carbon emissions of up to 90% compared to regular diesel.

Venues are also doing their part to reduce their transportation-related carbon footprint.

UBS Arena, home of the NHL’s New York Islanders, recently celebrated its 1 millionth Long Island Rail Road rider and the venue sponsors a “Ride, Dine and Have a Good Time” program to incentivize and encourage people to take the train.

Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington, and PHX Arena (formerly Footprint Center), in Phoenix, Arizona, offer free transit with an event ticket.

“We want to be a force for good,” said Rosie Selle, vice president of marketing for Climate Pledge Arena. “It’s authentic to who we are as people at the arena, but also what our arena brand stands for.”

For the second year, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Commuter Rail and Keolis Commuter Services are providing round-trip, special event train service to concerts at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. Train service has been scheduled for the full lineup of 2025 summer concerts including AC/DC, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, The Weeknd, George Strait, Coldplay and Morgan Wallen. Round-trip tickets are $20 and can be purchased two weeks before each show date.

Companies are offsetting their carbon use by supporting carbon sequestration projects, which is the process of capturing and storing atmospheric CO2. The goal is to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.

Companies are enhancing the process by supporting reforestation projects including the Orion Amphitheater in Huntsville, Alabama, which is currently undergoing a massive study to determine the exact carbon footprint of the 8,000-cap venue.

“Everything you do has a footprint. So, what do you do to offset that footprint?” said Ryan Murphy, partner at tvg hospitality, which operates Orion. “You can look at the carbon footprint of people traveling here to work, bands coming in, fans coming in – and equating that for every concert we’re doing we’re replanting X number of trees and reforesting the area around the amphitheater.”

Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, home of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild, recently launched Trees for Travel. The program, which is a partnership with the Green Cities Accord, offsets the carbon footprint for team air travel throughout the NHL regular season by helping to protect and grow the city’s urban tree canopy.

Engaging fans in sustainability efforts can make a difference. To cut emissions, venues encourage fans to carpool or take advantage of free or discounted public transit.

In Bentonville, Arkansas, they promote pedal power.

The Momentary, which features multiple performance spaces including a 6,000-cap amphitheater, offers a free bike valet for guests.

“With our proximity to downtown, it just so seamlessly fit that we would encourage the pedestrian/bike movement for our visitors,” said Ben Huss, director of operations for The Momentary. “It was like, ‘Here’s a need. Let’s see if we can figure out a way to solve it.’ And that’s how the bike valet got its wings.”

The Momentary hires Pedal It Forward, a local nonprofit that collects, repairs and distributes bikes to needy families, adults and children in Northwest Arkansas, to operate the bike valet. During evening concerts, they store between 50-55 bikes and up to 150 a day during festivals. The Momentary hosts 12 to 15 outdoor shows, two dozen indoor performances and up to four festivals each year.

“It’s such a great program for folks to be able to ride up to a concert and know that their bike is going to be taken care of, and then after the show, get back on their bike and ride to their homes and other places downtown,” said Huss.",https://static.pollstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SAF-1024x683.png,N,,2025-05-23 10:56:36.119946

The report, completed by independent advisory firm, Pollination and unveiled at an industry event in partnership with the University of NSW’s Decarbonization Innovation Hub, examines the challenges inherent in the current policy frameworks and the critical points of consideration to unlock alternative SAF accounting frameworks, such as Book and Claim.

The Book and Claim system separates the environmental benefits of SAF from the physical fuel. This allows airlines to purchase and claim the environmental benefits of SAF without physically transporting and storing the fuel, reducing the logistics costs and avoiding the additional unnecessary carbon emissions.

Book and Claim represents a significant opportunity for Australia, which has natural advantages for SAF production, including abundant feedstock resources. With this system, Australia could become an exporter of environmental benefits to regions where SAF production is limited or unavailable, creating economic opportunities by aggregating demand from both domestic and international markets, while supporting global aviation decarbonization.

Australia’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting system allows airlines to recognize emissions reductions from direct combustion of SAF, but lacks mechanisms to account for SAF that Australian airlines purchase that is used outside the country.

“In partnership with Boeing and the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network, we’re thrilled to bring together industry and academic leaders to present and explore the latest research supporting aviation’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050,” Ms Walmsley said.

“SAF is the most critical decarbonisation lever for the aviation sector to reach net zero emissions, but production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel must accelerate significantly for the global aviation sector to achieve this goal.”

“This report outlines how a Book and Claim system would allow Australian airlines to contribute to aviation decarbonization even before domestic SAF production commences. By enabling airlines to purchase SAF benefits regardless of location, we can accelerate industry-wide adoption and ultimately drive down costs.”

""Enabling a Book and Claim system helps to avoid logistics costs and unfavorable environmental outcomes that occur from having to move fuel from where it is produced to where a customer is based.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Virgin_Australia_Boeing_c5991bec41.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 10:56:40.107737

Today, he channels that experience into a cause that transcends balance sheets: offering advice and guidance to India and the wider world toward a sustainable energy future. Having worked on projects both domestically and internationally, Singal sees a bright future for Indian and US collaboration in the sector. The transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives isn't just an environmental imperative; it's an economic and geopolitical necessity. Among the multitude of solutions, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stand out as pivotal components in this global shift.

India's commitment to green methanol is both ambitious and pragmatic. With a methanol production capacity of approximately 1 million metric tons, the nation anticipates a demand surge to 4.675 million metric tons by 2030. This growth is underpinned by the government's Methanol Economy program, which envisions methanol not only as a cleaner fuel alternative but also as a means to enhance energy security and reduce import dependence. The US is also actively participating in global efforts to reduce carbon and promoting initiatives like Green Methanol.

“I’ve always had a keen interest in all things sustainable and realized early on how vital changes are needed to meet global net-zero targets. India and the US have long been two of the leaders when it comes to green energy, and it’s commendable to see their progress. It’s great to see the mutual aspirations of both nations being achieved, and I’m excited to see how the relationship continues to flourish.” Commented Suneet Singal.

Methanol's versatility is a key advantage. It can be produced from various feedstocks, including coal, natural gas, biomass, and even captured carbon dioxide. This adaptability allows for integration into existing industrial frameworks, facilitating a smoother transition from conventional fuels. As well as this, methanol serves as an efficient hydrogen carrier, simplifying storage and transportation challenges associated with hydrogen fuel.

In the aviation sector, India has set clear targets for SAF adoption. The country plans to blend 1% SAF with jet fuel by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, initially focusing on international flights. These targets align with global efforts to decarbonize aviation, a sector traditionally reliant on high-emission fuels. Comparatively, the US is aiming to supply sufficient SAF to meet 100% of domestic fuel demand by 2050. Studies suggest that SAF could contribute between 53% and 66% toward achieving net-zero targets in aviation. With SAF only currently accounting for around 0.1% of all jet fuel consumption worldwide, this highlights both the US and India’s forward-thinking role in a sustainable world.",https://images.forbesindia.com/media/images/2025/May/img_245453_whatsappimage2025-05-21at5.45.05pm.jpeg,N,,2025-05-23 11:56:58.993996

In 2024, the U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry achieved record production. A new report, “Economic Impact of Biodiesel on the U.S. Economy 2024,” shows that the industry’s rapid growth also generated a record economic impact. The industry supported 107,400 American jobs and $42.4 billion in domestic economic activity.

The total economic impact was nearly double the figure from Clean Fuels’ previous study in 2022. That’s no surprise, since U.S. production capacity doubled between 2022 and today. Nationwide in 2024, availability of biomass-based diesel—including biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable jet and heating oil—topped 5.1 billion gallons, meeting more than 9% of fuel demand for heavy-duty, on-road transportation. The industry—both fuel producers and soybean processors—invested billions to sustain this growth.

Nevertheless, the industry is facing policy uncertainty that threatens those investments and jobs. While market demand and potential for clean fuels continues to grow—with rail, marine heating, and aviation interest strong and growing—many producers are currently shut down and laying off workers.

To bolster market certainty and resume growth, Clean Fuels advocated that the U.S. EPA make a step change in the Renewable Fuel Standard volumes for 2026 and 2027, asking for an increase of the biomass-based diesel (BBD) volume to 5.25 billion gallons in 2026. That’s 1.9 billion gallons higher than the 2025 volumes. And the industry asked for continued growth, with BBD volumes raised to 5.75 billion gallons for 2027.

In April, Clean Fuels launched a six-figure advertising campaign to back up the industry’s advocacy efforts and build support for a timely bump in BBD volumes. The campaign was designed to highlight for policymakers the unified, industrywide agreement on the request.

Earlier, in March, along with farm and feedstock groups, Clean Fuels sent a letter asking the EPA to set 2026 biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes at 5.25 billion gallons. Later that month, Clean Fuels, the American Petroleum Institute, American Soybean Association, National Oilseed Processors Association, and ethanol trade groups met with EPA to present agreed upon volumes for the 2026 rule, including the 5.25-billion-gallon BBD volume.

The group of stakeholders agree that U.S. biomass-based diesel capacity of roughly 6.5 billion gallons is more than sufficient to meet the increase in RFS volumes. Much of the existing capacity is underutilized. The stakeholders also point to projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that demand will reach 5.5 billion gallons in 2026, and capacity will continue to grow to 7.3 billion gallons.

The stakeholders further agreed that the feedstocks to produce the volumes in America are available. According to an analysis by S&P Global on behalf of NOPA, the soybean processing industry invested more than $6 billion to expand or build 20 crush facilities across 10 Midwest states. The investments will support 1.4 billion additional gallons of U.S. production by 2030, with enough capacity coming online by 2026 to support the 5.25-billion-gallon goal.

The U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel industry used more than 1 billion pounds of domestic soybean oil each month throughout 2024—an increase of 15% since 2022. Biodiesel and renewable diesel production support $1.10 in value for every bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S. Demand for 5.25 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel will create a value-added market for more than 50 billion pounds of fats and oils each year. If the trend for policy during the next several years is for domestic feedstocks and domestic production, then our industry is going to create a lot of new demand for U.S. agriculture and biomass production.

For our industry to follow through and make good on the investments and growth of the past few years—and to get American biodiesel workers back to producing much-needed fuel—we need stable policy that enables us to coordinate production growth with feedstock supplies and innovation. An appropriate step upward in the RFS program is a great start.

For centuries, the coconut has been revered as the “tree of life,” offering everything from food and fuel to shelter and shade.
Beyond nutrition, coconut trees can also be leveraged in the fight against climate change.
Moreover, as perennial crops, coconut trees are more resilient than annuals to impacts such as droughts, high winds and floods.
Organic farming and intercropping – growing coconut trees amid other crops – also supports soil health and enhances biodiversity.","In the sweltering midday heat of Chennai in southern India, the roadside vendor cracks open a green coconut with two swift blows from his hooked knife. As he hands it off to locals on their daily lunch break, its cool, fresh taste almost makes standing in the sun worth it.

But did you know that the same humble coconut that quenches your thirst could be used to power jets?

If you answer no, the International Coconut Community (ICC) has a bold vision to share—one where the coconut is not just a “tropical treat” but a climate solution that nourishes people, captures carbon, and, as it turns out, may even help power your next flight.

For centuries, the coconut has been revered as the “tree of life,” offering everything from food and fuel to shelter and shade. According to data from the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization, nearly 90 per cent of the world’s coconut production takes place in Asia and the Pacific, with Indonesia, the Philippines and India the three major producing countries.

At a side event to the ESCAP Commission session in Bangkok in April, the ICC had invited three experts to share their insights into some of the advantages of coconuts. Dr. Fabian Dayrit from the ICC Scientific Advisory Committee for Health exalted the extraordinary nutritional benefits of coconut meat, which is low in carbohydrates and sugar, packed with dietary fibre and entirely free of cholesterol. It also provides all nine essential amino acids.

At the same time, coconut milk is gaining popularity as a dairy-free alternative with a smaller environmental footprint than dairy milk as well as higher calcium content. Coconut flour and oil are also becoming pantry staples as healthy, sustainable alternatives to processed foods and dairy, lionizing traditional, local food systems.

Beyond nutrition, coconut trees can also be leveraged in the fight against climate change. These trees are surprisingly effective carbon sinks—absorbing an average of 15 to 25 tons of CO₂ per hectare annually, explains Dr. K Balachandra Hebbar, Director of ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute in India.

When scaled across 12 million hectares, that is more than 200 million tons of CO₂ captured – a significant contribution to climate action. Moreover, as perennial crops, coconut trees are more resilient than annuals to impacts such as droughts, high winds and floods. Organic farming and intercropping – growing coconut trees amid other crops – also supports soil health and enhances biodiversity.

Countries are now experimenting with monetizing coconut plantations through global carbon markets through new projects like the Pollachi Fresh Air initiative in India, where farmers are attempting to establish a large carbon sequestration belt, or Vanuatu’s small island carbon credit pilots.

“Carbon credit initiatives in coconut farming present a viable opportunity for farmers to generate additional income while contributing to climate change mitigation,” Hebbar explains. “Engaging in such programmes can enhance sustainability and provide financial benefits.”

However, many hurdles remain, such as lengthy certification processes, delayed payments and complex data collection. These make the carbon credit world a challenging, albeit hopeful, terrain for small farmers.

Even further away from the traditional uses of coconuts, a renewable energy power generation company from Japan is proposing a novel idea: making Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from non-standard coconuts.

In 2022, SAF accounted for less than 0.1 per cent of the global jet fuel supply. The Green Power Development Corporation of Japan wants to change that by using off-spec coconuts, which are considered unsuitable for food markets because they are too small, cracked, sprouted or rotten.

The process of creating SAF involves sourcing, sorting and tracing the coconuts from producer countries, drying, compressing and then extracting the oil before shipping it to a processing plant where it is converted into a high-quality fuel called “neat SAF”. This uses a specially developed, low-hydrogen process tailored to coconut oil’s unique carbon structure. The company hopes to realize the commercialization of SAF in Japan by 2030.

The impact? Up to 80 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel – and no competition with food crops due to the use of off-spec coconuts.

The coconut is clearly no longer just a kitchen staple. It is a versatile, renewable resource with positive impacts for our health, energy supply and the environment. While it hides in plain sight, the right research, policies, partnerships and investments can transform it into a superfruit that helps us build a more sustainable future.

So, the next time you sip on coconut water or apply some coconut oil to your hair, imagine this: that same fruit could one day help save the planet and carry you across the sky.",https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/2025-05/Image%20by%20Pexels%20from%20Pixabay_2025-M05-23.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 10:57:24.640476

There probably isn’t the political will to bring a permanent end to the biofuels tax credit.","When Donald J. Trump talks about “America First,” he means putting the needs and desires of the American people ahead of global concerns. It’s an admirable goal, and he’s making it manifest throughout the marketplace.

This is especially true in the energy sector, where his adoption of the “drill baby, drill” attitude to energy exploration has already created a drop in the price at the pump. Things need to go further, beyond the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels until the production of synthetics and biofuels are included.

For more than 20 years, taxpayers have financially supported the ethanol and biodiesel industries through generous tax subsidies.If it ever was, this is no longer something from which the American people derive benefits sufficient to justify the costs. It is an exercise in central economic planning that continues largely for the enrichment of multinational commodity giants and fuel exporters.

Consider Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The House Republican’s One Big Beautiful Bill expands by $45 billion the biofuel tax credit created by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. It gives multinationals larger tax breaks for exporting “green” jet fuel to help meet European mandates than it does for supplying biodiesel and ethanol to American consumers. This ignores the U.S. consumers’ needs and puts foreign interests ahead of domestic ones. Nonetheless, some in Congress argue this will somehow boost America’s energy security and reduce our reliance on foreign oil.

That’s not the way it works out. It’s just another example of corporate welfare masquerading as a social and economic good. Companies that benefit most from the subsidies have the financial and logistical capacity to scale production quickly, optimize their operations to maximize tax credits, and exploit global markets that offer higher returns by, for example, utilizing the European Union’s sustainable aviation fuel mandates. Many of these multinationals are positioned to take advantage of trade loopholes that allow them to avoid tariffs on feedstocks imported from China. Small and mid-sized American farmers and biofuel cooperatives meanwhile struggle to compete, despite being the original intended beneficiaries of such subsidies.

These credits aren’t worth the cost. The 2024 Joint Tax Committee expenditures report projected that the IRA’s biofuel tax credit, known as section 45Z, would cost $8.4 billion over three years. This week the House voted to expand that to $45 billion and extend it by four years. It’s the only Biden green energy credit targeted to be bigger when it ought to be zero.

There probably isn’t the political will to bring a permanent end to the biofuels tax credit. It’s too important to too many powerful interests. Why not then enforce export limits on fuels produced with taxpayer assistance so that publicly funded benefits contribute to the nation’s energy needs and economic progress before being sent overseas. Ensuring taxpayer subsidized biofuel is only sourced, produced, and used in the U.S. would maximize the domestic economic and environmental benefits, increase domestic supplies, and reduce the cost of the credit to American taxpayers.

A Heritage Foundation report suggests additional tapping of our energy abundance would spur job growth and increase family incomes except that “Today, America’s position as a dominant producer of oil and gas is threatened by misguided government policies that have restricted oil and gas production on federal lands and federally controlled offshore areas and attempted to stifle oil and gas production on private land through overregulation.” These conditions prohibit Americans' potential to excel in the energy industry both at home and abroad.

In the first two hundred days of his new administration, President Trump has created new energy opportunities for us all. In February, the National Energy Dominance Council was established. The nation’s untapped energy resources are once again going to open to exploration. To further strengthen our energy future, let’s end the preferential treatment shown to corporations engaged in environmental virtue signaling at the expense of what America needs. Policies should reward those who invest in American infrastructure, innovation, and the workforce to lower costs, generate growth, and offer more options for American consumers.

It's time to put the country first. The Biden approach to “think globally” needs to be replaced with a resolve to “act locally.” If Congress won’t rein the biofuels credits and use the savings to lower the corporate rate to 15 percent to the benefit of all businesses, American taxpayers will be left less well off than they might be. Let’s lessen America’s involvement in multinational schemes that erode our domestic economic resilience.

President Trump’s return to The White House has created a whole host of uncertainties, one of which is the commitment to fighting climate change and reaching the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Despite this, decarbonisation remains a major goal for the aerospace sector.

Since being established in 2022, the Sustainable Skies World Summit (SSWS) has grown from 169 registered attendees to more than 1,300 in 2025. This numerical growth is also reflected across the sector with over 1,000 aviation sustainability announcements made over the last month alone, according to Jonathon Counsell, Group Head of Sustainability at IAG, who gave an address on the opening day.

On that very day, the UK Government announced £400,000 of funding to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the country. Although the different varieties of SAF offer potentially exciting technologies to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, they suffer drawbacks including high costs and unproven technology (See ‘Scaling up SAF’ AEROSPACE March 2025). It is concerns such as this that have led to a backlash against decarbonisation efforts in the US and Europe. However, Dr James Richardson, chief scientist for the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) defended decarbonisation efforts in a keynote address. “The transition is sweeping across sectors and your transition is coming soon,” he said. He explained the CCC’s role as an independent body monitoring the UK and devolved governments’ efforts to address climate change, adding that after the next ‘carbon budget’ period of 2038-42 and into the 2043-50 timeframe, aviation, alongside shipping, will remain one of the most emitting sectors. “We have been very successful at decarbonising electricity, pushed coal of the electricity supply,” Dr Richardson said.

The need for certainty

Companies all over the world are looking to deploy SAF, but need financial certainty in order to do so. (Airbus)

As part of decarbonising the electricity grid, large scale renewable energy has been rolled out using methods such as solar and offshore wind power. The latter has had its funding levels guaranteed under ‘contracts for difference,’ where eligible companies are shielded from volatile electricity prices. As many sustainable aviation technologies remain in their infancy, a key issue is funding their development and upscaling.

On the second day, a panel discussing finance heard that the certainty revenue certainty mechanisms have provided for the renewables industry would prove invaluable for enabling long term investment and research into SAF and other carbon reduction technology in aviation. Joshua Garton, Head of Financial and Investment Analysis at GSI, explained the importance of certainty to the banks, emphasising that: “once the sector scales to that commercial level, the markets develop and markets will then carry the weight of financing these projects.”

Examples of innovation

Through the use of laminar flow technology, Otto Aviation hopes its new design will prove sustainable. (Otto Aviation)

For all of the work going into finding new fuels to decarbonise aviation, the most effective way to do this could, in fact, come from other methods such as improved aerodynamics and management of contrails (See 'Contrail Control Gathers Pace'), particularly as there is a general reluctance to manage demand. One potential way forward is blended wing body (BWB) designs with the aircraft’s engines, wings and fuselage all incorporated together. Several primes and startups are exploring these for civilian and military applications. On a panel considering the future of sustainable aviation, Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President Public Affairs and Sustainability at Alaska Airlines claimed that BWBs could cut emissions by up to 50% even when using conventional jet fuel and existing components. To this end, the airline has invested in JetZero, one company trying to bring BWBs to market, which claims its design could not only benefit from SAF, but also be future proofed for hydrogen propulsion in the longer term.

Also present at the summit’s ‘Accelerator Hub’ was SORA Aviation, a UK-based eVTOL firm which is looking to bring a six engine (one on a forward wing, two on the rear) aircraft to market. Capable of carrying up to 30 people on routes such as airport transfers, the company presents its product as benefiting from economies of scale through carrying the equivalent passenger number of seven four seat eVTOLs.

Another intriguing presentation came from US-based Otto Aviation which is developing a business jet, which could later be scaled up to regional size, using laminar flow technology. NASA has called this the ‘Holy Grail’ of aerospace design because the company uses supercomputer design and advanced manufacturing techniques to produce a ‘teardrop’ shaped aircraft. The advantages of what the company calls this “revolutionary, game changing aircraft” are the ability to fly at 51,000 feet, above most airliners, therefore eliminating the carbon effects of contrails and burning 60% less fuel. The company claims that the significance of the latter is that when using SAF, this use reduction will cancel out the so-called ‘sustainability premium’ which arises from SAF being more expensive.

Future talent

With many of these emerging technologies presenting promising routes to decarbonisation, the sector still faces a major challenge if these are to become a reality. Since the COVID 19 pandemic, the issue of how to ensure a sustainable aviation workforce has been at the forefront of the industry, with ways sought to a sustainable pipeline of labour.

Attending SSWS were a large number of students aged 13 to 17 who were given insights into potential careers in the industry and. RAeS CEO David Edwards FRAeS, chaired a panel exploring common perceptions around careers in aviation. One of the myths that the panel sought to debunk is the view that the majority or roles in the sector revolve directly around flight for positions such as pilots, with vital supporting positions such as procurement and finance overlooked.

On this theme, the former CEO of London Heathrow Airport John Holland-Keye once described the hub as “a city” with all the key jobs such as human resources that this entails. The panel also discussed ways overcome barriers such as using social media posts to explore ‘a day in the life’ of key aerospace employees, demonstrating the reality of roles that are available. The panel was followed by another featuring panellists who are early in their careers across of the sector, exploring how initiatives such as ‘career coaches’ can pass on experience from employee to employee.

Work to be done

As the summit drew to a close, the continued interest in decarbonising aviation was plain to see, despite skepticism about how achievable many of the objectives are. The number of challenges to be overcome remain daunting, but if obstacles such as finance and providing the right workforce can be surmounted, the potential for many of the ideas on display to become a reality exists, even if some of the deadlines may be met later than originally envisaged.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26501/otto-aviation-main.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:30.007131

Price elasticity of demand for aviation probably means that surcharges lead to erosion of the underlying fares.","Reported comments in early Mar-2025 by IATA DG Willie Walsh have questioned aviation's commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

CAPA - Centre for Aviation's sister company Aviation Week quoted the global airline trade body's boss at the ISTAT Americas conference: ""We are going to have to revisit [the net-zero target]"".

This came only weeks after a Feb-2025 revised roadmap to 2050 net zero by 'Destination 2050', which represents European aviation across the supply chain.

More recently, on 27-Mar-2025, the European airline body A4E said it remained ""fully committed"" to net zero by 2050.

On the same day, a report by Boston Consulting Group forecast that aviation would fall significantly short of its 2030 SAF commitments, but noted ""the long-term momentum for structural change in the aviation industry remains strong"".

Mixed messages from aviation on this crucial issue could be counterproductive, when many politicians and a growing strand of public opinion are looking for ways to stifle the industry's growth.

IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego has warned that funding the green transition means ""flying is going to be more expensive"". Meanwhile, Lufthansa Group has announced an Environmental Cost Surcharge to help with the additional costs of meeting environmental regulations.

Air France-KLM has had a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of between EUR2 and EUR24 since 2022. However, Lufthansa Group's environmental surcharge, of between EUR1 and EUR72, is also aimed at defraying other green transition costs.

European airlines face a greater range of such costs than most other regions.

As with fuel surcharges, the effectiveness of environmental surcharges in genuinely raising additional revenue is debatable. Price elasticity of demand for aviation probably means that surcharges lead to erosion of the underlying fares.

However, they send a signal to governments and regulators. They may help to stem the tide of taxes imposed on aviation in the name of the environment, but which effectively divert funds away from financing the green transition.

The UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), which advises the government, published its advice on the nation's Seventh Carbon Budget (2038 to 2042) on 26-Feb-2025.

Aviation's path to net zero in 2050 requires growth in the consumption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), improved operational efficiency, new propulsion technology, demand management, and paying the cost of ""engineered removals"" to offset its residual emissions.

A key theme of the CCC report is the role of demand management while SAF availability grows. To some extent this will happen naturally, as the costs of decarbonisation feed through to higher fares and lower demand.

However, the CCC notes that further demand management measures may also be necessary, including additional taxes and charges and limiting airport expansion. Its 'citizens' panel' expressed support for such measures.

The coinciding of the CCC report with recent UK government support for new runway capacity at both Heathrow and Gatwick is somewhat ironic. Expect renewed resistance to airport expansion from environmental groups, local politicians and local residents.",,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:39.104584
,,2025-05-23 07:30:19+00:00,The Western Producer,U.S. bill would get canola back into biofuel game | The Western Producer,Not Available,,,,,https://www.producer.com/news/u-s-bill-would-get-canola-back-into-biofuel-game/,"That is still the lowest of the five major feedstocks, which are soybean oil, canola oil, tallow, used cooking oil and distillers corn oil.
However, it would very much put canola oil back in the game.
Zandar Capozzola, principal consultant for renewable fuel with Argus Media, said 45Z has been a disaster for the U.S. biofuel sector.
“The market has been hit really hard by this transition to the 45Z credit,” said Capozzola.
Canola oil accounted for five per cent of total feedstock use in February, down from 11 perc ent a year ago.","SASKATOON — Canola oil would be one of the main beneficiaries of proposed changes to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit making their way through U.S. Congress, says an analyst.

The feedstock is not eligible for the credit under the current rules because of its unfavourable carbon intensity (CI) score.

However, under new rules contained in the budget bill that recently passed through the U.S. House of Representatives, canola’s carbon intensity score drops to 38.5 grams of carbon dioxide per megajoule from 54.9.

That means it would qualify for the credit because of new rules that eliminate the indirect land use change (ILUC) penalty, which is responsible for a large chunk of canola’s poor CI score.

It means canola would receive a 45Z tax credit of US$0.19 per gallon for biodiesel, $0.22 for renewable diesel and $0.39 for sustainable aviation fuel.

That is still the lowest of the five major feedstocks, which are soybean oil, canola oil, tallow, used cooking oil and distillers corn oil.

However, it would very much put canola oil back in the game.

Zandar Capozzola, principal consultant for renewable fuel with Argus Media, said 45Z has been a disaster for the U.S. biofuel sector.

It replaced the blender’s tax credit, which gave biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers a $1 per gallon credit irrespective of what feedstock they were using.

The 45Z credit is based on a shifting scale of value based on feedstock and production process. Its average value has been $0.43 per gallon since it was introduced on Jan. 1, 2025.

“That’s a 57 per cent reduction in the tax value afforded to producers,” he said during a recent webinar.

Renewable diesel and biodiesel producers responded by slashing production. January’s output was 20 per cent below a year earlier with plants running at 47 per cent of capacity, down from 93 per cent in December 2024.

Things have improved since then with plants running at 63 per cent capacity in April, but it is still well below 2024 levels.

“The market has been hit really hard by this transition to the 45Z credit,” said Capozzola.

Biodiesel margins turned negative at the start of 2025, declining 75 per cent year over year through May. Renewable diesel margins fell 50 per cent over the same period.

Canola-based fuel was hardest hit because the feedstock doesn’t qualify for 45Z.

Tallow, used cooking oil and distillers corn oil have been the biggest beneficiaries, with corn oil earning an average $0.75 per gallon credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel production.

Foreign used cooking oil is not eligible for the credit (except for sustainable aviation fuel), pressuring domestic supplies of the feedstock.

The upshot is that 45Z has caused a move away from crop-based feedstocks. Canola oil accounted for five per cent of total feedstock use in February, down from 11 perc ent a year ago.

Tallow has surpassed soybean oil to take top spot, accounting for 31 per cent of feedstock compared to 26 per cent a year ago.

Total feedstock use in February was down 27 per cent compared to a year ago as many plants shuttered or paused production.

The 45Z policy changes contained in the draft budget proposal would be a boon for crop-based feedstocks.

For instance, soybean-oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules compared to $0.22 under the existing regulations.

“We could see a tremendous reshuffling of the feedstock slate should this draft bill move forward in its current state,” said Capozzola.

The numbers for waste-based feedstocks would stay the same because they don’t face any ILUC penalty under the existing rules.

The draft budget bill also extends 45Z through 2031 and restricts feedstocks to the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is also good news for Canadian canola growers.

Capozzola noted that the proposed new 45Z rules would not “play well” with California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which caps crop-based feedstocks at 20 per cent.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/22153240/131383_web1_RKA07152024_canola_bloom.jpeg,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:42.416191

The problem is that last year, airlines consumed 1 million tonnes of SAF out of a total consumption of 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel.
This would require the SAF industry to produce about 1 million tonnes of SAF per year until 2030 and then 3 million tonnes.
Neste, the largest producer of SAF, is producing 1.5 million tonnes this year, with a growth to 2.2 million tonnes by 2027.
In the years before, it would have been an 8% reduction, or 25 tonnes of Jet fuel, with the CO2 reduction at 64 tonnes.","May 23, 2025, ©. Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

We have since we started in October last year looked at:

Alternative, lower emission, propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids, and new concepts for Jet-Fuel and Hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also looked at recent research into the role of CO2, NOx emissions and Contrails generated by airliners.

Three weeks ago, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

We examined Alternative 1’s emissions improvement two weeks ago and compared it to the normal improvement in new airliners’ fuel consumption last week. Now, we examine the improvement that SAF can offer compared to the other two.

Improvement in emissions from SAF

SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, differs from the normal Jet-A1 fossil-based fuel by having its source’s CO2 absorbing phase in the same time period as the fuel’s oxidation into CO2 and other emission products in an aircraft engine. By it, a total CO2 emission reduction of about 80% can be achieved.

The problem is that last year, airlines consumed 1 million tonnes of SAF out of a total consumption of 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel. The problem comes from SAF being more expensive than Jet-A1.

Right now, the industry is in a chicken-and-egg situation. Low demand and, therefore, production make SAF costly as it lacks scale. Its higher price throttles further demand.

We have also written that SAF can’t replace normal jet fuel 100% in present aircraft, as the fuel systems and engines need some of the fossil Jet fuel’s aromatics to keep their seals supple. As new-generation airliners enter the market, this limitation will gradually disappear as the sealant materials are updated with materials that don’t require these aromatics to keep seals fit.

A path away from this stalemate is that states mandate a specific blend of SAF in an airline’s fuel consumption. The 27 European EU states decided on such a mandate in 2023, called ReFuelEU. It requires aircraft that depart from EU airports of a minimum size (800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of freight per year) to any destination (EU or outside EU) to fuel their aircraft at the airport with jet fuel that has the following blend of SAF:

We see that the blend requirement is 2% until 2030, then rises to 6%, and so on. This would require the SAF industry to produce about 1 million tonnes of SAF per year until 2030 and then 3 million tonnes. Neste, the largest producer of SAF, is producing 1.5 million tonnes this year, with a growth to 2.2 million tonnes by 2027. While airlines are worried about sourcing the required SAF volumes from 2030, the SAF industry says it will meet the demand.

How much will SAF reduce CO2 emissions?

Right now, the only region with a mandate for SAF blending is the EU. As traffic from such EU airports represents about 20% of worldwide aircraft traffic, on a worldwide basis, we apply a fivefold reduction of the SAF effect from this mandate.

If we take the 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel consumed in 2025, where 1 million tonnes of these would be SAF before 2030, then 3 million tonnes, growing to 10 million tonnes after 2035, and so forth, we finish with a 70% blend of SAF from EU airports in 2050.

On a worldwide scale, if we assume that the improvement in fuel consumption from new aircraft keeps the yearly jet fuel consumption at 300 million tonnes, we will have a 14% reduction of fossil Jet Fuel consumption by 2050, or 42 tonnes, with an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions, or 106 million tonnes. In the years before, it would have been an 8% reduction, or 25 tonnes of Jet fuel, with the CO2 reduction at 64 tonnes.

We shall remember these numbers when we come to compare the three different alternatives in future Corners.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:50.582954
