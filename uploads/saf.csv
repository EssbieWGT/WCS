Lack of awareness and higher costs for the greener fuel remain issues for SAF, which is two or three times as expensive as fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel.
Current rules allow up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.
In 2024, Iata said SAF production reached one million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) – or about 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production.
Singapore Airlines and its budget arm Scoot are among those committed to reaching a goal of 5 per cent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030.","SINGAPORE - The World Economic Forum (WEF) and Singapore’s GenZero launched an initiative on May 5 aimed at boosting regional demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and to bolster the aviation sector’s climate credentials.

A key mission of the Green Fuel Forward initiative is to scale up production of SAF, which the industry regards as a vital tool to cut the sector’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments globally, including Singapore’s, have set mandates that map steady increases in the percentage of SAF in planes’ fuel tanks in the coming years.

“The only way to get to net zero, or very close to net zero by the middle of the century, is very, very large amounts of SAF,” said Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s sustainability lead for the Asia-Pacific.

More efficient aircraft designs and engines can get perhaps 20 per cent of the way, and operations – such as better route planning – another 10 per cent, he told The Straits Times at the launch of the initiative during the GenZero Climate Summit 2025 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. The summit aims to showcase ways to hasten the decarbonisation of the global economy.

Boeing has been actively promoting the use of SAF and the company aims to ensure its commercial aircraft are certified to operate on 100 per cent SAF by 2030, he said.

Lack of awareness and higher costs for the greener fuel remain issues for SAF, which is two or three times as expensive as fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel. And in Asia, the world’s largest aviation market, demand is not keeping pace with planned production capacity additions in the coming years.

“The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals,” said Mr Frederick Teo, chief executive of GenZero, an investment platform owned by Temasek.

SAF is designed to be a drop-in fuel for planes, needing no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current rules allow up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

SAF can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has set a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050.

The fuel is made mostly from waste materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat, but can also be made from agricultural residues and even alcohol.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that SAF will achieve about 65 per cent of the emissions reductions needed for the industry to reach net zero by 2050. And cutting emissions has become increasingly critical, with aviation currently accounting for approximately 2.5 per cent of global CO2 emissions, and possibly doubling or even tripling from 2019 levels by 2050 unless concerted action is taken.

Green Fuel Forward is a capacity-building initiative that aims to draw in airlines, refiners, logistics firms, banks and others. A total of 16 companies and organisations have agreed to participate, including Boeing, Climate Impact X, DBS Bank, DHL, the International Energy Agency, Neste, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Temasek and UOB.

Singapore Airlines first started using SAF in 2017 on a trial basis and is hoping for greater market participation to drive up demand and push down prices, said chief sustainability officer Lee Wen Fen. The airline regards SAF as key to its decarbonisation goals.

A key focus of the initiative is to boost the take-up of SAF certificates by companies to offset their own emissions or the travel emissions of their employees, for example.

The certificates can be bought on exchanges, such as Singapore’s Climate Impact X, and each is linked to the creation of one tonne of SAF. Certificate buyers can track and claim the environmental benefits, such as emissions reductions, of using SAF without having to purchase the physical fuel.

The emissions reduction can be claimed once the tonne of SAF is burned, with the accounting process approved by ICAO. On average, each SAF credit represents a CO2 emissions reduction of 2.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes versus conventional fuel.

The initiative will organise workshops and practical guidance tools to help organisations navigate topics such as environmental integrity and reporting practices for SAF and SAF certificates.

Globally, SAF still comprises a fraction of total jet fuel use. And in the Asia-Pacific, uptake is far slower than in Europe.

In 2024, Iata said SAF production reached one million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) – or about 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production. This is double 2023’s production of 0.5 million tonnes but far below the initial projections for 2024 of 1.5 million tonnes.

Rules mandating SAF usage will drive up demand over time.

Flights departing EU airports must now use 2 per cent SAF in their fuel mix, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and 70 per cent by 2050. For Japan, SAF must account for at least 10 per cent of domestic airlines’ jet fuel consumption by 2030.

In Singapore, 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports must be sustainable, with a goal to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

Singapore Airlines and its budget arm Scoot are among those committed to reaching a goal of 5 per cent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030.

There are other challenges for the industry, including ensuring the environmental integrity of feedstocks, such as land-based feedstock, which can lead to unintended consequences for deforestation, said Temasek’s managing director for sustainability, Ms Park Kyung-ah, during a panel discussion at the launch.

In Europe and the US, governments have also expressed concerns about reports of virgin palm oil being fraudulently added to boost used cooking oil supplies to SAF refineries. The EU forbids the use of virgin palm oil as an SAF feedstock.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1811fa75f7a30753cfbcf43d7f08ea752017cb444e838fda00e1d3d9ed9152fd,N,,2025-05-05 10:56:11.511329

The shift reflects a growing recognition within the aviation industry that achieving net-zero emissions by a specific date is a highly ambitious and sometimes impractical goal, especially when confronted with factors like fuel supply constraints and the pace of technological advancements. With this in mind, Air New Zealand has decided to focus on a more achievable emissions reduction range, offering the company the flexibility to adapt as new innovations and solutions emerge.

A Pragmatic Approach to Emissions Reduction

Instead of setting an exact emissions target, Air New Zealand now aims to cut jet fuel-related emissions by 20-30% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. This revised approach reflects a more pragmatic outlook on what is realistically achievable within the next decade, given the challenges the airline industry faces in scaling up cleaner technologies like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The decision to move away from hard emissions targets to a more flexible guidance framework is designed to ensure the airline remains on track with its sustainability goals while accommodating uncertainties in both technology development and regulatory requirements. By adopting this guidance-based approach, Air New Zealand can adjust its strategy as new solutions become available, while continuing to make meaningful progress toward reducing its carbon footprint.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Key to the Future of Aviation

One of the cornerstones of Air New Zealand’s emissions reduction plan is the increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and forest residues, offering a far lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel. As part of its long-term sustainability plan, Air New Zealand is targeting 10% SAF usage by 2030.

However, the global SAF market remains in its infancy, and scaling up its production presents significant challenges. SAF is currently more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, and supply is limited. To address these challenges, Air New Zealand has been working extensively to secure a stable and scalable SAF supply, including domestic sources from New Zealand’s forestry sector.

The airline’s dedication to SAF is underscored by its ongoing efforts to establish partnerships with fuel producers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to create a robust, sustainable supply chain. Air New Zealand is also exploring the use of waste products from the forestry industry, such as sawdust, to produce SAF, which would help reduce both aviation emissions and New Zealand’s overall carbon footprint.

Carbon Offsetting: Complementing SAF with Carbon Credit Purchases

While SAF is central to Air New Zealand’s decarbonization strategy, the airline recognizes that it will not be sufficient on its own to meet its emissions reduction goals. To help offset its remaining emissions, Air New Zealand will continue to purchase carbon credits through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This scheme, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), aims to offset carbon emissions from international flights, maintaining carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020.

In addition to participating in CORSIA, Air New Zealand plans to buy approximately 11,000 tonnes of carbon credits to further offset its emissions. These credits will support a variety of nature-based solutions, such as forest restoration and other carbon removal projects in New Zealand, contributing to the airline’s broader commitment to sustainable environmental practices.

A Fleet Upgrade to Support Sustainability Goals

In addition to SAF and carbon offsetting, Air New Zealand is investing in its fleet to ensure that its operations are as fuel-efficient as possible. The airline is upgrading its fleet with more modern, energy-efficient aircraft, which use less fuel and produce fewer emissions. This strategy includes the continued introduction of newer models, such as the Airbus A321neo and the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner, both of which offer superior fuel efficiency compared to older aircraft.

As of May 2024, the airline’s fleet is comprised of a diverse range of aircraft, including narrowbody, widebody, and turboprop models, with a strong emphasis on fuel-efficient designs. Some of the key aircraft in Air New Zealand’s fleet include:

17 Airbus A320 aircraft, including both classic and newer models

12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, with plans to add more in the near future

30 ATR 72-600 turboprops, used for regional routes

10 Boeing 777-300ERs for long-haul international travel

14 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for international flights

3 Boeing 787-10s, offering increased seating and improved fuel efficiency

23 Dash 8-Q300 turboprops for domestic and short-haul routes

In addition to investing in modern aircraft, Air New Zealand is also adopting advanced flight optimization systems to improve fuel efficiency during flight. These systems enable more precise routing and better management of flight speed and altitude, reducing overall fuel consumption.

Looking Ahead: Challenges and Commitments

Despite the progress made, Air New Zealand acknowledges that there is still much work to be done. The airline’s shift to a guidance-based emissions framework does not signal a retreat from its sustainability goals but rather a commitment to a more adaptive and transparent approach. The challenges of scaling SAF production, securing reliable supply chains, and implementing new technologies remain, but the airline is determined to continue its journey toward a more sustainable future.

The airline’s new emissions guidance approach represents a balance between ambition and realism, offering a roadmap that can evolve with the times while still driving meaningful progress toward the goal of reducing aviation’s environmental impact.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-05T171536019.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 10:56:50.934649

According to a LinkedIn post by Kiri Hannifin, Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer for Air New Zealand, and an airline statement, the decision to go from targets to guidance was due to the technological challenges and ""uncertainty"" in meeting the original targets. However, as Hannifin shared with the media, Air New Zealand continues to be committed to aviation sustainability .

Reviewing the latest - as of 1 May - 2030 emissions guidance shows that Air New Zealand is committed to driving emissions from jet fuel creation and combustion 20-30 percent down from 2019 levels by 2030. The airline intends to use carbon credits and, ""use 10 per cent SAF (as a percentage of total fuel) in 2030"" to achieve this goal. But as Hannifin explained on her LinkedIn post, ""We want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector.""

Air New Zealand Continues SAF Commitment

The Air New Zealand goal to reduce emissions by 20-30 percent from jet fuel consumption depends largely on increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply. However, as Simple Flying has documented , increasing SAF supply is no easy feat worldwide. For Air New Zealand, there has been a worldwide search for over a year now .

The global search for more innovation in SAF development and delivery is because, as Hannifin shared with Simple Flying on March 20, 2024, ""A stable supply of SAF is critical to our ability to reduce carbon emissions."" Additionally, SAF is in short supply, and as Hannifin shared with NewstalkZB on May 1,

""[SAF's] the main way that airlines will decarbonize. ... There's hardly any available, so the more demand there is, the more supply there'll be available - and that will help get the prices down.""

One can listen to the May 1 interview below:

SAF Is Not Air New Zealand's Only Decarbonization Solution

Air New Zealand is also relying on other solutions to decarbonize. One of which is carbon credits to offset emissions via CORSIA . CORSIA stands for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. The scheme was established by ICAO pre-pandemic and seeks to cap CO2 emissions from international flights at 85% of 2019 levels, coupled with carbon-neutral growth for operations past 2020. However, according to the guidance, Air New Zealand will also buy ""approximately 11,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)"" credits to supplement this and fund natural carbon removal efforts in New Zealand.

Additionally, there are two fleet solutions at work. The first is more efficient flying with computer aids. The second is renewing and maintaining a fleet with modern, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Below is a table of the current Air New Zealand fleet as of May 5 for reference:

Below is a 2022 YouTube about the Air New Zealand fleet plans:

Hannifin: ""Still Be A Stretch For Us""

Ultimately, one should consider what Hannifin posted in her LinkedIn that even with shifting from specific targets to guidance, and reaffirming the Air New Zealand commitment to reduce emissions, there are still challenges. Air New Zealand has to continue to increase the SAF supply, by for instance waste products from the forestry industry (aka logging) like sawdust and more. One can listen to the details below, thanks to another Hannifin interview on NewstalkZB with the magic of Spotify:

Šis mandatas irgi palaipsniui augs, ir 2050 m. jau pusė viso SAF kuro privalės būti sintetinis. Taigi permainos aviacijos sektoriuje jau vyksta pilnu tempu“, – sako „Avia Solutions Group“ priklausančios tarptautinės antžeminių paslaugų, orlaivių degalų tiekimo ir logistikos paslaugų įmonių grupės „Baltic Ground Services“ („BGS“) vadovas ir Norsaf valdybos narys Vytautas Čekanavičius.

Dėl naujų reikalavimų, oro linijos palaipsniui turės pirkti vis daugiau SAF kuro, o 2030 m. dabartiniai gamybiniai pajėgumai jau nebegalės patenkinti augančio poreikio. Anot V. Čekanavičiaus, Liepojoje bus naudojama JAV įmonės „KBR“ vystoma gamybos technologija, kai naudojamas alkoholis, bet į procesą įtraukiamas ir vandenilis su CO2. Tai reiškia, kad bus gaminamas tiek paprastas, tiek sintetinis SAF kuras.

„Liepojos Laisvojoje ekonominėje zonoje yra ir vamzdynai, ir geležinkelio linija, čia jau vyksta ir etanolio perkrova, planuojama, kad atsiras ir žaliojo vandenilio gamykla. Kitaip tariant, egzistuoja didelė dalis mums reikalingos infrastruktūros. Šiuo metu vyksta derybos ir su viena didele kompanija, kurios išskiriamą CO2 naudotume savo sintetinio SAF gamybai“, – dėsto „BGS“ vadovas.

Kaip sako LSEZ SIA „NORSAF“ valdybos narys Janis Kisiels, naujosios SAF gamyklos projektas ypatingai reikšmingas visam regionui. Jį įgyvendinus, augs ir Baltijos šalių energetinis saugumas, gerokai sutrumpės tiekimo grandinės.

„Ši gamykla yra labai geras pavyzdys, kaip dirbdamos išvien mūsų šalių kompanijos gali įgyvendinti pačius didžiausius ir ambicingiausius projektus ir taip prisidėti prie žaliosios aviacijos transformacijos. Siekiame gaminti gerokai daugiau SAF kuro, nei reikės visai Baltijos šalių rinkai, tad didžiąją dalį savo pagaminto SAF ketiname eksportuoti“, – teigia jis.

Planuojama, kad naujoji Liepojos gamykla kasmet pagamintų 100 tūkst. tonų SAF. Palyginimui, šiuo metu visuose Baltijos šalių oro uostose sunaudojama apie 400 tūkst. tonų aviacinio kuro, o pagal dabartinį 2 proc. mandatą, rinkai dabar reikia tik apie 8 tūkst. tonų SAF.

„Dirbame su potencialiais tiekėjais, partneriais, investuotojais, ES institucijomis. Mūsų planas ir ambicija 2027 m. pradėti statybas, ir 2030 m. jau gaminti SAF kurą. Projektas milžiniškas, bet tikime, kad įdėto darbo rezultatas bus vertas pasididžiavimo ir turės įtakos aviacijos pramonės tvarumui“, – teigia V. Čekanavičius.",https://images.delfi.lt/media-api-image-cropper/v1/d30cc7d1-1c2a-4b74-9c9f-452bd09d5345.jpg?w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-05-05 07:57:13.046973

With support from the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), MZT has kicked off a DAC plant in Norfolk that will serve to pull down atmospheric CO2 to be used for the production of manufactured limestone by O.C.O Technology (O.C.O.).

Current estimates say that once operational at full capacity, this DAC plant will be able to remove around 250 tonnes of CO2 per year.

For partnering company O.C.O., which utilizes captured CO2 to produce sustainable construction materials, this DAC deployment will enable a reliable and sustainable on-site source of carbon dioxide, optimizing the supply and protecting against price and availability fluctuations.

Dr. Nicholas Chadwick, MZT co-founder and CEO, commented, “With the construction sector being one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions, the industry needs to rapidly rethink its carbon backbone — and creating sustainable building materials which double as carbon sinks is a great way to do just that.”

«We use 70% less energy to remove CO2,» Amir Shiner, RepAir Carbon CEO

This deployment marks the third ambitious DAC initiative announced by Mission Zero Technologies.

A joint effort between the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Temasek-backed, decarbonisation-focused investment company GenZero, it will educate organisations to become more familiar and competent with sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFC), promote the use of both, enable test purchases and encourage partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Frederick Teo, chief executive officer of GenZero, said: “The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals.”

He added that the initiative can provide the technical clarity and corporate commitment needed to scale sustainable aviation fuel adoption, and “by mobilising corporates and airlines, we can create the certainty needed to spur innovation, scale production and make lower-emission flights a reality”.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable sources that include biofuel, waste or synthetics.

As it can be used in existing jet engines and reduce emissions by up to 80 per cent, it is the most viable way of reducing the emissions of air travel. However, it is hampered by its high cost (three to five times more than regular jet fuel), low production and uncertain demand.

According to the International Air Transport Association, sustainable aviation fuel accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024.

SAFC will help organisations administer emissions reductions for using sustainable aviation fuel, using a framework developed by WEF’s Clean Skies For Tomorrow initiative. It will allow both airlines and corporate travel to track and claim emissions reductions from flights using sustainable aviation fuel.

Sixteen organisations are participating, including the banks DBS, Mizuho and UOB; aircraft maker Boeing; airlines Air New Zealand, Qantas Group and Singapore Airlines; sustainable aviation fuel producer Neste; and logistics company DHL.

Green Fuel Forward’s efforts will include education and training on key topics, plus hands-on exercises such as legally compliant test purchases of sustainable aviation fuel and SAFC.

According to a 2024 report, South-east Asia has the potential to supply 12 per cent of the world’s sustainable aviation fuel by 2050. The Asia-Pacific is the largest passenger aviation market in the world, and is also expected to lead sector growth in the next few years.

DHL’s blend of speed, visibility, and brand assurance gives it an edge in markets where logistics reliability can directly impact revenue cycles.","When DHL Express announced last week the renewal of its partnership with the Mumbai Indians for a fifth consecutive year, it was more than a routine sponsorship extension. Beneath the surface of this feel-good cricket-and-commerce story lies a deeper narrative—one that offers insights into how international logistics providers are reshaping their brand relevance in one of the world’s most dynamic markets, and aligning closely with domestic connectivity goals that include, crucially, air cargo growth.

The renewed partnership keeps DHL Express as the principal sponsor for India’s most successful cricket franchise. But while the public face is fan engagement and climate-conscious campaigns, the underlying strategy speaks to DHL’s long game: expanding its reach and relevance in India’s air express and time-definite cargo segments, where competition with both international integrators and emerging domestic players is intensifying.

Beyond branding

India’s air cargo sector, valued at approximately US$2.3 billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10 percent through 2030, according to government and industry data. With the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, rapid e-commerce expansion, and rollout of multi-modal logistics hubs under Gati Shakti, demand for precision logistics services is rising sharply.

DHL Express, long a dominant player in the premium segment, is clearly aligning its cultural visibility with this growth arc. Cricket, particularly the IPL, offers unparalleled reach in India — with over 500 million viewers across platforms — but its value to air cargo professionals is not just in visibility. It is in symbolic alignment with India’s evolving needs: agility, speed, and integration.

“Sports and logistics share a common thread — both work on the qualities of precision and agility,” Sandeep Juneja, Vice President, Sales and Marketing at DHL Express India, said. “Our continued relationship [with Mumbai Indians] is a testament to our shared pursuit of success.”

In that phrasing is an implicit recognition that air cargo in India is becoming less transactional and more brand-driven, where service reliability and time performance (rather than price alone) define market share. The Mumbai Indians’ values — excellence, teamwork, speed — become brand proxies for DHL’s logistics ethos.

The ‘team behind the team’

From a cargo operations standpoint, DHL Express is already an essential player in time-definite international movements into and out of India’s key air gateways: Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Its “team behind the team” tagline may be rooted in sport, but operationally, it mirrors DHL’s role in enabling just-in-time logistics for India’s SMEs, pharma, and tech manufacturers.

For example, DHL’s reliance on the air cargo segment is evident in its operational infrastructure in India. The company operates a dedicated freighter fleet and makes extensive use of belly-hold cargo space across commercial airlines — all coordinated through its central hubs in Leipzig and Hong Kong. India’s rising exports — with FY 2024–25 merchandise exports pegged at US$447 billion — represent a strategic opportunity, especially as micro-enterprises seek faster routes to global markets.

By linking its express brand with cricketing excellence, DHL is not merely chasing eyeballs. It is embedding itself in national consciousness as a trusted operator in a country that still faces significant logistics bottlenecks, including limited cold chain integration, fragmented warehousing, and volatile ground transport.

he partnership’s ‘Six for a Cause’ campaign — wherein DHL plants six trees for every six hit by a Mumbai Indians player — adds a layer of climate consciousness to the mix. Last season, 133 sixes resulted in nearly 800 trees being planted. While modest in carbon terms, such initiatives align with the growing pressure on logistics firms to decarbonise.

India’s draft Air Cargo Policy and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) both call for “greener cargo corridors,” and DHL, like its peers, is under regulatory and reputational pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments, carbon-neutral warehousing, and route optimisation will all become material indicators in the years ahead. Campaigns like DHL’s, though PR-oriented, provide public linkage between cargo movement and climate responsibility — a necessary narrative as India pushes for net-zero aviation by 2070.

Strategic signal

The partnership also sends a signal to India’s fast-growing domestic express players — Delhivery, Ecom Express, and India Post’s revamped logistics division among them — that DHL is doubling down on local mindshare even as its physical infrastructure grows.

With India’s intra-regional air cargo expected to grow at 12–14 percent CAGR, especially from Tier 2 and 3 cities, cultural partnerships will play a role in influencing procurement decisions, particularly among MSMEs and digitally enabled retailers.

Australia’s election gives LNG, fuels sector certainty

Australia’s election gives LNG, fuels sector certainty

Sydney, 5 May (Argus) — Australia's governing Labor party's second majority term could mean that changes to the offshore permitting regime promised last year are signed into law, while east coast LNG businesses will avoid a planned reservation system proposed by the opposition. Labor's victory at the 3 May election combined with the election of fewer members from the Greens party and climate-focused independents, could mean it faces less pressure to cancel fossil fuel projects. But it will remain reliant on the Greens to pass laws through the nation's upper house — the senate — meaning Labor may need to negotiate the passage of bills with the leftist party if the Liberal-National-based coalition opposes its measures. The Greens ran on a promise to ban new coal, oil and gas projects but won fewer seats than in 2022 because of preference flows. A federal decision on the lifetime extension of the Woodside Energy-operated 14.4mn t/yr North West Shelf (NWS) LNG delayed by Labor, is now looking more positive for the firm. The firm sees approval as vital to progressing its Browse gas development offshore northwestern Australia. Voters' rejection of the opposition Coalition on the nation's east coast means its policy to reserve a further 50-100PJ (1.34bn-2.68bn m³/yr) from the Gladstone-based LNG exporters will not proceed. The result provides an opportunity for certainty and stability for the energy sector, upstream lobby Australian Energy Producers said. The group urged the government to focus on new supply as Australia's gas reserves for domestic use rapidly deplete. The government will need to specify exactly how it aims to secure supplies to ensure stable supply, once coal-fired generators retire at the end of the 2020s and into the 2030s. This is because the nation's integrated system plan is based on Labor's policy of reaching 82pc renewable energy in the power grid, backed up by about 15GW of gas-fired power. Industry will await further direction stemming from the Future Gas Strategy which canvassed solutions to Australia's declining gas supply including new pipelines, storage and seasonal LNG imports. Permitting concerns In the government's previous three-year term, a series of court-ordered requirements to consult with affected Aboriginal groups briefly disrupted multi-billion dollar LNG developments. Labor promised to specify through new laws exactly which groups must be consulted before approvals could be granted. But these were dropped from the agenda in early 2024 following opposition by the Greens. Labor's resources minister Madeleine King blamed the Greens for obstructionist manoeuvres on this legislation, but it remains unclear if and when Labor might introduce such laws. Conversely, the Coalition promised to end government support for anti-gas lobbies such as law group the Environmental Defenders Office — set to continue under Labor. In liquid fuels, Labor's victory should boost Australia's electric vehicle (EV) sales, with emissions standards laws set to remain enforced. The Coalition had said it would soften the laws because of concern over cost of living pressures. Plans to temporarily cut the fuel excise will also not progress. Australia's EV take-up has stalled, and industry has blamed this on poor investment in recharging infrastructure and other policy settings, including the removal of the fringe benefits tax exemption for plug-in hybrid car models. A re-elected Labor government is likely to further policy towards a mandate for sustainable aviation fuel or renewable diesel, given the growing share of Australia's emissions projected to come from the transport industry. It pledged A$250mn ($162mn) for low-carbon liquid fuels development in March , for low-carbon liquid fuels development in March, as part of its commitment to the nascent sector. Local market participants are optimistic that further biofuels support will be provided as urgency to meet net zero ambitions builds, including a 2030 target of 43pc lower emissions based on 2005 levels. About A$6bn/yr of feedstocks like canola, tallow and used cooking oil are exported from Australia, while existing ethanol and biodiesel producers are running underutilised plants, making about 175mn litres/yr at present, because of poorly-enforced blending mandates.

This shorter booking curve allows Virgin Atlantic Cargo to assess and capitalise on new opportunities in emerging markets more swiftly.","Five months into his role, Nick Diesel, Virgin Atlantic Cargo’s recently-appointed Managing Director, is looking to bring his experience from leading the team through post-pandemic recovery to support the carrier throughout turbulent economic conditions and global supply chain disruptions.

“I’ve been with Virgin Atlantic for about ten years, but I’ve only been in this particular role for five months, I’m still learning ,” Diesel told Air Cargo Week. “During my time at the airline, I’ve gained broad experience across a number of departments, which I think has helped me in this new role.

“When the pandemic hit, we had to pivot quickly. We were operating in what seemed like a temporary crisis, but it turned out to be something much longer-lasting and more disruptive,” Diesel shared.

“The biggest lesson I learned during that time was that you can never predict what’s around the corner and so need to focus on what you can control. You can have your best estimates, but it’s crucial to keep plans flexible and simple so we can quickly adapt.”

This adaptable mindset has proven crucial in the current environment. “In the cargo world, we’re fortunate to be a smaller operation compared to some of the larger players,” Diesel noted. “This allows us to be more agile and try out new solutions that can drive improvements. We have a fantastic team, and the pace of technological advancement is exciting for us. We’re actively looking at business automation and exploring tools that will help us move more efficiently and stay ahead of the curve.”

Prepared for unpredictability

Despite the current challenges, Diesel sees the airline’s ability to innovate, adapt, and build strong relationships with its team and customers as key factors for long-term success.

“The landscape is changing rapidly, and we’re exploring everything from automation in back-office functions to dynamic pricing strategies. There’s a lot of potential here, and I think we’ve only scratched the surface. Over the next few months, I’ll be focusing on understanding how we can use these tools effectively to better serve our customers and further improve our operations,” Diesel expressed.

“The political climate, and global supply chain disruptions are definitely a significant influence on everything we’re doing, but we’re focused on staying flexible and continuously improving,” he said. “I’m excited about where we can go from here, and I have confidence that our team will continue to rise to the occasion.”

Potential through passenger travel

With its position as a belly-hold cargo operator, Virgin Atlantic’s extensive passenger network provides significant advantages but also presents certain operational challenges.

By leveraging this network, the company can bring cargo directly into major city locations and key destinations, maximising available capacity on flights that would otherwise be empty. However, to make this work, there’s a delicate balance to strike—ensuring that both passenger demand and cargo opportunities are optimiSed without compromising profitability on either side.

“There are two main components to this,” Diesel explained. “First, how do we maximise the opportunity with the existing network? And second, how do we shape the strategic direction of Virgin Atlantic to ensure that cargo has a strong voice in decision-making?”

“We’re fortunate to have senior leaders with extensive cargo experience and so we understand the contribution cargo makes to Virgin Atlantic’s financial performance.

“We’ve also made a significant shift by framing our cargo team as the ‘fourth cabin’ at Virgin Atlantic, alongside economy, premium, and upper class,” Diesel revealed. “This shift has helped us highlight the value that cargo adds to our network, positioning it as a key part of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, alongside our holidays and loyalty programmes. This approach has given cargo a stronger, more prominent role.”

Speedier set up

The quick ramp-up time for cargo compared to passengers is another significant advantage for Virgin Atlantic Cargo. While the booking window for passenger flights can extend up to 18 months, cargo bookings tend to have a much shorter lead time—often just two weeks. This shorter booking curve allows Virgin Atlantic Cargo to assess and capitalise on new opportunities in emerging markets more swiftly.

“This makes it easier to quickly assess cargo opportunities in new markets,” Diesel explained. “We’re about to wrap up our plan, which outlines our strategy through 2025, and we’re already preparing for the next strategic plan for 2030.

“What’s been really positive is the opportunity to influence the selection of potential markets early on. We’re able to input directly into the process, suggesting markets based on customer demand, rather than having the passenger network team come to us later with potential routes.”

“We’ve also made a significant shift by framing our cargo team as the ‘fourth cabin’ at Virgin Atlantic, alongside economy, premium, and upper class,” Diesel revealed. “This shift has helped us highlight the value that cargo adds to our network, positioning it as a key part of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, alongside our holidays and loyalty programs. This approach has given cargo a stronger, more prominent role.”

A notable example of this alignment in action is Virgin Atlantic’s expansion into markets like India, where cargo has played a critical role in supporting the profitability of these routes. As geopolitical situations shift, particularly in regions like the Red Sea, the cargo division’s performance has provided a boost to the airline’s growth in new markets.

“ Cargo is able to reach maturity much quicker in new markets, playing a key role in supporting route profitability,” Diesel shared.

Internal collaboration

To capitalise on the full scale of opportunity in the industry, Virgin Atlantic Cargo is focused on optimising its operations through closer teamwork with its different departments, with Diesel having prioritised engagement with staff and customers across the network during his first months in the role.

“It’s been fantastic to meet our teams and customers. Most of the feedback has been very positive, which is always great to hear,” Diesel remarked. “We’re committed to ensuring that our people are empowered, supported, and clear on their roles, especially when facing challenges. This level of communication and support is what makes us stronger as a team.”

Drawing from his time working in finance and data , Diesel presented a unique perspective on how Virgin Atlantic Cargo can adapt to economic challenges: “My experience in financial planning and procurement has been invaluable in this role. I’m constantly learning from my colleagues, including a number of people in our senior leadership team who have vast experience in cargo. Together, we’re focused on staying on track and making the right decisions for the future.”

Serious about sustainability

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword but a core principle that influences nearly every aspect of operations, from fuel sources to fleet management, and even local facility practices.

“We were really excited about the success of our 100 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) flight, which was a huge milestone for the airline,” Diesel shared. “What’s often not mentioned is that we also carried cargo on that flight—not just people.

“We worked closely with key customers to make it happen, and the key message we wanted to convey is that if enough SAF is produced, we will fly it. That’s the point we’re driving home:the barrier is not operational it is one of price and scale”

The 100 percent SAF flight marks just one part of Virgin Atlantic’s broader strategy for sustainability. Diesel explained that there are two main areas the airline is focusing on to reduce its environmental footprint: the fleet and the fuel.

“82 percent of our aircraft are next-generation, averaging 6.9 years old, and by 2028, once all of our 16 A330neos arrive, we will be 100 percent next generation,”Diesel revealed. “While much of the conversation around sustainability focuses on future innovations, we’ve already made substantial progress in terms of fleet renewal, which has led to significant reductions in emissions.

“SAF production needs to scale, and that’s something we’re advocating for on a government level,” Diesel explained. “We’re supporting efforts to ensure that both the pricing and the supply of SAF are sustainable in the long term, so airlines have the certainty needed to plan for a future that’s both greener and more cost-effective. And the support of our Cargo customers is of vital importance, they are major purchasers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificates (SAFc) and their contribution to the SAF we buy helps to reduce their carbon footprint, support the growth of SAF, and achieve their sustainability goals”.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-13.23.05-1080x721.png,N,,2025-05-05 07:57:47.644193

,,2025-05-05 08:29:19+00:00,Eco-Business,Industry alliance launches in Singapore to spur Asia's green jet fuel uptake - Eco-Business,"Gabrielle See, Eco-Business",,,,,https://www.eco-business.com/news/industry-alliance-launches-in-singapore-to-spur-asias-green-jet-fuel-uptake/,"Temasek-owned decarbonisation platform GenZero, alongside the World Economic Forum (WEF), has launched a new regional coalition to overcome sluggish demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in a bid to accelerate the decarbonisation of Asia’s rapidly growing aviation sector.
“[SAF credits] can be very powerful in capitalising more demand,” GenZero’s chief executive Frederick Teo told Eco-Business.
In 2022, GenZero, together with national carrier Singapore Airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), piloted the sale of 1,000 SAF credits from a trial to procure SAF for the city-state’s airport.
They will have the opportunity to undertake a test purchase of SAF and SAF credits by next year, GenZero stated in its joint press release with WEF.
There are currently no methodologies to generate SAF carbon credits, though Gold Standard has plans to develop one for fuel switching in aviation.","Temasek-owned decarbonisation platform GenZero, alongside the World Economic Forum (WEF), has launched a new regional coalition to overcome sluggish demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in a bid to accelerate the decarbonisation of Asia’s rapidly growing aviation sector.

Announced on Monday at the GenZero Climate Summit 2025 held in Singapore, the Green Fuel Forward initiative brings together airlines, logistics providers and corporates to support the offtake of green jet fuel through the use of SAF credits, which each represent one metric tonne of SAF.

These credits can be purchased by entities outside of the aviation industry to offset their Scope 3 emissions, stemming from indirect value chain activities such as business travel and air freight, without having to directly procure the underlying green fuel product. This relatively novel asset class, which is traded and recorded using a “book and claim” system, is meant to open up a new revenue stream to bring down the costs of SAF and further scale its production.

“[SAF credits] can be very powerful in capitalising more demand,” GenZero’s chief executive Frederick Teo told Eco-Business. “If we make it cheaper, there will be more demand… With that kind of expanded demand, you give a signal to producers to invest in supply because they know there will be that kind of demand. That is the theory of change.”

“If corporates are prepared to offset some of their air travel emissions by buying and using SAF credits instead of just purchasing other kinds of credits, then the money we’re using to offset our Scope 3 is directly going into subsidising airlines and airports in purchasing SAF,” said Teo.

Aviation accounted for 2.5 per cent of global energy-related carbon emissions in 2023. While SAF is key towards decarbonising the sector, short of reducing air travel, one of the most significant barriers to its widespread production has been the substantial green premium airlines have to pay to make the switch from conventional jet fuel. In 2025, International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF – which currently only accounts for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production – will cost about US$2,500 per tonne, or about 3.8 times the cost of traditional fuel.

The absence of uniform policies and mandates across the region has also resulted in fragmented demand among airlines, which have been more focused on ramping up flights post-pandemic. Unlike Europe, which mandates 2 per cent SAF usage for flights departing from the European Union and United Kingdom airports as of this year, the first compulsory use of SAF in Asia will only begin in 2026, when Singapore and Thailand enforce a 1 per cent mandate.

Teo praised Singapore’s SAF mandate model – which will be implemented through a levy on air tickets rather than a strict fuel blending mandate – as an innovative way of boosting demand for green jet fuel while shielding airlines and passengers from the price volatility associated with it.

Corporates who are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide to offset their business travel emissions can therefore receive credits in return for subsidising SAF procured to reduce the Scope 1, or direct, emissions of airlines.

In 2022, GenZero, together with national carrier Singapore Airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), piloted the sale of 1,000 SAF credits from a trial to procure SAF for the city-state’s airport. About two-thirds of the credits generated were sold to corporates and air cargo companies – which was less successful than expected.

“Demand wasn’t as strong, people were not too familiar with the product, and ultimately, because it was a more expensive product, there was no willingness [to invest in SAF],” said CAAS’ chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng at a conference last year.

16 organisations have joined GenZero’s new initiative, including Air New Zealand, Boeing, Climate Impact X, DBS Bank, DHL, International Energy Agency, Mizuho, Nete, Qantas Group, Singapore Airlines, Temasek and UOB. They will have the opportunity to undertake a test purchase of SAF and SAF credits by next year, GenZero stated in its joint press release with WEF.

There are currently no methodologies to generate SAF carbon credits, though Gold Standard has plans to develop one for fuel switching in aviation. The industry body Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, which is also part of the new coalition, has also developed a book and claim system to ensure there is no double counting of credits.

Supply outpacing demand

While Southeast Asia is home to abundant feedstock resources, including used cooking oil, palm oil residues and municipal waste, the region’s biggest challenge lies in turning production capacity into actual consumption.

At least five new SAF facilities are set to come online in the Asia Pacific region within the next two years, threatening to outpace regional demand.

Air New Zealand, for instance, halved its SAF target for 2030 from to 10 per cent last year due to affordability concerns. SAF currently makes up only 1.6 per cent of its total fuel supply. Meanwhile, airline operators that are part of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, such as Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways, are cautiously pursuing a voluntary SAF usage goal of 5 per cent by the end of this decade.

This gap between where SAF is produced and where demand is located has led Asia to export over 370,000 tonnes of SAF in 2024, according to ship tracking data from Kpler – mostly from Finnish producer Neste’s Singapore refinery, the world’s largest production facility.

“The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals,” said Teo. “By mobilising corporates and airlines, we can create the certainty needed to spur innovation, scale production, and make lower-emission flights a reality.”",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/854af4fe91c324cc_org.png?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-05-05 07:58:27.978888

In an era of escalating climate concerns and energy challenges, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as a critical component in the decarbonisation of the global aviation sector.

Traditional fossil fuels have powered our aircraft for over a century but come at a steep environmental cost. With aviation emissions coming under increasing scrutiny, international mandates -- particularly in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the US -- are setting ambitious targets for SAF use. It is a transformative solution for the aviation sector, derived from renewable resources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, forestry by-products and even municipal solid waste. For Pakistan, an economy blessed with abundant agricultural resources, this global shift presents a unique opportunity to transform its aviation and energy sectors alike.

The production of SAF involves a two-step process. First, the feedstock is converted into an intermediate product, which is subsequently refined in the second step to produce the final SAF. The choice of production technology depends on the type of renewable feedstock, which can be classified into four main categories: lipid-based feedstocks (such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible vegetable oils), sugar-based feedstocks (such as wheat straw, rice husks and bagasse), lignin-rich feedstocks (e.g., forestry residues), and carbon dioxide (CO2).

Although a range of technologies exist for processing these feedstocks, only Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which converts waste oils, fats and greases into SAF via hydroprocessing, and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), which processes sugar-based alcohols such as ethanol or butanol through dehydration and oligomerisation, have been commercialised to date.

Emerging technologies like Hydroprocessed Catalytic Fast Pyrolysis Oil (HCFPO) and Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ) are particularly suitable for lignin-rich feedstocks. HCFPO employs catalytic fast pyrolysis (thermal decomposition) to produce bio-oils, which are then hydroprocessed into SAF.

CHJ, on the other hand, utilises hydrothermal liquefaction (thermochemical process) to convert feedstocks into biocrude, followed by hydroprocessing to refine it into SAF. This process mimics the natural formation of crude oil by applying heat and pressure to biomass.

CO2 represents one of the most radical and promising feedstocks in the quest for SAF. Industry leaders are exploring innovative techniques that convert CO2, captured directly from the atmosphere or concentrated point sources, into energy-dense SAF. This breakthrough approach offers a pathway to mitigate atmospheric CO2 levels and paves the way for a circular carbon economy in which waste emissions are transformed into valuable resources.

The conversion of CO2 into SAF is achieved through three primary pathways: biological, chemical, and electrical. The biological pathway utilises genetically engineered microorganisms to convert CO2 into intermediary products, such as oils or alcohols. The chemical pathway employs advanced catalytic systems to synthesise hydrocarbons from CO2 directly. Meanwhile, the electrical pathway leverages renewable energy to drive electrochemical reactors, reducing CO2 into intermediates that can subsequently be refined into SAF. Europe is pioneering advancements in electrochemical conversion, while Australia is at the forefront of biological innovation in this field.

Technological advancements now also enable the co-production of diesel alongside SAF. This innovation creates new opportunities for sustainable fuel solutions, accelerating the transition to cleaner energy.

The investment required for an SAF biorefinery yields considerable economic dividends despite its multibillion-dollar price tag at larger scales. Direct job creation triggers a ripple effect, driving indirect employment, supply-chain stimulation and cross-sectoral economic activities

SAF technologies enable scalable production, with capacities ranging from 100,000 tonnes to as much as one million tonnes annually. While large-scale refineries demand multibillion-dollar investments, their economic influence reaches far beyond their price tags. These facilities have the potential to generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs, serving as catalysts for regional development.

The construction phase of a SAF biorefinery involves extensive capital expenditure, spurring local contractors, suppliers, and related service providers. This financial injection stimulates regional development, strengthens infrastructure, and supports ancillary industries. Beyond the significant workforce required during development, once operational, the refinery will generate a few hundred direct jobs spanning plant operations, quality assurance, engineering, maintenance and administrative roles, alongside a range of support positions such as security personnel and drivers.

This scale of direct job creation triggers a ripple effect, driving indirect employment across multiple industries. For instance, ancillary industries such as feedstock production, transportation and logistics, equipment manufacturing, construction, and maintenance services are likely to benefit substantially. Based on analyses of similar renewable energy projects worldwide, it is reasonable to anticipate that an additional four to six indirect positions would emerge for every direct job generated. This would translate into thousands of indirect jobs associated with the SAF biorefinery project on a regional scale.

The economic impact extends further into several related industries. The agricultural sector, in particular, stands to gain as local farmers supply biomass feedstocks -- such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husks or other crop residues -- creating a steady demand stabilising rural incomes and encouraging sustainable agricultural practices.

On a national level, establishing a SAF biorefinery in Pakistan would contribute significantly to energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. Developing a home-grown SAF industry would also position Pakistan as one of the players in the global transition to renewable energies. As international markets increasingly favour sustainable and low-emission fuels, Pakistan could benefit from enhanced export opportunities.

The technological advancements and demonstration projects associated with SAF production could also spur innovation across Pakistan’s energy sector, further diversifying the country’s economic base. Additionally, this progress would influence research and development, foster innovation, and strengthen environmental services, transforming universities into leading hubs for sustainable fuel research.

The starting point in the transition to SAF requires a dynamic, multipronged approach that integrates investment, industrial development, and innovation. A well-defined strategy must prioritise attracting foreign investment, equipping local industries with the necessary infrastructure and expertise, and fostering a robust research and development ecosystem.

The investment required for an SAF biorefinery yields considerable economic dividends despite its multibillion-dollar price tag at larger scales. Direct job creation triggers a ripple effect, driving indirect employment, supply-chain stimulation and cross-sectoral economic activities, potentially multiplying these benefits severalfold. Ultimately, such investments are a vital pillar of regional and national growth. By transforming waste and renewable feedstocks into high-value SAF, Pakistan can simultaneously address environmental imperatives while laying the foundation for a more resilient and diversified economy.

Pakistan’s energy crisis is technical, economic, institutional and strategic. It is no longer enough to tweak the margins of Pakistan’s power sector. The deepening crisis of rising tariffs, circular debt and unutilised renewable energy calls for a fundamental rethink of the system’s architecture.

The idea of sector-coupling -- connecting electricity production with industrial use, transport and hydrogen generation -- offers a new lifeline. This opportunity is most vivid in Thatta, which hosts some of the country’s most productive wind corridors. Here, amid gusts of clean energy often left unused, lies the potential to recast Pakistan’s energy dilemma into an economic advantage. The conversion of surplus wind energy into green hydrogen could not only resolve the financial paradox of Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) but also position Pakistan as a future exporter in the burgeoning global hydrogen market, expected to reach $38.1 billion by 2029, from $5.2 billion in 2024.

The roots of this opportunity lie in a problem that has been festering for years. Pakistan’s energy governance model, structured around rigid power purchase agreements and a grid ill-equipped for intermittent generation, has led to a bizarre situation where the country is paying for electricity it cannot use. This is Non-Project Missed Volume -- payments made to wind and solar power producers even when their output cannot be dispatched due to grid constraints. These payments surged from just under Rs1.9 billion in FY2021–22 to a staggering Rs39.5 billion in FY2023–24. At this rate, the power sector is quite literally bleeding cash while the wind blows and the sun shines, further fueling the Rs2.3 trillion circular debt.

Under pressure from fiscal deficits and global lenders, the government has responded by renegotiating Power Purchase Agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), including those based on renewable energy. While this may offer short-term fiscal relief, it has severely dented investor confidence. Global lenders such as the IFC, ADB and Proparco have raised red flags. The perception of contract sanctity has eroded. The risk premium for renewable energy projects in Pakistan has increased, making capital more expensive or altogether unavailable. In this environment of uncertainty, the renewable energy sector, which had just begun to find its feet, is now once again on shaky ground.

This is where sector-coupling enters the conversation -- not as a buzzword but as a viable strategy. The principle is simple: link the energy sector with other sectors of the economy to create new demand, enhance efficiency, and reduce waste. In the case of Thatta, the focus is on converting curtailed wind energy into green hydrogen through electrolysis. This hydrogen can then be used across industrial, transport, and even power generation sectors. In fertiliser production, it can replace fossil fuel-based feedstock. In transport, it can serve as fuel for heavy vehicles. And in the global market, it represents a valuable export commodity with exponentially growing demand, especially for countries seeking to decarbonise aviation, shipping, and heavy industry.

Pakistan has the technical potential to produce nearly 69 million metric tons of green hydrogen annually, particularly in resource-rich areas like Sindh and Balochistan. Currently, its hydrogen export value is negligible, estimated at just $24,700 in 2023. But the international market is poised for an explosion, with low-emissions hydrogen required to scale from under one million tonnes in 2022 to at least 70 million tonnes by 2030 under the IEA Net Zero scenario. Countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea are investing heavily in future off-take agreements. For Pakistan, this isn’t just about technology but about timing. If it can create a functioning green hydrogen value chain, from generation to storage to transport and export, it can emerge as a competitive player in this high-growth market.

The sector-coupling model anchored in Thatta can help Pakistan kill two birds with one wind turbine. It offers a structural solution to the NPMV crisis and creates a new export industry aligned with global decarbonisation trends. It could become a template for other regions, such as Gwadar or coastal Balochistan

Thatta’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs), already receiving incentives under CPEC, offer the perfect experimental ground. These zones can be repurposed or newly designated as ‘Green Hydrogen Zones’, where tailored policy support, such as tax exemptions, customs relief and infrastructure facilitation, can be provided. India has already exempted SEZ-based green hydrogen projects from the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) requirement. Kenya has integrated hydrogen incentives into its Export Processing Zones. Pakistan can adopt similar models to attract both domestic and international investors, especially those seeking to diversify hydrogen supply chains away from saturated European hubs.

The benefits of such a strategy cut across stakeholder lines. For the government, it provides a long-term reduction in circular debt and enhanced energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels, which currently account for over 60% of primary energy. For consumers, it promises lower electricity tariffs in the long run, as more flexible energy systems reduce reliance on costly imported LNG or furnace oil. For the renewable sector, especially wind producers in Thatta, it offers a guaranteed buyer for their electricity, even when the grid cannot absorb it. This stabilises revenue streams and enhances the bankability of future projects.

Yet, as with all ambitious strategies, there are hurdles. The capital cost of hydrogen production is still high. Electrolysers, compressors, storage tanks, and desalination facilities for water are not cheap. Today’s Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) in Pakistan is estimated at $3.90–4.27 per kg, still above global export price competitiveness. Wind speeds in Thatta, though historically reliable, have shown a declining trend since 2009 -- a factor that must be studied before making large-scale commitments. Moreover, a clear regulatory framework for hydrogen production, safety standards, pricing mechanisms and export protocols is still missing in Pakistan. These gaps must be urgently addressed through a national hydrogen strategy.

Policymakers must also be sensitive to social and environmental concerns. Community engagement, environmental impact assessments, and benefit-sharing mechanisms should be central to developing these green hydrogen SEZs. To ensure inclusive development, local employment and upskilling opportunities must be woven into the planning fabric.

The first policy milestone should be a national green hydrogen strategy. It must outline production targets, permissible technologies, financial instruments, and market development plans. The government should invest in grid upgrades to reduce NPMV in the short term and ensure that surplus energy can be redirected to hydrogen production. A hydrogen certification scheme, aligned with international standards, would be essential to ensure export readiness. Simultaneously, partnerships with China, Germany and the Gulf States could bring technical expertise and capital.

The government should also consider mandating hydrogen blending in existing CNG infrastructure or creating a fixed share of hydrogen procurement in fertilizer manufacturing. These demand-side measures will complement the supply-side investments and help establish a robust domestic market.

Importantly, green hydrogen presents an emerging opportunity in the global carbon market. High-quality carbon credits generated from low-emission hydrogen projects can attract private capital, especially in developing countries like Pakistan, where compliance carbon pricing mechanisms are limited. According to the IEA and GenZero, carbon credits could be pivotal in bridging the green premium of early-stage technologies like green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, and direct air capture.

Given that global investment in these three technologies was just $9 billion in 2023 but needs to grow to $700 billion annually by 2050, leveraging carbon credits can be vital to unlock climate finance. For Pakistan, integrating green hydrogen projects into the voluntary or compliance carbon markets -- once robust methodologies are adopted -- could open a new revenue stream while strengthening its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). With the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) and other global bodies now enforcing stricter rules, projects based on verifiable hydrogen use in industrial decarbonisation can credibly claim carbon reductions, enhancing Pakistan’s appeal in global carbon trading.

Ultimately, the sector-coupling model anchored in Thatta can help Pakistan kill two birds with one wind turbine. It offers a structural solution to the NPMV crisis and creates a new export industry aligned with global decarbonisation trends. It could become a template for other regions, such as Gwadar or coastal Balochistan, where solar and wind potentials are similarly underutilised.

What Thatta offers is a window into a future where clean energy isn’t just a moral imperative or a climate commitment but an economic growth strategy. This shift is not optional for a country like Pakistan; it is existential. The winds of Thatta are already blowing.

В Госдуме предлагают нивелировать связанные с этим риски для отрасли производством российского низкоуглеродного топлива

Возможные риски в связи с началом вступления в действие обязательных требований Международной организации гражданской авиации (ICAO, ИКАО) о сокращении авиационных выбросов углекислого газа (CO2) с 2027 года обозначил правительству замглавы комитета Госдумы по энергетике Юрий Станкевич. В конце марта он обратился с этим вопросом в Минэнерго, Минтранс, Минпромторг и Минэкономразвития, следует из соответствующих писем в ведомства (РБК ознакомился с документами).

Речь идет об учрежденной в 2016 году в рамках ICAO, членом которой является Россия, Схеме компенсации и сокращения выбросов углерода (система CORSIA) в международной гражданской авиации. Это свод глобальных рыночных мер, направленных на достижение целей по повышению топливной эффективности на 2% в период до 2050 года и стабилизации уровня выбросов СО2 с 2020 года. С 2021 года ее применение является добровольным, но с 2027 года будет обязательным.

Согласно резолюции ICAO А41-22, схема предполагает, что за выбросы углекислого газа, превышающие базовый уровень (85% от показателя 2019 года), авиакомпании будут платить. Как указано в документах (депутат подтвердил их подлинность и факт обращения в министерства), возникающие таким образом дополнительные издержки создают риски для авиакомпаний России и снижают конкурентоспособность производства и поставок авиатоплива, которое предлагают российские нефтяники.

«Дополнительные затраты авиакомпаний могут быть переложены на пассажиров в виде повышения цен на билеты. Кроме того, это может вызвать рост цен на авиагрузоперевозки, что особенно затронет срочные грузы, такие как фармацевтика и скоропортящиеся продукты, а также вызовет увеличение нагрузки на другие виды транспорта», — пишет Станкевич.

По его мнению, решением может стать запуск в России промышленного производства низкоуглеродного или устойчивого авиатоплива — LCAF или SAF. Однако сейчас его верификацией занимаются только компании из недружественных государств — Швейцарии, Германии, Японии. Поэтому, заключает депутат, необходимо «обеспечить условия», при которых способность российского низкоуглеродного авиатоплива сокращать углеродный след была бы признана ICAO.

Производство «зеленого» авиатоплива

CORSIA предусматривает производство LCAF на существующей инфраструктуре нефтеперерабатывающих заводов, следует из ответа замглавы Минэнерго Павла Сорокина на запрос депутата. В то же время проводимая в России модернизация нефтеперерабатывающих заводов направлена на выпуск топлива высокого качества с низким углеродным следом, в том числе и авиационного керосина («Джет А-1», ТС-1, РТ), потенциально отвечающего критериям LCAF. Однако «нефтяные компании сообщили, что в настоящее время в Российской Федерации отсутствует единая методика расчета выбросов и нормативов выбросов парниковых газов при производстве LCAF». «Только после разработки такой методики Минэкономразвития России появится точная информация о возможности производства или необходимости внедрения дополнительных мероприятий для производства LCAF», — пишет замминистра.

Что касается вопросов производства в России топлива SAF и связанного с этим регулирования, то они относятся к компетенции Минпромторга, курирующего химические и биохимические предприятия, отмечает Сорокин. Вместе с тем, указывает он, определенная работа по стандартизации в данном направлении все же ведется. Она предусматривает разработку предварительного национального стандарта (ПНСТ) «Топлива для реактивных двигателей. Компонент, обеспечивающий соответствие принципам устойчивого развития. Технические условия». Кроме того, в настоящее время Росстандартом рассматривается вопрос верификации низкоуглеродного авиационного топлива.

РБК обратился за комментарием в пресс-службы Минпромторга, Минэкономразвития и Минтранса, где все вопросы переадресовали в Министерство энергетики. В Минэнерго на момент публикации не ответили. РБК также направил запрос в крупнейшие нефтяные и авиакомпании.

Согласно ответу замглавы Минтранса Владимира Потешкина на письмо Станкевича, в настоящее время подведомственное министерству ФГУП ГосНИИ ГА совместно с нефтяниками ведет научно-исследовательскую работу по оценке возможности применения в составе отечественного топлива для реактивных двигателей компонентов, снижающих углеродный след (смесь с SAF). «Полученные предварительные результаты исследований свидетельствуют об отсутствии негативного влияния компонентов на качество», — указывает замминистра.

В 2021 году сообщалось о создании в России биотопливного альянса («Евразийский SAF-альянс») компаниями «Газпром нефть», Airbus, «Аэрофлот», S7 Group, «Волга-Днепр», а также Институтом им. Н.Е. Жуковского и ГосНИИ ГА. В рамках него планировалось объединить экспертизу, чтобы ускорить процесс сертификации экологически чистого авиационного топлива (SAF) и способствовать его развитию в России. Первый полет на смеси такого биотоплива в российской гражданской авиации должен был произойти не позднее 2024 года. Как сообщили РБК в пресс-службе «Газпром нефти», компания в настоящий момент ведет разработку рецептуры собственного авиационного топлива SAF. Его основу составит переработанное масложировое сырье. «Эта технология ранее была успешно протестирована при производстве судового биотоплива, заправку которым «Газпром нефть» уже осуществляет в российских портах», — рассказали в компании.

Сертификация российского топлива в ICAO

Однако в рамках CORSIA использовать топливо LCAF возможно только при условии сертификации производителя одной из утвержденных ICAO систем сертификации устойчивости, отмечает Сорокин. Сейчас к ним относятся только две организации: International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) и Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), но в их полномочия входит сертификация только производителей топлива SAF. «Таким образом, ввиду отсутствия утвержденных ИКАО органов сертификации, уполномоченных сертифицировать производителей LCAF, сертификация LCAF в рамках CORSIA невозможна и является барьером для развития этого рынка», — пишет он.

По данным на апрель 2024 года, сертификацию этих систем получили девять партий топлива, произведенных тремя компаниями: Ecochem (Китай), Neste (Нидерланды) и World Energy (США). Чтобы в этом ряду появилось российское топливо и система сертификации, Минтранс предлагает работу по трем направлениям, следует из письма Потешкина.

В госрегулировании:

создать орган, наделенный полномочиями по выработке государственной политики и ее реализации в области декарбонизации авиационного топлива;

создать национальную систему сертификации авиатоплива LCAF и SAF с учетом требований ICAO;

Информировать ICAO о проведенной работе для дальнейшего одобрения национальных сертификатов SAF и LCAF.

В техрегулировании:

внести изменения в соответствующий техрегламент Таможенного союза;

разработать национальный стандарт на топливо для реактивных двигателей, содержащее синтезированные углеводороды.

В производстве:

разработать российские технологии производства авиатоплива LCAF, а также синтезированных углеводородов для топлива SAF;

провести комплексные исследования опытно-промышленных партий топлива SAF с привлечением профильных научно-исследовательских институтов для подтверждения соответствия качества и эксплуатационных свойств такого топлива требованиям по стандартизации и обеспечению норм летной годности;

При положительных результатах испытаний организовать промышленное производство SAF.

Сокращение выбросов в условиях санкций

Поскольку около 20% глобального предложения авиакеросина соответствует критериям LCAF, только его масштабное применение могло бы обеспечить достижение цели ICAO по сокращению нетто-эмиссии за счет альтернативного топлива на 5% к 2030 году, считает Иван Рубанов, заместитель начальника управления углеродного рынка и инновационных проектов Петербургской биржи. Это быстро, требует малых усилий и организационных затрат с минимальными инвестициями в основные фонды. «Суммарные затраты на запуск масштабного производства SAF оцениваются в несколько триллионов долларов. Сам этот инструмент оказывается едва ли не самым дорогим способом декарбонизации», — пишет Рубанов в Биржевом вестнике Петербургской биржи.

Он считает, что потенциал потребления LCAF на российском рынке велик и в перспективе может сравниться со всем объемом использования авиатоплива в международных перевозках — около 5 млн т в год. Это обеспечило бы десятипроцентное снижение эмиссии, при этом часть топлива могла бы продаваться судам иностранных авиакомпаний, заправляющихся в России. «С точки зрения предложения критериям LCAF системы CORSIA могут соответствовать 10–30% производимого в стране авиакеросина, которые способны покрыть 50–100% потребностей международных авиаперевозчиков», — резюмирует Рубанов. А механизмом, который мог бы стимулировать спрос российских компаний на LCAF, могло бы стать использование различных коэффициентов при расчете демпферных платежей для LCAF и стандартного авиатоплива.

Вместе с тем в 2022 году Россия заявила, что не считает себя связанной положениями резолюции Ассамблеи ICAO А41-22, которая касается критериев оценки единиц выбросов для системы CORSIA. Представители российской делегации сообщили, что «в условиях беспрецедентных односторонних ограничений в отношении международной гражданской авиации, введенных рядом государств — членов ИКАО, любые меры по компенсации для международной гражданской авиации теряют всякий смысл».

«С учетом всех изменений и присоединения к утверждению системы CORSIA, которое было уже слишком давно, мое мнение — России нужно выйти из данного соглашения. Учитывая, какое у нас сейчас взаимодействие с Европой, как ограничены полеты, для нас теряется в этом смысл. А с точки зрения всех остальных дружественных государств, я думаю, что можно договариваться», — считает зампредседателя наблюдательного совета ассоциации «Надежный партнер» Дмитрий Гусев. Однако пока формального отказа нет, требования должны соблюдаться, и руководствоваться в этом нужно экономической целесообразностью и минимальными для эксплуатантов рисками, добавляет эксперт. «У нас много нефти, из которой мы можем сделать любое топливо, и огромные территории с несравнимым потенциалом поглощения углерода», — отмечает он.

Гендиректор Friendly Avia Support Олександр Ланецкий говорит, что игнорировать новые требования ICAO нельзя, так как они распространяются на авиакомпании всех стран. «Отказаться от выплат можно будет только в том случае, если кто-то из стран-участниц выйдет из соглашений ICAO. Тогда сломается вся система, потому что авиакомпании этой страны получат неконкурентное преимущество», — полагает эксперт. По его словам, в 2024 году авиакомпания Air Baltic, которая эксплуатирует современные самолеты Airbus A220-300 (в парке авиакомпании 50 таких судов) с высокой топливной эффективностью, направляла на покупку квот на выбросы CO2 около 3% своих расходов. Самолеты предыдущих поколений с меньшей топливной эффективностью, которые составляют основу парка российских перевозчиков, будут генерировать больше CO2. Соответственно, расходы российских компаний будут выше. Он добавил, что эксплуатанты переложат их в цены авиабилетов, потому что альтернативных источников компенсации роста себестоимости перевозок у них нет.",https://s0.rbk.ru/v6_top_pics/media/img/8/35/347463924885358.jpg,N,,2025-05-04 17:56:29.577470

A traveler books a long-haul flight from Frankfurt to Singapore and notices a line item labeled “Environmental Surcharge.” It’s not optional, and it’s not tiny. For most economy passengers, it adds somewhere between €6 and €20. In business class, it can go much higher. At first glance, this might seem like a minor annoyance—another in a growing list of airline fees. But that small surcharge is the tip of a much larger shift: the full cost of aviation decarbonization is beginning to land squarely with the customer.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is the aviation industry’s primary tool to cut lifecycle carbon emissions without fundamentally changing the airframes or propulsion systems that have defined commercial flight for decades. SAF can, in theory, slash emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional Jet A fuel. In practice, its contribution is far smaller today—less than 1% of global jet fuel use—but that share is growing rapidly, driven by policy mandates in the EU, UK, and Singapore, and increasingly by corporate net-zero travel programs. The catch is cost. SAF, whether derived from used cooking oil, forestry residues, or purpose-grown biomass, typically costs two to five times as much as fossil jet fuel. Synthetic e-fuels derived from green hydrogen are even more expensive—often eight to ten times—and face enormous scaling barriers.

According to the International Energy Agency, global SAF production was approximately 600 million liters in 2023, a twelvefold increase over 2019 levels but still a fraction of what is needed. The IEA projects that to meet net-zero aviation pathways, SAF will need to account for at least 10% of global jet fuel consumption by 2030, rising steeply thereafter. The EU’s Fit for 55 package mandates 2% SAF in 2025, 6% by 2030, and 20% by 2035 for all flights departing EU airports. Singapore will require 1% from 2026, scaling to 3–5% by 2030, and is introducing a SAF levy on tickets to fund that mandate. Airlines aren’t absorbing those costs; they’re passing them through.

This is something that’s built into my projection of aviation demand and decarbonization through 2100. Airlines aren’t charities and climate change is real, so the industry is going to have to pay for low-carbon power, and what costs there are will be born by passengers. Most projections ignore electric aviation, but I’ve discussed this with top people at Ryanair, aerospace engineers and electric aviation founders globally. We all agree that hybrid electric aviation for up to 1,000 km routes with 100 passengers is inevitable, and that will cut a lot of flights out of the jet fuel demand equation. Further, increased flight costs will significantly soften the demand increases seen from 1980 to 2019. COVID itself fundamentally altered the industry, with significantly less business travel in the Age of Zoom. Now there’s data on how airlines are already passing costs along.

This pass-through is happening in multiple ways. In Europe, full-service airlines like Lufthansa and Air France–KLM have implemented mandatory SAF surcharges that scale by route and class. Lufthansa’s fee can reach up to €72 for long-haul business class tickets. In Singapore, the government is levying a SAF charge directly on tickets. Finnair and United Airlines offer voluntary SAF contributions during booking, typically a few euros or dollars, framed as an easy climate action. Meanwhile, corporate travel programs have emerged as SAF buyers of last resort, with firms like Microsoft, Deloitte, and Boston Consulting Group paying premiums through programs like United’s Eco-Skies Alliance and Lufthansa’s Compensaid Corporate. These arrangements use book-and-claim accounting to decouple the physical fuel uplift from the emission reduction benefit, allowing companies to claim SAF-related reductions even if the fuel was burned elsewhere.

Yet the real story isn’t just how airlines are pricing SAF today. It’s how this dynamic reshapes aviation economics in the next decade. A 10% SAF blend, which may be mandatory in some jurisdictions by 2030, could increase total fuel costs by 20–30% if the price premium holds. That’s before factoring in airport blending logistics, certification costs, and potential penalties for non-compliance. Since jet fuel historically comprises 20–30% of airline operating expenses, this is a structural cost pressure that can’t be ignored. Airlines operate on thin margins. They will not, and cannot, absorb that burden alone. Ticket prices will rise.

The industry projects rising demand in spite of this, something I think is wishful thinking. Boeing and IATA forecast that global passenger traffic will double by 2040, citing long-term economic growth and expanding middle classes. But these projections rest on historical price elasticity that may no longer hold. Airfare inflation, driven by decarbonized fuel, is likely to cap growth earlier than IATA expects. Per analysis from Transport & Environment and others, a 20% rise in average ticket prices could reduce demand by 10-15% depending on the route and travel purpose. That would be enough to flatten growth curves, especially for discretionary leisure travel.

Moreover, decarbonization is not evenly distributed. Low-cost carriers with thinner customer margins and fewer business-class subsidies will face tougher choices. Ryanair has already warned that EU climate policies will raise average fares by €10 to €15 over the decade, and that’s with very low percentages of SAF. These aren’t abstract numbers. They will alter behavior. Short-haul trips under 1,000 kilometers may begin to shift to rail in Europe and East Asia, where infrastructure allows. Long-haul tourism may plateau as cost pressures mount. Business travel—already declining in relative terms since the pandemic—is unlikely to resume its former dominance, especially as virtual meetings and sustainability reporting norms take deeper hold.

As SAF mandates tighten, airlines will look for relief valves. Government subsidies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s $1.25–$1.75 per gallon tax credit for SAF, provide temporary cushioning, but that’s also not something that is guaranteed to persist given the current Administration’s wrecking ball approach. Those incentives phase out within the decade in any event, and few governments are eager to fund unlimited fuel subsidies for an industry still perceived as a luxury emitter. Some airlines are lobbying for contracts-for-difference or other hedge instruments to reduce price volatility. But even with policy support, costs will not return to fossil-era baselines.

One consequence will be fleet innovation. As SAF costs climb, the incentive to use less liquid fuel grows. Turboprop aircraft for short-haul regional routes are already 30–40% more fuel-efficient per passenger-kilometer than regional jets. Battery-electric and hybrid-electric turboprops are under development by firms like Heart Aerospace, Ampaire, and others, with 19 to 100 seat configurations and ranges from 200 to 1,000 kilometers. These aircraft avoid most SAF costs altogether. By 2035, they are likely to be competitive for short regional hops, especially in jurisdictions with high carbon prices or SAF mandates. Airports may also adjust, shifting infrastructure investments toward regional mobility rather than long-haul expansions.

As I’ve noted, our biological waste streams are immense, with 2.5 billion tons of food waste annually alone, and more from agricultural, animal husbandry and forestry. I’ve assessed virtually all of the feedstocks and processing technologies and am comfortable that there is zero conflict between climate goals, feeding people and biofuel use for longer haul aviation and shipping. Further, shifting those waste streams into biofuels is an inherent climate benefit because a lot of them decompose anaerobically into methane, leading to big climate challenges. That points to bioSAF as the dominant pathway, not because it’s perfect, but because it’s available, certifiable, and cheaper than synthetic options. Green hydrogen-derived e-kerosene remains and will remain prohibitively expensive and power-intensive. Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil methane with carbon capture, being used for synthetic fuels will likely never reach the economic, regulatory or public acceptance thresholds needed for mass adoption in aviation.

We are seeing the start of the repricing of the sky. SAF is not a footnote—it is the future of aviation fuel, and it’s not and will not be cheap. Every surcharge and fare increase is a signal. As SAF blends rise from 1% today to 10% and eventually 20% by 2035, ticket prices will climb. Some travelers will fly less. Some routes will shrink. Short-haul aviation will start shifting to electric propulsion. The net result isn’t the end of flying, but a subtle inversion of the curve: fewer people flying more carefully, on planes that burn fewer liquids and more electrons, with costs and choices reshaped by carbon. The sooner we acknowledge this trajectory, the better we can navigate it.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-4-2025-09_46_34-AM-800x424.png,N,,2025-05-04 14:56:07.518303

The United States is facing a significant downturn in international tourism in 2025, with projections indicating a 5.1 percent drop in the number of travelers coming to the country. This marks a stark reversal from the previously anticipated growth rate of 8.8 percent. The impact extends beyond just the number of visitors; foreign visitor spending is expected to plummet by 10.9 percent, deepening the economic strain on the tourism sector.

This unexpected decline in international arrivals and spending is expected to have wide-ranging effects on industries dependent on tourism, from hospitality and retail to transportation and local businesses. While the U.S. had been preparing for a steady recovery following the pandemic, this sharp drop underscores the fragility of global travel in the face of shifting geopolitical and economic factors.

In conclusion, Japan Airlines’ record financial results for FY2024-2025 are a testament to its successful recovery following the pandemic.","Japan Airlines has achieved a remarkable milestone in fiscal year 2024-25, driven by a substantial surge in international passenger traffic. With a standout fourteen percent increase in international passengers, the airline has successfully capitalized on the growing demand from key US markets. This growth, fueled by a recovery in global travel and the airline’s expanding routes, highlights Japan Airlines’ ability to attract both inbound tourism and outbound business travel, positioning the airline for continued success in the highly competitive aviation industry.

Japan Airlines (JL) has announced outstanding financial results for fiscal year 2024-2025, driven by a strong 14% surge in international passenger traffic and strategic growth initiatives. The airline’s performance is also bolstered by substantial progress in its low-cost carrier (LCC) operations, full-service segments, and non-aviation business areas, as well as its sustainability efforts such as the adoption of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Japan Airlines’ Revenue Growth and Passenger Increase

For the fiscal year 2024-2025, Japan Airlines posted consolidated revenues of JPY 1,844 billion, marking a significant 11.6% year-on-year increase. This performance is the highest since the airline’s re-listing. The growth in revenues was primarily driven by a 14.4% increase in international passenger numbers, alongside steady increases in domestic travel, cargo operations, and other non-aviation business segments.

The airline’s operating expenses also saw a rise, climbing by 9.8% year-on-year to JPY 1,693.4 billion. This increase was largely influenced by the depreciation of the Japanese yen, higher fuel costs, and strategic investments in workforce expansion. However, despite these increased costs, Japan Airlines reported impressive profit growth. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 18.7%, totaling JPY 172.4 billion, while net profit grew by 12.0%, reaching JPY 107.0 billion.

Robust International Passenger Demand

One of the key contributors to Japan Airlines’ growth was the sharp increase in international passenger demand. With international travel rebounding after pandemic-related slowdowns, the airline saw a 14.4% growth in international passengers. This increase was driven by a combination of recovering outbound business travel and rising inbound tourism to Japan. High-demand routes such as Tokyo-Narita (NRT) to Chicago (ORD) and expanded services from Osaka-Kansai (KIX) contributed significantly to this surge.

In addition, the airline capitalized on the revival of global tourism and business travel, with Southeast Asia, North America, and intra-Asia routes experiencing notable growth. The airline saw an 11.9% rise in international revenue as a result of these trends, solidifying its position as a key player in the global aviation market.

Operational Performance and Highlights

Japan Airlines’ full-service operations continued to show strong performance, contributing significantly to the company’s growth. Revenue from its full-service segment climbed by 9.8%, totaling JPY 1,451.8 billion. This growth was driven by sustained demand from inbound tourism, recovering business travel, and strong demand for high-value cargo. Operating profit (EBIT) from the full-service operations rose by 4.7%, reaching JPY 111.1 billion.

In the domestic market, Japan Airlines also saw continued growth in passenger demand. Domestic passenger numbers rose by 2.9% for the full year, with domestic revenue increasing by 3.7%. One of the highlights in the domestic market was the airline’s record-high load factor of 82.9% in the fourth quarter, which was bolstered by promotional campaigns and strong demand.

Strategic Expansion and Fleet Growth

Looking forward, Japan Airlines is actively expanding its network and fleet to accommodate increasing passenger demand. The airline plans to begin new direct flights between Tokyo-Narita (NRT) and Chicago (ORD) starting May 31, 2025. In addition, it will increase flight frequencies on its Honolulu routes from Osaka (KIX) and Nagoya (NGO) by July.

To further enhance its long-term growth, Japan Airlines plans to expand its fleet by adding ten Boeing 787-9s and twenty Airbus A350-900s from FY2027 onwards. These new aircraft will allow Japan Airlines to increase its seat capacity and enhance service offerings for both domestic and international routes.

Additionally, Japan Airlines has launched the “DEEEEP JAPAN” project in collaboration with the travel agency JTB, with the goal of promoting regional tourism across Japan. Starting from FY2028, Japan Airlines will begin replacing its Boeing 767 aircraft with more fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo models, initially for Tokyo-Haneda (HND) routes.

Financial Outlook and Future Projections

Japan Airlines’ solid financial performance has resulted in a boost to its annual dividend, which has been increased from JPY 80 to JPY 86 per share. Additionally, the year-end dividend has risen from JPY 40 to JPY 46. This reflects the airline’s strong earnings and its commitment to delivering value to shareholders.

For the fiscal year 2025-2026, Japan Airlines expects to maintain its positive momentum. The airline is forecasting total revenues of JPY 1,977.0 billion, with EBIT reaching JPY 200.0 billion and net profit growing to JPY 115.0 billion. The company attributes this optimistic forecast to continued demand for air travel, coupled with the airline’s ongoing strategic fleet and network expansions.

Japan Airlines has seen an impressive fourteen percent increase in international passenger traffic for fiscal year 2024-25, driven by strong demand from US markets. This growth underscores the airline’s expanding global presence and recovery in both inbound and outbound travel.

In conclusion, Japan Airlines’ record financial results for FY2024-2025 are a testament to its successful recovery following the pandemic. With growing passenger numbers, operational efficiencies, and strategic investments in fleet and network expansions, Japan Airlines is well-positioned for continued growth in the coming years.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-04T110242540.jpg,N,,2025-05-04 02:56:24.981928

As News.com.au reported, the minority stakeholder in the Utah Jazz bought a Bombardier 7500 capable of carrying up to 19 passengers and said he has ""a deep internal conflict"" about it. He cited personal security, running a global business from Australia, and fatherhood in a LinkedIn post as reasons for using the carbon-heavy mode of transport.

Why is it an issue when many other billionaires utilize large vessels such as private jets and yachts? For one, the amount of polluting gases regular private jet travel produces goes against Cannon-Brookes' stance on environmental issues.

He has been an active climate campaigner and is a key investor in SunCable's giant Australia-Asia PowerLink — a project to transport energy from solar farms in the Northern Territory to Singapore.

Per the Financial Post, his investment firm, Grok Ventures, attempted a 2022 takeover of Australia's AGL Energy to help the country transition from coal to more sustainable energy. The Financial Review reported that his influence and shares in the company encouraged AGL to close the country's biggest coal plant a decade ahead of schedule.

Carbon gases not only cause air pollution but are a major factor in the overheating planet and the unpredictable weather patterns that come with it. While these jets make up only a fraction of those gases — almost 2% of the industry's overall pollution — the figure is steadily increasing. The journal Communications Earth & Environment published a study in 2024 that said the polluting gases from private jets had increased by 46% over the past five years.

Some effort is being made to mitigate a portion of those toxins. VistaJet, a leader in private business aviation, is using biogenic sustainable aviation fuel created from used cooking oil. Others, including Flexjet, also use carbon offset programs — projects that reduce or remove pollution elsewhere to compensate for what flights produce.

How or if Cannon-Brookes will offset his private travel remains to be seen. Based on carbon footprint, a greener option may have been the low fuel-consuming Pilatus PC-12, a single-engine jet that's 10 times less polluting than a Bombardier Global 6000, per Aeroaffaires. At least the Bombardier 7500 has its pros, as ""approximately 85% of the materials used are recoverable,"" according to Runway Girl Network.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mike-Cannon-Brookesimage-recxlAf0NNgIWZTp0.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 23:56:07.565943

With birth rates plummeting globally, countries face a future of shrinking and ageing societies driven by an unrelenting collapse in fertility.

Family structures and living arrangements previously imaged only in science fiction will become commonplace features of everyday life with an unprecedented collapse of procreative power.

These stark warnings of an era of pervasive depopulation were delivered at the 2025 Congress of the Asia Pacific Initiative on Reproduction (ASPIRE) in Singapore today.

Internationally respected political economist, Dr Nicholas Eberstadt, is supporting an ASPIRE campaign advocating for policy changes that will encourage family building, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

Dr Eberstadt is the Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute where he is renowned for his demographic research and studies on international security. He is also a senior advisor to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

He told the ASPIRE Congress that between 1965 and 2015 the human fertility rate in births per woman fell by half and the “record breaking, jaw dropping” plunge has quickened in recent years in rich and poor countries alike.

Dr Eberstadt said by 2023 fertility levels were 40 per cent below replacement levels in Japan, 50 per cent in mainland China, 60 per cent in Taiwan and 65 per cent in South Korea. Sub-replacement trends are also evident in countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.

“Labour forces will shrink all around the world due to the spread of sub-replacement birth rates with the old beginning to outnumber the young,” Dr Eberstadt explained.

“Societies will have to adjust their expectations to comport with the new realities of fewer workers, savers, taxpayers, renters, home buyers, entrepreneurs, innovators, inventors, consumers and voters.

“Dwindling workforces, reduced savings and investment, and unsustainable social outlays and budget deficits are all on the cards for today’s developed countries without sweeping changes in immigration, lifecycle earning and consumption patterns, and government policies for taxation and social expenditures.

“Super-elders of 80-plus years of age are the world’s fastest growing cohort. By 2050, there will be more of them than children in some countries. The burden of caring for people with dementia will pose growing costs – human, social, economic – in an aging and shrinking world.”

Dr Eberstadt said as families and societies assume new structures under long-term population decline, the challenge will be to develop new habits of mind, conventions and cooperative objectives.

“Policymakers will have to learn new rules for development in the midst of depopulation,” he explained. “Investors, likewise, will need new playbooks to profit from an altered environment of opportunity and risk.

“There will be less margin for error for investment projects, be they public or private, and no rising tide of demand from a growing pool of consumers or taxpayers to count on.

“Prosperity in a depopulating world will also depend on open economics, free trade in goods, services and finance to counter the constraints that shrinking populations impose. As the hunt for scarce talent becomes more acute, the movement of people will take on new economic salience and immigration will matter more than in does today.”

ASPIRE President, Dr Clare Boothroyd, said in response to the disturbing fall in fertility rates, a new ASPIRE special interest group would be created to harness expertise in population sustainability.

She will co-Chair the group with acclaimed reproductive endocrinologist, Professor Dominique de Ziegler from Foch Hospital in Paris.

“Humanity is entering uncharted territory in the phenomenon of depopulation, and it is a challenge that must be embraced by governments, industry, the education sector and the public to push for family friendly policies that encourage family planning,” Dr Boothroyd said.

The ASPIRE Congress at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore has attracted more than 2,000 leaders from various disciplines in assisted reproduction to address latest advances and knowledge in fertility health.

Abel is currently the vice chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.
This year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting marked the second straight year that NetJets was not mentioned during the question-and-answer session.
NetJets Executive Moves Last year, NetJets also quietly made an executive change, although it did not issue an external announcement.
Patrick Gallagher, NetJets’ President of Sales, Marketing, and Owner Services divisions, was named President of NetJets Aviation.","NetJets, the world’s largest private jet operator, will have a new CEO at its parent company by the end of 2025.

NetJets, Inc. includes management and charter operator Executive Jet Management.

Concluding Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett said earlier today that he would recommend to the company’s board that Greg Abel assume his position as chief executive.

Abel is currently the vice chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

He has been tabbed as Buffett’s successor for some time.

Berkshire Hathaway bought NetJets in 1998 for $711 million.

Buffett’s entry into the business aviation segment is widely credited for encouraging investment in the sector.

Kenn Ricci, chairman of rival Flexjet, recently talked about Buffett’s impact during an NBAA podcast:

‘We estimated we needed about $60 million to $80 million for core fleet buying used aircraft. We went out to the banks with my great idea…and maybe we had $7 million, $10 million in debt available…Then, in 1998, Warren Buffett bought NetJets. And every bank I had been to thought I was a genius all of a sudden. And they were all looking to get into the industry and we had $500 million. In some way, but for Warren endorsing our industry, I never would have found the debt capital to be able to build the inventory and go as fast as I did.’

The high-visibility Berkshire Hathaway platform has also promoted private aviation to a wider audience of businesses and HNW consumers.

NetJets programmatic offerings—guaranteed jet cards and fractional ownership—fill the gap between ad hoc charters and full ownership, encouraging more consumers to enter the segment.

At the end of 2024, NetJets had 9,106 employees.

Buffett and Airlines

In 2017, amid another round of airline investments, Buffett told shareholders, “You couldn’t pick a tougher industry.”

He also reprised his famous 2007 quote, “If a far-sighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.”

After his first airline investment in 1989, Buffett wrote, “In the case of our commitment to USAir, industry economics had soured before the ink dried on our check. As I’ve previously mentioned, it was I who happily jumped into the pool; no one pushed me. Yes, I knew the industry would be ruggedly competitive, but I did not expect its leaders to engage in prolonged kamikaze behavior. In the last two years, airline companies have acted as if they are member of a competitive tontine, which they wish to bring to its conclusion as rapidly as possible.”

Oxford defines a tontine as an annuity shared by subscribers to a loan or common fund, the shares increasing as subscribers die until the last survivor enjoys the whole income.

Buffett and NetJets

The private aviation business has proven to be as fierce and challenging to make a buck as the Part 121 airlines.

Berkshire Hathaway bought NetJets in 1998 for $711 million.

In 2010, Buffett wrote, “Even though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its acquisition in 1998, were a failure.”

Buffett told shareholders that in his first 11 years of ownership, the private jet company incurred an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million.

Debt went from $102 million to $1.9 billion.

At the time, the legendary investor noted, “Without Berkshire’s guarantee of this debt, NetJets would have been out of business.”

In 2023, the late Charlie Munger told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, “NetJets has been remarkable. You can argue it’s worth as much as any airline now.”

American Airlines, the least valuable major airline at the time, was valued at around $9 billion.

For the industry’s dominant player, it put an exclamation point on what is one of aviation’s biggest turnarounds.

Last year, NetJets and its pilots agreed to a new contract.

It will grant cockpit crews an extra $1.6 billion in compensation over five years.

The move was viewed as an endorsement of NetJets and private aviation from America’s best-known and arguably most successful investor.

NetJets currently holds 2,000 options for new private jets from Bombardier, Embraer, and Textron Aviation.

This year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting marked the second straight year that NetJets was not mentioned during the question-and-answer session.

NetJets Executive Moves

Last year, NetJets also quietly made an executive change, although it did not issue an external announcement.

Patrick Gallagher, NetJets’ President of Sales, Marketing, and Owner Services divisions, was named President of NetJets Aviation.

He now oversees the brand’s strategic direction, vision, and ongoing growth.

Before joining the company, Gallagher was Executive Vice President and Head of Sales at Marquis Jet Partners, joining NetJets when it bought the jet card group in 2010.

He previously held sales and management positions at Jet Aviation and United Airlines.",https://cdn.privatejetcardcomparisons.com/uploads/shutterstock_353934110.jpg?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop,N,,2025-05-03 15:56:33.327322

Sole trader Edd, was up against some of the largest corporations in the motor industry including Motul, Exol lubricants, Borg automative and KYP components.

He said: “I was really surprised, it was such a shock to be against the big boys and win.”

“Being sustainable is something I’m quite keen on and I’m hugely proud to be recognised on a national level.”

READ MORE: Man wins Mechanic of the Year before appearance on Radio 2

Edd, whose first job was delivering the Andover Advertiser, is now a renowned car consultant who travels around the UK and internationally to solve diagnostic problems when garages can’t figure out the issue.

With his work he has travelled to Milan, Geneva, Dublin, Sicily and around the UK but started to feel like ‘the mechanic with the biggest carbon footprint out there.’

He said: “Travelling everywhere, I became aware of my carbon footprint, and I started looking at what I could do to offset it and mitigate it.

“There are a lot of sustainability issues in this area that you can’t control but I’ve developed a real passion for it, and I strive to be more environmentally friendly in everything I do.""

One thing Edd does to reduce his environmental impact is that he offsets his carbon footprint via the Heathrow website when booking flights.

This allows him to compensate for his flight’s carbon dioxide production by purchasing sustainable aviation fuel.

To reduce the flight’s weight and impact, he also negotiates with garages to allow him to use their mechanical tools, allowing him to travel light with his diagnostic laptop and a small bag.

When he arrives at his destination, he doesn’t hire a car and instead will use public transport and walk as much as possible.

He said: “As a sole trader, there’s not one big thing I can do, but it’s just lots of little things.”

Edd noticed that his diagnostic laptop was generating large amounts of paperwork for each job, with sometimes up to 65 pages being printed for a bigger job.

He said: “It was producing reams of paper and using lots of ink which begins to mount up.

“It was mostly unnecessary and I was able to eradicate that.”

As the UK brand ambassador for Topdon who manufacture his diagnostic equipment, Edd was able to work with them to create different equipment which allows all the information which would have been printed to be turned into a digital report and emailed via Bluetooth instead.

Edd has also implemented smaller changes into his work, like using reusable gloves and car covers opposed to disposable ones.

His efforts to create a more sustainable motoring industry didn’t go unnoticed, and he was nominated for the Car and Aftermarket Trader environmental award by more than one source.

He said: “It was a big honour just to be there, and it was just little me sat there not expecting to win.

“The judges said they were impressed, and my passion for sustainability shone through.”

Edd has said he would love to support the awards next year, even if he is not nominated, as they are celebrating a great cause.",https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/19396011.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-05-03 14:56:25.948939

Die ADAC Luftrettung hat das weltweit erste Langzeitprojekt zum Einsatz von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) im Luftrettungsbetrieb erfolgreich abgeschlossen. In einem dreijährigen Realbetrieb zeigten sich keine Einschränkungen bei Leistung oder Einsatzbereitschaft der beiden beteiligten Hubschrauber. Gleichzeitig wurde eine signifikante Reduktion von ultrafeinen Partikeln festgestellt. Das Projekt wurde in Kooperation mit dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Safran Helicopter Engines, Pratt & Whitney Canada und Airbus Helicopters durchgeführt.

Reduktion ultrafeiner Partikel im Flugbetrieb

Die Rettungshubschrauber „Christoph Rheinland“ und „Christoph Europa 1“ wurden mit einem SAF-Blend aus bis zu 38 Prozent nachhaltigen Rohstoffen wie recycelten Pflanzenfetten betrieben. Bei typischer Leerlaufleistung wurde eine Reduktion ultrafeiner Partikel um 44 Prozent festgestellt, bei normaler Einsatzgeschwindigkeit lag die Reduktion bei 33 Prozent. Auf den CO2-Ausstoß bezogen konnte über den gesamten Lebenszyklus des Treibstoffs eine Verringerung erreicht werden, da SAF fossile Bestandteile ersetzt.

Keine nachteiligen Effekte auf Technik und Triebwerke

Die eingesetzten Helikopter vom Typ Airbus H145 und H135 zeigten keine nachweisbaren Schäden oder höheren Verschleiß an Triebwerken im Vergleich zum herkömmlichen Kerosinbetrieb. Auch bei der Emission von CO2, CO und NOx wurden keine Veränderungen festgestellt. Die eingesetzten Triebwerke – Safran Arriel und Pratt & Whitney PW206B – sind derzeit für den Betrieb mit SAF-Mischungen bis zu 50 Prozent zugelassen.

Forschung und Entwicklung werden fortgesetzt

Die ADAC Luftrettung kündigte an, die Forschung weiter zu vertiefen und künftig einen höheren SAF-Anteil bis hin zu 100 Prozent anzustreben. Langfristig sollen auch synthetische E-Fuels (Power-to-Liquid) zum Einsatz kommen. Das Projekt startete im Sommer 2021 mit dem ersten SAF-Flug eines Rettungshubschraubers. Eine Ausweitung des SAF-Betriebs auf weitere Einsatzstunden ist geplant.

Kooperation mit Forschung und Industrie

Das Projekt wurde vom DLR mit einem mobilen Messlabor begleitet. Die Partnerunternehmen betonten die Bedeutung des Projekts für die Bewertung der Umweltverträglichkeit und technischen Verträglichkeit von SAF.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

INTERNATIONAL

Moving forward – The foreign ministers for the BRICS bloc, which met earlier this week, are looking forward to advancing the implementation of the 2024 BRICS Carbon Market Partnership agreement to strengthen collaboration among the members nations. The partnership will facilitate cooperation in the field of carbon markets, with a specific focus on capacity-building, the Presidency Declaration stated. The ministers also plan to establish a BRICS Laboratory on Trade, Climate Change, and Sustainable Development, to promote collaboration on mutually supportive approaches to trade and environmental policy. As well, the officials rejected unilateral, punitive, and discriminatory protectionist measures, not in line with international law, such as unilateral and discriminatory carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), the statement added.

Backtracking concern – More than two-dozen investors who collectively manage £1.2 tln in assets have called on HSBC to reinstate its 2030 climate targets, which in February the bank said it would need to rely more on carbon offsetting to meet. At the same time, HSBC delayed its net-zero emissions targets for operations, travel, and supply chains to 2050. While the bank is also reviewing its targets for reducing financed emissions, and removed its chief sustainability officers from the executive board in Oct. 2024 as part of a wider reshuffle. The group of shareholders including Trinity College Cambridge and the Church of England is calling on the bank to urgently affirm it will continue to build on its climate progress rather than backtrack, and to undertake this process in dialogue with shareholders, said a spokesperson from ShareAction who coordinated the call to action ahead of HSBC’s AGM on Friday.

Unwanted advisory – The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) offered to advise this year’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil but talks did not progress, according to people familiar, reported by the FT. TBI, established by the former British prime minister in 2016, previously worked closely with both the UAE and Azerbaijan, hosts of COP28 and COP29 respectively, moves that proved controversial. In a recent report, Blair called for a reset of net zero policies in the UK, warning voters were being made to make too many ‘financial sacrifices’. His foreword to the report urged governments to change course on tackling climate change and said the COP process won’t deliver change fast enough. His critique of the annual forum would be viewed as deeply unhelpful by Brazil, one COP veteran said. People close to the Brazilian government have said it’s unlikely the TBI could win an advisory role with the country ahead of COP30, particularly given Brazil’s large and professional foreign service.

Easy does it – Total nEHS-regulated emissions in 2023 were approximately 282.6 mln tonnes of CO2, a 2.6% decrease from 2022, according to an official report published by the German emissions authority this week. When adjusting for newly included fuels like coal, the reduction was about 3.8%, or 10.9 mln tonnes of CO2. In 2023, nEHS covered around 42% of Germany’s total GHG emissions, while the EU ETS covered around 43%. Combined, about 85% of Germany’s emissions were subject to carbon pricing DEHSt said. Main contributors to the nEHS emissions were from natural gas and diesel producers, each accounting for around one-third of emissions.

Investing in livelihoods – Singapore’s Temasek is helping the communities in Kenya’s Kitui and Baringo counties earn carbon credits through the plantation of 2.1 mln trees, local media outlet The Star has reported. Half of the carbon credits generated under the project will be issued to the investor, while 45% will be sold in the voluntary market and the revenue will be paid to the tree owners, it said. Initially launched in 2021, the project was stopped after a drought hit Kenya, affecting tree plantations. In Dec. 2022, Temasek extended a funding of $15,000 to Global EverGreening Alliance that went to the construction of the water sump-well, giving a big boost to tree-planting, livelihoods, and land restoration activities in the region.

Here are the facts – The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) has published a fact sheet on its legal CO2 removal and storage framework. The fact sheet provides information on current incentives and legal conditions for CCS and CDR technologies and is aimed particularly at project developers, buyers of negative emissions in the form of CO2 certificates, cantonal and municipal permitting authorities, and the interested public. It is available in German, French, Italian, and English.

Missing the mark – By lagging in carbon commodification, Gulf countries risk forfeiting significant revenue and losing access to critical funding for low-carbon technologies and fuels, according to Jan Haizmann of Zero Emissions Traders Alliance, in an opinion piece published for Zawya Projects. Gulf countries risk leaving money – a lot of money – on the table, he wrote, as they risk being left behind in scaling carbon finance. Moreover, they relinquish sources of funding for new fuels and technologies to meet their climate goals, Haizmann wrote.

Uncertain outlook – Chemicals company BASF reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance on Friday, targeting 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and adjusted for one-off items of between €8 bln – €8.4 bln, up from €7.9 bln last year. During the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA fell 3.2% to €2.63 bln, broadly in line with market expectations. The German company warned the outlook was highly uncertain due to US tariffs and the unknown impact of how other countries respond. Net income in the Jan-March period dropped 41% to €808 mln. BASF plans to hold its 49% stake in two planned North Sea wind farms back to original owner Vattenfall, while retaining the Swedish utility as a renewable power supplier. The company is holding its annual investor meeting Friday. (Reuters)

Profit drop – Volkswagen’s first quarter operating profit for the core brand group dropped by 46.3%, due to EU carbon provisions and write-down on inventory related to US tariffs, the automaker said on Friday. The operating profit for the core brand group fell to €1.12 bln, from €2.08 bln a year ago, while its VW passenger car unit saw an 84.9% drop to €112 mln. In April, VW said it included a €600 mln provision for potential fines for missing European carbon emissions targets in first quarter results. (Reuters)

Carbon bomb financing – City of London banks have invested more than $100 bln into companies developing so-called ‘carbon bombs’ — huge oil, gas, and coal projects that would drive the climate past globally agreed temperature limits with hugely damaging consequences worldwide, according to a study by Leave It In the Ground Organisation (LINGO). Nine London-based banks, including HSBC, NatWest, Barclays, and Lloyds, have participated in financing companies responsible for at least 117 carbon bomb projects in 28 countries from 2016-23, the researchers found. If the projects advance, they will have potential to emit 420 bln tonnes of CO2, equivalent to over a decade of current global CO2 emissions. HSBC was found to financially support companies involved in the most such projects at 104 in total.

Rebranded – Climate finance company HeavyFinance, dedicated to advancing regenerative agriculture in Europe, has rebranded as InSoil to better reflect the firm’s broader focus on soil health and carbon credit generation, ArcticStartup reported on Friday. The company said it launched a €50-mln private credit fund to support projects with measurable climate impact, with the EIF committing €20 mln. The new capital will go towards widening access to its 0% interest Green Loans and accelerate the expansion of its Carbon Farming Program, aiming at enrolling 1 mln ha by 2026.

ASIA PACIFIC

Green route – A ‘green shipping route’ between South Korea and the US will be established by 2027 as previously planned, according to national news agency Yonhap, which cited remarks by officials from the Korean ocean ministry. The two countries will cooperate to introduce eco-friendly ships, establish infrastructure for carbon-neutral fuels such as green methanol, as well as set up relevant standards. South Korea is also working with Australia to study the feasibility of another green shipping route, likely to be launched in the first half of 2029.

Adding clout – China has published a draft of the country’s first-ever environmental code, which should establish principles and guiding provisions, facilitate the integration of related legislation, and fill gaps in the current legal framework, state-owned news agency Xinhua reported. Currently, China has around 30 laws and more than 100 administrative regulations in the environmental field, including one announced last year for the operation of the national emissions trading scheme.

Full throttle – The world’s largest 100% battery electric ship is close being finished by a shipyard in Tasmania, Australia and will go on to transport passengers in South America, Renew Economy reported. The 130-metre, zero-emissions Hull 096 was built by shipbuilder Incat for South American ferry operator Buquebus. The vessel includes over 250 tonnes of batteries with an energy storage capacity of more than 40 MWh, four times larger than any previous maritime installation in the world. Incat will finish a final fit out, battery installation, energy system integration, and sea trials will take place later this year. The Hull 096 is the ninth vessel Incat has built for Buquebus, but the first that is zero emissions.

AMERICAS

Scary IRA – More than three dozen Republicans have banded together to urge a total repeal of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to E&E News. The outlet reported 38 lawmakers said they feared “parochial interests” would keep US President Donald Trump from fulfilling his promises to unleash American energy in a letter to House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo). An environmental research centre estimated in April that repealing certain tax credit provisions in the IRA could save $421 bln in federal spending by 2034.

Pivoting programme priorities – The US EPA has announced a new phase of organisational restructuring intended to improve operational efficiency and better align staff with the agency’s statutory responsibilities. The changes, made under President Trump’s executive order on workforce optimisation, affect the Office of the Administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and Office of Water. Measures include the creation of new offices focused on state air partnerships, clean air programmes, and applied science, as well as the reallocation of over 130 technical and scientific staff to address backlogs in chemical and pesticide reviews.

Storage standards set – Ohio representatives introduced House Bill 170, which aims to establish a legal and regulatory framework for carbon capture and geologic storage in the state. The bill grants the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management exclusive authority over carbon sequestration activities, including permitting and oversight of underground injection wells classified under UIC Class VI. It establishes procedures for site permitting and consolidation, sets financial assurance and liability requirements, and outlines post-closure responsibilities. The bill also clarifies ownership of injected CO2 and limits liability for surface and subsurface property owners, except under specific conditions. The legislation follows the recent introduction of a similar bill by Ohio senators.

SAF research funding – A new bill in Minnesota would require the commissioner of the state’s Pollution Control Agency to pursue steps towards development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in St. Paul. HF 3280 would mandate the commissioner to contract an entity to design CO2 capture and transport infrastructure to produce SAF at the Metropolitan Water Resource Recovery Facility in the city. The bill would appropriate $300,000 from the state’s general fund in pursuit of this goal, inclusive of a report to be submitted no later than June 2029 that details capital and operation costs, workers employed, and an estimated volume of SAF to be produced annually.

Bills, bills, bills – Two California bills looking to increase transparency around cost impacts of transportation fuel regulations on consumers have recently progressed in the California legislature. Assembly Bill 555 (AB 555), which seeks to require California regulator ARB to submit quarterly reports to the Legislature detailing how its regulations affect fuel prices for Californian consumers, has been referred to the Assembly Appropriations Committee, with a hearing scheduled on May 7. Senate Bill 348 (SB 348), which has also been referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee, proposes to require ARB to revise LCF by Jan. 31, 2026 to reduce its financial burden on drivers. The bill mandates a full analysis of carbon credit pass-through costs, prioritises driver-focused policy changes, and calls for a balance between environmental goals and economic equity. It also requires a financial impact analysis whenever ARB adopts or revises regulations that directly affect drivers.

Shifting goalposts – Quebec modified the date it expects to publish and enact changes to its cap-and-trade programme on Friday. The province’s environment ministry (MELCCFP) updated its site detailing to indicate that it expects publication of proposed regulation or other legislative instruments in spring-summer 2025 and enactment of a by-law or other legislative instrument in fall-winter 2025. Previously those timelines listed were spring and fall 2025. Changes to the province’s joint carbon market with California have been long delayed, as market participants initially expected a key rulemaking document to be published in fall 2024.

Fuel rules – California’s ARB issued an advisory on Friday clarifying fuel compliance requirements for ocean-going vessels (OGVs) operating within 24 nautical miles of the California coast. The Ocean-Going Vessel Fuel Regulation mandates the use of marine gas oil (MGO) or marine diesel oil (MDO) with no more than 0.1% sulfur content, aligned with ISO 8217 standards. Vessels may use alternative fuels such as natural gas, methanol, and electricity if they are among those explicitly exempt from the regulation. Non-exempt alternative fuels like biodiesel or renewable diesel may only be used with an ARB-approved research exemption. The advisory also confirms that compliant pilot fuels may be used with exempt primary fuels and outlines the process for applying for research exemptions, including pre-approval requirements and emissions minimisation measures. Enforcement applies to vessels not meeting these requirements unless operating under an approved exemption.

Plugging away – Zefiro Methane, a US-based environmental services company focused on methane abatement, announced Friday that its subsidiary Plants & Goodwin secured new contracts to plug oil and gas wells from the Ohio state government. The contracts include ten wells located in Ashtabula county.

Cowboy country cash tracker – Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) announced a new interactive project map that allows stakeholders to pinpoint each of the 306 ERA-funded projects to-date throughout Alberta, across hundreds of cities, towns, and hamlets. The interface includes a series of dashboards and charts that provide a visual overview of ERA’s portfolio of nearly C$970 mln ($702 mln) worth of investments made over 16 years of advancing innovative technologies that contribute to economic growth and emissions reduction in the province.

Crossing fingers – Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said that she’s confident Dow’s C$9 bln ($6.5 bln) net zero petrochemicals project will proceed, even though the company said it was delaying construction until market conditions improve. The Path2Zero project, claimed to be the world’s first net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions ethylene and derivatives complex. It was planned to be located in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Smith said that she spoke with CEO Jim Fitterling and said that it was just a matter of slowing down the timing of the project amid broader global uncertainty. (Calgary Herald)

Croaker encroachers – Two companies in Quebec were sentenced to pay C$35,000 ($25,300) in fines for causing damage to an area that is protected by the Species at Risk Act. The geographic area near Montreal is approximately 2 km squared and was protected by emergency order in 2016 to decrease habitat loss for the Western Chorus Frog and prevent activities that could harm the species. In 2023, Habitations Pilon and Les excavations Jacques Germain & fils were making changes to a billboard using heavy machinery, which caused damage to more than a quarter of the protected area – visible damage covered over 612 meters squared. Of the fines paid, C$30,000 will be directed to the Government of Canada’s Environmental Damages Fund and C$5,000 will be paid to the Receiver General for Canada.

The future is now – IETA has published a paper on ‘The Digital Transformation of Carbon Markets’. In the report, the emissions trading association outlines its vision for what a digitally transformed carbon market could look like, suggesting that overall, the carbon market has generally been slow to fully embrace technological innovation. The organisation said that AI and other digital developments could speed credit generation, lower operational costs, and enhance market transparency and integrity.

New maps – Project proponents can now access Verra’s provisional versions of allocated deforestation risk maps for Cambodia and Guatemala. This is part of the standard’s new REDD jurisdictional methodology, within the module for Avoided Unplanned Deforestation (AUD). Under the module, proponents can conduct preliminary deforestation due diligence using this open-access data.

Growth plans – Imperative, a carbon project development company, has announced the appointment of John Nagulendran as Chief Growth & Investment Officer and member of the board of directors. Nagulendran will support CEO Scobie Mackay with identifying and executing the company’s capital and strategic growth plans. He will also lead strategic engagement with the company’s investors, governments, civil society ,and other stakeholders. Nagulendran previously spent 14 years at Switzerland-based Pala Investments where he was responsible for structuring and executing public and private equity raisings, project financings, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, and divestments in the natural resources and critical minerals sector. He was previously at Herbert Smith Freehills and Rajah & Tann.

AND FINALLY…

Dead men drink no CO2 – Spirits distributor Blue Caterpillar has entered a strategic partnership with UK-based Two Drifters Distillery to distribute the world’s first carbon-negative rum. Starting in June, the sustainably produced rums will be available in global travel retail and select domestic markets across the Caribbean and the Americas.

If passed, the legislation would provide a major push for SAF development in Michigan, combining environmental goals with economic support for the state’s agriculture sector.","State lawmakers in Michigan have unveiled a bipartisan plan to help launch a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in the state. The proposal—introduced as House Bills 4424-4425 and Senate Bills 235-236—aims to offer an income tax credit to those who produce or blend SAF for flights departing from Michigan, reports Michigan House Republicans.

SAF, made from renewable sources like corn or soybeans, is blended with traditional jet fuel to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. It is viewed as a cleaner alternative that can help the state meet future energy and environmental goals.

“Things are changing fast in Michigan,” said Rep. Jerry Neyer, a Republican from Shepherd. “Farmers are stuck in a ‘wait and see’ mode due to shifting federal policies. This plan gives them a clear signal: there’s a growing market for their crops in clean fuel production. It’s a practical way to cut emissions, grow the economy, and support our agricultural community.”

Sen. Sam Singh, a Democrat from East Lansing, said the measure is aligned with the goals of the state’s broader clean energy initiative. “It won’t be easy to decarbonize the aviation sector, but this is a smart first step,” he said. “By working with farmers and producers, we can reduce emissions while strengthening Michigan’s economy.”

Under the proposed legislation, producers and blenders of SAF would receive a $1.50 per gallon tax credit. Additional incentives would be available for achieving higher emissions reductions. The annual cap on incentives would be $4.5 million in the first year and $9 million annually over the following nine years.

Sen. Joseph Bellino, a Republican from Monroe, praised the plan for its potential to deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits. “This is a commonsense approach that supports local farmers and helps keep fuel prices stable, all while making aviation cleaner,” he said.

Il commercio verso gli Stati Uniti di questa preziosa risorsa, infatti, è bloccato.

L’ultimo carico diretto negli USA, che fino a pochi mesi fa erano il principale acquirente del prodotto, secondo Reuters sarebbe partito tra fine marzo e inizio aprile. Per comprendere l’importanza di questo bene, basta pensare che il valore dell’export cinese di UCO nel 2023 ha raggiunto i 2,64 miliardi di dollari (complessivamente 3 milioni di tonnellate), toccando livelli record. I trader cinesi, chiusa la via americana, cercano altri sbocchi – i dazi di Trump hanno portato anche all’aumento dei prezzi dei prodotti di Temu e Shein.

Richard Dickinson, capo del trading di Amarus Trading, una delle principali aziende del settore con sede a Shanghai, prevede che l’attuale situazione rimanga invariata nel medio termine. “Una parte delle esportazioni sarà dirottata in Europa e in nuovi mercati asiatici come Corea, Thailandia, Malesia e India”, ha dichiarato. Ma a cosa serve, effettivamente, l’olio esausto? Principalmente per la produzione di carburanti sostenibili, in particolare del Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Parliamo di una delle soluzioni più promettenti per ridurre le emissioni dell’aviazione civile – nel frattempo Airbus progetta l’aereo del futuro che, ovviamente, sfrutterà al massimo il SAF. L’Europa è in prima linea nella transizione verde e ha imposto una quota obbligatoria del 2 per cento di SAF nei carburanti per l’aviazione a partire da quest’anno, il che la rende un mercato particolarmente attrattivo per gli esportatori cinesi.

A quanto pare, sempre secondo le stime di Reuters, almeno metà delle esportazioni cinesi di UCO nei prossimi mesi saranno diretti verso l’Unione Europea. Come rivelato da Dickinson, pure in Asia le alternative non mancheranno: in Thailandia, Malesia e Giappone sono attivi o in fase di avvio almeno quattro impianti SAF, con una capacità produttiva annua complessiva di 700mila tonnellate. Un “fermento industriale” che potrebbe assorbire parte dell’UCO non più esportato negli Stati Uniti.

Senza considerare che la domanda interna cinese sta crescendo sensibilmente. Il Paese ha avviato nel 2024 diversi nuovi impianti per la produzione di SAF, tra cui quelli di di Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, Haixin Energy Technology, Haike Chemical e Blue Whale Bioenergy. Dando un’occhiata alla ricostruzione di Reuters, la Cina consumerebbe già tra le 100mila e le 120mila tonnellate di UCO al mese per produrre carburante sostenibile, ma il volume è destinato ad aumentare con l’avvio di altri stabilimenti.

Insomma, in un contesto in cui il mercato globale cerca di ricalibrarsi, l’olio esausto – che di fatto è uno scarto – si sta trasformando in una risorsa strategica, capace di connettere politiche ambientali, economia circolare e geopolitica del commercio energetico.",https://images.everyeye.it/img-notizie/europa-invasa-dall-olio-esausto-cinese-opportunitA-ecologica-rischio-nascosto-v4-797430.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 13:56:13.769556

Ujjwala Yojana Expands Its Reach

The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), one of the government’s flagship social welfare schemes, has emerged as a cornerstone of energy access. As of now, the Ujjwala scheme has reached 10.33 crore households. Since its launch, nearly 222 crore LPG refills have been delivered to PMUY beneficiaries, with around 13 lakh refills being taken daily.

The government currently provides a targeted subsidy of Rs 300 per cylinder to all Ujjwala users. This initiative has also helped improve LPG usage among economically weaker households. Per capita LPG consumption has risen from 3.01 cylinders annually in 2019–20 to 3.95 in 2023–24. The current financial year is already showing higher consumption levels, with per capita use reaching 4.34 cylinders on a pro-rata basis as of October 2024.

Push for Biofuels and Ethanol Blending

In a major thrust towards greener fuels, India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme has recorded a significant rise in ethanol supply—from 38 crore litres in 2013–14 to over 707 crore litres in 2023–24. This has translated into an average ethanol blending rate of 14.6 per cent during the current ethanol supply year, with blending already reaching 16.23 per cent as of December 29, 2024. Over 17,400 fuel stations are now dispensing E20 petrol (20 per cent ethanol).

The government also aims to develop 900 KTPA of Green Hydrogen capacity by 2030, with tenders for 42 KTPA already floated and another 128 KTPA in the pipeline. In aviation fuel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 have been set.

Additionally, the PM JI-VAN Yojana has been revised to include a wider range of advanced biofuels and extended till FY 2028–29. The amendments also allow brownfield and bolt-on projects to qualify for support.

Refining Capacity and Upstream Growth

India currently operates 22 refineries with a total capacity of 256.8 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA). Of these, 18 are in the public sector, three are privately owned, and one operates as a joint venture. The public sector contributes the lion’s share at 157.3 MMTPA.

The refining capacity is expected to grow to 309.5 MMTPA by 2028, driven by expansion projects in 11 PSU refineries and a new grassroots facility. In the upstream sector, 741 wells—including 132 exploratory and 609 development wells—were drilled in FY 2023–24. Natural gas production rose to 36.44 billion cubic meters (BCM) from 34.45 BCM the previous year. Additionally, 16,645 LKM of 2D and 15,701 SKM of 3D seismic surveys were conducted. A total of 12 new oil and gas discoveries were made under nomination and contractual regimes.

The government also acquired 42,944 LKM of 2D seismic data through airborne gravity and magnetic surveys, bolstering future exploration efforts.

Policy Reforms and Diversification

To attract new players and unlock smaller reserves, the government introduced the Discovered Small Fields (DSF) Policy in 2015. So far, three bidding rounds have been completed, resulting in 85 contracts, of which 55 remain active. Five fields are already producing, with cumulative output reaching 520 Mbbl of oil and 138 MMSCM of gas.

In the Coal Bed Methane (CBM) sector, 15 blocks have reached a production rate of 1.8 MMSCMD, with total production of 6.38 BCM and over $2.46 billion invested to date.

To reduce dependency on select countries, the ministry diversified its oil and gas imports during FY 2023–24. PSUs like IOCL and GAIL secured long-term LNG supply deals with ADNOC, UAE, locking in 2.7 MMT annually.

The government is also building strategic reserves. Under SPR Phase I, 5.33 MMT of storage was commissioned in Mangalore, Padur, and Visakhapatnam. Phase II, approved in 2021, adds another 6.5 MMT of underground storage at Chandikhol and Padur through public-private partnerships.

Road to Energy Independence

The government’s multi-pronged strategy to cut import dependency includes a broader switch to natural gas, promotion of biofuels like ethanol, compressed biogas, and biodiesel, and support for energy-efficient refinery processes. Ethanol blending alone has brought significant benefits: as of September 2024, farmers have received around Rs 92,409 crore in payments under the EBP programme. This has also led to foreign exchange savings of over Rs 1.08 lakh crore, crude oil substitution of 185 lakh metric tonnes, and CO₂ emissions reduction of about 557 lakh metric tonnes.

With a projected 20 per cent ethanol blend likely to contribute over Rs 35,000 crore to farmers annually, the government has also launched the SATAT initiative to scale up CBG for transport use.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/05/03/1963608-energy.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 09:56:30.949686

To be characterised as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) qualifying oriented, a biofuel should have a LCA result that meets certain sustainability criteria [10].
The ReFuelEU regulation requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum share of SAF into all aviation fuel sold in the EU with the minimum share of SAF supplied at each EU airport.
Moreover, policy should support SAF uptake by also taxing aviation fossil fuel to close the gap and allow price parity.","There has been a lot of emphasis placed on the technological pathways for the production of SAF. By design, these SAFs are drop-in solutions, which can be directly blended into existing fuel infrastructure at airports and are compatible with modern aircraft [4] Having bigger diversity of pathways available is important as this allows SAF production from diversified feedstock. There are currently seven biofuel production pathways that are certified to produce SAF, which perform at operationally equivalent levels to Jet A1 fuel. The most widely used technologies of production that currently allow a 50% blend are:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT): This technology converts biomass or waste into liquid fuels using a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactor.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA): This technology converts vegetable oils or animal fats into liquid fuels using a hydro processing process.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This technology uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then used to synthesise liquid fuels.

Methanol to Jet technology can deliver e-jet fuel from renewable electricity, water, and CO2 or advanced biofuel from solid biomass feedstocks.

One of the biggest challenges for the further deployment of SAF is the cost, which is currently at least twice as high as conventional jet fuel (Fig. 1). During 2022, the average SAF price estimate was around USD 2,400/t, albeit with significant differences across regions. Moreover, the cost of producing SAF varies depending on the technology used and the feedstock.

The cost of FT-SAF is currently the highest, but it is expected to come down as the technology matures [5]. The cost of HEFA-SAF and PtL-SAF is lower, but they are still more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The availability of feedstock is also an important factor in the production of SAF [6]. Within a competitive market framework, increased production levels and expansion of the feedstock mix should exert downward pressure on SAF prices, progressively closing the gap to fossil-based jet fuel and easing the financial burden on airlines.

It should be noted that not all SAF are the same and the blended maximum with normal Jet fuel is currently 50%. Aromatics in jet fuel are needed for maintaining seal compatibility. A lack of aromatics can result in seal shrinkage which can lead to fuel leakage and seal failures with certain types of seals that exist in older legacy engine products, airframes, facilities and fuelling trucks. Fuel-seal compatibility is a key consideration for SAF certification and blending limits [7]. There is still a lack of clarity of research and current certification by aircraft manufacturers on the effect older aircraft and implications of going to 100% blending rates may have on the operating economics of older aircraft and the resultant maintenance costs for operators in developing or emerging economies.

It is likely that aviation will need between 330–445 million tonnes of SAF per annum by 2050. The scale-up will be a significant challenge. Up to $1.45 trillion worth of investment over the next 30 years will be required to develop this new energy system The Waypoint analysis (Table 1) provides scenarios about the SAF growth needed, but assumes that the jet fuel production plants come on line as exactly forecasted and have the required funding. This is a large assumption given the pressure from other modes of transport and the growth rate of air transport. There is still a clear production shortfall and the added factor of offtake agreements, which today are only in the forum of memorandum of understanding, raise doubts over each of these scenarios.

Current production intends to follow the F1 trajectory, but the expected policy environment in the next 2–4 years aims to shift towards the F1 high trajectory at a global level. The F1 high+ trajectory is very feasible, but extra policy initiatives are needed to reach that point: recent announcements suggest this could be a possibility towards the 2030 timeframe. Practicalities of financing, construction and production timelines around the world mean getting above F1 high + is unlikely before 2030.

Another pertinent point to the SAF discourse is the entire lifecycle analysis or Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) [8]. The LCA is used to evaluate the environmental impact of SAF production, ranging from the impact of feedstock production, sorting and refining to SAF production, transportation and use. LCA studies have shown that SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel [9]. The environmental impact of SAF depends on the technology used for its production and the feedstock sources. To be characterised as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) qualifying oriented, a biofuel should have a LCA result that meets certain sustainability criteria [10]. The Life cycle emission value is composed of two main elements: (1) Core Life Cycle Assessment emissions, which looks at emissions related to feedstock, fuel production facilities, transportation and fuel combustion and (2) Induced land-use change (ILUC) emissions which may require additional land use in the production with feedstock.

SAF without policy support would remain an underinvested private sector [11]. There are various policy options that can support SAF, such as blending mandates, excise duty reductions/exemptions, research, development and demonstration funding and financial de-risking measures. For example, the Biorefinery Assistance Program, established within the Farm Bill, provides a loan guarantee for companies that turn waste into renewable jet fuel. The most important legislative measures related to biofuels in Europe are the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), the Energy Taxation Directive and the Directive on the Quality of Petrol and Diesel Fuels (FQD). The EU’s recast RED II, which was ratified by the EU parliament in September 2023, sets out the EU's stricter bioenergy sustainability criteria and includes advanced biofuels & renewable fuels of non-biological origin for aviation as part of its higher renewable energy targets [12]. The regulation provides incentives, such as financial support for research and development, to promote SAF technologies and scale-up initiatives [13].

The intertwining of European and international regulations is catalysing a shift towards SAF in Europe's aviation sector. The ReFuelEU regulation requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum share of SAF into all aviation fuel sold in the EU with the minimum share of SAF supplied at each EU airport. The minimum blend for SAF will be 2% by 2025, 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040 and 70% by 2050. The minimum share of synthetic aviation fuels will be 0.7% in 2030, 5% by 2035, 15% by 2045 and 35% by 2050.

Feedstock acquisition is a significant portion of SAF production cost and is linked to feedstock procurement, such as used cooking oils, agricultural residues, and dedicated energy crops [14]. Subsidies to the energy sector is a common practice and subsidies can support the supply of SAF (REF Efthymiou and Ryley, 2022). Direct subsidies for biofuels are only 6% (USD 38 billion) of the total amount and have mainly come from the EU (USD 11.4 billion) and the United States (USD 14.1 billion), whereas direct subsidies to fossil fuels exceeding the subsidies for renewable energy by a factor of 19 [15]. Europe needs to consider direct subsidies per output of biomass or input (indirect) subsidies for the production of biomass along with support to the full supply chain.

The technology and infrastructure needs for the scalability of SAF production processes like Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch necessitate substantial investment in technology and infrastructural development [15]. There is currently a need for increased investments in research to enable 100% SAF certification without blending requirements [16] which will allow wider deployment of SAF at scale and simplify consumption by operators with respect to infrastructure requirements at airports. Policy should further support Research and Development (R&D) of new technological pathways to scale up and deliver SAF.

In addition, regulatory measures like ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and net-zero emissions targets adopted by the aviation industry are important to support the uptake of SAF. Moreover, policy should support SAF uptake by also taxing aviation fossil fuel to close the gap and allow price parity.

This paper evaluated the SAF supply challenges to meet the forecasted supply of SAF, both from a mandated perspective, lifecycle analysis of fuel produced and from a feedstock cost. This paper concludes that central to the challenge will be price and availability of feedstock for the SAF quantities needed to fulfil current REFuelEU mandate. The paper also argued that the need for policy support and national government funding and incentives to build up SAF production infrastructure and stimulate supply.

Many challenges remain in the production and supply of SAF to meet the targets of 2050, with the price of SAF playing an important role. By a combination of scaling up of commercial PtL and SAF in general, the effect will be an improvement of lifecycle emissions performance as well as better economics for production. Despite the challenges, the outlook for the global SAF market is positive; with increasing demand for sustainable aviation solutions, combined with technological advancements and growing economies of scale, which are expected to drive the growth of the SAF market in the coming years and will help overcome price barriers in the long term.

The contribution of the paper is shedding light on the cost and production challenges that exist today and suggesting policy solutions that will allow the further deployment of SAF. More importantly, we want to highlight the need for effective policy support that considers effects like the Jevons paradox and the Green paradox of Sinn and approach decarbonisation policy in a system way.

The paper argues that further research and development into new production methods is essential for driving down production costs and discovering new, efficient production methods. By combining and prioritising these policy and incentive drivers, governments and institutions need to provide incentives for private sector participation, such as tax breaks or direct subsidies. The paper addresses the research gap of aviation decarbonisation by bringing together the policy and the free market performance of SAF highlighting the challenges.",https://static-content.springer.com/cover/book/978-3-031-89444-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 21:56:44.804292

Less than a year after announcing plans to establish a hydrogen-based aviation fuel hub at Pittsburgh International Airport, Pennsylvania-based natural gas producer CNX has quietly taken down the website on which it advertised the hub.

The move comes as the fate of the much-vaunted hydrogen industry — seen by the Biden administration as a way to power America while reducing climate-altering emissions — is in upheaval.

While a Biden-era rule dealt a blow to those in the gas and oil industry hoping to invest in hydrogen technology and offered greater financial incentives to the renewable energy sector, President Donald Trump is showing preference for fossil fuel-powered hydrogen. Meanwhile, the fate of those Biden-era tax credits — whether for renewable energy or fossil fuel — is up in the air as congress wades through the budget reconciliation process.

Under Trump’s guidance, the Department of Energy has indicated it plans to kill Biden-era funding for four renewable-powered hydrogen hubs in primarily Democratic regions while retaining funds for fossil fuel-powered hubs in mostly red states, such as South Dakota, Ohio and Kentucky.

California, along with Oregon, Washington and other regions, are on the Department of Energy’s “cut” list, according to Politico, which said it obtained a spreadsheet of the projects.

If the recommendations are ultimately adopted by the Trump administration, Pennsylvania would very much become a state divided. While a proposed hub in the Appalachian region that would run on fossil fuels is marked for approval, a hub mostly reliant on renewable energy near Philadelphia is marked for denial.

The seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs were a main plank of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda, a $7 billion effort to establish a national network of hydrogen producers to slow the use of the fossil fuels largely blamed for global warming.

But with four of the hubs eliminated, the envisioned national hydrogen grid would become a patchwork, seemingly drawn along political lines and primarily powered by polluting sources of energy.

Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate & Energy program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said:

The hydrogen hubs program was intended to spur innovations and demonstrations on how best to advance hydrogen as a tool in the clean energy economy,

“Blatantly co-opting these funds for use as handouts to political supporters and favored polluters would be shameful, and fully undermine the program’s ability to achieve those aims.”

While the Pennsylvania hub fueled by natural gas would use methane to provide energy for the production of so-called blue hydrogen, the other hub would use renewable energy such as wind and solar to produce what’s known as green hydrogen. By itself, the burning of hydrogen does not produce carbon dioxide emissions.

CNX was originally involved in the former hub, known as ARCH2, but told the Pittsburgh Business Times in March that it had paused involvement in the project because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding. CNX’s name was also deleted from the ARCH2 website.

CNX did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the hydrogen hub and the sustainable aviation fuel site in Pittsburgh.

A spokesperson for the airport said it,

Is continuing to move forward with its plans to become one of the first airports to have sustainable fuel production on-site.

CNX was initially one of 15 companies enlisted in the hub, with plans to contribute “low carbon” natural gas to power hydrogen production, which entails using steam to draw off the hydrogen atoms from methane molecules, an expensive and energy intensive process.

But the company’s evolving relationship with the hydrogen industry appears to have soured when the Biden administration finalized a long-awaited federal rule on a tax credit for hydrogen production called 45V.

That final rule, CNX argued, was “overly restrictive,” and failed “to create sufficient economic incentives” for the company to expand its production of methane released from abandoned coal mines, which it said was key to the growing hydrogen economy. CNX pitched its involvement in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel project in Pittsburgh as being dependent upon the outcome of the 45V rule.

McNamara said,

We saw the fossil fuel industry view 45V as a lucrative chance for profit,

“Not by truly reducing emissions, but by introducing loopholes that made it easier to qualify.”

CNX had previously lobbied for the intricacies of 45V to work out in its favor. A little more than a year ago, a CNX lobbyist pushed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office to lobby the federal government to ensure the Treasury Department’s hydrogen rule was lucrative for coal mine methane — a request to which the Shapiro administration agreed, Capital & Main reported at the time.

The value the rule gave to coal mine-derived natural gas came down to a series of arcane specifics in a formula that measures life-cycle emissions from beginning to end of the creation of a single kilogram of hydrogen.

CNX urged the Treasury Department to treat coal mine methane as carbon-negative with the assumption that it would otherwise leak into the atmosphere from inactive coal mines, releasing a more potent greenhouse gas than if it were captured and burned, which would release carbon dioxide. (Both are greenhouse gases, but methane is well understood to be around 80 times more potent in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe.) By ascribing to this captured methane a negative value, a tiny portion of it could be blended into a natural gas hydrogen feedstock and qualify for the highest tier of the 45V tax incentive, the same level as hydrogen produced with renewable energy.

But the final rule went against the pleas of CNX and companies like it, including the ARCH2 hub itself, which urged the Treasury Department to pass a methane-friendly rule in 2024, arguing it could “lead to a loss of $6 billion in private investments” otherwise and have “far-reaching consequences” for the hydrogen industry.

Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank Ohio River Valley Institute, said:

It’s like the Treasury Department went out of its way to say, ‘We hear what you’re saying.

“And the answer is no,”

The ruling was seen as a win for environmentalists, who urged the Treasury Department to ensure that any projects receiving subsidies under the guise of being “clean” were in fact clean. They feared CNX’s proposal, and that of other fossil fuel producers, would’ve given natural-gas based hydrogen a tax boost equal to that for renewable, emissions-free sources of hydrogen.

How and whether the rule will be upheld by the Trump administration — which has shown strong support for fossil fuels and a general disdain for renewable energy — remains an open question, and one of concern to environmentalists. According to Bloomberg, the American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade group, has lobbied the White House to ensure fossil fuels can qualify for the highest tier of the hydrogen tax credit.

O’Leary sees CNX’s apparent exit from ARCH2 as a sign of the hub’s strained economics. In October, O’Leary authored a paper in which he noted that the hub had lost four of its development partners, while a handful of others were showing signs of financial stress.

O’Leary wrote,

This is not a resume that inspires confidence among prospective investors,

CNX’s reluctance to move forward signals a broader trend within the industry, O’Leary said in an interview with Capital & Main.

O’Leary said,

The wheels are coming off,

“Even after subsidies are taken into account, the economics still aren’t there to make many of these projects work.”

Another project development partner for ARCH2, KeyState Energy, is also showing signs of uncertainty. In February, a primary customer for its blue hydrogen, Nikola Corporation, a transportation company that had planned to use the hydrogen for a zero-emission truck fleet, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company plans to sell its assets.

KeyState CEO Perry Babb told Capital & Main the company had pivoted from its energy production project with Nikola to a new ammonia fertilizer project that has a committed customer, and will still rely on hydrogen and receive funds from ARCH2. The first payment from the hubs program has been doled out and KeyState will invoice for reimbursement soon, he said.

Babb said he still meets regularly with the remaining ARCH2 project partners, who are “all positive in expressing a way forward.” But he noted that, for years, he’s weathered regulatory uncertainty; the final 45V rule was the nail in the coffin for Keystate’s original plans to produce blue hydrogen under ARCH2. He said the company has also put its participation in the Pittsburgh Sustainable Aviation Fuel hub “on pause.”

He said,

Last May, I began to notice dozens of hydrogen projects being canceled,

“I had thought that it was essentially because the business case wasn’t sound.With the continued uncertainty around tax credits through the end of the Biden administration… we said, ‘That’s it. We’re done. We’re going to go where there’s a market that’s predictable.’”

While failing to find a partner in the Biden-era Treasury Department, CNX could soon turn to the state, where Gov. Shapiro is reupping a $49 million tax credit for hydrogen production as part of his “Lightning Plan,” a six-pronged portfolio of legislation designed to speed up the commonwealth’s clean energy economy.

Though supported by some state environmental groups, the plan caught the ire of others, like Karen Feridun, co-founder of the grassroots Better Path Coalition, who said in a statement that the Lightning Plan would “continue and even expand fossil fuel production.” On March 11, a group of Democratic senators and representatives introduced 12 cosponsorship memos, six in each chamber, carrying out Shapiro’s plan.

Feridun said of Shapiro in an interview with Capital & Main,

He’s going to do whatever he needs to do to try to keep [hydrogen] going,

“It’s a nice way to kind of provide cover for having a continued fossil fuel plan,” one that “sounds really good to voters.”

Should ARCH2 unravel, Feridun fears grassroots environmentalists would be tasked with tracking individual projects, without the cohesion of a hub offering guidance. Even so, she said there never was “a clear map that defined what the footprint of all of this was,” which left frontline communities in the dark.

Like O’Leary, Danny Cullenward, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said he now sees the hydrogen “hype” bubble beginning to burst. Though he believes hydrogen has an important, if niche, place in the clean energy transition, its economics don’t make sense in all uses unless heavily subsidized.

He said,

We basically set up a structure that said, at the end of this rainbow is a giant pot of gold.

And everybody said, ‘We’d all like to do that. That all sounds great to us

“I think now the cold, hard reality of, ‘Does hydrogen make sense? And in what applications would it make sense?’ is becoming a little bit more real.”

The whiplash of all this impacts Pennsylvania communities, many that are former oil, gas and coal towns learning that major projects they’d once planned for are no longer.

O’Leary said,

It’s immensely damaging,

“State or even county and municipal level governments, they’re making economic development choices based on these expectations.The distraction impact of what’s going on is just staggering.”

Key projects include IOC’s expansion of its Panipat, Paradip, Gujarat and Barauni refineries to raise their capacities and integrate petrochemicals units.
Refinery throughput at nine stand-alone refineries fell 2.4% year on year to 71.56 million mt in 2024-25 (April-March).
The company’s nine stand-alone refineries have a capacity of 70.25 million mt/year, accounting for 27.36% of India’s total refinery capacity.
Commenting on the crude oil import outlook following recent US sanctions and the emerging tariff scenario, Sahney said the company was treading cautiously before signing term deals for Russian crude.","Indian Oil Corp. is looking to invest up to $11 billion over the next four-five years to expand its petrochemicals capacity as part of a business strategy in a shifting energy landscape, where demand for transport fuels could witness a slowdown, company officials said.

The expansions IOC is pursuing at its refineries would help in raising India’s biggest state-run refiner’s Petrochemical Intensity Index to as high as 15% by 2030 from 6%, officials added.

“The next phase of expansion, after the current capacity expansion in the refineries gets completed, we will go for, in a very big way, for petrochemicals expansion,” Chairperson AS Sahney said April 30 while releasing the company’s annual financial results.

IOC recently signed an agreement with the state government in Odisha to set up a petrochemicals complex at Paradip, which would be its largest investment at a single location. This will help expand IOC’s existing 15 million mt/year refinery capacity at Paradip.

The complex will have a dual-feed cracker and associated downstream units for producing a range of products, including phenol, polypropylene, isopropyl alcohol, high-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and butadiene.

Key priority

Raising the petrochemicals intensity is the top priority for Indian refiners pursuing ambitious expansion strategies, government and refining officials said, as the sector is set to receive nearly $87 billion in investments over the next decade and account for more than 10% of the global petrochemicals sector growth.

A recent parliamentary committee report of the petroleum ministry recommended that India must expand its refining capabilities by diversifying the product mix and increasing focus on petrochemicals, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, to help refineries adapt to changing market demand and reduce dependence on traditional petroleum products.

Of the several projects India is pursuing, about 58% of the increase is expected to come from brownfield expansions over the next three years, while the remaining would come from greenfield projects, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights’ analysts.

Key projects include IOC’s expansion of its Panipat, Paradip, Gujarat and Barauni refineries to raise their capacities and integrate petrochemicals units.

“While Indian refiners are betting high on petrochemicals, the industry is today seeing an oversupplied market. Even Reliance Industries Limited, the largest producer of petrochemicals in India, in their Q4 report, has admitted that significant demand and supply imbalances in downstream chemicals markets have led to multiyear low margins,” said Swathi Seshadri, energy specialist, petrochemicals, South Asia, at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Lower margins, crude imports

IOC’s gross refining margin for the fiscal year ended March 31 fell 60.2% year on year to $4.80/b, company officials said, reflecting lower returns from cracks in Asia’s third-largest economy. It had posted a GRM of $12.05/b in the previous fiscal year.

Refinery throughput at nine stand-alone refineries fell 2.4% year on year to 71.56 million mt in 2024-25 (April-March). In 2024-25, IOC’s domestic sales rose 3.3% year on year to 95.38 million mt, while exports fell 6.1% on the year to 4.92 million mt in 2024-25.

The company’s nine stand-alone refineries have a capacity of 70.25 million mt/year, accounting for 27.36% of India’s total refinery capacity. The refiner’s product portfolio includes gasoline, diesel, naphtha, jet fuel, petrochemicals and lubricants.

In the fourth quarter, IOC posted a 1.5% rise in refinery throughput to 18.55 million mt while its domestic sales rose 3.6% year on year to 24.6 million mt and exports fell 13% on the year to 1.34 million mt.

Commenting on the crude oil import outlook following recent US sanctions and the emerging tariff scenario, Sahney said the company was treading cautiously before signing term deals for Russian crude.",,N,,2025-05-03 09:56:53.698945

This increase in aircraft parking capacity allows Sheltair to better accommodate transient and based aircraft, providing more safety, flexibility, and efficiency for general aviation customers.

“The completion of our FBO ramp expansion marks a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to growth, efficiency, and excellence in safety and service,” states Leigh Kendziorski, General Manager at Sheltair SAV. “This apron expansion not only enhances our operational capabilities but also strengthens our ability to better serve our partners, clients, and the aviation community at large. As the general aviation fleet continues to grow in size, this expansion allows us to comfortably accommodate larger aircraft and meet the evolving needs of the industry.”

In addition to the expanded aircraft parking, the project included the installation of a state-of-the-art drainage system beneath and around the new apron area and also prepared additional land for the future development of a 45,000 SF hangar with attached office space. This improvement enhances the durability of the tarmac and ensures long-term environmental and operational integrity — an essential investment for both the facility and the surrounding airport infrastructure.

Located just minutes from downtown Savannah, Sheltair SAV is ideally positioned to serve one of the fastest-growing markets in the Southeast. The apron expansion not only underscores Sheltair’s commitment to Savannah’s aviation community but also supports the broader economic development of the region by enabling greater access for corporate travel and investment.

By Based on products, the burn care market is categorized into five segments: advanced burn dressings, burn wound therapy devices, biologics, traditional burn care products, and other burn care products. Among these, the biologics segment is expected to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the rising demand for advanced and effective treatment options for deep and complex burns. Biologics provide targeted healing, minimize long-term complications, and promote tissue regeneration, making them particularly suitable for treating severe burns. The increasing acceptance of these products among healthcare professionals and ongoing innovations in regenerative medicine are contributing to the strong and sustained growth of the biologics segment.

By Based on burn degree, the burn care market is divided into first-degree burns (minor burns), second-degree burns (partial-thickness burns), and third-degree burns (full-thickness burns). Of these, the second-degree burns segment accounted for the largest market share of the burn care market in 2024. This is largely because partial-thickness burns occur more frequently. These burns tend to destroy the epidermis and dermis; as such, they require the application of advanced burn care products, which drives consistent demand in this segment.

By geography, the market for burn care is divided into five main regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America dominated the burn care market in 2024 with the largest market share. This is primarily because countries like the US and Canada have well-developed healthcare facilities, supporting widespread access to advanced burn care products and treatments. The region also experiences a high rate of burn injuries. The availability of key players and constant investment in research & development further consolidate North America's position in the burn care market.

Specifically, camelina and safflower will be processed into low-carbon intensity oils and used as feedstock to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a fully compatible drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the decarbonization of air travel. This marks a significant step forward in feedstock innovation to produce renewable fuels in Europe.

Intermediate novel crops expand the available pool of low-carbon intensity feedstocks to produce renewable fuel, with emission reductions of up to 90% compared to conventional diesel. Repsol will utilize advanced technology in its industrial assets to convert these oils into renewable fuel, creating a new pathway for the development of renewable fuels in Spain.

The companies recently closed their previously announced transaction and are committed to ongoing research and development to explore further low-carbon feedstock opportunities to boost the supply of renewable fuels, including sourcing novel seeds from Spanish farmers.

“Renewable fuels are a fundamental pillar for Repsol on our road to becoming zero net emissions by 2050, and intermediate crops must play a key role in guaranteeing the supply of the low-carbon feedstocks necessary to produce these fuels. Our strategic alliance with Bunge, a world leader in the vegetable oils production sector, strengthens our capacity to achieve our shared vision of decarbonizing industry and mobility in the most efficient way,” said Juan Abascal, Repsol’s executive managing director of Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy.

The construction, maintenance and use of buildings accounts for 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions and as such the construction industry shoulders a huge responsibility when it comes to global sustainability.

Fortunately, forward-thinking architects, engineers and developers are redefining what it means to build with the planet in mind.

The new generation of sustainable construction projects are not only marvels of design and engineering, but powerful statements of what’s possible when creativity meets responsibility.

In this list, we explore ten of the most groundbreaking, environmentally-conscious construction projects from around the world.

One Central Park is a residential and commercial complex that stands as a shining beacon of green design. The building features more than 1,000 square metres of vertical gardens, a feat made possible by botanist Patrick Blanc’s innovative hydroponic systems. It also includes a massive heliostat—an array of motorised mirrors that redirect sunlight into shaded parts of the structure. These systems reduce heat gain, provide natural cooling and foster biodiversity in the heart of Sydney. It’s a visually arresting example of how technology and botany can work together to redefine high-rise living.

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital breaks the mould of utilitarian, resource-intensive healthcare environments. With gardens integrated into nearly every floor, it brings therapeutic nature into patients’ daily lives, supporting faster recovery and better mental health. Passive design features, such as natural ventilation and strategically placed openings, reduce the hospital’s energy use significantly. Rainwater is collected and reused for irrigation, and the landscaping is designed to support local biodiversity. This patient-centred approach proves that healthcare and sustainability can thrive side by side, making the hospital not just a place of treatment, but a sanctuary of healing.

This visually stunning structure is a testament to the power of natural materials. The bamboo sports hall at Panyaden International School was designed to blend with its tropical surroundings while minimising environmental impact. Bamboo was chosen for its rapid renewability and impressive tensile strength, offering the flexibility and durability needed for the structure. The building’s form takes advantage of natural ventilation and daylight, eliminating the need for artificial lighting or air conditioning. The project celebrates local craftsmanship and age-old construction methods, proving that low-tech solutions can yield high-impact sustainability.

CopenHill is where high design meets high ambition. Located on the outer edge of Denmark’s capital, it is a waste-to-energy plant that doubles as a public recreational space, burning non-recyclable waste to generate clean electricity and district heating for 150,000 homes. Its façade features aluminium bricks and glass, optimised for energy efficiency. But what really sets it apart is the rooftop—a ski slope, hiking trail, climbing wall and viewing platform that transform the plant into a local attraction. It exemplifies a new kind of multifunctional urban infrastructure, one that serves communities both environmentally and socially, turning utility into an experience.

The Bullitt Center isn’t just green—it’s regenerative. Built to last 250 years, it is one of the few structures worldwide to meet the rigorous standards of the Living Building Challenge. It produces all of its own energy through solar panels, manages water with a rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling system, and uses composting toilets to minimise waste. Constructed without toxic materials, the building also features timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. More than just an office space, the Bullitt Center is a bold statement on what the future of building must look like in the era of climate action.

Dubbed the greenest office building in the world, The Edge has become a symbol of what sustainable corporate architecture can achieve. With a BREEAM score of 98.36%, it holds one of the highest sustainability ratings ever awarded. The building uses an innovative array of 28,000 sensors to manage lighting, temperature and occupancy. Rainwater harvesting, solar panels and an aquifer thermal energy storage system contribute to its net zero energy profile. Deloitte, the building’s primary occupant, worked closely with developers to ensure the workplace supported both environmental and employee wellbeing. The result is a smart, self-learning building that sets a new global standard.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ae2b408f8cefd92c74db642980016cf9:06735ee8cc5d3a08202cb4643af316f1/large-sustainability-top10-projects-cms-apr2025.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 19:56:24.131880

The company said the aircraft has the potential to cut fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile, while comfortably seating 250 passengers and flying up to 5,000 nautical miles.

JetZero's Path to Commercial Flight and Military Utility

JetZero's flagship aircraft, the Z4, is a high-capacity commercial plane designed to reshape both civilian and military aviation. With a demo flight scheduled for 2027, the Z4 targets long-haul commercial routes but also offers military potential, according to the company. The aircraft has multiple configurations including cargo transport and refueling tankers, two use cases that account for around 60% of the U.S. Air Force's total jet fuel consumption.

The Air Force's $235 million contract is meant to accelerate the development of JetZero's demonstrator aircraft and airframe technologies. JetZero is working closely with the Air Force, NASA, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which places it at the intersection of federal defense, aviation research, and commercial innovation.

In addition to military support, JetZero's commercial ambitions are gaining serious momentum, with United entering into a conditional agreement to order up to 100 aircraft, along with an option for 100 more.

Rethinking the Passenger Experience

Besides the focus on fuel savings, the aircraft's blended wing structure introduces a completely reimagined cabin layout. The company said that plans for the interior include larger, flexible seating, wider aisles, handicap-accessible lavatories, and dedicated overhead bins for each seat. The design also streamlines boarding, thanks to a wide main entrance and multiple aisles, reducing crowding and speeding up passenger flow.

The aircraft will run on conventional jet engines but is also compatible with sustainable aviation fuel blends. This opens the door to dramatic cuts in carbon emissions without requiring immediate overhauls of fueling infrastructure.

It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down.

— Joe Jobe, CEO, Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition

JEFFERSON CITY, MO, UNITED STATES, May 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition, representing 70 organizational members throughout the biodiesel value chain, applauds the reintroduction of a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 1 to reinstate the $1-per-gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC)—a much-needed boost for the biodiesel industry.

HR 3137, introduced by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, calls for retroactive reinstatement of the Section 40A biodiesel BTC, which expired Dec. 31, 2024. The bill would reinstate the BTC as of Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2026. While the Section 45Z production tax credit in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was viewed as a replacement for the BTC, the U.S. biodiesel industry has been in real trouble since last year, when the BTC sunset loomed and no implementing regulations on the 45Z credit were even proposed let alone finalized in the two-plus years since the IRA became law. This delay along with disadvantages the industry faces as a result of implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard program have had significant adverse impacts on biodiesel producers, many of which are smaller facilities located in rural areas. Numerous plants have shut down, their workers laid off and assets lost.

“The expiration of the biodiesel blenders tax credit (40A) along with the lack of implementing regulations on Section 45Z have effectively shut the biodiesel industry down for all of 2025, with no end in sight,” said SABR Coalition CEO Joe Jobe. “This bill to extend 40A would turn the markets back on immediately because the implementing regulations for 40A are already in place and the markets understand them.”

The Section 45Z credit as it currently stands is not the answer. The incentive favors sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel over biodiesel. Many biodiesel producers will be fortunate to get a third of the value from the Section 45Z credit as they got from the BTC or be subject to significant red tape to potentially get a higher value. Meanwhile, some SAF producers may get up to $1.75 a gallon from the new incentive. In addition, much like European policies and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the 45Z credit discriminates against ag-based feedstocks like soybeans grown by American farmers. This improper discrimination is based on the failed modeling theory of indirect land-use change, but 20 years of real-world data shows those predictions never came true.

The two-year BTC extension would provide time for Congress to fix fundamental flaws in the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z and for the Trump administration to propose and finalize implementing regulations for the 45Z credit, which the previous administration had two and a-half years to do but didn’t. The SABR Coalition and its members believe retroactive reinstatement of the $1-per-gallon BTC, which has an anti-double-dipping provision allowing producers to claim either a credit under Section 40A or 45Z but not both, is critically necessary to not only revive the battered U.S. biodiesel industry, but to save it from extinction.

“The biodiesel industry is in a world of hurt,” Jobe said. “It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down. Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners. And those fuel distributors can’t sell their fuel to truck-stop operators, and glycerin refiners can’t sell their refined material to numerous, wide-ranging industries that rely on it for their products, including sewage treatment plants that use glycerin and enzymes in their water treatment processes. So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”

The SABR Coalition and its members are urging Congress to include the BTC extension marker bill in the budget-reconciliation process—the “big, beautiful bill.” SABR sent a letter to the House and Senate majority and minority leaders, in addition to the chairs of the House ways and means committee and the Senate finance committee, along with the White House, explaining how imperative it is to reinstate the BTC to restore commerce up and down the biodiesel value chain—from farmers to crushers, biodiesel producers, glycerin refiners, fuel distributors, truck-stop operators and other important sectors of the American economy.

Groups endorsing the 40A extension bill include:

– American Trucking Associations (ATA).

– Clean Freight Coalition.

– Energy Marketers of America (EMA).

– Illinois Soybean Growers.

– National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

– National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI).

– National Tank Truck Carriers.

– NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops.

– Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).

– SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers.

– Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition.

– Truckload Carriers Association (TCA).

“Decades of public and private investment—including from the soybean checkoff—to build out the domestic biodiesel industry is at risk,” said Ron Kindred, the chairman of Illinois Soybean Growers and a farmer from Atlanta, Illinois. “This legislation removes the uncertainty that is impacting everyone in the biodiesel value chain starting with soybean farmers, all the way down to distributors, retailers and consumers.”

Cosponsors of the bill include Reps. Andrew Garbarino, R-New York; Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota; Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Darin LaHood, R-Illinois; and Claudia Tenney, R-New York.

Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants.
But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty.
He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies.
The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said.","Robert Bonnie, the Agriculture undersecretary for farm production and conservation in the Biden administration, said Monday that he is “very concerned that USDA is being weakened” by the Trump administration’s staffing and budget cuts.

In his first public remarks on the Trump administration’s policies, Bonnie told the North American Agricultural Journalists at their spring Washington meeting that he is particularly worried about the loss of key personnel. Bonnie said he is prohibited from having direct contact with USDA officials for two years due to the ethics agreement he signed when he took his presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed post, but that he has learned that Tim Griffiths, the national coordinator of the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s sage grouse initiative, left USDA on Friday.

An email to Griffiths’ NRCS address in Montana on Monday resulted in the following automated reply: “I am sorry, but I am no longer available.” The response directed senders to another USDA official, and ended with “Your friend in conservation. Tim.”

Bonnie noted that the sage grouse initiative Griffiths led covers more than 9 million acres and “involves a couple thousand ranches in a voluntary, all incentive-based program.”Bonnie said it was terrible for USDA to lose “that type of leadership, creativity. Tim is one of many people lost.

“According to a biography on the Society for Range Management website, Griffiths has “spent his entire career working to achieve fish and wildlife conservation through sustainable agriculture and to reduce regulatory burdens associated with the Endangered Species Act. In 2011, Tim received the Secretary of Agriculture Honor Award for his work on the agency’s major sage grouse conservation initiative.” Bonnie also said that 75% of the federal government’s wildfire response “sits at USDA,” and that he is worried as the summer fire season approaches, the Forest Service is “going to lose senior people, the number of teams will be reduced.” Bonnie also pointed out that the Biden administration established relationships with Ducks Unlimited and other conservation groups, and that he worried that USDA will lose those relationships. Bonnie, who developed the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities during the Biden administration but also worked at USDA during the Obama administration, noted that during the Obama administration farmers “ran the other way from climate policy,” but during the Biden years the government and the farmers worked together on agriculture and forestry. Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants. The Trump administration has changed the Partnerships initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP) initiative, and Bonnie has said he hopes that the administration will follow through on the original goals.

But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty. Bonnie said he also worried about the impact of cutting back on USDA programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, and the loss of U.S. international leadership. He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies. The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said. On biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, other departments are also involved, he said.The final guidance for the 45Z tax credit for biofuels was not completed because officials in an interagency process wanted to further examine a carbon calculator, but if the Treasury Department would put in place the peer review process established by the Biden administration, “farmers would be off the races on sustainable aviation fuel,” Bonnie said. But Bonnie said he is worried about the loss of leadership in all the agencies that play a role in biofuels. If the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department pull back, “farmers are going to pay the price,” he said.

This not only lowers carbon emissions but also creates more meaningful experiences.

Tip: Choose quality over quantity. Spend time walking, biking, or using local transport to reduce your footprint.

4. Supporting Local Communities

Ethical travel involves giving back to the places you visit. In 2025, tourists look for authentic experiences like community-led tours, homestays, or local workshops. They shop at local markets, eat at family-run restaurants, and avoid international chains.

Tip: Spend your money where it matters most — in the hands of locals who protect their culture and environment.

5. Digital Tools for Responsible Travel

Technology is making it easier to travel sustainably. Apps now help find eco-friendly accommodations, carbon-neutral flights, and low-waste restaurants. AI-powered travel planners also suggest green activities and local experiences.

Tip: Use tools like HappyCow, EcoHotels, or Google’s eco-certified filters to make smarter travel decisions.

Practical Tips to Travel Sustainably

Pack light: Lighter bags mean less fuel used in transport.

Bring reusable items: Carry a water bottle, shopping bag, and utensils.

Avoid single-use plastics: Say no to plastic straws, cups, and bags.

Respect local culture: Dress modestly, learn basic phrases, and follow local customs.

Leave no trace: Take your trash with you and avoid disturbing wildlife.

Offset your carbon: Invest in tree planting or clean energy projects.

The awards, now in their second year, are presented by TheBusinessDesk.com in partnership with Clarion, Deloitte, and the Swinton Estate. They celebrate companies that are making lasting, positive contributions to society and the environment.

This accolade is a testament to Jet2’s dedication to creating a more sustainable future, demonstrating its leadership in the aviation industry. The company’s efforts were acknowledged for implementing clear sustainability strategies, achieving significant milestones, and continually working towards a greener tomorrow.

A Comprehensive Sustainability Strategy

Jet2’s updated Sustainability Strategy is built around three key pillars: In the Air, On the Ground, and In Resort. The strategy’s scope extends to tackling Scope 3 emissions across its supply chain, reflecting the company’s commitment to reducing its overall environmental impact.

One of the standout aspects of the strategy is Jet2’s new climate transition plan, which aims for tangible, immediate actions to reduce the airline’s carbon footprint. The company has set a target to reduce carbon emissions per revenue passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. This ambitious goal means reducing emissions from 67gCO2/RPK in 2019 to 43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035.

Key Sustainability Achievements

Jet2 has made notable investments to decarbonize its fleet, with a firm commitment to purchasing 146 Airbus A321 neo aircraft. These new aircraft will result in up to 20% reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger and are 50% quieter than their predecessors, helping Jet2 achieve its carbon reduction goals while providing a more comfortable experience for passengers.

The company has also prioritized eliminating single-use plastics, replacing them with biodegradable and recyclable alternatives. This initiative alone has successfully removed 22 million single-use plastic items from Jet2’s supply chain each year.

To further enhance fuel efficiency, Jet2 has incorporated cutting-edge technologies like the split-scimitar winglets on 60 of its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. These modifications have resulted in reduced fuel consumption through improved aerodynamic performance.

A Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

In its efforts to reduce its environmental impact, Jet2 has introduced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its operations. The company began using SAF at key airports such as London Stansted, Bristol, and Malaga, well ahead of the mandatory SAF requirements set to take effect in the UK and EU in January 2025. This proactive approach highlights Jet2’s leadership in the industry and its commitment to adopting greener fuel alternatives.

Ground Operations and Electric Equipment

Jet2 has also focused on electrifying its ground operations, with over 50% of its ground service equipment now fully electric. This effort significantly reduces carbon emissions from the company’s non-flying operations and contributes to the overall sustainability of its business.

Jet2holidays’ Sustainable Hotels Collection

In addition to its work on the airline front, Jet2holidays has expanded its Certified Sustainable Hotels collection. This growing collection, now with over 1,200 hotels, provides customers the option to choose accommodation that meets rigorous sustainability certifications, furthering Jet2’s commitment to responsible travel.

Recognized as an Industry Leader

In recognition of its efforts, Jet2 has earned a platinum rating for airline sustainability in the CAPA 2023 sustainability benchmark report, placing it among the top ten airlines globally for its sustainability performance. The airline ranks 4th out of 100 airlines in carbon emissions per revenue passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK), cementing its status as a leader in environmental responsibility.

A Social Value Framework for Communities

Jet2’s Sustainability Strategy goes beyond environmental considerations. The company has introduced a social value framework that focuses on supporting its employees and the communities where it operates. This framework addresses eight key areas: training and development, well-being, inclusion and access, health and safety (within the company), and jobs and skills, communities, partnerships and ethics, risk and safety (outside the company).

This holistic approach to sustainability not only benefits the environment but also fosters positive change in the communities Jet2 serves, ensuring that its efforts extend beyond business operations.

Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays said: “I am very proud of what we have achieved since launching our first sustainability strategy in 2021 and this award reflects the investment and hard work that has gone into that. We are basing our strategy on technologies and tangible actions that we know are available to us now, rather than what may or may not be available in the future, however we continually monitor to see where we can embrace new technologies. Our tangible steps include investing in new and more fuel-efficient aircraft, using SAF, launching a Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, removing millions of single use plastics from onboard our aircraft, and utilising technologies such as split-scimitar winglets. Our strategy clearly sets out our vision to accelerate our sustainability journey whilst supporting our colleagues and the communities where we operate, and we will continue to make this a critical area of focus.”

Jet2’s recognition at the Yorkshire Sustainability Excellence Awards is a well-deserved acknowledgment of its ongoing commitment to sustainability. From investing in new aircraft to reducing single-use plastics and promoting sustainable travel options, Jet2 is paving the way for a greener and more responsible aviation industry. As the company continues to build on its impressive sustainability achievements, it remains at the forefront of driving positive change within the aviation sector and beyond.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jet2_Sustainability_award-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 19:56:32.967735

As fans cheer their goals and victories, the club is also scoring major points in its mission to cut carbon emissions and adopt environmentally friendly practices. Through ‘The Red Way‘ strategy, Liverpool aims to reduce its environmental footprint and set new standards for sustainability in the world of elite football.

The Red Way: Liverpool’s Blueprint for Sustainability

Liverpool FC’s journey to sustainability officially began in 2021 with the launch of The Red Way. It is the club’s award-winning strategy to minimize its environmental impact.

The plan focuses on three pillars: people, planet, and communities. It aligns with 16 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. On the environmental front, Liverpool has set clear targets:

Halve operational carbon emissions by 2030

Achieve net zero by 2040

Achieve carbon neutrality in merchandising by 2030

In its 2023–24 Red Way report, the club outlined key achievements:

96% of all energy at club sites came from renewable or low-carbon sources

Football operations emissions were 100% offset

Overall carbon emissions fell 12.5% compared to 2022–23

A 15% reduction in emissions from its 2019–20 baseline

In transportation, LFC invested in Sustainable Aviation Fuel to eliminate all emissions from domestic flights. Its team buses are powered by Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, cutting emissions by up to 90% compared to diesel.

The club worked on biodiversity and planted over 1,000 trees and hedges. They also added honeybee habitats with 60,000 bees. Plus, they grew half a tonne of food for their kitchens.

The legendary Anfield pitch is now fully recyclable. Old turf is repurposed into benches and other materials for community projects like the orchard at the AXA Training Centre.

The club’s operations have been recognized through ISO certifications:

ISO20121 (sustainability management)

ISO45001 (health and safety)

ISO50001 (energy management)

Liverpool has committed to global efforts by signing the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and the UN’s Race to Zero. They pledge to cut emissions in half by 2030 and aim for net zero “as soon as possible.”

A Game-Changing Collaboration: Direct Air Capture with 1PointFive

In 2025, Liverpool strengthened its sustainability efforts. It partnered with 1PointFive, a subsidiary of Occidental that focuses on Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology.

Under this collaboration, LFC calculates the carbon footprint of its merchandise — from production to delivery — and purchases carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits to offset those emissions.

DAC is a cutting-edge solution that removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. Liverpool’s purchased credits are tied to STRATOS. This facility will be the largest DAC in the world that can capture 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ each year.

According to LFC Chief Commercial Officer Ben Latty:

“Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do at the club. Through The Red Way, we are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint and driving positive change for our people, planet, and communities.”

This innovative step positions Liverpool as one of the first clubs to embed carbon removal directly into fan merchandise. Beyond offsetting, it also encourages supporters to make carbon-conscious choices, deepening fan engagement on climate action.

How Liverpool Compares: Sustainability Efforts of Rival Clubs

Liverpool FC is seen as one of the leaders in football when it comes to protecting the environment. But Liverpool is not alone. Two of its biggest Premier League rivals, Manchester City and Arsenal, are also working hard to make their clubs more environmentally friendly.

Manchester City’s Sustainability Initiatives

Manchester City has added many green actions to its Etihad Campus. Like Liverpool, it signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and promised to reach net-zero emissions by 2030.

The club uses 100% renewable electricity in its stadium and buildings. It has installed over 10,000 solar panels at the City Football Academy and the Joie Stadium. Man City is also strong in waste management. It sends zero waste to landfills and recycles over 90% of waste on matchdays.

To cut travel emissions, the club encourages fans to take public transport or bike to games. The club’s buildings use energy-saving lights and water-saving systems. In 2023, Manchester City won the Sustainability Team of the Year award at the Football Business Awards for all these efforts.

Arsenal FC’s Green Efforts

Arsenal FC is another club known for its green leadership. It was the first Premier League club to put in a large battery storage system at its Emirates Stadium. This system stores extra renewable energy for later use.

The club aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. It has an interim goal of reducing Scope 1 and 3 emissions by 42% and Scope 3 emissions intensity by 52% by 2030, versus 2021 levels.

Like Manchester City, Arsenal uses 100% renewable electricity to power its Emirates Stadium and low-carbon gas to lower emissions. It has installed a 3MW battery storage system.

The club has cut down on single-use plastics in food stands, drink areas, and its shops. It also runs projects like tree planting and wildlife protection to help nature near the club.

Between 2019 and 2023, Arsenal cut its operational emissions by 20%. It signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework too. Through its “Arsenal for Change” campaign, the club encourages fans to take part in environmental activities.

All three clubs show a strong commitment to protecting the environment. Liverpool stands out because it uses carbon removal technology in its merchandise and leads in biodiversity work. Manchester City is strongest in waste management, while Arsenal leads in energy storage and community nature projects.

Overall, here is how the three Premier League clubs compare in terms of the following environmental metrics.

A Growing Collective Responsibility in Football

Liverpool, Manchester City, and Arsenal’s initiatives reflect a larger shift: elite football clubs are starting to recognize their role in fighting climate change.

Beyond clubs, fans, governing bodies, and sponsors are pushing for greener practices. The Premier League launched a Sustainability Strategy in 2023 and recently published an update. This plan urges all 20 clubs to cut emissions, reduce waste, and engage with communities.

The Sports Positive League Table ranks Premier League clubs based on sustainability. It helps set standards and boosts competition in ESG practices. Liverpool has consistently ranked in the top three, alongside Arsenal and Manchester City.

Beyond the Premier League, the push for greater environmental responsibility in football is becoming a global movement. Clubs worldwide are stepping up. They aim to cut emissions, reduce waste, and support sustainable practices on and off the field.

In Germany, VfL Wolfsburg stands out as a leader in sustainable football. The club, owned by Volkswagen, has been carbon neutral since 2012. This makes it one of the first in European sports to adopt large-scale environmental initiatives.

Wolfsburg uses 100% renewable energy, and they harvest rainwater to irrigate the pitch. The club also offers eco-friendly transport for fans and staff.

In the Netherlands, Ajax Amsterdam has embraced renewable energy and circular economy principles. The Johan Cruijff Arena is Ajax’s home stadium. It uses solar panels, wind energy, and a 3-megawatt battery storage system. This system is one of the largest in Europe and runs on recycled Nissan Leaf car batteries.

The arena’s green design includes LED lights, water-saving tech, and waste separation systems. These features help cut down the environmental impact of major sports events.

Moving to North America, Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer (MLS) has made strong commitments to sustainability. The club offsets travel emissions for the team. It also promotes zero-waste matchdays at Lumen Field. Plus, it partners with local groups for urban reforestation and community solar projects.

Sounders FC helped start MLS WORKS Greener Goals. This league-wide initiative focuses on making American soccer more environmentally friendly.

Even smaller clubs are stepping up. In England’s League Two, Forest Green Rovers has been widely praised as “the greenest football club in the world”. The club has set a global standard for sustainable sports infrastructure. Their fully vegan stadium menu, organic pitch, and solar-powered stadium lead the way.

These examples show that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Arsenal are part of a much broader shift. More clubs are using new solutions and sharing best practices. This helps football make a bigger impact on climate action.

A New Competition Off the Field

As Liverpool FC chases silverware on the pitch, it is also chasing leadership in sustainability off it. With bold targets, innovative partnerships, and award-winning initiatives under The Red Way, the club is setting standards that go beyond football. And as its Premier League rivals also raise their ESG ambitions, the competition for sustainability leadership is only set to grow.

Winning matches is important. But setting a strong example in the fight against climate change? That could be one of the most meaningful goals of all.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2279399373.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 17:56:25.247038

The market for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40-50%.
Addressing the cost challenges of Sustainable Aviation Fuel adoption One of the most significant hurdles to adopting sustainable aviation fuels is its cost.
Biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel plants share many characteristics with small chemical plants.
As a result, microgrid optimization emerges as a crucial consideration for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producers.","Biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represent critical pathways for decarbonizing the global energy mix. The transportation sector is responsible for nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While the road transportation segment is making strides toward electrification with electric vehicles (EVs), the aviation and maritime sectors face significant limitations in this regard, relying primarily on conventional fuels, except for smaller, lightweight aircraft and vessels.

With air travel expected to double by 2050, GHG emissions are projected to rise correspondingly. This increase will make it more difficult to meet net-zero targets by mid-century. The market for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40-50%. This sector is driven notably by government mandates, differentiating it from other renewable energy segments.

Countries like the U.S., Brazil, and India are promoting alcohol-based SAF derived from feedstocks such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, beets, and various oilseed crops to bolster their agricultural economies.

Many SAF projects are nearing their Final Investment Decision (FID), although they face some hurdles related to costs and technical challenges. Traditional oil and gas companies are expected to play a critical role in progressing SAF due to their established cash flow, existing infrastructure, and supply chain advantages. On the other hand, smaller independent producers actively seek investments to fund their initiatives.

Addressing the cost challenges of Sustainable Aviation Fuel adoption

One of the most significant hurdles to adopting sustainable aviation fuels is its cost. Currently, biofuel-based SAF is priced at two to three times the cost of traditional jet fuel. The cost of eSAF can be six to eight times higher. The aviation industry operates in a highly competitive environment characterized by slim profit margins and substantial liability tied to safety regulations, posing a considerable challenge. Spending two to eight times more on fuel is unsustainable for many airlines unless these expenses constitute only a small fraction of their overall fuel costs.

The initial European mandate requiring a 2% SAF blend may appear minimal, but the gradual increase will be significant in the near future. Consequently, one of the options for airlines is to pass this added cost on to consumers. For instance, if the average ticket price is $500, a 2% SAF blend could result in a $10 increase in ticket prices. This raises the critical question: would customers be willing to pay an additional $10 for a flight that incorporates 2% SAF?

A shared hope among the aviation industry and SAF producers is that SAF production costs will decrease over time achieving cost parity with fossil fuel generation in certain countries.

The SAF movement has commenced, promising to lower emissions by 80-90% compared to traditional jet fuel. However, the pressing challenge now is to accelerate SAF projects to meet net-zero emissions targets by 2050. To address this, both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), alongside technical challenges, must be overcome.

Several digitalization and electrification strategies can potentially expedite the progress of SAF projects, aiming to lower overall costs and enhance efficiency. These initiatives are critical to unlocking the full potential of SAF and achieving sustainability goals in the aviation sector.

Unified power & process management

Historically, power management and process automation have operated as distinct entities, a division that has hindered facilities from maximizing efficiency. However, the gradual electrification and integration of renewable energy sources into the power mix are driving a transformative shift toward the simultaneous management of both energy carriers—molecules and electrons. In the context of the eSAF pathway, green hydrogen is produced through energy-intensive electrolyzers, which account for approximately 60-70% of operational costs.

This convergence of decarbonization, digitalization, and the need to lower capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) is prompting the industry to reassess traditional methodologies in process automation and power management.

Energy companies are increasingly recognizing digitalization as a vital enabler of their business objectives, eager to leverage its potential, even though the route to implementation can be complex. For many organizations, the logical initial step is to integrate power and process management systems. The subsequent phase involves applying this unified approach across the entire lifecycle of the plant to ensure continuous value optimization.

By merging power management with process automation during the design phase, facilities can achieve a digital interconnection of power and processes that facilitates critical data capture. Using this data in a digital twin, which simulates the plant’s operational lifecycle. Incorporating real-time performance data allows the integrated power and process digital twin to deliver significant advantages, including:

Up to 20% savings in overall CapEx while keeping projects on schedule

A 10% reduction in process energy costs

Up to a 35% decrease in direct CO₂ emissions

A 15% reduction in downtime

A 3% overall improvement in profitability

Electrification

Green electricity offers the fastest pathway to decarbonization, facilitating operational improvements in process duration and controls. Biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel plants share many characteristics with small chemical plants. They feature reactors, tanks, towers, compressors, pumps, boilers, and heaters. In a typical chemical plant, the primary power source remains predominantly fossil-based, accounting for 80-90% of energy use. The remainder is sourced from grid electricity (10-20%). In the case of eSAF, the integration of electrolyzers elevates electrification from 10-20% to a substantial 60-70%.

Significant opportunities exist to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through electrification, such as electrifying boilers, heaters, compressors, and pumps. By moving towards greater electrification within these facilities, companies can streamline operations and contribute to meaningful emissions reductions.

Microgrid optimization enhanced by AI

The integration of renewable energy sources and battery storage into the electrical grid, alongside traditional fossil fuel power, presents both challenges and opportunities for optimizing energy costs and advancing decarbonization efforts.

This shift allows prosumers to sell excess electricity back to the grid, enabling strategies such as arbitrage. Where they utilize low-cost energy for charging batteries and reselling during periods of high demand. As a result, microgrid optimization emerges as a crucial consideration for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producers. Aditionally, Artificial Intelligence analyzes and optimizes energy sources, safety, and profitability.

Modularization and standardization

Currently, aside from the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, SAF production pathways remain primarily in pilot or small-scale commercial phases. Developers and process original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are adopting a modular design approach based on three key factors:

Individual process units that easily transport and deploy near feedstock sources

Pilot plants scaled up economically by adding additional modules

Standardization of processes to reduce engineering and construction costs.

Carbon tracking

SAF off-takers will demand proof and certification of the carbon intensity associated with the SAF fuels they procure. In response, SAF producers must effectively track carbon intensity throughout the value chain, particularly during the production process. A comprehensive carbon index will be necessary to meet regulatory mandates and support claims for carbon credits. Tracking carbon intensity will involve monitoring the following:

the overall SAF produced

the carbon intensity of feedstocks

the amount of energy consumed during production and transportation

Biofuels and SAF are essential components of the energy transition. Their successful integration into the aviation sector requires concerted efforts to address cost barriers, leverage technological advancements, and ensure supportive policies are in place. Without these measures, the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation remains a formidable task. The biofuels and SAF segments have already started and are accelerating ahead; digitalization and electrification is boosting this transition.",https://blog.se.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1167642565-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 01:56:33.045594

As of Apr. 28, Grangemouth refinery was no longer processing crude oil, PRL confirmed to OGJ in an e-mailed statement.

“[PRL] has invested £50 million (US$66.4 million) in creating a modern import and distribution terminal capable of receiving finished fuels by sea for onward distribution to customers around the country,” said Iain Hardie, Petroineos’ regional head of legal and external affairs.

“From 29 April, we will be importing all the products necessary to meet Scotland’s demand for transport fuels,” Hardie added.

Confirmation of the closure follows PRL’s late-2020 announcement of its intention to begin rationalizing capacity before ultimately ending operations in second-quarter 2025 amid a collision of global market pressures and the global energy transition, the combination of which left the 1924-built refinery unable to economically compete with more modern and efficient sites in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Africa, as well as limited demand for key fossil-based fuels produced at the site (OGJ Online, Nov. 19, 2020).

PRL extended its appreciation to Grangemouth’s workforce, about 400 of which were set to lose employment with the refinery’s shutdown.

“Our colleagues have shown incredible commitment, dignity, and resilience during months of uncertainty regarding the future of this [refinery], through the consultation period, phased shutdown, and the start of refinery decommissioning. It has been a challenging period, but their professionalism has ensured security of fuel supply to our customers across Scotland and beyond,"" Hardie said.

PRL is a joint venture of INEOS AG’s Ineos Investments (Jersey) Ltd. (50.1%) and China National Petroleum Corp.’s PetroChina Co. Ltd. (PetroChina) subsidiary PetroChina International (London) Co. Ltd. (49.9%).

Grangemouth’s future

The refinery’s shuttering comes just more than a month after the UK and Scottish governments released results of a £1.5-million ($2-million) feasibility study executed by Ernst & Young Global Ltd. that outlines nine low-carbon and renewable energy business models most likely to attract private investment for securing the industrial site’s future (OGJ Online, Mar. 21, 2025).

Known as Project Willow, the plan—backed by £25 million from the Scottish government and £200 million from the UK government—includes investments such as:

Waste: Hydrothermal upgrading (breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics); chemical plastics recycling, acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) biorefining (breaking down waste material).

Biofeedstock: Breaking down Scottish timber into bioethanol; anaerobic digestion of bioresources and digestate pyrolysis; hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), entailing conversion of Scottish cover crops into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using low-carbon hydrogen.

Offshore wind conduit: Replacing natural gas with hydrogen; using low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol for subsequent conversion to SAF; producing low-carbon ammonia from hydrogen for shipping and chemicals.

Both the UK and Scottish governments said they work with Petroineos to market the proposals set out in Project Willow and seek investor interest to support businesses and stakeholders in a goal to bring forward investible propositions for the site within the next 12 months.

Unforgiving workforce?

In the wake of the refinery’s closure, Unite the Union (Unite)—the country’s largest trade union—issued an Apr. 29 statement in which it warned political leaders of electoral consequences for failing the refinery’s workforce and the broader Grangemouth community.

“The UK and Scottish governments have utterly failed to protect refinery jobs at Grangemouth, and thousands face losing their jobs as oil refining in Scotland ends,” said Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary.

“There are projects like SAF production which can be accelerated to protect jobs, and…pave the way for Grangemouth to become a world leader in green aviation,” Graham said.

Unite cited an impact assessment by PwC that concluded the Grangemouth refinery makes an economic contribution of £403.6 million/year and that “almost 3,000 workers [relied] on the refinery’s operations.”

“[B]oth [the UK and Scottish] governments have effectively allowed China to shutdown Scotland’s capacity to refine fuel, as it hopes to use Grangemouth as an import hub,” Graham contended.

“Workers will not forget or forgive,” she said.

Graham pointed out that while Project Willow has identified nine possible projects for the site, “under [PRL’s] proposals, most of these [projects] would not start for several years after the site had closed and jobs had been lost.”

Unite believes many of the potential projects “could be fast tracked and implemented now,” including “a rapid move to convert the existing refinery to [SAF] production…starting with co-processing [of renewable feedstock with conventional crude].”

“Instead, not one job will be saved at the refinery, not one job will be created for years by Project Willow, and not one penny of the £200-million National Wealth Fund can be unlocked without private investment,” said Derek Thomson, leader of Unite Scotland.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/05/6815029eacfa13120c4aaa06-250502petroineos_refining_ltd.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-02 19:56:37.683623

But referring to the government’s SAF Mandate, which requires 2% of fuel on flights departing the UK this year to be SAF, she said: “Mandates alone don’t create supply.”

Hudson told Abta’s Aviation Forum: “We’re further ahead as a group than we thought we would be – 2.6% of our fuel is SAF. [But] we’re trying to replace fossil fuels in a short space of time. We need to see next‑generation SAF fuels scaling. That requires technologies to come to market quickly.”

She argued the government’s proposed Revenue Certainty Mechanism to encourage SAF production would see the costs “come back to airlines and go on to consumers”.

Sustainable Aviation’s Duncan McCourt said: “The Revenue Certainty Mechanism can’t come quickly enough.” But he noted: “SAF will be a global commodity and the UK will [have to] import large quantities.”

The aviation industry has a “credible” plan to reach net zero by 2050, Sustainable Aviation chief executive Duncan McCourt told delegates at the Abta forum.

But he acknowledged: “It’s not without significant challenges, not without significant uncertainty and no doubt there will be significant periods of discomfort.”

McCourt warned: “The political pressure is likely to increase. Aviation will be the biggest emitter [of carbon] by 2040, so it’s incumbent on aviation to do all it can to address this.”

He insisted: “The tools now exist to take carbon out of flying. All the elements of the technology already exist. We know the science of how to do it, but we haven’t got the scale.”

McCourt said aviation leaders fear that if the industry does not move fast enough, it faces “the risk of stranded assets and regulations restricting demand growth”.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/074/Shutterstock-airline-fuel_Main.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 12:56:34.141048

2025 Carbon Intensity Reduction Target TotalEnergies has raised its 2025 carbon intensity reduction target from 15% to 17%, aiming for a 25% emission cut by 2030.","In Q1 2025, TotalEnergies earned $4.2 billion in adjusted net income and $7.0 billion in cash flow from operations. Revenue dropped to $47.89 billion from $51.88 billion a year earlier. However, the company held firm because of strong oil and gas output and steady LNG profits, and more interestingly, its carbon credits investment.

The report revealed that production rose 4% year-over-year, averaging 2.55–2.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. New output from Brazil, the U.S., Malaysia, Argentina, and Denmark helped drive this growth. Gas prices stayed high, partly balancing weaker oil prices.

Power and LNG Boost TotalEnergies Amid Refining Woes

The LNG business posted $1.3 billion in adjusted net operating income. While LNG trading met expectations, gas trading struggled due to Europe’s volatile markets and geopolitical tensions.

Power operations also grew. The segment generated over $500 million in income and $600 million in cash flow. Key deals, like acquiring Germany’s VSB and investing in battery storage, supported this growth.

Still, downstream operations faced headwinds. Weak refining margins and issues at French and U.S. facilities cut into profits. Petrochemical and biofuel margins in Europe also declined, adding pressure.

Carbon Credit Spending Hits Record High

TotalEnergies spent $2 million on carbon credits in Q1 2025. That’s double what it spent in Q1 2024. This massive spending aims to cut emissions and reach its net-zero target by 2050.

Robust Backing for Nature-Based Projects

A significant segment of its investment supports nature-based solutions like forest protection, regenerative farming, and wetland conservation. By the end of last year, TotalEnergies had collected 13.7 million verified carbon credits. Each year, the company plans to invest $100 million in carbon projects.

Between 2025 and 2030, TotalEnergies will build a stock of 50 million carbon credits.

These projects can potentially deliver at least 5 million metric tons of CO₂e credits annually by 2030.

From 2030, the company will start using high-quality carbon credits to offset its remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The aim is to build a strong portfolio of trusted projects that support global rules and ensure the credits are real and long-lasting. Additionally, the company expects these projects to bring long-term environmental and social benefits.

It expects to reach 37 million verified credits by 2030 and 53 million by 2050. These projects could also generate $770 million for local communities.

$100 M Deal with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands

TotalEnergies signed a $100 million deal with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands last year. The project protects 300,000 hectares of forests across 10 U.S. states—Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

This partnership supports sustainable forest management and boosts the forests’ ability to absorb carbon. It also helps local communities by improving land use and preventing environmental damage. The carbon credits generated help offset the company’s remaining emissions.

What Makes Total Energies the Top Net-Zero Player

Last year, the LNG giant launched the “Our 5 Levers for Sustainable Change” initiative. The goal was to engage all employees in reducing emissions by boosting energy efficiency and adopting low-carbon technologies across its operations.

GHG Emissions Fell in 2024

The company cut emissions from operated sites by more than 36% in 2024 compared to 2015. Notably, over 200 emission-reduction projects helped slash 1.3 million tons of CO₂e.

However, recently the company raised its 2025 emissions goal to 37 Mt CO₂e per year. It aims to cut net Scope 1+2 emissions by 40% by 2030 (vs. 2015 levels). This also includes using 5 million carbon credits from nature-based projects, as explained before. Subsequently, these offsets will be used only for residual emissions from 2030 and consumed gradually at about 10% per year.

By end-2024, TotalEnergies had invested around $750 million in emissions reduction. These investments save 1.5 Mt CO₂e each year and cut energy costs by over $100 million annually.

However, emissions from flexible power generation rose slightly. This happened due to the addition of combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in the U.S. and U.K., which support TotalEnergies’ low-carbon electricity expansion.

Still, overall emissions dropped 25% from 2015 levels.

The carbon intensity of upstream oil and gas assets also fell from 21 kg CO₂e/boe in 2015 to 17 kg CO₂e/boe in 2024.

All these figures make TotalEnergies one of the top industry performers.

Scope 3 and Scope 4 Emissions

In 2024, TotalEnergies helped reduce global emissions by 65 million tonnes of CO₂e through LNG sales, as many customers replaced coal with gas for power generation. Although gas increases Scope 3 emissions, it enables cleaner energy and avoids more emissions overall. These are classified as Scope 4 emissions.

The company also avoided 18 million tonnes of CO₂e in 2024 and is aiming for 150 million tonnes of emissions by 2030. This makes 90 Mt from LNG and 60 Mt from renewables while keeping Scope 3 emissions below 400 Mt.

Methane Emissions Drop Drastically

Methane emissions dropped from 64 kt in 2020 to 29 kt in 2024—a 55% cut. TotalEnergies beat its 2025 target early and now aims for a 60% cut by 2025, and an 80% cut by 2030 compared to 2020.

Digital Tools Boost Efficiency

The company is using digital tools to cut emissions smartly. In Exploration & Production, the ForCFR app links carbon forecasts with oil and gas output. In Angola, it helped cut 179 kt CO₂e annually by optimizing well operations.

Another example is: at the Normandy, Donges, and Feyzin refineries, the CarbOptim app tracks energy use in real-time and helps cut steam and energy waste.

2025 Carbon Intensity Reduction Target

TotalEnergies has raised its 2025 carbon intensity reduction target from 15% to 17%, aiming for a 25% emission cut by 2030. That means delivering the same energy with fewer emissions, or more energy with the same carbon footprint. Most of the progress will come from boosting clean electricity, cutting oil use, and growing gas and bioenergy.

Joins Google for Clean Energy

In January 2025, TotalEnergies teamed up with Google Europe to help power its Dutch data centers with 24/7 clean electricity by 2030. They’ll combine Google’s green power deals and add battery storage to handle renewables’ ups and downs. Similar deals are already in place with U.S. tech firms

Switch to Low-Carbon Power by 2025

TotalEnergies aims to power all its refining and chemical sites in Europe and the U.S. with 100% low-carbon electricity by 2025. This target will be achieved through initiatives like the Go Green project in Port Arthur, Texas.

Additionally, last year it achieved 26 GW of gross installed renewable electricity capacity, targeting 35 GW by 2025 and reaching 100 GW by 2030.

With this progress, TotalEnergies plans to become one of the top five global producers of renewable electricity (wind and solar), excluding Chinese companies.

Latest Projects

In April 2024, TotalEnergies started the Marsa LNG project in Oman. The plant will run on power from a 300 MW solar farm and emit less than 3 kg CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent.

Also, the company approved the GranMorgu oil project in Suriname.

This all-electric project will use advanced tech to cut emissions below 16 kg CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent.

Additionally, it aims to:

Become a key producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), targeting 1.5 million tonnes annually by 2030.

In 2024, the company’s gross biomethane production capacity rose to 1.2 TWh per year

Hydrogen Plans Take Shape

This is part of its long-term plan to decarbonize its operations and energy products.

TotalEnergies is expanding its clean hydrogen portfolio with multiple projects across Europe. In France, it’s building biohydrogen units at La Mède and Grandpuits refineries with Air Liquide, targeting annual CO₂ cuts of 130,000 and 150,000 tonnes respectively.

In the Netherlands, a 250 MW offshore wind-powered electrolyser in Zeeland will supply 30,000 tonnes of green hydrogen from 2029, reducing refinery emissions by 300,000 tonnes yearly.

Furthermore, tolling agreements in Belgium and France will see Air Liquide operate electrolysers in Antwerp (130 MW) and Normandy (100 MW), each producing 15,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually and cutting 150,000 tonnes of CO₂ per site by 2027.

Despite market challenges, TotalEnergies continues to invest in clean energy and climate action. Its rising carbon credit purchases highlight how big energy players are using voluntary carbon markets to decarbonize. Thus, its role for a lower-carbon future is of utmost significance.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2079480685.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 12:56:38.464470
