On March 10, SK Energy announced a contract with Cathay, Hong Kong's flagship airline, to supply 20,000 tons of ISCC-certified SAF through 2027. Since November 2024, SK Energy has been providing SAF to Cathay at Incheon International Airport. Both companies intend to expand SAF utilization across additional routes in the near future.

This agreement marks a pivotal achievement for SK Energy, occurring just two months after the company became the first Korean refinery to export SAF to Europe. The APAC region is critical for SK Energy, accounting for over 80% of its export volume. With Hong Kong International Airport ranking as the fifth busiest airport globally in passenger traffic, this partnership allows SK Energy to further solidify its presence in the region. Leveraging this strategic foothold, the company is actively working to strengthen its position in the APAC SAF market.

Industry experts highlight SK Energy’s success as a result of its innovative SAF production system. In September 2023, SK Energy established a production capacity of 100,000 tons per year using a co-processing method. This technique integrates bio-feedstock supply systems into existing petroleum processing lines, enabling the efficient production of low-carbon fuels such as SAF and bio-naphtha.

Global SAF demand is rising following the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) 2021 resolution to reduce aviation industry carbon emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. The European Union now mandates that all departing flights must include at least 2% SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The United States has also committed to replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050. In APAC, Singapore plans to introduce a 1% SAF usage requirement by 2026, and South Korea will require airlines to blend 1% SAF in 2027. In preparation, South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport will set SAF usage targets by mid-2025.

Specifically, he cited low carbon fuel standards in California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico that push for ultra-low carbon ethanol.","Plans for a five-state carbon pipeline were thrown into question last week when South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for such projects.

Carbon sequestration is a way for ethanol producers to significantly lower carbon intensity scores. But carbon dioxide has to go through a pipeline to get to a sequestration site.

Permitting issues at the state level have been a barrier to some pipeline projects. With a new administration and Congress focused on rolling back “Green New Deal ” measures, it’s unclear how they will proceed.

The South Dakota law could spell trouble for the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline that was planned to traverse parts of the state.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said the group’s view is that the South Dakota law effectively bans CO2 pipelines in the state. If this holds, he said it will disadvantage many farmers and ethanol plants there.

Limiting carbon pipelines undercuts President Donald Trump’s energy goals that include the ability to sequester carbon as a key part of American energy dominance.

The proposed project would include 2,500 miles of pipeline through Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas. Already, 57 ethanol plants along the route have partnered with Summit.

Rocky journey for pipeline development

After years of back and forth, the company has received sequestration permits in North Dakota and pipeline permits in Minnesota, North Dakota and Iowa.

However, the Iowa Utilities Board's approval provided that Summit could not begin construction until it had approval from North Dakota and South Dakota for the route.

Some South Dakota landowners strongly opposed the project.

The state Supreme Court sided with landowners in August, ruling that Summit had not proved it is a common carrier, limiting its ability to do surveys without landowner permission. Voters in November rejected a law allowing carbon pipeline developers to sidestep local restrictions.

Initially, state utility regulators rejected the company’s permit application in 2023. Summit reapplied in November 2024 with a route change. Regulators are still considering the route.

In a letter explaining his decision to sign the eminent domain bill, Rhoden said the project is not dead yet. Instead, he hopes Summit uses the opportunity to reset and improve relations with landowners. He also noted that voluntary easements will not be prohibited by the law.

Under a voluntary easement, a landowner agrees to take a payment in exchange for allowing a company to access their land. That way the company doesn't need eminent domain authority.

As of October 2024, Summit said it had secured 75% of the base route in Iowa, 75% of the previous route in South Dakota, 82% in North Dakota and 89% in Minnesota.

In a statement after the law was signed, Summit said the move presents obstacles but the project will move forward in states that “support investment and innovation.” The company promised more news ""soon.""

“It’s very unfortunate that, despite our approvals in Iowa, North Dakota and Minnesota, South Dakota changed the rules in the middle of the game,” Summit wrote. “This kind of regulatory uncertainty creates real challenges — not just for our project, but for the ethanol plants in South Dakota that now face a competitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring states.”

Other carbon pipeline projects have been scrapped recently. Navigator CO Ventures announced in 2023 that it had canceled its Heartland Greenway pipeline project due to “the unpredictable nature of the regulatory and government processes.”

Carbon pipelines key part of ethanol production

IRFA's Shaw said a pipeline in South Dakota would be a “big red easy button,” for Iowa ethanol producers and farmers seeking lower carbon intensity scores. However, he said the law does not signal the end of the road.

“There are many places to sequester carbon,” Shaw said. “There are many ways to get there that do not involve a pipeline in South Dakota.”

Shaw said there’s high demand for “ultra” low carbon ethanol around the world and in the United States. Ethanol producers are looking for ways to access markets and one hiccup in South Dakota is not going to stop it, he said.

Specifically, he cited low carbon fuel standards in California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico that push for ultra-low carbon ethanol. Other states are exploring fuel standards that could model these. Some of the largest ethanol export markets, like the United Kingdom, European Union and Canada, also have low carbon fuel standards.

In the private market, airlines are also itching for low-carbon fuel, Shaw said.

“It doesn't matter whether you think the issue of reducing carbon is silly or smart or stupid,” Shaw said. “It doesn't matter. These are what our customers want.”

Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is the biggest and easiest way for ethanol producers to reduce carbon intensity. Ethanol plants could invest millions of dollars in on-site technologies that lower carbon, but it’s more costly and less beneficial than sequestration, Shaw said.

There are other ways to transport carbon, including rail, but carrying carbon through pipelines is cheaper. Shaw noted that Illinois could be a destination for a pipeline that avoids South Dakota.

Shaw said there are plenty of ways Summit can keep the project alive and said he'd be shocked if the company simply abandoned the project rather than exploring alternatives.

While Shaw took an optimistic approach to broader political support for carbon sequestration, Doug Durante, executive director of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, was more skeptical.

“We're going kind of backwards in our emphasis on carbon,” Durante said. “So I think if you had a pipeline … what’s the value?”

Durante pointed to efforts by the Trump administration to eliminate climate initiatives, language and programs. USDA scrubbed certain websites related to climate change. Recently, the Department of Energy also rebranded “sustainable aviation fuel” as “synthetic aviation fuel.”

Trump and some Republican lawmakers have also sought to scale back the Inflation Reduction Act. Signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, the law updated the 45Q tax credit to offer $85 per ton of carbon sequestered to incentivize the use of carbon capture and storage.

Pipeline projects like Summit seek to claim this credit.

Lowering carbon intensity scores through sequestration can also change the credit amount fuel producers receive through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. This was also included in the IRA and replaced expiring biofuel credits.

Some Republicans have made it clear that they want some IRA provisions, including 45Z and 45Q, to be preserved in upcoming tax reform and budget reconciliation bills. But it’s unclear exactly how Congress and the administration will handle these efforts.

Without credits or incentives, Durante said it could alter the calculation and value of ethanol.

“I think it unfortunately kicks one of the legs of the stool out from under ethanol,” Durante said. “Again, if there’s no governmental or societal value for reducing carbon.”",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Associated%20Press%20photos/Dec%202023/AP_Dec_23_carbon_pipeline_protest.jpg?height=635&t=1741297988&width=1200,N,,2025-03-12 14:51:01.787215

Or, as Pusskeiler puts it: “Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is becoming a key component in procurement strategies aimed at greener supply chains.

It not only supports businesses in achieving their environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets but also enhances supply chain resilience and provides a competitive advantage. As companies seek more sustainable sourcing solutions, SAF is emerging as a critical driver of low-carbon logistics.

In a significant step towards reducing carbon emissions, Mercedes-Benz has secured a record-breaking order of SAF for its export air freight shipments from Frankfurt to Beijing and Shanghai. The procurement of around 13,000 tonnes of SAF marks the largest single-volume order of its kind by a DB Schenker customer. This initiative will cut Mercedes-Benz’s CO2e emissions by 40,000 tonnes, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable logistics.

Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight at DB Schenker, highlights the long-term impact of the agreement: “Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey. Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments.

""By working together, we are actively and immediately reducing emissions in intercontinental supply chains. This contract represents one of the largest-ever SAF deals in the entire automotive and logistics industries globally. I look forward to seeing more customers join us.”

Strengthening Sustainable Supply Chains Through Procurement

Mercedes-Benz and DB Schenker have maintained a strong procurement and logistics partnership for decades, covering land, air and ocean transport, as well as warehouse management. In 2021, Mercedes-Benz became one of the first companies to utilise DB Schenker’s SAF-powered cargo flights. This latest order represents another milestone in their joint efforts to decarbonise supply chains.

With sustainability now at the core of corporate procurement strategies, Mercedes-Benz is setting a new industry benchmark by prioritising low-emission transport solutions.

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz, underlines this commitment: “As part of our Ambition 2039 for Mercedes-Benz Cars, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions in logistics by 60% compared to 2021. Our sustainability strategy focuses on CO2 avoidance and on the reduction of emissions for all modes of transport in inbound and outbound. Utilising sustainable aviation fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions. Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”

This agreement not only demonstrates leadership in green logistics but also encourages other companies to integrate SAF into their procurement strategies. By leveraging sustainable sourcing, businesses can build more resilient supply chains while contributing to global decarbonisation efforts.

SAF’s Role in Green Logistics and Procurement Strategy

SAF is a renewable fuel derived from waste products such as agricultural and forestry residues, algae, used cooking oil and municipal solid waste. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle, making it a key enabler of sustainable logistics.

A major advantage of SAF is its compatibility with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure, allowing for immediate adoption without the need for costly modifications. This makes it an attractive solution for procurement teams aiming to transition towards lower-carbon transport options while maintaining operational efficiency.

For companies focused on ESG compliance and supply chain sustainability, integrating SAF into their procurement strategies offers multiple benefits. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels and supporting the circular economy, SAF contributes to long-term carbon reduction goals while ensuring business continuity in an increasingly regulated environment.

The Impact of SAF Procurement on the Automotive Industry

The partnership between Mercedes-Benz and DB Schenker signals a broader shift in automotive procurement, where sustainable sourcing and logistics solutions are becoming non-negotiable. By investing in SAF, Mercedes-Benz is not only reducing its own carbon footprint but also setting a precedent for the industry.

Mercedes-Benz’s sustainability roadmap, ‘Ambition 2039,’ outlines its goal of achieving net carbon neutrality across its entire vehicle lifecycle and supply chain. To reach this target, the company is investing in recycled materials, fleet electrification and renewable energy. By 2030, more than 70% of its energy requirements are set to be met through solar and wind power.

By securing large-scale SAF procurement, Mercedes-Benz is demonstrating that sustainable sourcing is not just an ambition but a practical reality. This approach encourages other automotive manufacturers and logistics providers to follow suit, driving the industry towards a greener future.

As businesses face increasing pressure to decarbonise their supply chains, the Mercedes-Benz and DB Schenker agreement highlights the power of procurement in shaping a more sustainable logistics landscape.

The cellulosic content test is part of the ongoing efforts to transform RPR into a biorefinery in the coming years.
It will become a biorefinery dedicated to producing fuels exclusively from renewable materials,” concludes Petrobras’ CEO, Magda Chambriard.","Petrobras (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Riograndense Refinery (RPR) successfully completed an industrial scale co-processing test using 5% pyrolysis bio-oil (a non-food biomass raw material) combined with fossil feedstock. The refinery, located in Rio Grande, southern Brazil, has Petrobras, Ultra and Braskem as shareholder companies.

Petrobras provided the technology for the co-processing test conducted at RPR’s catalytic cracking unit, which lasted seven days and was concluded on February 17th. A highly specialized technical team from Petrobras and Riograndense offered support throughout the commissioning, startup, operation, and shutdown stages of the bio-oil supply to the process. When co-processed at RPR’s FCC unit, the bio-oil was converted into various fractions such as fuel gas, LPG, and components for gasoline formulation and marine fuel with renewable content.

For the test, the FCC unit was adapted to enable the simultaneous bio-oil and fossil feedstock co-processing. The reactor catalyst belongs to the ReNewFCC line, produced in partnership with Fábrica Carioca de Catalisadores (FCC S.A.), a joint venture between Petrobras and Ketjen.

The renewable fraction was supplied by Vallourec – Florestal unit. The bio-oil production is ISCC PLUS certified and involves the condensation of vapors generated during eucalyptus charcoal production, which helps in preventing GHG emissions.

In late 2023, RPR became the first in the world to process 100% vegetable oil in an FCC unit, producing fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry, such as propylene and bio-aromatics (BTX – benzene, toluene, and xylenes), also with Petrobras´ Research, Development, and Innovation Center (CENPES) technology.

“The recent test represents a significant breakthrough for global biorefining, as it could enable wood and other agroforestry residues transformation, which are widely available, into derivatives typically produced in oil refineries,” says Petrobras’ Director of Engineering, Technology, and Innovation, Renata Baruzzi.

Petrobras’ Director of Industrial Processes and Products, William França, emphasizes that “the innovative aspect of this new CENPES development is the bio-oil introduction into an existing refining asset, reducing the need for additional investments and opening a broader perspective in the energy transition and value generation for the industry”.

According to Petrobras’ Director of Energy Transition and Sustainability, Mauricio Tolmasquim, “with COP30 approaching, this innovation reinforces Petrobras’ and Brazil’s leadership on the international scenario, consolidating the company’s role in driving technological solutions for the energy transition in our country,”.

The initiatives are part of Petrobras’ BioRefining Program, which foresees US$ 1.5 billion investments within its 2025-29 Business Plan. The co-processing test at RPR complies with the RD&I clauses of the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP).

The cellulosic content test is part of the ongoing efforts to transform RPR into a biorefinery in the coming years. “In line with our commitment to leading a just energy transition in Brazil, the Riograndense Refinery has the potential to become the world’s first refinery to produce continuously 100% renewable products. It will become a biorefinery dedicated to producing fuels exclusively from renewable materials,” concludes Petrobras’ CEO, Magda Chambriard.",https://www.chemengonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ce-sm-logo-400x400-sb.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 14:51:10.041227

Tickets are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet mandates for the use of renewable energy in transport.

In the Netherlands, ""other"" and advanced renewable fuel units (HBE-Os and HBE-Gs) hit a more than three-week high of €11.10/GJ on 6 March, while in the UK, non-crop renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) reached 26.25 pence/RTFC on 5 March, the highest level since 29 January.

Despite the increase, RTFCs are at a discount to the like-for-like blend value of used cooking oil methyl esther (Ucome) biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) Class II (see graph). And in the Netherlands, HBE-Gs remain well below the like-for-like blend value of palm oil mill effluent (Pome) oil-based HVO (Class IV). This typically discourages obligated parties to physically blend biofuels.

Biodiesel and HVO prices increased on higher feedstock costs, market participants said. The premiums of HVO Class II and IV against the HVO-escalated 7-28 day Ice gasoil price reached $800/m³ and $785/m³, respectively, on 7 March, the highest since 12 February.

Meanwhile, the Argus Ucome biodiesel fob ARA price rose to $1,453.24/t on 4 March, its highest since 3 December. And last week, the Argus UCO fob ARA assessment hit its highest level since October 2022, driven by low supply in the ARA region and a stronger euro against the US dollar. A closed arbitrage with China, Europe's biggest importer of UCO, is putting further pressure on supply in the region, market participants said.

UCO trade flows shifted away from Europe last year as significant amounts of Chinese product moved to the US at the expense of flows elsewhere. But there may be some relief for European buyers in 2025 as US buyers wait for clarity on the Inflation Reduction Act's carbon intensity-based 45Z credit.

President Donald Trump's doubling of pre-existing tariffs on Chinese imports to the US to 20pc is yet to have an impact on the European market, although participants said it could put a ceiling on further price gains.

SAF blending pressures HBE-IXBs

HBE-IXB tickets — generated by blending biofuels made from feedstocks listed in Annex IX part B of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive — have been moving in the opposite direction. The Argus Netherlands HBE-IXB price softened to its lowest since October last year on 13 February, at €9.50/GJ (see graph). It has since risen slightly, reaching €9.75/GJ on 11 March.

The tickets are under pressure from stronger supply as some are being offered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blenders, market participants said. Biofuels in aviation benefit from a 1.2x multiplier, in addition to the double counting rule for waste feedstocks.

An EU-wide SAF mandate — ReFuelEU — came into effect on 1 January, replacing national obligations. Under the mandate, fuel suppliers will need to include 2pc SAF in their jet fuel deliveries in 2025, rising to 6pc in 2030.

UCO-based hydrotreated esters and fatty acids synthesised paraffinic kerosine (HEFA-SPK) is the most common type of SAF available today. In the Netherlands, blending HEFA-SPK SAF into jet fuel can generate HBE-IXBs.

But the Dutch ministry of infrastructure is consulting on its second draft to transpose the recast RED III. If the current draft is implemented, the Netherlands will introduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction mandates from 2026 for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping. The first draft also included an aviation subcategory, but it was removed in February.

GHG-quota by blending less lucrative in Germany

The increase in biodiesel and HVO prices in the ARA region has not had an impact on German GHG certificates. Buying GHG certificates remains more cost effective than physical blending for fuel suppliers. But market participants anticipate prices rising from the end of March, which could reverse this trend.

Overall blending in Germany is expected to increase this year to generate new GHG tickets, after carry-over was frozen, forcing producers to build their GHG balance from scratch in order to fulfil their 2025 quotas. Many market participants remain focused on their 2024 balance for now, and demand for advanced biofuels and HVO in Germany has been slow so far this year.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-03-12 13:50:54.799294

Starting January 2025­, planes can refuel with sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport

​OMV Petrom, the largest integrated energy producer in Southeast Europe, in supplying Cluj International Airport Avram Iancu with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2025, an important step towards reducing carbon emissions in air transportation. Through this partnership, Cluj International Airport and OMV Petrom reaffirm their commitment of supporting the energy transition and adopting sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

Starting January 2025, aircrafts taking off from Cluj airport, the second largest airport in Romania, are fueled with aviation fuel mixed with 2% SAF, thus reducing the environmental impact. Nearly 1,800 flights were operated in January and February using this fuel, covering all departures from the airport.

""We are proud to contribute to the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport. SAF is produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, transformed into fuels with properties similar to conventional kerosene using innovative technologies. At OMV Petrom, we have started construction works on a €750-MM investment so that, starting 2028, we can produce such fuels in Romania at the Petrobrazi refinery. We believe in Romania's potential to become a regional hub for such fuels,"" said Radu Căprău, member of the OMV Petrom Executive Board responsible for Refining and Marketing.

“Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to initiate the process by which the aircrafts operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fueled with sustainable aviation fuels. This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfill our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,"" said David Ciceo, General Manager of Cluj International Airport.

With nearly 3.3 MM passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni. As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying SAF, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

How sustainable fuels are produced. SAF is produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as used oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes and green hydrogen, these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to conventional kerosene. SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a vital role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets. The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates the use of SAF on European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2% starting January 1, 2025, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6% by 2030.

The biggest part in aviation is fuel – can you talk about fuel efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?
So, working with companies like Airbus and Boeing to improve fuel efficiency is really key.
If we’re using fuel, are we using lower carbon fuel?","Aviation is a fascinating sector, especially when it comes to sustainability.

It is known as a ‘hard-to-abate sector’ because, unlike other industries, its road to net zero is not so straightforward.

Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from up and down a company’s supply chain) form the majority of total emissions for most organisations around the world.

In aviation, almost all emissions come from Scope 1 (the direct emissions from operations). The reason? Jet fuel.

Planes rely on jet fuel to fulfil their primary function, but sustainable alternatives are not yet readily available enough for the sector to totally switch out fossil fuels for cleaner, greener ones.

Instead, aviation companies like British Airways have to decarbonise in other ways.

After his fascinating fireside at Sustainability LIVE: Net Zero, Tom Byrne, British Airways' Head of Net Zero & Environment, told us all about the innovative approaches that the industry is taking to decarbonisation right now.

Could you tell us a little bit about your role at British Airways and how you first got into sustainability?

My job is Head of Net Zero & Environment and it's a privilege to have that for a brand like British Airways.

I've always loved flying and being able to contribute towards flying getting more sustainable in time is a dream for me.

My team focuses on accelerating our net zero programme, which is about using less fuel, lower carbon fuels and increasingly looking at carbon removals, but also looking after our wider environmental footprint.

So that's food waste, single-use plastic and environmental compliance. It's a really busy area and a really brilliant job.

I've been in the industry for over a decade now and I’ve primarily worked for big corporates in the built environment, online fashion and now aviation.

My work is about really trying to help businesses achieve their long-term carbon goals and climate goals. And yeah, it's been a good ride!

There are many different parts to net zero at a company like BA. The biggest part in aviation is fuel – can you talk about fuel efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?

You’re right – the majority of our emissions are in our Scope 1 and the majority of those is burning jet fuel. So that's the primary source of our emissions and it’s what we look at every single day to drive down.

There's three main ways of tackling that.

1. Using less fuel and having more operational efficiency. So our new aircraft, the Airbus A350 uses 35% less fuel than the Boeing 747 that it’s replacing.

The Airbus A320 Neos use about 20% less fuel than the ones they're replacing. So, working with companies like Airbus and Boeing to improve fuel efficiency is really key.

2. Working with our pilots to improve efficiency. So we operate every single day with more efficient processes and more efficient technology. So that's a really key part of our net zero pathway. We think that will cover about a third of our emission reductions.

3. SAF. If we’re using fuel, are we using lower carbon fuel? That's where SAF really comes into it.

There have been a few stories about contrails in the news recently. Does BA do much work around contrails?

Carbon is part of the equation when it comes to climate, but there's this other element of our climate impact, which is called non-CO₂, and contrails form a large part of that.

Non-CO₂ is something that we are thinking about a lot and have been for the last couple of years.

We're trying to work with the science community, with the academia community just to improve the science and knowledge, because with carbon we really know one tonne of jet fuel that we burn equals three tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere.

We know what that does to climate change and global warming.

With non-CO₂ – including contrails, the level of uncertainty is much wider. We're working with the likes of Imperial College London, Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy and the UK government to actually improve the science.

We're actually doing a research study ourselves around how we could use SAF to reduce contrails as well.

We're trying to collaborate as best we can with industry partners to improve their knowledge, improve the science, and then hopefully mitigate in the future like we're doing with CO₂ emissions.

Aviation is often called a ‘hard-to-abate’ sector, so if there's people actually ready to team up and join forces on how to decarbonise, then that's a great thing.

Exactly right. There's three elements of collaboration that I think about a lot. Firstly, collaborating with your peers.

So what are you doing to share information, best practise data with your peers? And as an industry, we all need to move towards that net zero position.

It's no good to us if only BA does it, right? So we have to collaborate with our sister airlines and our peers.

Then, it's collaboration with the supply chain. That’s really important because we don't produce planes, we don't produce fuel, we don't capture carbon emissions ourselves. We have to work with supply chain partners to do that.

And then thirdly – customer collaboration. So that might just be communicating to customers, but we can give them more information about the issues around aviation and what we're trying to do to solve those issues.

We're also collaborating with corporate customers. We know we are a lot of our corporate customers’ Scope 3 footprint.

Tackling Scope 3 is really important for them and we can work with them on those solutions.

Whether that is just giving them information, data, helping them to make smarter choices, co-sponsoring things like SAF to drive down their emissions as well, that's really vital.

Collaboration exists in lots of different ways and without it we won't get very far.

The record agreement reduces the global automotive company’s CO2e emissions by 40,000 tons through the procurement of around 13,000 tons of SAF. The biofuel is being accredited towards export air freight shipments from Frankfurt to Beijing and Shanghai.

Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight, DB Schenker: “Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey. Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments.

The next deadline is often the next race, so change can happen in a matter of weeks.

In the race to net zero, Formula 1 is leading the field, aiming to reach this target by 2030.

Its 2024 Impact Update says that Formula 1 is on track to deliver on this goal.

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, says: “Innovation and community drove Formula 1's work in 2024. We are thrilled to outline our progress and continued work in this space.

“Formula 1 as a sport is uniquely positioned to take action through our global reach and technological leadership.”

Fuelling F1 cars sustainably

F1’s cars run on E10 fuel, a blend of 10% green ethanol and 90% fuel – but this is planned to change in 2026.

Cars will soon run on 100% sustainable fuel, where the carbon used to produce the fuel is of the same quantity as that emitted when it is used.

F1 has been working in partnership with Aramco and the FIA to develop this fuel and have tested more than 39 blends in the process.

In 2024, F2 and F3 cars ran on 55% Aramco advanced sustainable fuel and the FIA medical and safety cars operated on 40%.

This will move to 100% in F2 and F3 cars for 2025 ahead of F1 cars adopting the fuel.

Throughout the 2024 season, all cars also operated using FSC-approved Pirelli tyres, ensuring compliance with strict forest sustainability standards.

Sustainable fuels off-track

The cars on track represent just 1% of F1’s carbon footprint and already use the most efficient hybrid engines in the world.

Most of the sport’s emissions are off-track, where cars, equipment and teams need to be transported to each of the race locations.

The report says that in 2024, F1’s investment in alternative fuels drove carbon reductions in its air and road logistics alongside circuit operations and on track.

It also made significant investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of this ultra-efficient logistics strategy with DHL and Qatar Airways.

This combined investment reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO₂e, or roughly 19%, compared to traditional aviation fuel.

Low-carbon energy generation systems began testing and were used in 2024 at the Red Bull Ring, the Hungarian Grand Prix and the Italian Grand Prix in Monza.

For 2025, the programme will be rolled out to reduce more than 90% of carbon emissions at all European Grand Prix using technologies such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), biofuel, solar panels and batteries.

Reducing logistics emissions

Transporting the equipment for 24 races around the world is no small feat.

As part of Formula 1’s efforts to reduce travel and logistics emissions, it has made improvements to the geographical flow of races around the world.

The race in Japan will move from September to April, fitting with the Asia Pacific segment of the schedule and Azerbaijan has been moved to align with Singapore.

The Qatar Grand Prix will move to the penultimate race of the season, putting it next to Abu Dhabi.

From 2026, the Canadian Grand Prix will be hosted earlier in the year and the Monaco Grand Prix will take place on the first full weekend in June, consolidating the European leg of the season to remove an additional transatlantic crossing.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said: “The change will make the future flow of our calendar not only more sustainable, but logistically more sensible for our teams and personnel.

“Our net zero by 2030 commitment continues to be a priority for us as a sport and it is thanks to changes like this that we are on track to hitting our goal.”

Formula 1’s social initiatives

In 2021, the Hamilton Commission proposed 10 recommendations including the implementation of a Diversity and Inclusion charter.

Formula 1, the FIA and all 10 F1 teams have now signed the charter, aiming to improve diversity and inclusion across motorsport with initiatives like scholarships, apprenticeships and access for those from underrepresented communities.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh delivered a candid message at an industry event in Phoenix, signaling a need to reassess the sector's sustainability roadmap.

At the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in Boston, U.S., on October 4, 2021, IATA member airlines passed a resolution committing them to achieving net-zero carbon emissions from their operations by 2050. Bold promises marked that historic moment when the global aviation industry began recovering from the COVID-19 crisis. Today, however, that enthusiasm appears to be waning.

Before a diverse audience of financiers, lessors, banks, and industry stakeholders, Walsh acknowledged for the first time that the sector is unlikely to meet its long-standing target.

This admission not only marks a turning point for IATA but also raises fundamental questions about the feasibility of the industry’s current sustainability plans. Let's dive in.

The Roadblock: Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) have been central to the industry's strategy for reducing emissions. Despite some progress—increasing production numbers that, while doubling in recent years, still represent only a tiny fraction of overall jet fuel demand—the slow pace of SAF adoption has become a critical concern.

Walsh’s remarks pointed directly to these challenges, noting that the anticipated growth in SAF production has not materialized quickly enough to sustain the aggressive 2050 timeline.

Industry analysts and executives, including Aviation Week’s Jens Flottau and senior editors Joe Anselmo and Christine Boynton, have long warned that the path to net zero was built on overly ambitious assumptions—have a listen to the podcast episode where the editors discuss Walsh's acknowledgement of this.

The signs were already present in 2023. According to an assessment by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), it would be difficult to accomplish the previous White House administration's target of meeting 100% of U.S. jet fuel demand with biofuels by 2050 due to sustainability and supply issues.

The CBD is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1.7 million members and online activists dedicated to protecting endangered species and wild places.

According to the report, the majority of the feedstocks being evaluated for the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) would negatively impact the environment or the climate. The report adds that the development of renewable fuels alone cannot achieve the ambitious SAF production target.

“Once you examine the data, the aviation biofuels boon looks more like a boondoggle,” said John Fleming, Ph.D., a scientist at the Center’s Climate Law Institute and the lead author of the report.

“Aviation is inarguably one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize, but that’s exactly why we need a diversified, comprehensive approach. For Biden to put all our eggs in the biofuels basket is a reckless disregard of climate reality.”

To further complicate the matter, setting a 2050 target can seem disingenuous given that airplanes last, on average, a little over 20 years and that technologies won't likely be widely available for fleet adoption until the 2040s.

Walsh's acknowledgment, therefore, while surprising in its timing, confirms what many in the industry have feared: without a substantial breakthrough in sustainable fuel technology, the 2050 target will remain an elusive goal.

Political, Regulatory Shifts

The evolution of this narrative is set against a backdrop of shifting political and regulatory climates. In 2021, environmental mandates and policies—especially those pushed by the Biden administration and European governments—compelled airlines to pursue aggressive emissions reduction strategies.

However, those external pressures have eased in many regions, particularly in the United States, as political priorities shift away from stringent sustainability mandates.

Despite these changes, European and Asian regulatory frameworks continue to impose strict emissions and SAF quotas. Walsh’s comments have already sparked concerns about potential conflicts with governments that insist on maintaining rigorous environmental standards.

Furthermore, Bain & Co. partner Jim Harris pointed out in his July 2022 op-ed for Aviation Week that, according to a study on future aviation propulsion technologies, SAF production costs and supply availability would fall short of meeting aviation needs, even with government mandates and incentives encouraging early adoption and investment.

And let's not forget the time when seasoned Captain Ben K told the Marshall Skill Academy that while it was part of the push toward sustainability, “SAF is not completely carbon neutral; there are emissions when it’s refined and then transported to the airports.”

“You also still need to grow plants to make it – which takes up things like water, farm space, labour costs, and so on. This is why ‘lifecycle emissions’ is a phrase that pops up a lot in SAF press releases.”

This disconnect between industry projections, alternative fuel production, and regulatory demands will inform further debate in upcoming meetings, including the IATA General Assembly slated for June in Delhi.

Airlines, Manufacturers' Response

Even as Walsh’s comments cast doubt on the feasibility of the 2050 goal, major airlines have reiterated their commitment to sustainability.

U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DL), Southwest Airlines (WN), American Airlines (AA), and United Airlines (UA) have all confirmed that they will adhere to their net-zero targets, underscoring the importance of sustained investments in technology and innovation.

Efforts to drive progress are already underway. United Airlines, for instance, has launched a Sustainable Flight Fund to support startups working on SAF development and new aviation technologies.

Meanwhile, innovative projects such as JetZero—a blended wing body prototype poised to offer significant efficiency gains—offer a glimpse into the potential future of cleaner air travel.

Aircraft manufacturers and regulatory bodies like the ICAO have also intensified their efforts. Recent meetings have produced recommendations to tighten emissions standards and accelerate the certification of new sustainable fuel pathways.

In 2024, Boeing announced a collaboration with NASA and UA to conduct in-flight tests to measure the impact of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on contrails and non-carbon emissions.

The second ecoDemonstrator Explorer by Boeing, a Boeing 737-10 plane designated for UA, underwent testing using 100% SAF and traditional jet fuel stored in separate tanks. NASA's DC-8 Airborne Science Lab followed the commercial aircraft to evaluate the emissions and contrail ice particles generated by each fuel type.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Airbus and a consortium of industry leaders co-invested in a SAF financing fund to accelerate the production of green fuel. Airbus Canada, Pratt & Whitney Canada, and SAF+ Consortium also announced a joint project called CADAQ-100 to develop next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in collaboration with the Government of Quebec.

The combined companies agreed to invest over C$17m (US$12.5m) in the project. To be sure, lowering CO2 emissions is a battle on many fronts, and the aviation industry is leading the way.

A Wake Up Call

Four billion passengers are moved by air annually, and the industry supports more than 60 million jobs worldwide. Despite an annual increase in flights, the aviation industry has invested heavily in new technology and operational methods, significantly reducing its carbon emissions, which is 2-3% of global carbon emissions (motor vehicles account for 83% of global emissions).

However, Walsh’s remarks serve as a wake-up call for the aviation industry. He risks reducing the external pressure that has driven critical innovations over the past few years by admitting that the current timeline is likely unachievable.

The industry now faces the dual challenge of reconciling realistic technological advancements with stringent environmental regulations. While the short-term outlook appears grim, continued collaboration between airlines, manufacturers, and governments could still pave the way for meaningful progress toward sustainable aviation.

As aviation enthusiasts, we have to acknowledge that, compared to the early passenger jet models that entered service in the 1950s, today's aircraft are over 80% more fuel-efficient. I say leave it to the engineers.

As for SAF, it is not a panacea to curtail aviation's CO2 emissions, and yet, the aviation industry relies heavily on SAF to achieve net zero by 2050. Therefore, I agree with Harris' assumption that, unless we are ready to cap aviation traffic, the industry will eventually need to accelerate the adoption of other technologies into its fleet, which will take more than expected or proposed.

A poll conducted last year at the 'IBA Webinar: Net Zero for Aviation - An Impossible Target?' showed that 47% of attendees saw 2080 as a more realistic date. SAF plants are growing in capacity, and 53 airports worldwide are distributing SAFs.

Whether from biofuels, advanced biofuels converted from waste products, or synthetic liquid fuels, the SAF promise is just that. Experts say there will not be enough supply for many years. In 2021, 125m liters of SAF were produced—449m liters are needed by 2050. Unless there's a breakthrough, it's not going to happen.

The companion Center for Biological Diversity 2020 report, Flight Path, outlines feasible solutions, including improving aircraft fuel efficiency, making operational and regulatory improvements, and achieving ""ambitious advancements"" toward a fully electrified aviation sector.

DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz

Across several decades, DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz have maintained an effective partnership, spanning land, air, ocean transport and warehouse management.

Mercedes-Benz was one of DB Schenker's first customers when it launched the world’s first-ever regular cargo flight fuelled by SAF in 2021.

This latest collaboration is set to boost progress in reducing carbon emissions across international logistics and the air freight industry.

As Mercedes-Benz sets a new industry benchmark for corporate sustainability, DB Schenker is showcasing the logistics industry’s move towards more sustainable practices.

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz, states: “As part of our Ambition 2039 for Mercedes-Benz Cars, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions in logistics by 60% compared to 2021.

“Our sustainability strategy focuses on CO2 avoidance and on the reduction of emissions for all modes of transport in inbound and outbound. Utilising sustainable aviation fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions.

“Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”

‘Ambition 2039’ for Mercedes-Benz Cars

Mercedes-Benz has remained committed to advancing sustainability through its ‘Ambition 2039’.

This details how the company is striving to ensure its entire fleet of new vehicles are net carbon-neutral by 2039 across their entire lifecycle and along the entire value chain.

It has made vital progress to reach this goal by using recycled materials, the electrification of its fleet, using renewable energy in production and integrating renewable energy sources for charging.

In 2022, Mercedes-Benz’s vehicle production locations achieved net carbon neutrality.

By establishing more PPAs and using more solar and wind power across its sites, Mercedes-Benz aims to utilise renewable energy for more than 70% of its energy needs by 2030.

What is SAF?

Sustainable aviation fuel is a waste-derived or renewable fuel that helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

It is made from feedstocks like agricultural and forestry waste, algae, used cooking oil and municipal solid waste to help decarbonise the aviation industry.

SAF is helping the logistics industry to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and promote a circular economy by significantly reducing lifestyle CO2 emissions.

It is also compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure (drop-in fuel), meaning it represents a viable alternative in the transition to a greener future.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/58b171eef770ba2cd097cca249ca6ccf:e3e6f846b18f9d396f4f6d294f288ed9/mercedes-benz-shipments-1-credit-db-schenker-torsten-zimmermann.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 12:52:48.411882

Through this partnership, Cluj International Airport and OMV Petrom reaffirm their commitment of supporting the energy transition and adopting sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

Starting January 2025, aircrafts taking off from Cluj airport, the second largest airport in Romania, are being fuelled with aviation fuel mixed with 2% SAF, thus reducing the environmental impact. Nearly 1,800 flights were operated in January and February using this fuel, covering all departures from the airport.

“We are proud to contribute to the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport. SAF is produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, transformed into fuels with properties similar to conventional kerosene using innovative technologies. At OMV Petrom, we have started construction works on a EUR 750 million investment so that, starting 2028, we can produce such fuels in Romania, at the Petrobrazi refinery. We believe in Romania’s potential to become a regional hub for such fuels,” said Radu Caprau, member of the OMV Petrom Executive Board responsible for Refining and Marketing.

„Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to initiate the process by which the aircrafts operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fuelled with sustainable aviation fuels. This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfil our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,” said David Ciceo, General Manager of Cluj International Airport.

With nearly 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania. As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuel, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

How sustainable fuels are produced

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are fuels produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as used oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes and green hydrogen, these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to conventional kerosene. SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a really important role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets.

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates the use of sustainable aviation fuels on European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2% starting January 1, 2025, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6% by 2030.",https://energyindustryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OMV-Petrom-Provides-SAF-for-Planes-at-Cluj-International-Airport.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 12:52:58.303676

This significant purchase is expected to cut CO2e emissions by 40,000 tons for Mercedes-Benz and will power air shipments from Frankfurt to China, reinforcing the companies’ commitment to sustainable logistics and the drive toward carbon neutrality.

(PRESS RELEASE) ESSEN/STUTTGART, 12-Mar-2025 — /EuropaWire/ — In a landmark move for green logistics, DB Schenker has supplied Mercedes-Benz with its largest ever order of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking a new chapter in low-emission air freight. This record-setting agreement involves the procurement of approximately 13,000 tons of SAF, which is projected to reduce Mercedes-Benz’s CO2e emissions by 40,000 tons. The biofuel will power air shipments from Frankfurt to key destinations in China, including Beijing and Shanghai.

This collaboration builds on a long-established partnership between DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz, spanning decades across various transport modes such as land, air, ocean, and warehouse management. Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight at DB Schenker, emphasized the significance of this agreement:

“Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey. Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments. By working together, we are actively and immediately reducing emissions in intercontinental supply chains. This contract represents one of the largest-ever SAF deals in the entire automotive and logistics industries globally. I look forward to seeing more customers join us.”

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz AG, underscored the importance of this initiative as part of the company’s broader “Ambition 2039” strategy. She noted that the focus on CO2 avoidance and reduced emissions across all transport modes is vital for reaching their sustainability targets:

“Utilizing Sustainable Aviation Fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions. Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”

The SAF used in this partnership is derived from waste materials such as used frying oil and is produced without certified palm oil, ensuring an average 80% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Although SAF is more costly—currently three to five times the price of fossil-based fuel—it offers a tangible solution to diminish the environmental impact of air transport. The established process of virtual allocation ensures that each ton of SAF used translates directly into an equivalent reduction of conventional kerosene consumption.

This breakthrough agreement not only highlights the potential of SAF in reducing aviation emissions but also reinforces the commitment of both DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz to driving sustainable change in the global supply chain.

Further information for editors

CO2e avoidance: The amount of CO2e released during combustion in the jet engine is equal to the amount of CO2e removed from the atmosphere during the photosynthesis phase of the plants employed to produce the oil the SAF is refined from. While the actual physical insertion of SAF might occur on different flights and airports, the respective amount of conventional kerosene is avoided. This established process is called virtual allocation.

Calculation: The method for calculating life cycle emissions and their reductions complies with the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (2018/2001/EU). These are accounted for under Scope 3.

Financial commitment: DB Schenker only uses biofuel which is certified palm oil free. Currently, the market price for SAF is 3-5 times more expensive than regular fossil-based fuel.

Airline partners: The SAF utilized for Mercedes-Benz’ supply chain is being utilized on several globally operating carriers.

Huawei has unveiled a comprehensive suite of intelligent transformation solutions as part of its broader strategy to accelerate industrial intelligence across multiple industries. The announcements came during the Mobile World Congress (MWC) Barcelona 2025, where the company showcased 83 global transformation showcases spanning 71 key scenarios.

The company launched 10 major solutions jointly developed with partners, including the Smart Railway Yard & Station Solution and Intelligent Multi-level Port Operation Management Solution.

Much of the focus of the event was on the digital transformation of industry, with Leo Chen, Huawei’s Corporate Senior Vice President and President of Enterprise Sales, outlining four key pathways the company believes are essential to accelerating what it calls ‘intelligent transformation’. “Firstly, we must deeply integrate technologies into industry scenarios and build a target ICT architecture for industrial intelligent transformation based on industry requirements, pain points and development stages,” Chen stated.

The other pathways include building advanced AI-oriented infrastructure to support exponential growth in AI workloads, developing high performance AI products that seamlessly integrate with open-source models and training ICT talent in a more targeted manner.

These solutions could significantly impact transport operations by addressing persistent challenges in real-time operations management, passenger flow optimisation and infrastructure monitoring.

AI infrastructure for transport environments

Huawei’s new AI inference appliances, which support over 50 mainstream large models, are designed to make advanced AI capabilities more accessible to transport sector customers. By simplifying deployment, the company aims to lower the adoption barrier for intelligent applications in complex operational environments.

The Huawei Enterprise Business exhibition area at MWC featured three themes: Accelerating Industrial Intelligence, Innovative ICT Infrastructure, and Partner Collaboration for Mutual Success. The showcase highlighted integration of digital and intelligent technologies, including those specifically developed for transport applications.

Talent development key to success

A significant component of Huawei’s strategy involves addressing the talent shortage that often hampers digital transformation efforts in sectors like transportation. The company announced two new talent development initiatives: the Industry Elites in the ICT Classroom Programme for enterprise customers and the Leading ICT Talent Cultivation Programme for universities.

These programmes aim to cultivate professionals who can bridge the gap between industry-specific challenges and technological solutions – a critical need as airports increasingly rely on integrated digital systems.

Industry challenge data

Data presented at the summit highlighted that 83% of digital transformation projects stumble due to failures in data products, while 52% of enterprise systems cannot access or integrate with intelligent platforms.

According to Huawei, its approach attempts to address these challenges by focusing on eliminating operational silos and establishing clear security frameworks – particularly important for airport environments where security protocols must seamlessly integrate with operational efficiency.

Intelligent transformation in the real world

Several customers from adjacent industries provided testimonials about their experiences with Huawei’s intelligent transformation solutions. Gil Brasileiro Fernandes, ICT Services Manager at Petrobras, noted: “Digital innovation is not just a choice, but the path to a more efficient, safer and sustainable future.”

The principles outlined by Petrobras – investing in robust infrastructure, prioritising solutions that enhance efficiency and safety, and transforming connectivity into a competitive advantage – align closely with the priorities of transport customers.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0752-1.jpeg,N,,2025-03-12 12:53:13.053502

During the meeting, Khassenov emphasized that partnering with LanzaJet opens new opportunities for advancing sustainable energy solutions. He stressed the importance of adopting low-carbon alternative fuel technologies for Kazakhstan's energy transition.

He said the collaboration would support Kazakhstan's low-carbon targets, drive the adoption of advanced technologies, and help KMG cut emissions by 15% by 2031 compared to 2019 levels.

Founded in 2020 by LanzaTech, Suncor, and Mitsui, with additional investments from the US Department of Energy and All Nippon Airways, LanzaJet has developed a certified ""alcohol-to-jet"" (ATJ) technology to produce SAF from ethanol. The company has long-term SAF supply agreements with major airlines, including All Nippon Airways, British Airways, and Virgin Atlantic. LanzaJet's ATJ technology can process ethanol from any biological or non-biological feedstock, cutting greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% while improving energy efficiency.",,N,,2025-03-12 06:50:09.896902

The ReFuelEU regulations have been criticised by many in the biofuels industry for excluding crop-based aviation fuels, according to the report.
In its ruling, the General Court of the EU said that ePURE and Pannonia Bio did not have a legal right to bring the challenge, the report said.
As the underlying challenge was dismissed, the objections to the EU regulations raised by the RFA, Growth Energy, USGC and LanzaJet were not considered by the court.
The underlying challenge to the FuelEU Maritime regulation – and RFA’s petition to intervene – were also dismissed by the Court.","In its decision on 27 February, the court dismissed a legal challenge brought in 2024 by European renewable ethanol association ePURE and European biofuel producer Pannonia Bio over the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation’s exclusion of crop-based biofuels, the 28 February report said.

ReFuelEU is part of the Fit for 55 package, which is the EU’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to a 1990 baseline and to reach net-zero by 2050.

The ReFuelEU aviation rules require EU airports and fuel suppliers to ensure that at least 2% of aviation fuels are “green” by 2025, increasing to 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035, 34% in 2040, 42% in 2045, and 70% in 2050.

The rules also require a proportion of the fuel mix to be comprised of synthetic fuels, such as e-kerosene. The requirement for synthetic fuels is set at 1.2% in 2030, 2% in 2032, 5% in 2035 and progressively reaches 35% in 2050.

The ReFuelEU regulations have been criticised by many in the biofuels industry for excluding crop-based aviation fuels, according to the report.

In May 2024, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), Growth Energy, the US Grains Council (USGC) and SAF technology company LanzaJet sought to intervene in the challenge in support of ePURE and Pannonia Bio, Ethanol Producer wrote.

In its ruling, the General Court of the EU said that ePURE and Pannonia Bio did not have a legal right to bring the challenge, the report said.

As the underlying challenge was dismissed, the objections to the EU regulations raised by the RFA, Growth Energy, USGC and LanzaJet were not considered by the court.

“We are disappointed by the court’s decision and strongly disagree with its finding that biofuel producers in the EU and United States – who manufacture the renewable fuels that become SAF – are somehow not harmed or affected by the EU’s unfair and unscientific SAF requirements,” the US groups were quoted as saying.

“We will continue exploring options with our partners in Europe to address the biased nature and punitive effects of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.”

RFA had also petitioned the EGC to intervene in a separate challenge brought by EU producers against the FuelEU Maritime regulation, which also excludes crop-based biofuels from inclusion in the EU’s regulatory programme to decarbonise maritime fuels, the report said.

The underlying challenge to the FuelEU Maritime regulation – and RFA’s petition to intervene – were also dismissed by the Court.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/EU-jpeg-sized.jpg?mtime=1685521489,N,,2025-03-12 06:50:15.132479

Korean oil refiner SK Energy announced Tuesday that it recently signed a comprehensive partnership with Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific Airways to promote the expansion of its sustainable aviation fuel exports.

The partnership explores the potential supply of SAF for cargo planes in addition to its current use in passenger aircraft, and considers exporting the fuel for use at overseas airports, according to SK Energy.

The agreement builds on an earlier deal under which SK Energy committed to supplying over 20,000 tons of SAF to Cathay Pacific for flights departing from Korea’s Incheon Airport through 2027. Deliveries began in November, though the financial details of the deal have not been disclosed.

SK Energy stated that its collaboration with Cathay Pacific is expected to serve as a bridgehead for expanding SAF exports to the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for more than 80 percent of Korean refiners’ exports.

Before its partnership with Cathay Pacific, SK Energy secured its first-ever SAF export deal with multiple European airlines in January, supplying fuel for use at local airports.

SK Energy produces SAF at its Ulsan plant, where it completed a biomaterial refining facility in September capable of producing 100,000 tons of low-carbon products annually.

The global SAF market has been growing steadily since the International Air Transport Association set a target in 2021 to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon emissions by 50 percent compared to 2005 levels by 2050.

In alignment with this goal, the European Union has mandated that at least 2 percent of fuel for departing flights consist of SAF, with plans to increase this share to 70 percent by 2050. South Korea and the United States also aim to transition aviation fuels toward SAF.

According to market researcher Global Market Insights, the global SAF market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 46.2 percent, reaching $74.6 billion by 2034.

Lee Young-chul, head of the marketing department at SK Energy, said :

While closely monitoring domestic and international SAF regulations as well as market conditions, including demand fluctuations, we will continue collaborating with strategic partners like Cathay Pacific Airways to establish a stable global SAF supply chain,

This move follows their recent successful export of SAF to Europe and positions them as a key player in the growing Asia-Pacific SAF market, reports Biomass Magazine.

On March 10th, SK Energy revealed that they have signed a deal with Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s main airline, to supply at least 20,000 tons of SAF until 2027. Since November of last year, they have already started supplying certified SAF to Cathay at Incheon International Airport. Both companies plan to increase SAF usage on more routes in the future.

This agreement is a major step for SK Energy, securing a steady SAF supply contract with Hong Kong’s largest airline just two months after they became the first Korean refinery to export SAF to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region is SK Energy’s biggest export market, accounting for over 80% of their sales.

Hong Kong International Airport, a major travel hub in the Asia-Pacific region, ranked fifth globally in passenger numbers last year. SK Energy aims to use this export to Hong Kong to expand their reach in the Asia-Pacific SAF market.

Industry experts credit SK Energy’s success to their early adoption of large-scale SAF production. Last September, they established a production capacity of 100,000 tons per year and began producing SAF using a process that combines bio-materials with regular petroleum processing. This allows them to create lower-carbon products like SAF.

The demand for SAF is increasing worldwide. In 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) set a goal to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon emissions by 50% by 2050.

The European Union has mandated that all flights departing from Europe must use a minimum of 2% SAF this year, with that number increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The United States has set a target to replace all regular jet fuel with SAF by 2050.

In Asia, Singapore will introduce a SAF requirement of 1% in 2026, and South Korea will require a 1% blend in 2027.

Market research firm Global Market Insight predicts the global SAF market will grow significantly, from about $1.7 billion in 2024 to $74.6 billion by 2034.

In South Korea, the government plans to set SAF usage targets later this year, in preparation for a mandatory SAF blending requirement in 2027. Starting in 2027, all international flights leaving South Korea will be required to use SAF blends.

Lee Young-chul, Head of SK Energy’s Marketing Division, said, “We will pay close attention to changes in SAF policies and the market, both in Korea and internationally. We want to build a reliable global SAF supply chain by working with Cathay Pacific and other partners.”",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.jpeg,N,,2025-03-12 02:50:16.579838

A Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate at the University of Michigan with experience working on diesel engines, Videchak’s research inspired her to enroll in sustainability courses offered by the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and the School of Environment and Sustainability.

Videchak’s dissertation is focused on creating fuel-specific engine calibrations optimized for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and a 50% (by volume) blend of the two fuels to decrease CO2 emissions and increase engine efficiency.

Videchak will attend Clean Fuels Alliance America’s 2025 Sustainability Workshop in Kansas City, Missouri, in April, where she will share her research and collaborate with industry and scientific leaders in the field.

“Ultimately, the results of my work will hopefully encourage engine manufacturers to make these alternative fuels a primary consideration rather than an afterthought,” Videchak wrote in her application. “I am eager to attend the workshop to deepen my understanding of alternative fuel sustainability, a critical area for my future career. This opportunity would allow me to apply what I learn to my professional aspirations in renewable energy and low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels.”

The Beth Calabotta Grant was established to support deserving students interested in clean fuels, science and research. The grant honors scientist and past Foundation director Beth Calabotta, whose legacy and dedication to biodiesel and sustainability tremendously impacted the industry.

“First offered in 2018, this grant continues Beth’s efforts to encourage students in science and research,” said Tom Verry, executive director of the Foundation. “Courtney’s research, perseverance, and vision are inspirational and exemplify exactly what this grant was meant to support. Beth would be proud.”

About the Beth Calabotta Sustainable Education Grant

Beth had an unquenchable love for agriculture and life sciences. Later in her career, Calabotta’s efforts focused almost solely on developing biofuels as viable energy alternatives to conventional fuels. Based on Calabotta’s work, the Foundation and the Clean Fuels Alliance America Board want to continue building on the idea that adopting innovative technologies and diversifying markets will produce environmental benefits that can be documented through research and data.

About the Clean Fuels Alliance Foundation

The Foundation works closely with Clean Fuels Alliance America to address national issues affecting us all — cleaner air, greater economic development for rural communities and enhanced national security through energy independence. Organized in 1994, the mission of the Foundation is to accomplish outreach, education, research, and demonstration activities for the advancement of biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

As such, AAFCO recognizes this and allows them in natural dry and wet pet food.
What inspired Zuke’s to focus on natural, healthy ingredients for pet treats, and how has that shaped the brand’s development?","Food retailers are well aware of the increasing consumer demand for all-natural foods and foods that offer nutritional support. But, what they may not be as aware of is that those same demands are carrying over to the pet aisle.

Consumers are increasingly seeking 100% all-natural pet treats that are free from preservatives or artificial additives, as those treats, “offer a sense of increased quality and purity/safety,” according to an October 2024 report from global management consulting firm OC&C Strategy Consultants, Additionally, FMI – The Food Industry Association’s Nonfoods Category Insights: Pet Food 2024 report indicates that pet owners are looking for “high-quality ingredients, nutritional benefits and trusted brands.”

While premium pet foods and treats were previously only available at specialty pet stores and veterinarian offices, some, such as Nestlé Purina’s Zuke’s dog treats, are making an appearance at retailers and grocery stores nationwide – a move that positions those retailers to “attract a broader customer base from those seeking basic, economical options to those looking for super-premium, specialized products,” according to FMI.

The premium pet treat category at retail also offers a simple way to grow basket size, says Nestlé Purina’s Vice President of Trade and Industry Development Joe Toscano, who shares insights into this growing segment.

What is leading the consumer trend of seeking more natural dog treats? Why does this matter?

More than ever, pet parents are seeking out natural and organic food options for their pets. That’s because people are more aware of unwanted ingredients in their food. There are plenty of natural pet food options on the shelves. In fact, more than 250 of our pet food recipes already contain no artificial flavors or preservatives because every year we’re working to make more of our products without these artificial ingredients because pet parents increasingly seek natural treats from trusted brands. We understand that today’s pet parents seek natural products backed by scientific expertise.

Interestingly enough, while The FDA has not yet defined the term “natural” as it applies to human food, there is a definition for pet food! The Association of American Feed Control Officials says ‘natural’ ingredients cannot be produced by or subjected to chemically synthetic processes. It also cannot contain any chemically synthetic additives or processing aids. Ingredients derived from plant, animal or mined sources are “natural” according to AAFCO. It is important to note, that pets do need low levels of some synthetic microingredients and nutrients, like vitamins and minerals. As such, AAFCO recognizes this and allows them in natural dry and wet pet food.

What inspired Zuke’s to focus on natural, healthy ingredients for pet treats, and how has that shaped the brand’s development?

Founded in 1995, Zuke’s originated when founder Patrick Meiering recognized the need for healthier energy-supporting treats during outdoor adventures with his chocolate lab, Zuke.

• Diversify SAF Production Pathways: While there are 11 certified pathways for SAF production, the industry currently relies heavily on Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)—which uses feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fats—accounting for 80% of SAF production in the next five years.
A Call to Action IATA’s latest SAF production estimates highlight both progress and ongoing challenges in the aviation industry's decarbonization efforts.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released new projections on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, highlighting both advancements and ongoing challenges in scaling up production.

SAF Production Growth: A Mixed Picture

In 2024, SAF production reached 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion liters), marking a twofold increase from 2023, which saw production at 0.5 million tonnes (600 million liters). Despite this progress, SAF still accounts for only 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel output.

However, this figure falls short of earlier estimates, which had projected SAF production for 2024 at 1.5 million tonnes (1.9 billion liters). Delays in ramping up production at key SAF facilities in the United States have pushed their timelines into the first half of 2025.

Looking ahead, IATA forecasts that in 2025, SAF production will reach 2.1 million tonnes (2.7 billion liters), equating to 0.7% of total jet fuel production and 13% of global renewable fuel capacity.

The Challenge of Accelerating SAF Production

""SAF volumes are increasing, but at a disappointingly slow pace,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. ""Governments continue to send mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel exploration while failing to provide sufficient incentives for new-generation fuel producers. Investors also seem hesitant, waiting for easy guarantees before committing fully. With airlines operating on razor-thin margins—just 3.6% net—expectations for SAF profitability should be long-term and sustainable rather than focused on short-term gains. Airlines are eager to purchase SAF, and there are substantial financial opportunities for companies that invest in the long-term decarbonization of the sector. Governments can play a key role in accelerating this transition by phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and replacing them with strategic incentives for SAF and other renewable energy sources.""

Aviation and the Global Energy Transition

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, emphasized that aviation’s decarbonization must be viewed within the broader global energy transition. ""Aviation should not be treated as an isolated transportation issue. SAF production is just one part of a larger shift toward renewable energy, and refineries producing SAF will also generate other renewable fuels used across industries. The world must maximize renewable energy output, and airlines need equitable access to that supply.""

To reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, IATA estimates that between 3,000 and 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be required. These facilities will produce SAF alongside renewable diesel and other alternative fuels for various industries. Achieving this will require an annual capital expenditure of approximately $128 billion over the next 30 years—a figure significantly lower than the $280 billion annual investments made in solar and wind energy between 2004 and 2022.

""Governments must act quickly to introduce strong policy incentives that accelerate renewable fuel production,"" said Walsh. ""We have a model to follow from the wind and solar industries. The encouraging news is that the financial investment needed for SAF and other aviation fuels is significantly lower than what was required to scale wind and solar energy. Redirecting even a portion of the subsidies currently granted to fossil fuels could significantly boost SAF production.""

Short-Term Strategies for SAF Expansion

IATA identified three key areas where immediate action can accelerate SAF production and usage:

• Increase Co-Processing in Existing Refineries: Traditional refineries can co-process up to 5% of approved renewable feedstocks alongside crude oil, requiring minimal infrastructure investment. Expanding this approach could eliminate the need for 260 new renewable fuel plants by 2050, saving an estimated $347 billion in capital expenditure.

• Diversify SAF Production Pathways: While there are 11 certified pathways for SAF production, the industry currently relies heavily on Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)—which uses feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fats—accounting for 80% of SAF production in the next five years. Increasing investment in alternative pathways such as Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT), which utilize agricultural and biological waste, could significantly boost SAF availability.

• Establish a Global SAF Accounting Framework: A transparent, standardized registry is crucial to ensure that airlines receive full credit for their SAF purchases. Such a system would prevent double counting and facilitate a global SAF market where producers and airlines can efficiently trade SAF credits, supporting widespread adoption.

A Call to Action

IATA’s latest SAF production estimates highlight both progress and ongoing challenges in the aviation industry's decarbonization efforts. While SAF production is increasing, it remains well below the levels needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Governments, investors, and the energy sector must work together to create a policy environment that supports rapid expansion of SAF production, ensuring aviation plays a meaningful role in the global energy transition.",https://www.aviationturkey.com/images/favicon.png,N,,2025-03-11 21:50:58.929382

The municipal Port of Walla Walla in southeast Washington has secured a $1.5 million state grant for Amsterdam-based SkyNRG to annually produce 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel near a multimodal freight network.

“SkyNRG’s new facility will be an important economic driver in the region and throughout our state’s innovative clean energy and aerospace sectors,” said Gov. Bob Ferguson. “Sustainable aviation fuels are central to the evolving global aerospace industry, and we’re proud to be leading the way here in Washington state.”

SkyNRG selected the industrial park as the site for its manufacturing facility due to its proximity to Washington airports and the surrounding West Coast markets, where it sees potential for rising demand across the transportation industry for alternative fuels to help reduce carbon emissions. The facility will produce SAF and renewable diesel using feedstocks such as renewable natural gas.

According to the governor’s office, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport dispenses yearly 600 million gallons of aviation fuel. It added that the Port of Seattle “intends to migrate 10% of that volume to SAF — about 60 million gallons per year — and to procure it from local, sustainable sources.”

This RNG uses materials culled from landfills and wastewater treatment plants as well as animal manure, all of which can be transported using existing natural gas pipelines. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notes that RNG is a substitute for chemically identical natural gas and has several applications, including use as vehicle fuel.

Founded in 2010, SkyNRG provides SAF to more than 130 customers across the world, and is developing dedicated production facilities to support the shift from fossil jet fuel to sustainable aviation fuel.

The barge port is located at the base of the Blue Mountains along the Snake River, part of a waterway system connected to the Columbia River that spans from the Pacific Ocean over 365 miles inland.

The venture is expected to add as many as 600 jobs during construction, and employ about 100 people when the production facility opens in 2029. Construction on the 165-acre parcel is slated for next year.

“The Port of Walla Walla is proud to support SkyNRG’s investment, which helps to broaden our economic base while enhancing the strength and resilience of our community,” said Patrick Reay, port executive director. “This facility positions Walla Walla as a leader in sustainable aviation fuel while creating quality jobs and long-term economic benefits. SkyNRG’s presence underscores our commitment to innovation and attracting forward-thinking industries.”

“We are excited to help expand American-made fuel production, as well as Washington state’s leadership in the global clean energy transition,” added John Plaza, CEO SkyNRG Americas. “We are also proud to bring new jobs to this community.”

The Washington State Department of Commerce allocated money for the project from the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

“This project aligns with our strategic growth priorities around clean technology and innovation,” said Joe Nguyen, Commerce Department director. “In addition to furthering Washington’s leadership in clean energy and sustainable aviation, it creates family-wage manufacturing jobs that strengthen the local economy and community.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-03/Washington-1200.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 19:51:31.743384

U.S. production reached 4.7 billion gallons in 2024, and demand is growing in new markets: aviation, rail, shipping, construction, and heating.
According to EPA data, domestic biodiesel production in January 2025 was at the lowest monthly level in the last five years.
U.S. renewable diesel production in January fell 17% below the average monthly production in 2024.
Getting back to business is crucial for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers as well as their customers.","Policy uncertainty is a roadblock for companies. Biodiesel and renewable diesel producers raced ahead over the past two years. They and their industry partners invested billions in feedstock processing, doubled production and capacity, and built new markets. But mixed signals and delays in Washington have many producers idling right now. They need a green light from policy leaders to get back to business.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which carves out a portion — currently 13% — of the on-road gasoline and diesel market for renewable fuels. It’s an important signal for renewable fuel producers to plan production levels, and the RFS statute directs EPA to complete rules more than a year in advance.

According to the Energy Information Administration, biodiesel and renewable diesel are meeting 9% of U.S. demand for distillate fuels — the on-road diesel that powers heavy-duty transportation of goods across the nation. U.S. production reached 4.7 billion gallons in 2024, and demand is growing in new markets: aviation, rail, shipping, construction, and heating.

Unfortunately, when EPA set the 2023-2025 RFS volumes, the agency selected biomass-based diesel and advanced volumes significantly below production trends and proven capacity. The RFS volume for 2024 was just over 3 billion gallons — about 2 billion gallons below what the market actually supported.

EPA is now months behind setting the RFS volumes for 2026 and beyond. The agency has indicated that it is considering a step-change in the RFS volumes to support the growth in biodiesel and renewable diesel. But the agency continues to slow walk the rulemaking, discouraging producers. They need a signal now what the market will look like for 2026. They can’t wait till the end of the year.

Adding to the market uncertainty, the U.S. Treasury this January introduced overdue and incomplete guidance on a major change in tax policy for renewable fuel producers. The new Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z of the Internal Revenue Code) was intended to be a technology neutral incentive for U.S. production of all renewable fuels — renewable natural gas, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, and others are equally eligible. The value of the credit is based on the calculated emissions rates at each production facility.

Treasury’s delay particularly hurt biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, who were transitioning from a long-standing excise tax credit to the new, facility-specific income tax credit. The value of the tax credit is built into the feedstock and fuel offtake contracts they negotiate up to a year in advance. Without available guidance on the value of the 45Z credit during the final quarter of 2024, many companies simply couldn’t put agreements in place for the first months of 2025.

The devastating impact of the uncertainty is already apparent. According to EPA data, domestic biodiesel production in January 2025 was at the lowest monthly level in the last five years. U.S. renewable diesel production in January fell 17% below the average monthly production in 2024. Some smaller producers are still struggling to understand how the new credit works and what value they can attach to their product.

While Treasury has now published minimal guidance on the tax credit, it hasn’t finalized the rules. Treasury could make changes to the guidance as it takes comment from stakeholders, and Congress could still make changes to the law. The change in presidential administrations is causing additional delays as new Treasury leadership comes in.

Getting back to business is crucial for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers as well as their customers. Fuel consumers planning their fleet operations have increasingly looked to adopt clean fuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel for cost-effective and immediate reductions in carbon and tailpipe emissions. Shortfalls in production would take a significant bite out of an essential U.S. energy supply, impacting the price of nearly every consumer good shipped across the country.

Policy stability is crucial to resuming industry growth, developing new capacity and feedstocks, and meeting increasing demand in new markets. Clean Fuels is working with producers, feedstock suppliers and other stakeholders to advocate for timely RFS volumes and to ensure that the tax credit works for everyone going forward.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/policy-gridlock.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 19:51:36.843313

“My energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth.
These initiatives are projected to save Pennsylvania energy customers $664 million by 2040 and generate $11.4 billion in clean, reliable energy investments.
The Lightning Plan: A Bold, All-of-the-Above Energy Plan Governor Shapiro’s plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth and help energy projects get built and approved faster than ever before through several strategic initiatives.
I am proud to be supporting Governor Shapiro on his plans to do both things at once through his Lightning Energy Plan.","York, PA – Today, Governor Josh Shapiro visited Voith Hydro North America to announce that key components of the “Lightning Plan” – a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy plan to secure Pennsylvania’s energy future – will be introduced in the General Assembly in the coming weeks. Legislators in both houses of the General Assembly have published co-sponsorship memos aligning with the plan, as Governor Shapiro and Democrats in the General Assembly work to strengthen Pennsylvania’s energy leadership.

Supported by labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, Governor Shapiro’s commonsense energy plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, speed up permitting, and protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building more energy generation in Pennsylvania – positioning the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

The Governor made this announcement at Voith Hydro North America’s plant in York, one of the world’s largest hydro turbine manufacturers. The Governor’s all-of-the-above strategy would increase energy production in Pennsylvania – and leading energy manufacturers like Voith will play a key role in that effort by producing more hydropower turbines. By producing more energy, Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan will boost key sectors of the Commonwealth’s economy, including manufacturing, robotics and technology, agriculture, and life sciences.

“Pennsylvania has long been a national energy leader, from Ben Franklin to today, but right now, we’re letting other states outcompete us and we’re losing out on jobs, new investment, and innovation – that has to change,” said Governor Shapiro. “My energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth. We have to meet this moment and this plan – supported by leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates – will lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, speed up permitting, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. The time for action is now and I look forward to working with leaders in the General Assembly to move this forward.”

Pennsylvania needs an energy plan to power the Commonwealth forward. Energy consumption is rising in Pennsylvania and around the world; the nation is facing more extreme weather events; the limits of the energy grid are constantly being tested; and utility costs are on the rise as a result of global instability and foreign wars. Doing nothing is not an option.

The Governor’s energy plan will provide funding for new projects through an updated Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) manufacturing tax credit, streamline energy project approvals by creating a state energy siting board to cut red tape, and encourage communities to lower utility bills through shared energy resources. Additionally, the plan increases rebates for energy-efficient appliances to help reduce household energy costs. The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.

“Demand for electricity in the US is growing, and hydro power stands out as one of the most reliable and sustainable renewable energy sources available, not only for generating electricity, but also for storing energy – an often overlooked but essential resource to maintain a stable energy grid,” said Stanley Kocon, President & CEO of Voith Hydro North America. “We wholeheartedly support the Governor’s plan to lower electricity costs and to build and upgrade more power plants to ensure clean, reliable and affordable energy for Pennsylvania's future.”

“We’re long overdue to unite behind a strategy that encourages energy production, lowers costs for energy consumers, creates good paying union jobs that offer family sustaining wages, and at the same time is mindful of the planet that we will leave behind for our kids and our grandkids,” said Jim Enders, President of the Central Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council. “These are common sense goals that we should all be able to agree on. Organized labor is encouraged by the Governor’s leadership on an energy plan that creates thousands of good paying union jobs and puts Pennsylvania energy at the forefront.”

“The Lightning Plan’s impact on communities like York – where manufacturing is not just an industry but a way of life – will be transformative,” said Kevin Schreiber, President & CEO, York County Economic Alliance. “The plan will attract new investments and stimulate job creation by prioritizing sustainable energy production and modernizing tax and other incentives, ensuring that advanced manufacturing remains a cornerstone of local economies. It will also empower manufacturers, such as VOITH HYRDO, to continue to expand operations and lead global energy innovation.”

“It's not just enough for us as a Commonwealth to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure. It's important for us to boost the amount of renewable energy here in the state. It's important for us to realize the benefits to air quality, to water quality, to build those things,” said Patrick McDonnell, President & CEO of PennFuture. “The lightning plan is a real, concrete way for us to reduce energy costs for consumers and to make sure we're putting the people of Pennsylvania to work.”

Governor Shapiro’s announcement builds on the energy plan unveiled(opens in a new tab) by the Governor last March, which will protect and create nearly 15,000 energy jobs, lowering utility bills for households, and taking real action to address carbon pollution. These initiatives are projected to save Pennsylvania energy customers $664 million by 2040 and generate $11.4 billion in clean, reliable energy investments.

Independent studies confirm(opens in a new tab) that Governor Shapiro’s plan will save Pennsylvanians money on their electricity bills, create energy jobs, and lead to billions in new investment in power plants and energy infrastructure.

The Lightning Plan: A Bold, All-of-the-Above Energy Plan

Governor Shapiro’s plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth and help energy projects get built and approved faster than ever before through several strategic initiatives. Co-sponsorship memos for each proposal are linked below.

EDGE Tax Credit (sponsored by Sen. Minority Leader Jay Costa, Senator Nick Pisciottano(opens in a new tab), and Rep. John Inglis(opens in a new tab)): The Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (PA EDGE) Tax Credit Program, established in 2022, hasn’t been used, leaving billions in potential economic development untapped. The Governor’s proposed 2025-26 budget will include key tax credit modifications to revamp the program, including:

Reliable Energy Investment Credit: Up to $100 million per facility for three years, focused on adding reliable energy sources to the grid.

Regional Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit: Up to $49 million annually for regional hydrogen projects, with lower thresholds to qualify.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Up to $15 million per year to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), like the CNX and KeyState Energy collaboration at Pittsburgh International Airport.

RESET Board (sponsored by Sen. John Kane(opens in a new tab) and Rep. Mandy Steele(opens in a new tab)): Pennsylvania needs to streamline the process for building energy projects. Currently, Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states without a state entity, accelerating siting decisions for key energy projects. The Governor is proposing the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition (RESET) Board to speed up permitting, reduce red tape, and support the next generation of energy projects in the state.

Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (sponsored by Sen. Carolyn Comitta(opens in a new tab) and Rep. Aerion Abney(opens in a new tab)): PACER would establish a cap-and-invest program to set Pennsylvania’s carbon limit and invest in reducing electricity costs. Under PACER, 70 percent of the revenue generated would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bills.

Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (sponsored by Sen. Steve Santarsiero(opens in a new tab) and Rep. Danielle Otten(opens in a new tab)): PRESS would modernize Pennsylvania’s outdated energy standards, incentivizing innovation in nuclear and renewable energy, including battery storage, to remain competitive with other states.

Lowering Energy Costs for Rural Communities (sponsored by Sen. Judy Schwank(opens in a new tab) and Rep. Peter Schweyer(opens in a new tab)): The Governor’s proposed 2025-26 budget introduces “Community Energy,” a proposal that helps rural communities, farmers, and low-income Pennsylvanians jointly share energy resources to lower costs. For example, farmers could use methane digesters to produce energy for their farms, reducing reliance on utility companies and lowering their energy prices.

Rebates to Reduce Household Energy Costs (sponsored by Sen. Lisa Boscola(opens in a new tab) and Rep. Kyle Donahue(opens in a new tab)): After nearly 20 years, Pennsylvania must reform Act 129, the law that provides rebates and incentives to buy new energy efficient appliances and other ways to reduce electricity needs over time — which in turn, leads to lower electricity prices. The Governor’s proposal will update these energy efficiency standards make Pennsylvania a leader again in saving consumers money on their energy bills.

“As a major energy-producing state, Pennsylvania is in a unique position to lead on sustainable energy sources that can reduce electric costs for families, bring new jobs to our communities, and help secure our right to clean air and pure water,” said Senator Carolyn Comitta. “PACER and the Governor’s “Lightning Plan” are the way forward to cleaner air, better economic opportunities, and consumer savings on electricity bills,” said Comitta, who serves as Minority Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. “I thank Governor Shapiro, Rep. Abney, and our legislative partners and co-sponsors for coming together to prioritize Pennsylvania’s future.”

“PACER is a win-win for the environment and Pennsylvanians,” said Representative Aerion Abney. “The program is a tremendous boost to economies across the state by creating many new jobs in the energy sector and reinvests crucial funds in the protection of our planet’s health for generations to come.”

“The current qualifications for a business to claim the Semiconductor tax credits are unattainable,” said Representative Steve Samuelson. “Not only do they leave out worthy businesses making great strides in manufacturing a key component of our electronic devices, but the credits have gone unused for the past two years. My bill would make the credits more attainable, ultimately achieving the goal of spurring economic development.”

“I have long said that it’s a false premise to say we must choose between creating jobs OR saving our planet,” said Senator Steve Santarsiero. “I applaud Governor Shapiro for leading the way and bringing together the interests of consumers, labor and the environment to find a solution that works for all of us. To that end, I am proud to introduce legislation to create the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard, the next generation of alternative energy portfolio standards for the Commonwealth. PRESS will turbocharge energy build-out in Pennsylvania and create a more diverse mix of energy resources focusing on clean, reliable, and affordable energy.”

“Pennsylvania is at a critical juncture. With energy demand skyrocketing, the PJM capacity markets facing unprecedented price spikes, and our state sorely lagging in clean energy investments, it’s imperative that we act now,” said Representative Danielle Otten. ""PRESS, as part of Governor Shapiro's Lightning Plan, will help to diversify our energy sources, reduce emissions, build resiliency into our grid, improve reliability, and lower electricity costs for ratepayers, while creating workforce opportunities and securing Pennsylvania's position as a leader in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for the next 20 years.""

""I'm proud to partner with Governor Shapiro to introduce the Community Energy bill, which will help farmers, low-income residents, and communities across Pennsylvania cut energy costs by sharing resources,” said Senator Judy Schwank. “Community Energy will support new energy projects and agricultural innovation by allowing farmers, for example, to come together to invest in methane digesters to power their operations instead of relying on electric companies. This is just one exciting component of the Lightning Plan, Pennsylvania's proposed all-of-the-above approach to energy.""

“Clean, renewable energy sources, like solar, geothermal and renewable natural gas help to reduce utility costs and lower the output on the electricity grid, but unfortunately many Pennsylvanians do not have the ability to access them,” said Representative Peter Schweyer. “Community Energy will allow people to subscribe to renewable energy programs which saves them money and ease the amount of energy output on the grid. I applaud Gov. Shapiro’s commitment to Community Energy and look forward to getting it passed and signed into law.”

""Pennsylvania has always been a leader in energy innovation, but red tape has held us back from building the next generation of reliable energy projects,"" said Senator John I. Kane. ""I'm thrilled to see Governor Shapiro taking bold action with the Lightning Plan, and I'm proud to be the prime sponsor of the RESET Board, which will be a key part of that vision. This one-stop shop for energy development will get steel in the ground faster, create good jobs, lower costs for consumers, and ensure Pennsylvania remains an energy powerhouse for decades to come.""

“If we are serious, really and truly serious, about supercharging energy development in the state to bring costs down for Pennsylvanians and set us up as a dominant energy leader, we must streamline the process,” said Representative Mandy Steele. “Creating a Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board will speed up the entire process, from permitting to reducing red tape, and supporting new energy projects in a big way. I am happy to be able to work with the governor on getting this proposal through the legislative process and become law.”

""Pennsylvania’s energy future requires a balanced approach, one that prioritizes both supply and demand. Act 129 is a needed but outdated initiative,” said Senator Lisa Boscola. ""When first introduced, the program helped make households more efficient by changing out inefficient appliances. As demand continues to outpace supply, we need to reimagine the tools used to create efficiencies in our homes and businesses. Reforming this program will give homeowners and businesses the incentives they need to reduce their energy bills by making investments in items that will drive down their energy consumption. By driving down demand, the program helps ensure we have the power we need to keep Pennsylvania running. Act 129 reforms are just one component of a strategic energy policy that includes smart investments in energy efficiency, resiliency, and generation.""

“I believe that Gov. Shapiro’s lighting plan is a fruitful step forward for the energy industry in Pennsylvania,” said Representative Kyle Donahue. “This plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building next generation power, and position the commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. I look forward to working with Gov. Shapiro and my colleagues in the state House and Senate to support legislation that will enact this plan.”

“As a lifelong resident of Allegheny County, I know how important it is to deliver good, honest union jobs to our working families, regardless of whether they have a college degree,” said Senator Jay Costa. “I also know the importance of keeping costs down wherever possible, so folks can put their hard-earned money where they want it to go, like their kids’ college funds or family vacation. I am proud to be supporting Governor Shapiro on his plans to do both things at once through his Lightning Energy Plan. By unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy potential, Governor Shapiro will create energy jobs, lower energy costs, protect PA’s energy independence, and position our commonwealth as a leader in the nation.”

“I commend Governor Shapiro for this bold, responsible, forward-looking energy plan, and I am happy to be a prime sponsor in the Senate of the EDGE tax credit programs, designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing sectors,” said Senator Nick Pisciottano. “I share the Governor’s commitment to affordable, clean, and reliable energy for every family, business, and community in Pennsylvania. This plan will lower electricity costs, which is a top priority for our residents who are facing rising utility bills. We are excited to introduce a plan that strikes a vital balance between meeting the growing energy demands of our state, while also making sure we are protecting our environment for future generations. By focusing on both innovation and practical solutions, we are setting the stage for Pennsylvania to thrive in the energy sector and compete in the global economy.”

“Pennsylvania energy powered the industrial revolution and Pennsylvania energy will power the technological revolutions of the future – if we make the right investments to support the projects that create jobs today and help create jobs for years to come,” said Represenative John Inglis. “I’m proud to be the sponsor of the EDGE tax credits in the Lightning package to help fund energy generation and infrastructure upgrades and a brighter future.”

“Pennsylvania is the crossroads of America for roads, rails, and skies,” said Representative Rob Matzie. “Investing in sustainable aviation fuel production with the Lightning plan helps cut emissions, create good-paying jobs, and support innovation in agriculture.”

“Pennsylvania has lost out because the PA EDGE tax credit program was not utilized as envisioned,” said Representative Tom Mehaffie. “We are overdue to re-energize the tax credits and ensure the Commonwealth – and nation – have sources of PA-produced, reliable power for years to come.”

Redirecting necessary farmland toward creating biomass for aviation fuels may increase the upward pressure on food prices.","The National Farmers Union is warning against unchecked growth of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Darrin Qualman, the union’s Director of Climate Crisis Policy and Action, said a global sustainable aviation fuel project may seem like a great way to decarbonize the aviation industry but the biomass required to create these fuels could increase on-farm emissions and put food systems at risk.

He said people should be concerned about this issue now because the world is at the front end of a massive public mega investment into SAF.

SAFs are a non-fossil fuel alternative that can be used in aircrafts without any modification. The report states that the current plan is for SAF production to increase using corn, soybeans, and canola over the next decade. In the long term, SAFs will increasingly be made from straw, agricultural residues, trees and grass.

“Don’t imagine these energy crops grown on forest land or waste land, necessarily,” Qualman said in a February webinar. “A lot of this is on Prime crop land or prime pasture land.”

He noted that literature around SAFs remain hopeful about sustainability and often foresee the fuels eventually being fashioned out of waste oils – like that which is leftover after making french fries in a restaurant. This would address the land use problem. Data from the U.S., however, shows that the amount of SAFs produced from waste oils is inconsequential. The burden largely remains on agricultural land to produce materials for SAFs.

Qualman said based on the projected increase of air travel, airlines could use up to two-thirds of a trillion litres of fuel per year by 2050. He said people should imagine if all this fuel was made from agricultural biomass. In Canada, creating this fuel would require 2.1 billion acres, which is 21 times the farmland area in Canada.

“The question is, should we attempt even a fraction of SAFs from crops?” Qualman said. “If we produce, say, 10 per cent of this, it would still take two times the cropland area of Canada. What would happen to global markets and global prices if a cropland area equivalent to two Canadas was taken away from food production and diverted to SAF production?”

The NFU and Qualman noted many Canadians are already struggling from a high cost of living. Redirecting necessary farmland toward creating biomass for aviation fuels may increase the upward pressure on food prices.

Chris Hessler, a U.S. expert on cleantech innovation, said there is truth to the NFU’s concerns but there is also oversimplification in them.

“If we were to try to scale up the current technologies using the current feedstocks and completely replace the fossil demand for jet fuel, we would run hard into all manner of sustainability issues, no question about it,” Hessler said. “But it’s also the truth that rarely does technology stand still.”

Hessler said many private sector investors can be scared away from putting money into clean tech, which would encourage innovation.

“We need really, really big dollars invested here,” he said.

Hessler warned against assuming technology is stagnant because this type of thinking only delays climate action. He said all projections show that aviation demand is expected to increase over the next few decades and there are no viable solutions for long term flight electrification.

Qualman, however, said part of the issue is believing sustainability can be achieved when economies endlessly grow. He said the NFU’s recommendation is for there to be increased alternatives to flying like improved train service.

“Alongside some of this techno solutionism, we just need to take a good, hard look at how much we’re consuming and how much we’re doing,” he said.

U.K. and international authorities are facing urgent questions about what went wrong and how bad the impact could be. Could there be an ecological calamity on Britain’s eastern beaches? And why did the two ships collide? Here is what we know so far:

What happened?

The Stena Immaculate, a U.S.-flagged tanker carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel, reportedly for the American military, was struck while anchored offshore on Monday morning by the Solong, a cargo ship sailing under a Portuguese flag.

The crews abandoned their vessels and all but one of 37 were saved as nearby ships and coast guard scrambled to the scene. One crew member from the Solong is missing and is presumed dead.

How bad is the damage?

Firefighters gained control of a fire on the Stena Immaculate on Tuesday, while the Solong remained ablaze. In a statement to parliament, Under-Secretary of State for Transport Michael Kane said it was “unlikely” the Solong will remain afloat.

What caused the crash?

Investigators are now working to discover how the collision occurred.

Kane, the junior transport minister, said there was no evidence to suggest foul play, even though enquiries into the cause of the crash have only just begun.

The Stena was anchored at the time of the collision, leading to questions as to whether the tanker was incorrectly moored in a shipping lane or whether the cargo ship had been on the wrong course, said David Slater, a professor with the school of engineering at Cardiff University.

But the government gave no initial assessment. “Something did go terribly wrong,” Kane said.

The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed to POLITICO that investigators will be arriving in Britain “to conduct the investigation over the coming days.”

Humberside Police announced on Tuesday they had arrested a 59-year-old man “on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.” Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson said: “The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst inquiries are under way and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”

What’s the impact?

The destruction of the Stena disrupts a key U.S. military refueling plan at a time of heightened global tensions. The Stena was one of 10 tankers in the Tanker Security Program, a fleet designed to provide a back-up fuel supply to U.S. defense forces in times of emergency.

What’s the pollution risk?

Authorities said it was too early to say whether the collision could cause a major environmental disaster. The northeastern coastline of England houses marine protected areas, important fisheries and seabird colonies.

What’s the current situation?

Kane, the U.K. minister, said the priority was to extinguish the fires on the vessels involved. On Tuesday the burning Solong had broken free of the anchored Stena and was drifting. Two tugboats were alongside the stricken ship, ensuring it moved no closer to shore.

Once the situation is stabilized, Kane said, the authorities will assess the risks. “Counter-pollution measures and assets are already in place, and both vessels are being closely monitored for structural integrity,” he said.

How dangerous is the fuel on the tanker?

Experts said the jet fuel on board the Stena was extremely toxic to marine life and highly volatile, meaning its lifespan in the environment would be shorter than heavier forms of oil such as crude. Anti-pollution crews will use foam to mop the oil from the sea.

Jet fuel “has minimal environmental impacts when it leaks, because it will either ignite and burn, or evaporate,” said Andy Teasdale, a marine safety advisor to the Institute of Marine Science, Engineering and Technology.

However, jet fuel is “50 times more toxic to aquatic life than diesel oil, which in turn is more toxic than crude oil,” said Alastair Grant, emeritus professor of ecology at the University of East Anglia.

This means that “it will have an acute effect on organisms in the immediate aftermath of the spill and [will] lead to various degrees of stress in exposed animals,” said Heriot-Watt University marine ecotoxicologist Mark Hartl.

Moreover, Teasdale said, it was still unknown what fuel both ships were carrying to power their own engines. “If the vessel sinks or tanks are breached, then the bunkered fuel may leak out and start to produce pollution,” he said.

What was the cargo ship carrying?

Kane said the government had yet to confirm reports that the Solong was carrying 15 containers of highly toxic sodium cyanide. The German owner of the Solong, Ernst Russ AG, said the containers had been emptied.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/11/GettyImages-2204552887-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-03-11 16:50:32.315318

What is this report?

The EU SAF mandate (ReFuel EU Aviation) requires the EASA to publish a technical report each year containing, amongst other things, information on SAF prices in Europe, and the development of European SAF capacity. The report published last week is not the full technical report required by ReFuel EU Aviation; that will be published in September. Instead, this is rather a pre-publication. Importantly, however, the price information in the 2024 reference report will not differ to the full technical report. While seemingly rather dry and innocuous, this report and its successors appear set to create shock waves through the European aviation sector. The price information cited will be used to set penalties for failing to meet the SAF targets under the EU SAF mandate, which in turn will play a pivotal role in determining SAF prices under the legislation.

Back up: What is the ReFuel EU Aviation mandate, and how does it work?

Enacted in 2023, ReFuelEU Aviation sets mandates (% targets) for SAF and synthetic SAF (eSAF)[1] starting from 2025 extending out to 2050 (see Figure 1) on aviation fuel suppliers supplying fuel to any airport in the EU. Airports are obligated to facilitate the access to SAF/eSAF, and airlines have reporting obligations. There are provisions that aim to prevent circumvention of the mandate by “tankering” aircraft outside the EU. Failure to comply with targets in any one year, will incur a penalty of twice the price difference between the SAF or eSAF and conventional jet for the shortfall in volumes. This shortfall in volume also carries over into the following year.

Figure 1: ReFuelEU Aviation Targets and Estimated VolumesSources: EU’s impact assessment (European Commission Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport) and Study supporting the impact assessment of the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

The funds EU member states raise from the penalties are meant to be used to support the further deployment of SAF, including SAF research and development as well as eSAF production and price bridging mechanisms. However, details on this are yet to emerge.

ReFuelEU Aviation runs parallel to the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III, the EU’s overarching biofuel regulation, with SAF volumes qualifying under both. ReFuel EU requires SAF to be produced from advanced (i.e., Annex 9) feedstocks, so SAF produced from food-based crops would not qualify, but unlike the RED III it makes no distinction between Part A or Part B feedstocks[2].

What do the prices in the 2024 reference report reveal?

Table 1 below summarizes the main prices. These data reveal that HEFA SAF, the SAF technology commercially available today, is still pricing at a significant premium (2.7x) to conventional jet. These premiums, on a cost basis, increase significantly when you consider future SAF technologies (e.g., advanced SAF (3.6x jet) and eSAF (10.1x jet). While expectations would be that costs, hence price, would come down as these technologies commercialize and scale, it does underline the challenge of the cost hurdles that are still to be addressed.

Table 1: EASA Summary 2024 Aviation Fuel Reference Prices[3]

In terms of cost penalties for aviation fuel suppliers, and by extension airlines assuming any such cost is transferred along the value chain, this indicates that failing to fulfill the 2025 SAF target would incur a penalty of $8.24 per gallon of shortfall (double the price delta between HEFA SAF and Conventional Aviation Fuel). If there was an eSAF mandate in place in 2025, and using the current cost estimates, the penalty would increase to a staggering $34.78 per gallon.

All other things being equal, obligated fuel suppliers would therefore be willing to pay up to jet plus these penalties for qualifying volumes to avoid such penalties. This suggests max willingness to pay price levels of ~$10.60 per gallon for HEFA SAF, and ~$37.10 per gallon for eSAF (assuming an eSAF target was in place for 2025).

What about future compliance costs?

Using the SAF/eSAF projections, it is also possible (with suitable caveats) to project the possible cost of the EU SAF mandate assuming the 2024 reference prices and associated penalties considering two scenarios:

A 100% compliance scenario, considering only the incremental price/cost premiums, and

A scenario considering 100% compliance to the SAF target but zero compliance with the eSAF targets.

Figure 2 shows the trajectory of these two scenarios, and where the EU lands by 2035.

Figure 2: Projected EU SAF Mandate CostsSources: EASA 2024 Reference Price Report, EU’s impact assessment (European Commission Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport), Study supporting the impact assessment of the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, and Stillwater analysis.

As shown in the figure, the impact of the EU SAF mandate really kicks in from 2030 onwards in terms of the overall cost of the program and the cost implications for jet. This is due to the increase in the SAF target to 6% and the start of the eSAF mandate.

Assuming full compliance, and prices/costs remaining at 2024 levels, while the overall cost and associated per-gallon premiums remain modest at $1.3 billion and 8 cents per gallon (cpg) cost premium out to 2029, in 2030 the full incremental cost of the program jumps to ~$8 billion and adds ~50 cpg or ~20% to the price of jet. Assuming the same price basis, this would increase by up to ~$30 billion, adding $1.90 per gallon (a >80% increase to the price of jet) in 2035!

In the scenario where the eSAF targets are not met, and the 2x penalties kick-in, the overall cost in 2030 is ~$12 billion, jumping to $47 billion by 2035, with associated cost premiums of 0.76 cpg (33% increase) and $2.98 per gallon (127% increase) respectively! Moreover, this does not consider the cost of meeting the deficit volumes carried over to the following year. Given that fuel typically represents 20-40% of an airliners total operating costs, this level of penalty, if passed on in full to the airlines, would be significant and have potential implications for the cost of air travel.

So what?

The obvious caveat here is that no cost reduction assumptions for SAF and eSAF have been made, nor for that matter a price increase in conventional jet. By way of example, the EU impact assessment assumed by 2035 HEFA SAF pricing below jet parity, and eSAF pricing at 2.2x jet – both significant reductions from current levels. However, this relatively simplistic analysis does point to a number of conclusions:

The level of these penalties is sufficient to make obligated fuel suppliers highly motivated to comply with the SAF target first and take any shortfall within the RED III, or the EU’s marine fuel mandate.[4]

The EU will become a price setter for SAF globally and seek to arbitrage SAF volumes into Europe to ensure compliance.

The EU is likely to price out the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, 45Z tax credit, and other low carbon fuel program incentives, to draw such material away, but in so doing is likely to cause upward price pressure to those competing markets’ credit prices.

The ambitious nature of the EU SAF targets, and the associated penalty mechanisms are predicated on significant cost reductions being delivered most notably for eSAF. If these are not delivered, it is likely that the targets and/or penalties are at risk of downward revision.

Conclusion

Ultimately, Europe is shaping up to become the major hub for SAF and eSAF globally over the next 5-10 years. SAF producers, irrespective of their global location, would be well served in developing and maintaining a close understanding of that market as it develops.",https://stillwaterassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fig1_20250311.png,N,,2025-03-11 21:51:14.469900

While SAF alone cannot eliminate emissions from air travel, it represents a viable alternative and a crucial step toward reducing aviation’s environmental impact. Made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, SAF can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The pair are part of a larger drive towards getting SAF to become widely available, achieving economies of scale and cost reductions that would make it commercially viable.

Uncertainty’s immediate impact

The lack of clarity has already had an impact – CVR Energy Inc said that it has stopped production of SAF while waiting for confirmation on whether federal tax credits will be available. The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit – perhaps the most crucial mechanism that was created with Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – is now in limbo.

As it stands SAF is the only scalable option for carbon abatement of ~75% of jet fuel emissions. Its production methods include feedstocks such as crops (soybeans, corn), fats, oils, greases, and even synthetic sources like captured carbon and clean hydrogen. To be considered as reducing emissions SAF must meet stringent reduction standards, requiring at least 50% lower emissions than conventional jet fuel across its lifecycle.

The U.S. was on track to produce 30 million gallons of SAF in 2024, double the previous year’s output and projections estimate production reaching nearly two billion gallons annually by 2030.

Gevo shared they are in discussion with the DOE for their second tranche and Montana Renewables has stated it expects its funds to arrive later this year.

But the mood in the department might be shifting.

In a recent objection to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommendation the DOE said it would hurt U.S. farmers and used brackets for the word sustainable when mentioning SAF. Combined with the twists and turns of U.S. tariffs on Canadian agriculture, we are seeing more uncertainty added to what was already a complicated pathway towards liftoff.

The (current) best-case scenario for sustainable aviation fuel

The road to making SAF work was already a challenging one. In a recent report the DOE, called “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff” provided a blueprint for how things might work after engaging with hundreds of industry stakeholders.

Speaking with Carbon Herald in December 2024, Dr. Vanessa Chan, the now former DOE Chief Commercialization Officer, said that “for every $1 invested by the DOE, the private sector contributes an additional $6,” showing how a government-enabled, private-sector-led model can work.

But to reach this ratio a critical threshold of 8 to 12 active commercial-scale facilities was needed by 2030, then SAF in the U.S. could

The other necessary component is long-term offtake agreements. Most SAF contracts currently span one to two years, but the industry needs more 10+-year agreements to provide demand certainty and attract investment.

Dr. Chan emphasises this. “If you don’t have the offtake agreements, then you can’t do it because no one’s buying it. It’s really, really critical. If there’s a way to get over 10-year offtake agreements, then there’s a way to get supply chains standing up.”

There are already successful examples of this with Brookfield’s investment in Infinium contingent on securing offtake agreements from American Airlines and Citi and facilitated by Breakthrough Energy.

Similarly, Twelve secured a long-term order book by brokering a three-way agreement with Alaska Airlines and Microsoft.

The final piece of the puzzle outlined in the report are policy networks – federal, state, and international policies that offer long-term incentives and both supply- and demand-side support.

In the U.S. the level of uncertainty for this has increased and even though several states like California, Illinois and Washington have clean fuel incentives, it remains unclear whether it will be enough to bolster efforts in the next four years.

One final thing Dr. Chan pointed out is an overlooked connection between SAF and carbon markets. “People often talk about SAF from a per gallon basis. We would love if people to refer to it on a per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions basis. If we do that, it actually enables the carbon markets. And if you do that, then you can actually have SAF be cost competitive with DAC and other high quality offsets.”

Boston Consulting Sees Demand Surge (with caveats)

A February report from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) describes the current state of affairs by saying “…rapid SAF capacity expansion has led to an overcapacity slump in 2024, suppressing prices and margins. We anticipate that demand will surpass capacity toward the end of the decade, restoring margins to reinvestment levels.”

But when it comes to the short and mid-term things are looking much better with the consultancy seeing SAF demand outstripping supply. Its 2030 forecast sets expected demand at 10 MTPA while the supply expected to be provided by already operational and projects that have broken ground at 9 MTPA.

The report continues by seeing increased demand in the long-term with a projected figure of 12% of global aviation energy demand by 2050. To put this in context, SAF provided only 0.3% of fuel production in 2023.

But even in the report itself BCG says the variables are too uncertain after 2030. Partially echoing the DOE report the consultancy identifies political uncertainty in both the U.S. and Asia as factors creating uncertainty but does point towards EU mandates that will begin in 2025 as the pillar of long-term demand growth.

EU rules to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel use

Those mandates constitute perhaps the strongest demand signal and political will. Even though the block has weakened some of its environmental momentum in the face of political opposition and accusations of deindustralization to the point of losing competitive advantage, the EU can’t be blamed for not following through.

Through its RefuelEU Aviation Regulation the block has set a 2% SAF target for airport fuel suppliers in 2025 and 6% in 2030. That year marks a substantial jump with the target increasing to 20% and gradually reaching its next milestone – 40% in 2040 and 70% by 2050.

To support this a 2023 revision of the EU ETS Directive set aside 20 million allowances with an estimated value of $1.73 billion (€1.6 billion) between 2024 and 2030.

Maintaining momentum in early February the EU Comission drafted rules and submitted them to the Parliament and Council of the block for review and formal adoption.

This backdrop has fueled progress in SAF production in Europe with the largest plant in the world being constructed in Rotterdam. The facility has a $1.63 billion (€1.5 billion) budget and is set to have a a production capacity of more than 250,000 of fuel annually.

ICAO efforts experiencing turbulence

Recently the The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched a platform to connect SAF developers with potential investors. Dubbed the ICAO Finvest Hub, it will also have a focus on LCAF and other aviation cleaner energy sources.

Though officially announced the initiative seems in a pre-launch phase, with only a presentation available, as well as an email (finvest@icao.int) for those interested in participating. Despite this state-level efforts seem to have generated the initial momentum needed for liftoff.

The United States is still seen as a driving force in the effort to increase SAF production but in statement from early March the DOE objected to an ICAO recommendation for mutli-cropping for sustainable fuels.

According to the DOE this would harm U.S. farmers while giving an automatic advantage to Brazil where over the rest of the world.

ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protecction (CAEP) did adopt the recommendation but some in the industry are left wondering whether it will be fully applied in the U.S. Though not a parting of ways this could signal a significant shift in Washington’s policy under the new administration which is reviewing every international effort the country is involved in.

What’s next for sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel stands at a critical juncture. In the U.S., projects like Montana Renewables and Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 signal strong federal and private investment, yet uncertainty around tax credits and policy shifts could hinder momentum.

Confidence and certainty is currently provided by Europe and the UK, both leading with ambitious mandates and reinforcing demand through regulations. ICAO’s recent financing initiative underscores a growing recognition of SAF’s role on the global level but if the U.S. doesn’t provide its usual level of involvement, and/or decides to act in a protectionist way, then international efforts could falter.

Ultimately, SAF’s future depends on stable policy frameworks and investment confidence. If these align, the industry could scale rapidly—potentially supplying 12% of global aviation fuel by 2050. If not, growth may stall, delaying or even derailing aviation’s decarbonization.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/abed-ismail-AVZmhL0ClIQ-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 14:58:10.847980

Unlike conventional direct air capture (DAC) methods, which pull carbon from the atmosphere, Pure Carbon Blue targets water, where CO2 is more highly concentrated.

According to founder and CEO Marc Goedkoop, the company captures carbon from water to create carbon-neutral feedstock for producers of sustainable food, fuels and materials. Goedkoop sees this novel approach as a promising avenue to contribute to aviation's challenging journey toward net-zero emissions targets.

The technology leverages the fact that carbon concentration in water is over 100 times higher than in air. Speaking to Sustainability in the Air, Goedkoop noted that ""Water continuously regains its capacity to draw CO2 from the atmosphere to find its new equilibrium. So indirectly it also cleans the air.""

The process works in two stages: first, it extracts the CO2 gas from water, then purifies it by removing nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace elements. This purified carbon can then be transferred directly to nearby industrial producers or secure storage facilities.

Since developing its initial tabletop model in 2021, Pure Carbon Blue has set about proving the technology. Goedkoop says that the first pilot installation, successfully tested in Dutch canals under varying seasonal conditions, is at Technology Readiness Level 5.

Cost and efficiency factors

Pure Carbon Blue estimates its costs at between $100-250 per ton of captured carbon, making it potentially more economical than traditional DAC methods where CO2 costs can be as much as 5x that.

Goedkoop emphasizes that direct water capture has a cost advantage due to the higher concentration of CO2 in water compared to air, while also requiring less land.

He further highlights the technology's simplicity and versatility of deployment, noting that all that's needed is a body of water, renewable energy, and a small space for the system. This ease of deployment supports scalability and cost-efficiency, enabling installations worldwide in diverse environmental conditions.

For aviation specifically, Goedkoop identifies two key opportunities:

Providing bio-carbon feedstock crucial for producing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF),

Offering carbon offsetting mechanisms that, according to several airline net zero plans, could comprise up to 10% of airlines' decarbonisation roadmaps alongside DAC.

This initiative aligns with the EU's mandate for synthetic SAF adoption, set at a minimum of 1.2% by 2030. ""If we truly want to meet net zero in 2050,"" Goedkoop noted, ""then we need to start building capacity, make it available.""

As a result, he envisions a future where passengers and freight forwarders can select airlines based on their sustainability credentials, with Pure Carbon Blue potentially becoming a reliable supplier of bio-carbon feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Market strategy and scaling

Pure Carbon Blue is pursuing multiple sectors simultaneously – including food production, fuels, specialty chemicals, and permanent storage – to manage risk and accelerate growth.

Goedkoop acknowledges uncertainty about which markets will develop fastest, emphasising the need to engage with quick-moving sectors to generate revenue and build capacity.

Their ambitious target is to establish 1 gigaton of bio-carbon capture capacity globally by 2030.

Achieving this goal hinges on forming robust global partnerships. ""Upon success, we intend to roll it out in collaboration with partners throughout the world,"" Goedkoop stated.

The future

Looking ahead, Goedkoop hopes that by 2030, carbon removal will be considered a normal business practice rather than a voluntary market activity.

""I hope that in 2030 we'll consider carbon removal as normal and that we don't need to speak any longer about a voluntary market.”

Meanwhile, as aviation continues its challenging journey toward decarbonisation, Pure Carbon Blue's water-based carbon capture method not only provides critical sustainable fuel feedstock but also offers a crucial component in addressing aviation's complex carbon emissions challenge, in offering carbon removal.

Pure Carbon Blue is only the latest in a series of innovative Dutch water-carbon capture companies. This growing cluster highlights the country's emerging leadership in water-based carbon capture technologies.

In January, we highlighted the 'blue economy' as one of the sectors we'd be watching in 2025. Pure Carbon Blue joins others like Sea02 and Brineworks (see our profile) in leveraging the Netherlands' abundant water resources to pioneer climate solutions.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F625a760f-8bc7-45ed-a489-88bc346a50af_1200x627.png",N,,2025-03-11 19:51:58.721248

“I think SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) is the future,” Kirby said at the CERAWeek conference hosted by S&P Global in Houston.
United is currently using SAF made from cooking oil blended with traditional jet fuel to supply some aircraft at Chicago O’Hare and Los Angeles international airports.
Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of Deerfield-based LanzaJet, which is commercializing ethanol-to-jet fuel technology, estimates there is unused capacity among U.S. ethanol refiners of about 2 billion gallons a year.
“How do you create an ethanol that is 50% better on a lifecycle basis than fossil (jet fuel)?”","Renewable blends make up less than 1% of jet fuel used today.

“I think SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) is the future,” Kirby said at the CERAWeek conference hosted by S&P Global in Houston.

The aviation industry wants to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. United has a goal to cut emissions 50% by 2035.

The important question is: “Do you have a viable feedstock that you have a legitimate path to produce it in a cost-competitive way?” Kirby said.

United is currently using SAF made from cooking oil blended with traditional jet fuel to supply some aircraft at Chicago O’Hare and Los Angeles international airports.

“There are whole bunch of ideas. None of them is there yet,” Kirby said. “I hope in next few years we can say we have a path. One that I think that’s going to happen that’s the most straight-forward is: Much of the infrastructure for refineries in the Midwest that’s producing renewable diesel and ethanol today from crops is going to be repurposed for renewable jet fuel.”

The continued transition toward electric vehicles will reduce demand for ethanol-blended gasoline, making aviation fuel an attractive market.

“In the long run, SAF is probably going to be the only way for the U.S. ethanol industry to maintain its current size,” said Scott Irwin, an agriculture economist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, although he says it won’t be a quick transition.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of Deerfield-based LanzaJet, which is commercializing ethanol-to-jet fuel technology, estimates there is unused capacity among U.S. ethanol refiners of about 2 billion gallons a year.

Pivoting existing ethanol production resources is more than a technical challenge.

“Could it happen? Sure,” said Jim Watson, Illinois executive director for the American Petroleum Institute. ""I don’t think it’s going to happen until the incentives are there.""

Illinois, which is a major ethanol player thanks to its farmers and companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, already has made moves to capitalize on its position. The state offers incentives that effectively double a federal tax break of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF, which encouraged United and Southwest airlines to start programs here.

The Trump administration intends to pause funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains the SAF credit. Kirby, however, is optimistic.

“This is one area I think has support on both sides of the aisle,” he said. “It’s possible everything in the IRA just gets thrown out. I think SAF is likely to be protected, but we need the right kind of incentive from the government to drive investment.”

Strict rules on the federal SAF tax credit, which focuses on the energy used in production as well as the energy saved by replacing fossil fuel, is a stumbling block for corn ethanol producers, Samartzis said. “How do you create an ethanol that is 50% better on a lifecycle basis than fossil (jet fuel)?”",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/399208722.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 14:58:19.190048

Welcome to the Check 6 Podcast. I'm Joe Anselmo, editorial director for the Aviation Week Network. The moment was historic and the times requested bold steps as the COVID-19 pandemic slowly began to subside. The world's battered aviation industry convened in Boston in the fall of 2021 for the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting. And bold the airlines were, committing to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Now less than four years later, IATA appears to be throwing in the towel. IATA Director General Willie Walsh, speaking at an industry event in Phoenix, expressed strong doubts airlines could meet their emissions goals in the next 25 years. So is the industry abandoning its bold push to become sustainable following recent moves made in other industries, or is it just acknowledging a reality that its emissions timeline was too ambitious from the start? Aviation Week Executive Editor, Jens Flottau, attended Walsh's speech and joins us on Check 6. Also with us are Senior Propulsion Editor Guy Norris and Air Transport Editor Christine Boynton, who closely tracks US airlines. Jens, take it away. What did Willie Walsh say, and why was it so momentous?

Jens Flottau (01:23):

Well, it was momentous because it was the first time that he admitted that he believes the airlines will not make 2050. It was astounding, astonishing that he did admit it, I found, and where he admitted it. So this was the ISTAT Americas event, Phoenix, Arizona. It's the gathering of the financing community, lessors, banks, funds, and so on. So it's not the typical stage for someone, for an airline executive, to show up and give such a message. So I was wondering why he did it there. We can probably talk about that later. So what he said was, ""We're going to have to revisit the net-zero target. We're not making as strong progress on sustainable aviation fuels as we thought. There will be a reevaluation."" So he kind of stopped short of saying, ""Forget it,"" but he hinted at it, and I believe that he did it now to prepare the groundwork for the IATA General Assembly, which is happening in June in Delhi, where the airlines will have to talk more about that.

Joe Anselmo (02:42):

Okay. You and I both agree this is momentous, but neither of us was surprised, nor were our colleagues. I mean, we have been saying for quite some time that there was no real clear path to getting to net zero for the industry. I mean, SAF was a huge part of it, and SAF is just not getting out of the barn.

Jens Flottau (03:00):

It's true. It's not a surprise to anyone who's been following this. I do think it's still a surprise that he said it at this time, in a way. After all, yes, it's unlikely, but it's also 25 years before we get to 2050. And to make that statement now says something. The concern I have is not that it's unrealistic or it's not true or anything. There's good reasons to say it, but when you say it, my concern is that you're taking pressure off the industry to continue because if Walsh comes out and says, ""Basically, we're not going to make it,"" everyone steps back. It's kind of... we've heard this in other industries in the recent weeks. We've heard this from Airbus on the hydrogen project, which is being delayed. It just seems like, since sustainability has been moved off the agenda, or at least off the top of the agenda in many countries, including the U.S., people think that now they can say things that they wouldn’t have dared saying only a few weeks ago.

Joe Anselmo (04:14):

I think what you're saying is there is a political backdrop here. I mean, 2021, the Biden administration was just past this new green deal, and European governments were mandating that industries get green. The airline industry had to do something. That's not the political case anymore. The Trump administration is much more skeptical of sustainability pushes, mandates, whatever you call them.

Jens Flottau (04:41):

Yeah, it is no longer the case, but unfortunately, it also meets with a reality where the SAF production increases are just not happening at the pace that they have to have. I mean, SAF production has doubled last year. It's going to almost double again this year, but that's still a tiny fraction of overall demand. So what Walsh said is, in a way, just a reflection of what's happening.

Joe Anselmo (05:15):

Christine Boynton, you cover airlines on a daily basis. Are we being too harsh? I mean, airlines are still saying they're committed to becoming more sustainable, right?

Christine Boynton (05:25):

So far, yes. I think kind of just starting out by echoing one of the things Jens said, even if those targets were overly ambitious, I do think they have spurred some really positive action from airlines because really, without aggressive targets, I think you've run the risk of not getting the kind of innovation that you need. So we have seen some interesting developments from airlines. United, for example, launched the United Airline Venture Sustainable Flight Fund that's looking to fund startups, not only with SAF development, but also new technology. And what's interesting about that one to me is that their corporate partners also include other airlines. So it's kind of bringing together the kind of collaboration we always hear when we're talking about innovative things, ""we need more collaboration, we need more collaboration."" Well, this is, I think, a good example of that. And I did have a chance to touch base with the Big Four US airlines after Willie Walsh's remarks, and no news from any of them on changing their targets. Yet Delta says it remains committed to its path to net zero by 2050. Southwest doesn’t have any changes to its goals to report. American's remains in place. United has no news on that at this moment. But I will note that this fall, American CEO Robert Isom did also raise separately his own concerns about industry progress not moving fast enough. He touched on needing supportive policies and investments and so forth. So, I mean, that's where we are now.

Joe Anselmo (06:57):

Guy Norris, aircraft manufacturers have to play a role in this too. I mean, you can't get to net zero without new airplanes that pollute a lot less, and Boeing and Airbus certainly are in no rush to move beyond their current models.

Guy Norris (07:10):

Well, that's true, Joe, but you sort of recall that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has actually... so we are looking at the situation, it's sort of a carrot-and-stick type of situation in a way. You have ICAO trying to set as many guidelines and rulings really to help in this sustainable process as possible. And at the same time, obviously, they're trying to protect the industry which it serves. But one of the issues is that they've actually mandated Boeing, two aircraft that Boeing has been producing will come to an end at the end of 2026 into 2027. They'll not be allowed to deliver the current 767 freighter and the 777 freighter as they currently build them under this new ICAO-led legislation on emissions. So they are doing something. But what's really interesting is that literally at the same time that Willie Walsh was talking about IATA’s gloomy view at ISTAT, ICAO was busy issuing kind of an update on the meeting of the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, or CAPE, as they're more familiarly known.

(08:32):

And it's interesting because the timing is just classic. It's CAPE really that's driving so much of this attempt to get to 2050 net zero. But what they've realized is that although they've put the rules out there, they haven't actually got any sort of teeth behind it or really any commitments into concrete action. So what this CAPE, the latest meeting, CAPE 13, it only took place a couple of weeks ago, and it generated 31 recommendations which cover the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions against ICAO’s long-term global goal, more stringent aircraft noise and emission standards for CO2, and it also apparently made progress on non-CO2 emissions, climate adaptation, fuels, and even CORSIA, which for our listeners may know that ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. So they're really seeing this as a pivotal time. I think they see that the whole inertia is slowing down the momentum towards 2050, and they're really trying to get ahead of that to try and say, ""Look, we can get some environmental commitments and convert these into concrete action."" And I'll finish there, but one of the last things is they haven't yet actually issued what these new standards are, what these new limits are. We won't know that yet really, and in fact, they won't even vote on this until the next ICAO meeting in October. But I think by then we're probably going to get a little view on a bit more detail into what these targets are.

Jens Flottau (10:13):

I just want to add something here. Walsh saying we're not going to make it is setting the airline industry up for conflict with a lot of governments. Actually, first and foremost, the European Union. Don't forget, there are mandates in place in Europe, one for 2030, one for 2040, and so on, and that's steeply rising for SAF quotas. They are not changing. They're still there in spite of what the airline industry wants. So it's going to be interesting to see that debate evolve. And as much as the airline industry and IATA are complaining about the European Union regulating and dumping burdensome regulations on the airline industry in the form of mandates, it's important to know that it's not only Europe. There are a lot of SAF mandates elsewhere, including in Asia, where growth is very fast and where people like Walsh like to point to the amazing growth in India, the amazing growth in China. Don’t forget, there’s a mandate in Singapore. There's a mandate in Australia and New Zealand and so on, and it's not just Europe. So there is going to be a global debate about this. And just because the airlines say we're not making it doesn't mean that they're not going to be forced to action by governments if they uphold their current positions.

Guy Norris (11:33):

And just to follow on to that, I know that Joe, you mentioned how SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels) are really the bulk of this immediacy. That's the big problem. I know Jens had reported that SAF production reached only 1 million tons in 2024, although that was double what had been achieved the year before. It's still only about 0.3% of jet fuel demand and nowhere near what's going to be needed. And so one of the key things that ICAO is saying in this CAPE report is it's the committee’s work that they've done on SAF will accelerate, they think, the certification of new sustainable fuel pathways, so new ways of creating SAF, which they say will be critical for getting towards the aviation goal of 5% CO2 emissions reduction through cleaner energies, but just by 2030. So they're not throwing the towel in on the 2050 target yet, but they're certainly at least saying if we follow this stepwise progression, there is still a chance that we can make a big impact.

Jens Flottau (12:48):

I find it almost a bit hypocritical to say we're not going to make it at this point. If you look at, and this is not the airlines I admit, but these are the manufacturers. If at the same time everyone keeps pushing everything out, yes, of course, you're not going to make it if you're not developing new aircraft, if you're slowing down the development of new engine technology, if there's just one startup, JetZero, trying to do something really innovative in the 2030s. Just a few years ago, two years ago actually, we were talking about Airbus launching a new narrowbody in 2027, 2028, or 2029. No one talks about that anymore. Entry into service was supposed to be mid-2030s. No one talks about that. Now it’s 2040. At the ISTAT Americas conference, one of the interesting comments I heard was that people believe that soon the sources will place orders for current generation aircraft, so NEOs or MAXes, for delivery in 2040. So we're extending the status quo—not forever, of course, but for a very, very long time. And if you're doing that, yes, of course you're not going to make the 2050 carbon target because those aircraft that are going to be delivered in 2040 will fly until 2065 or 2070. So the industry is really in a bad place and partly in a self-inflicted position that will cause some serious debates with governments, and rightly so.

Joe Anselmo (14:20):

Guy, Walsh threw out some timelines there. We were talking about 2050, and he mentioned 2040. When I was at the Farnborough Airshow last year, a guy from Boeing gave me an earful because I was criticizing Boeing and Airbus for not moving quickly enough. He said the technology just isn't ready to make game-changing improvements in efficiency. How long is it going to take to make some big step-change improvements in propulsion, aerodynamics, and other efficiencies?

Guy Norris (14:51):

Yeah. Well, and I was going to say, I mean, Jens mentioned JetZero there. I think you've got to look at this problem in two ways. One is you can bundle together technology that's almost available now and still take a big bite out of this problem. But the other way of doing it, and again to Jens’s point, is flying with current technology aircraft like the LEAP-powered 737 MAX or the GTF or LEAP-powered A320neo family. You can make a big difference there as long as you're fueling it with SAF or at least looking at that as a starting point. So it's not all doom and gloom. But I do agree, and to your point, Joe, the fact is technology still takes a long time to advance into everyday service. And what JetZero, for example, is doing is taking the biggest stride by embracing the blended wing body, which is inherently potentially more efficient because it produces lift from where the fuselage meets the wings. Immediately, you get that benefit, and so on and so forth. So I do think that their plan to really roll into service in the 2030s with a commercial model could be an inspiration. And I think with a combination of mass production of the modern generation with SAF-fueled engines and a few innovations that we're seeing in other areas, like blended wing bodies, you could begin to chip away at this problem. But I think it's going to take a lot more than that. And there’s a big cliff-edge coming.

Joe Anselmo (16:32):

And you mentioned JetZero. For our listeners, JetZero is a blended wing body prototype that would be a dual-purpose airplane, serving as a military tanker or a passenger aircraft. The company has US Air Force funding to go develop a prototype of that, which is set to fly in 2027.

Guy Norris (16:50):

Correct. Yeah, that’s the target right now.

Joe Anselmo (16:52):

Okay. Christine, we're almost out of time, but I want to come back around to airlines. You said airlines haven’t given up on getting more efficient and on their pledge to be greener. What specifically are some of the airlines doing?

Christine Boynton (17:06):

Sure. Well, I mentioned the United Airlines Venture Sustainable Fund earlier. They’re making investments in technology and looking to fund startup technology. They're doing things like reducing the weight on the aircraft in different ways. Southwest has done an interesting investment in the last, I would say, year or so. They've invested in corn stover-to-ethanol technology, and the construction of a first-of-its-kind plant, which is backed by Southwest, has begun in Kansas. The production there is expected to start at the end of the year. What that does is process corn stover, which is basically what’s left behind after corn is harvested—the leaves, stalks, cobs, husks. It’s expected to be able to process about 10 tons per day of corn stover, which would then be turned into SAF once converted into ethanol. So I think, again, with aggressive targets comes aggressive actions. I hope airlines don't lose momentum from here, from what they've achieved so far.

Joe Anselmo (18:09):

But don't you agree with Jens’s point that by Willie Walsh saying that, he's taking a little bit of pressure off the airlines?

Christine Boynton (18:16):

Yeah, absolutely. So I just hope that they have the foresight and thinking far enough ahead not to back down on the momentum that they've achieved so far, because this could really set us back.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-03-11 13:50:42.161767

Key Market Drivers

Rebound in Air Travel Demand Post-Pandemic

The resurgence in air travel demand following the COVID-19 pandemic has become a primary driver for the growth of the North America Aviation Fuel Market. As travel restrictions ease and vaccination rates increase, airlines are seeing a surge in passenger numbers, contributing to a higher demand for aviation fuel. In particular, domestic travel within North America has bounced back rapidly, with international travel gradually following suit as more countries open their borders. The increased number of flights, along with the global desire to resume business travel and leisure tourism, directly correlates with the need for more aviation fuel.

Commercial aviation is poised for continued recovery, leading to an increased consumption of fuel for both short-haul and long-haul flights. Additionally, the rise in demand for cargo services has played a pivotal role in fueling growth, as air cargo transportation surged with the rise of e-commerce. This growth in both passenger and cargo sectors is expected to continue as economies recover, driving demand for aviation fuel. The number of domestic passengers in the United States alone in 2022 reached over 700 million, a near full recovery to pre-pandemic levels.

Technological Innovations in Fuel Efficiency

Technological advancements in fuel efficiency are another significant driver of the North America Aviation Fuel Market. As airlines and aircraft manufacturers increasingly focus on reducing fuel consumption, new technologies are being integrated into aircraft designs and operations to optimize fuel efficiency. Innovations such as lighter materials, advanced aerodynamics, more fuel-efficient engines, and flight optimization systems are helping airlines lower their fuel consumption per mile flown. Additionally, aircraft maintenance technologies are improving, which enables engines to perform at higher efficiencies and ensures longer operational lifespans, further reducing fuel needs.

Airlines are adopting better operational practices, such as more precise flight routing, reduced taxiing times, and optimized altitude levels, which collectively reduce the amount of aviation fuel required for a flight. These technological innovations not only improve operational cost-efficiency but also help airlines meet environmental and regulatory standards concerning emissions. As these technologies become more widespread and their benefits more apparent, airlines will continue to implement them, fueling the demand for aviation fuel while simultaneously mitigating overall fuel consumption. Over the past decade, the aviation industry has reduced fuel consumption per passenger by an average of 1.5% annually, translating into billions of gallons saved.

Increasing Military and Defense Aviation Expenditures

The defense and military sector plays a vital role in driving demand for aviation fuel in North America. Increased military spending, particularly in the United States, is directly contributing to the higher consumption of aviation fuel. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is one of the largest consumers of aviation fuel in the world, supporting various military aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters, and transport planes. As geopolitical tensions rise globally and defense budgets increase, the demand for military aviation fuel is expected to continue growing.

The continuous modernization of defense fleets with more advanced, fuel-intensive aircraft also adds to fuel requirements. This growing defense expenditure is not just limited to the United States; Canada and other North American countries are also investing in military aviation, resulting in more demand for aviation fuel. Consequently, this trend will continue to be a key driver in the aviation fuel market as the defense and military sectors maintain their dominance in fuel consumption. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense allocated over USD 700 billion to defense expenditures, with a significant portion earmarked for military aviation operations.

Fleet Modernization and Expansion by Airlines

Fleet modernization and expansion by airlines in North America are accelerating the demand for aviation fuel. Many airlines are replacing older aircraft with newer, more fuel-efficient models, including the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, which consume significantly less fuel than their predecessors. This trend is especially notable as airlines aim to reduce operating costs and improve environmental performance. The newer aircraft models are designed with advanced engines and aerodynamics that enhance fuel efficiency and reduce overall fuel consumption.

In addition to replacing old aircraft, many airlines are expanding their fleets to accommodate the growth in passenger and cargo demand. This expansion includes the purchase of more fuel-efficient jets, which will result in a higher overall fuel demand due to the increased volume of flights. Additionally, the introduction of ultra-long-haul flights that can reach new international destinations will further contribute to an uptick in aviation fuel consumption. As North American carriers continue to invest in fleet expansion and technological upgrades, the demand for aviation fuel will remain on a strong upward trajectory. In 2022, North American airlines were projected to add nearly 500 new aircraft to their fleets, with the majority being fuel-efficient models.

Key Market Challenges

Fluctuating Fuel Prices and Volatility

One of the primary challenges faced by the North America Aviation Fuel Market is the volatility in fuel prices. Aviation fuel is one of the highest operational costs for airlines, and fluctuations in fuel prices can significantly impact profitability. The aviation fuel market is heavily influenced by the price of crude oil, which is inherently volatile due to geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, and changes in global oil demand. The cost of aviation fuel can also be affected by refinery capacities, environmental regulations, and market speculation, leading to unpredictable price swings. For airlines, managing these price fluctuations is a constant challenge, as it can dramatically affect their operating margins. When prices rise unexpectedly, airlines are often forced to pass on the increased cost to customers through higher ticket prices or fuel surcharges, which can reduce demand.

Conversely, when fuel prices fall, airlines may see reduced profit margins as competition drives down ticket prices. The inability to forecast fuel costs accurately makes it difficult for airline operators to develop long-term financial strategies, putting further pressure on their financial stability. The increased cost of aviation fuel can undermine the financial viability of smaller, regional airlines, which may have less flexibility in absorbing higher fuel prices compared to larger carriers with more diversified operations. This volatility, driven by both external global factors and unpredictable market dynamics, remains a significant challenge for the North America Aviation Fuel Market.

Environmental Regulations and Sustainability Pressure

As the global aviation industry comes under increasing scrutiny regarding its environmental impact, the North America Aviation Fuel Market is grappling with growing pressure to comply with stringent environmental regulations. Governments and regulatory bodies are demanding that the aviation industry reduce its carbon footprint and mitigate environmental damage caused by traditional fossil fuels. This pressure is particularly evident in North America, where the United States and Canada have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Aviation, a significant contributor to carbon emissions, is targeted by regulators for having a high environmental impact, primarily due to the combustion of conventional jet fuels. In response to these challenges, the aviation sector is accelerating efforts to transition to cleaner, more sustainable alternatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, the widespread adoption of SAF faces several hurdles, including high production costs, limited availability, and insufficient infrastructure to support large-scale SAF production. SAF, though promising, is not yet a commercially viable substitute for traditional aviation fuel at scale. Furthermore, the complexity of retrofitting airport infrastructure and aircraft fleets to accommodate SAF poses an additional challenge. As a result, while environmental concerns are pushing the market toward more sustainable practices, the transition to low-carbon alternatives remains a slow and costly process. In the short term, the aviation industry must navigate between regulatory pressure, operational costs, and limited availability of cleaner fuel options, which complicates efforts to achieve sustainability targets without disrupting the economic viability of airlines.

Supply Chain Disruptions and Infrastructure Limitations

The North America Aviation Fuel Market faces significant challenges related to supply chain disruptions and infrastructure limitations. The aviation fuel supply chain is highly complex and relies on an integrated system that includes refining, transportation, storage, and distribution networks. However, disruptions in this chain, whether from natural disasters, political instability, or global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, can lead to significant bottlenecks in fuel availability, directly impacting airlines’ operations. For instance, hurricanes or extreme weather events can damage refinery facilities and transport infrastructure, causing delays in the production and delivery of aviation fuel.

Similarly, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions can result in supply chain disruptions, creating instability in fuel availability and pricing. On top of these challenges, the existing infrastructure for aviation fuel in North America is aging and often inadequate to meet the growing demands of modern air travel. With increasing air traffic and fleet expansion, the existing storage and refueling capabilities at many airports are struggling to keep pace. Some airports lack sufficient fuel reserves or access to efficient distribution systems, leading to delays and potential shortages. Additionally, as airlines continue to adopt newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, the demand for high-quality aviation fuel is intensifying, placing additional strain on the infrastructure. The limited capacity of refineries to produce aviation fuel, especially sustainable alternatives like SAF, further exacerbates these issues. As a result, while the aviation industry experiences growth, the constraints imposed by an outdated and sometimes fragile supply chain and infrastructure present ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure the stable and efficient supply of aviation fuel across North America.

Key Market Trends

Increasing Adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

A significant trend in the North America Aviation Fuel Market is the increasing adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon emissions and align with environmental sustainability goals, SAF presents a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation. SAF is produced from renewable sources, such as agricultural waste, algae, or even municipal waste, making it a more sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel derived from crude oil. The adoption of SAF is being driven by both regulatory frameworks and voluntary sustainability targets set by major airlines. In North America, governments are introducing tax incentives, grants, and regulatory mandates to encourage the production and use of SAF.

For instance, the United States has introduced the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the SAF Grand Challenge to stimulate SAF development. Major North American airlines, including United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, have already committed to using SAF in their fleets to reduce their carbon footprint. This trend is expected to accelerate as the aviation industry works to meet net-zero emission targets set for 2050. However, challenges such as high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and the lack of infrastructure for SAF are hurdles that need to be overcome. Despite these obstacles, the market for SAF is expected to grow rapidly, with greater investment in SAF production capacity, technological advancements, and partnerships between airlines, fuel producers, and governments to build a more sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem in North America.

Integration of Digital Technologies and Automation

The integration of digital technologies and automation into the aviation sector is another notable trend affecting the North America Aviation Fuel Market. With advancements in data analytics, machine learning, and automation, the aviation industry is becoming increasingly efficient in managing fuel consumption, logistics, and operations. Airlines and airport operators are leveraging these technologies to enhance fuel management, optimize refueling processes, and minimize fuel wastage. For example, digital systems that track real-time fuel usage, weather patterns, and aircraft performance are now being used to optimize flight routes, reducing unnecessary fuel consumption.

Automated fueling systems are being introduced to streamline airport fueling operations, improving turnaround times and reducing the risk of human error. Automated systems also help in predicting fuel demand more accurately, ensuring that airports maintain optimal fuel reserves and avoid shortages or excess. As the aviation sector embraces a more data-driven approach to operations, it is expected that digital technologies will play an even more prominent role in improving the efficiency of aviation fuel management. The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in aircraft, airports, and refueling infrastructure is also facilitating better monitoring of fuel usage and quality, which in turn drives better operational decision-making. This integration of digital technologies and automation is reshaping the way fuel is managed in the aviation industry, reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact.

Expansion of Air Cargo and Private Aviation Sectors

The expansion of the air cargo and private aviation sectors is a growing trend in the North America Aviation Fuel Market. The global e-commerce boom has significantly increased demand for air cargo services, leading to a rise in the number of cargo flights and, consequently, the need for aviation fuel. As e-commerce giants like Amazon expand their logistics capabilities, the demand for air transport of goods has seen a sustained rise. The rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the distribution of vaccines and other time-sensitive products, has further fueled the demand for air cargo.

In parallel, the private aviation sector has witnessed significant growth, particularly in the post-pandemic era, as individuals and businesses seek safer, more flexible travel options. Private jet usage has increased among high-net-worth individuals, executives, and other clientele who prioritize convenience and safety over traditional commercial airline options. This trend is driving greater consumption of aviation fuel as private jets require specialized fuel types and refueling infrastructure. As these two sectors—air cargo and private aviation—continue to grow, they will become increasingly important drivers of aviation fuel demand in North America. The increasing need for timely deliveries and personalized travel services places upward pressure on fuel consumption, contributing to the expansion of the aviation fuel market as airlines, private operators, and cargo carriers invest in expanding their fleets and improving fuel logistics.

By supporting clients with their carbon reduction goals, fostering an inclusive company culture, and driving investment in areas like SAF, ATPI remains committed to shaping a more responsible travel industry.

Here, three of ATPI’s sustainability leaders outline how ATPI is helping to shape a more sustainable future for corporate travel – one journey at a time.

Pippa Ganderton, ATPI Halo Director

ATPI Halo is built on three pillars: Measure, Reduce, and Compensate. While these principles remain unchanged, the solutions continue to evolve. ATPI now offers advanced emissions reporting, carbon budgeting and traveller engagement tools to drive lower-emission travel choices.

For businesses navigating complex sustainability reporting for audit disclosure, we provide clarity. Many small- to mid-sized companies lack clear ownership over sustainability compliance, often caught between travel, finance and compliance teams. ATPI consolidates all travel emissions data under a single methodology, ensuring consistency and audit readiness.

One of the biggest challenges for businesses is navigating the complexity of sustainability regulations. Our goal is to provide clarity and give clients the confidence to report their travel and events impact accurately.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is another exciting area for ATPI. Through a partnership with Neste, ATPI enables clients to invest in SAF as a direct strategy for reducing aviation emissions, beyond supplier choice and behavioural change. SAF’s scalability makes it a viable solution that some jurisdictions are now mandating.

Businesses voluntarily integrating SAF today are setting the standard for the future. ATPI ensures clients can track and retire SAF investments with auditable ISCC declarations, helping them achieve tangible reductions in their Scope 3 emissions.

Looking ahead, the development of SAF from alternative sources such as lignocellulose and algae will continue to play a crucial role in decarbonising aviation.

Louisa Toure, ATPI Sustainability Officer

ATPI’s sustainability strategy has transformed from a focus on compliance to one of meaningful action. My role is to ensure sustainability is integrated across all areas of the business, aligning long-term goals with practical steps.

At ATPI, we take a pragmatic approach, recognising that businesses must focus on what is truly material to them rather than chasing trends. Sustainability is dynamic. Our strategy is built on strong foundations but remains flexible to adapt to new challenges.

A crucial element of this approach is embedding sustainability into decision-making across departments, ensuring it becomes a tool for problem-solving rather than an administrative burden. By creating a culture where sustainability is instinctive nature, ATPI drives greater impact than isolated initiatives ever could. We ensure that sustainability is not just a policy but a practice embedded into everyday operations.

Rachel Brown, ATPI Global Culture and Talent Lead

Sustainability isn’t just about emissions, it’s about people. In my role, I ensure ATPI’s approach to social sustainability supports our employees and aligns with the company’s overall goals. Historically, social impact projects were managed in isolation, but now, a global HR Community of Practice ensures consistency and collaboration across ATPI’s network.

One standout initiative is ATPI Inspires, where ATPI actively encourages, promotes and facilitates employee participation in volunteering activities within local communities. A collaborative partnership between HR and Sustainability, it emphasises ATPI’s commitment to social responsibility and community engagement.

By working together, both teams can amplify their impact, ensuring social sustainability is more than just an HR function and is a business-wide priority.

I’m also on the senior leadership team and having this seat at the table means that people-focused sustainability is recognised as an integral part of our strategy. It’s not just about compliance, it’s about fostering an inclusive and supportive work environment.

ATPI’s approach is also data-driven. A Global Staff Engagement Survey benchmarks employee wellbeing across all offices, guiding HR strategies and ensuring best practices are replicated companywide.

This Holland & Knight alert provides an initial summary of potential impacts of new tariffs on business aviation generally based on information available to date.","Highlights

Though the 25 percent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian- and Mexican-origin products on March 4, 2025, have the potential to significantly impact business aviation transactions, the U.S. on March 7, 2025, exempted goods qualifying for duty-free treatment under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from those tariffs until April 2, 2025. It appears that most Canadian aircraft and engines would qualify for duty-free treatment under USMCA, but the analysis for parts and components is more complex.

Other tariffs may also affect business aviation, including the new U.S. tariffs on China, aluminum and steel tariffs set to go into effect on March 12, 2025, and counter-tariffs proposed or implemented by Canada, China and Mexico.

U.S. officials have already signaled possible changes to these tariffs that could be implemented quickly, and existing tariff changes have come swiftly with little guidance, other than the presidential orders and short U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) notices. Hence, this is a snapshot as of March 11, 2025, based on preliminary Holland & Knight analysis. It is hoped that CBP will clarify certain provisions in the coming weeks.

The goals of protecting U.S. borders, increasing the U.S. industrial base and leveling the playing field with respect to tariffs in order to help U.S. businesses and enhance the U.S. trade balance are laudable. However, the potential ramifications of broad tariffs on imports in the U.S. aerospace industry are uncertain. The U.S. aerospace sector is a trade success story, as the sector has historically run a large positive trade balance, with export sales vastly outpacing imports. In particular, under the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft (Civil Aircraft Agreement), of which the U.S., Canada and China are signatories, the U.S. civil aviation industry has benefited from essentially zero tariffs on imports of civil aircraft and most civil aviation-related items imported into the U.S. and a number of countries. However, notices from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are clear that the new tariffs apply regardless of certain preferential tariff treatments, including the Civil Aircraft Agreement.

What Tariffs Are in Effect and Proposed?

On March 4, 2025, the U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canadian- and Mexican-origin products (except for Canadian-origin energy products, which are subject to a 10 percent tariff).

On March 4, 2025, the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese-origin products from 10 percent to 20 percent.

On March 7, 2025, the U.S. exempted Canadian- and Mexican-origin products that are eligible for duty-free treatment under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from the 25 percent tariffs, with the Trump Administration indicating such relief would be available until April 2, 2025.

Effective on March 12, 2025, the U.S. will impose a worldwide 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports, as well as on certain products made from steel and aluminum.

On Feb. 13, 2025, the U.S. announced it will implement ""reciprocal"" tariffs on foreign countries that impose tariffs on U.S. products and, through the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), solicited comments from industry participants on such foreign tariffs.

Canada and China have imposed counter-tariffs on certain U.S. exports to those countries. Mexico was expected to announce counter-tariffs prior to the U.S. agreeing to pause tariffs for goods entering under USMCA.

How Do New U.S. Tariffs Affect Routine U.S. Aircraft Operations Among the U.S., Mexico and Canada?

The tariffs should not impact routine flight operations among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, regardless of aircraft manufacturer, country of registration, etc., as the aircraft would be moving as instruments of international trade and not as merchandise being imported into the U.S. for consumption.

What Aircraft Purchase and Sale Transactions Would Trigger U.S. Tariffs?

Except for Canadian and Mexican products that qualify for duty-free treatment under USMCA, any aircraft of Canadian, Mexican or Chinese origin when permanently imported into the U.S. on or after March 4, 2025, as part of a sales transaction would be subject to the relevant countrywide tariff when it makes customs formal entry upon arrival at the first port of entry into the U.S.

Examples include:

new and used aircraft of Canadian origin, regardless of the country of current registry and regardless of from what country the aircraft was being exported

a Canadian-origin aircraft imported for pre-buy inspections with the intent to be sold in the U.S.

An aircraft that was last ""substantially transformed"" in Canada or Mexico prior to entry into the U.S. would be considered of Canadian or Mexican origin for purposes of these tariffs. For example, if a white-tail aircraft went through interior, paint and other completion services in Canada, then it likely underwent a ""substantial transformation"" in Canada. A similar substantial transformation analysis would apply to engines and other components. (Please note that the substantial transformation test applies only after USMCA exception expires on April 2, 2025. The applicable country-of-origin test under USMCA is a product-specific tariff shift test.)

Conversely, the following transactions would not be subject to the additional tariffs because the country of origin of the aircraft would be the U.S.:

a Canadian-registered, U.S.-manufactured aircraft being sold from a Canadian seller to a U.S. buyer (assuming the aircraft has not been modified or otherwise advanced in value in Canada or Mexico)

a U.S.-manufactured aircraft being imported from Mexico to the U.S. for sale in the U.S. (assuming the aircraft has not been modified or otherwise advanced in value in Canada or Mexico)

a Canadian-manufactured aircraft that was ""substantially transformed"" in the U.S.

Note that it is the physical importation of the aircraft into the U.S. for consumption (e.g., sale) or repair that would potentially trigger the customs entry and duties. Neither the country of registry nor the citizenship of the owner is legally relevant. For example, the sale of a ""N""-registered aircraft or a Canadian-manufactured aircraft from a United Kingdom seller to a French buyer where the inspection and transfer of title occurs in Biggen Hill, England, would not trigger tariffs.

What Are Other Impacts of U.S. Tariffs on Owners, Operators and Repair Facilities?

Except for imports for which the party can claim duty-free treatment under USMCA, the following would apply:

Importing Parts from Canada, Mexico or China. Canadian-, Mexican- and Chinese-origin aircraft parts imported into the U.S. will generally be subject to the new tariffs.

Repairs/Overhauls in Canada, Mexico or China. This is an area where additional guidance is needed from CBP. Under prior CBP regulations and guidance, if a U.S. commercial operator flew its U.S.-registered aircraft to a foreign jurisdiction temporarily to have work done abroad, there is no requirement for the aircraft to make a new formal entry or pay duties on repair work performed abroad. However, the rules differ between commercial and private aircraft operations. Given the basis for such duty-free treatment was the Civil Aircraft Agreement, it is unclear whether this would continue to apply now that the repairs may otherwise be dutiable. On the other hand, if defective components are sent to Canada, Mexico or China for repair, the value of such repairs would generally be subject to the 25 percent tariff upon reimportation into the U.S.

Importing for Repairs/Overhaul in the U.S. When an aircraft is brought into the U.S. for repair, overhaul or improvements, it is typically imported under a Temporary Import Bond (TIB), then reexported without the need to pay duties. The cost of the bonds may increase significantly, and underwriting the bonds will take more time than usual in a duty-free environment. This TIB process would also need to be used for parts coming into the U.S. for repair.

What Aviation Items Will Qualify as Duty-Free Under USMCA?

USMCA provides for duty-free entry of goods originating in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. For complex items, such as aircraft and engines, the rule for determining whether a product is ""originating"" in a USMCA country is the tariff shift test. The tariff shift test is for a good produced entirely in the territory of a USMCA country using non-originating materials, whether those non-originating goods satisfy the applicable rules-of-origin criterion for items under that particular Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S. (HTS) classification.

Civil aircraft are classified under Heading 8802. The applicable rule-of-origin criteria is that any material (i.e., part) used in production undergoes a tariff shift from another HTS heading or subheading. Since Heading 8802 covers only aircraft and not aircraft parts, engines, seats, tires, etc., which are classified under separate HTS headings, any part would go through a tariff shift once incorporated into the aircraft as part of being manufactured in Canada. Therefore, aircraft manufactured/assembled in Canada using engines or parts regardless of origin should qualify for preferential treatment under USMCA. Conversely, an aircraft manufactured outside of the U.S., Canada or Mexico that was completed in Canada would not meet USMCA requirements.

A similar analysis would apply with respect to an aircraft gas turbine engine manufactured in Canada, as any part for a gas turbine engine (other than a complete gas generator) would fall under a different HTS subheading than the engine itself.

This analysis becomes more granular when discussing parts because one would need to look at the specific rules of origin for that product. For example, HTS Heading 8807 covers many aircraft parts, but it might be the case that the part may be made up of other parts that fall under the same HTS heading/subheading and, therefore, do not undergo the required tariff shift.

A similar analysis would apply in the case of gas turbine engine parts, except that in the alternative, if there is no tariff shift, USMCA rule of origin allows for the product, such as a component made in Canada or Mexico of multiple parts, to be qualified based on whether the value of the qualifying regional content is 60 percent based on a ""transaction value"" method (e.g., assessing the costs of purchasing each component versus final product value) or 50 percent if based on the ""net cost"" method (e.g., looking at cost of production).

USMCA generally exempts repairs performed in another USMCA country, regardless of country of origin of the item being repaired. Hence, it appears such repairs in Mexico or Canada may be exempt from the 25 percent tariffs. However, there is some ambiguity on this point given the way the exemption was implemented that may require further clarification from CBP.

What Is the Process for Claiming Duty-Free Treatment Under USMCA?

In order to claim duty-free status under USMCA and avoid the 25 percent tariffs, the customs broker will need to annotate entries to claim the product qualifies for duty-free status and will require certification from either the producer, importer or exporter that the product so qualifies. Such certification can be based on information, including documentation, or an exporter who is not the producer may reasonably rely on the producer's written representation. Hence, generally, the Canadian or Mexican producer would be in the best position to provide either the actual certification or information that can be relied on by the exporter or importer. This will be particularly important with respect to components and subassemblies, given the complex rules of origin, where the producer may be the only person with information sufficient to make such determination.

One positive note is that items entering the U.S. under USMCA are not subject to merchandise processing fees, which for expensive items such as aircraft and engines can be up to $634.62.

How Will the U.S. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum Affect Business Aviation?

The U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and ""derivative products"" are unlikely to have any direct effect on civil aircraft and related parts. Though derivative products such as refrigerators and vacuum cleaners made with aluminum and not smelted in the U.S. are subject to duties assessed on the value of the aluminum, the list of derivative products does not include any tariff codes associated with civil aviation aircraft or related parts. However, such tariffs may impact the costs of production for U.S.-based manufacturers that need to source steel and aluminum from abroad.

How Will Counter-Tariffs Imposed or Threatened by Canada, China and Mexico Affect the U.S. Aviation Industry?

To date, the counter-tariffs implemented by Canada and China have targeted specific products not including civil aircraft or aircraft parts. However, Canada's initial round of counter-tariffs includes unmanned aircraft and, on March 4, 2025, Canada announced future tariffs up to certain dollar thresholds that could include civil aircraft.

What Proactive Steps Can a Buyer/Seller of Aircraft Do to Reduce Risk?

Consult with your customs broker and customs/trade counsel before bringing aircraft, engines or parts into the U.S. for sale or repair. Expect there may be issues arising upon entry as CBP officials struggle to implement these new tariffs.

In new contracts, consider carefully how the cost of tariffs will be allocated as between the parties (review applicable international commercial terms, tax representations and other provisions). Consider whether increases of tariffs over a certain percentage threshold should constitute a ""Force Majeure"" event, as such unexpected cost certainly changes the bargain that the parties contemplated.

If tariffs would apply, and given the rapid changes in tariffs, consider whether the physical entry of the aircraft into the U.S. can be delayed. It is the physical entry into the U.S. for consumption (i.e., to be permanently based in the U.S., not being placed on the ""N"" registry) that triggers the formal entry and duty requirements. If you have existing contractual obligations, consider amending agreements to delay taking delivery, take delivery outside the U.S. or other contractual options.

How Will These Tariffs Affect Carriage of Baggage and Air Cargo?

The new U.S. tariffs do not apply to items for personal use in accompanied baggage and currently would not apply to unaccompanied packages valued at $800 or less under the de minimis exemption (until such time as adequate systems can be put in place to collect duties on the latter).

Expect air cargo operations among the U.S., Canada, Mexico and China to be affected as the new tariffs and, in some cases, counter-tariffs are implemented.

With traffic deaths at a 33-year high, the legislation, sponsored by Sen. Marko Liias (D-Edmonds), aims to reduce fatalities by doubling penalties for drivers who repeat the same offense within a two-year period. The bill focuses on behaviors most associated with traffic deaths and serious injury crashes, such as speeding or not wearing a seat belt.

Liias introduced the bill after learning during a ride-along with Washington State Patrol (WSP) Trooper Blake Goetsch that not all second or subsequent infractions result in drivers paying higher penalties.

“With traffic deaths on our highways at a record high, we must do more to make Washington’s roads safer for everyone,” Liias said. “This bill will hold repeat traffic offenders accountable and lead to the behavior change that will avoid crashes and save lives.”

From 2021 to 2024, WSP reported more than 4,300 repeat offenses of the infractions targeted in the bill. Speeding more than 10 mph over the limit and not wearing a seat belt were the top infractions, accounting for 83% of repeat offenses.

During a Senate Transportation Committee work session on reducing repeat traffic offenses, Goetsch said education is effective for deterring unsafe driving behaviors on the road, but it does not always help prevent repeat violations.

“We do try to bring that lowest level of enforcement first,” Goetsch said. “But if it doesn’t get the response that we’re looking for and our collisions keep going up, or if that abstract driver record of the driver keeps getting longer like a CVS receipt, then we have to move on to different options, and having more tools that we can use would be extremely helpful to us.”",https://senatedemocrats.wa.gov/liias/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/03/20140716_LegWA_0005ab-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 12:53:05.269101

London Heathrow Airport (LHR) continues to progress towards its net-zero goals as demand grows, with February marking a record month for passenger traffic. The airport served over 5.7 million passengers, including a 7% increase in traffic to the USA and Canada. This was the busiest February ever, with daily passengers exceeding 200,000 for the twelfth consecutive month. Winter sunseekers flocked to destinations like the Caribbean, Italy, and Greece, while business hubs such as Delhi, Dubai, Mumbai, and Riyadh saw high load factors.

LHR remains committed to supporting the UK economy while reducing its environmental impact. The 2024 Sustainability Report highlighted a 7.5% reduction in carbon emissions in the air and 15% on the ground since 2019, keeping it on track for its 2030 targets. The airport also aims to reach 3% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage this year, surpassing the Government’s target by one percentage point.

Further strides in decarbonisation include reducing noise exposure by 18% compared to 2019, and a decrease in late flights, despite record traffic. Air quality monitors around the airport continue to meet UK pollution limits. LHR’s expansion plans are also moving forward, with proposals for a privately funded expansion set to be reviewed by the Government this summer.

In February, LHR, in partnership with the Department for Transport and Transportation Security Administration, launched a One Stop Security pilot to streamline transfers for North American passengers, further strengthening the UK’s aviation hub.

LHR CEO Thomas Woldbye commented: “Even during a traditionally quiet month for aviation in February, we saw sustained and growing demand to fly and export through Heathrow. As the UK’s gateway to growth, we must meet this increase in demand and do it without compromising our strategy to decarbonise and reduce noise impacts.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/heathrow_17581504373208_thumb_2.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 12:53:15.460115

This reduction trims their original plan of four A350Fs per carrier. The company emphasized this adjustment aligns with its current cargo strategy.

“This does not mean any change in strategy. We will continue to operate our hybrid model of freighter aircraft combined with belly cargo on Air France-KLM Group’s passenger aircraft,” a spokesperson stated.

The revised order follows the airline’s 2024 financial report, which showed a 4.1% increase in cargo volumes year-on-year. However, freight revenue declined 3.9% compared to 2023.

FY24 Financial Result

Air France-KLM reported an operating profit of €1.6 billion with an operating margin of 5.1%. Group revenues reached €31.5 billion, reflecting a 4.8% increase compared to 2023.

Operating cash flow stood at €446 million despite the impact of negative working capital arising from pandemic-related deferrals.

Adjusted recurring operating free cash flow improved significantly, reaching €271 million — a €317 million increase from the previous year.

Net debt rose to €7.4 billion, primarily due to new lease arrangements tied to fleet renewal and delays in aircraft deliveries. This aligns with the group’s targeted leverage ratio of 1.5x to 2.0x.

Fleet Renewal

Fleet renewal remained a key focus for Air France-KLM in 2024. By year-end, 27% of the group’s fleet comprised new-generation aircraft, with plans to increase this share to 80% by 2030.

In 2024, the group introduced several new aircraft models into its fleet, including 8 Airbus A350s, 10 Airbus A321neos, 9 Airbus A320neos, 9 Airbus A220s, 4 Embraer 195-E2s, and 1 Boeing 787-10.

Meanwhile, older aircraft such as 2 Airbus A380s, 3 Airbus A330-200s, 2 Boeing 737-800s, and 4 Boeing 737-700s were phased out to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions.

Sustainability Initiatives

Air France-KLM intensified its sustainability efforts by increasing its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

SAF accounted for 1.25% of the group’s total fuel consumption in 2024, marking a 13.6% increase from 2023.

To support this growth, Air France-KLM entered into a long-term agreement with TotalEnergies to secure up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over the next decade.

The group also improved its greenhouse gas emissions intensity, reducing it by 0.9% year-on-year to reach 928 gCO₂eq/RTK.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead to 2025, Air France-KLM forecasts a capacity increase of 4-5% compared to 2024.

Unit costs are projected to rise slightly, and capital expenditures are expected to range between €3.2 billion and €3.4 billion.

The group aims to maintain its leverage ratio within the targeted range of 1.5x to 2.0x, ensuring financial stability and continued investment in strategic initiatives.

“While there are regional differences, this global overcapacity resulted in a decline in renewable fuel sales prices and intensified demand for waste and residue raw materials,” Malinen said.

“In addition, the weakening fossil diesel price had a further negative impact on the Renewable Products’ sales prices. Consequently, sales margins fell significantly below previous years’ levels.”

Malinen also said Neste’s renewable refineries had faced operational challenges last year and while the company had tackled those challenges, they had had a negative impact on renewable diesel production and sales, particularly during the fourth quarter.

“In Neste’s current situation, it is obvious that a change of direction is needed,” Malinen said.

“Shortly after I took over as a CEO, we launched a group-wide, comprehensive full potential analysis. This work has now been completed and we have today launched a performance improvement program. The goal is to enhance Neste’s financial performance while securing our strong market position with better cost competitiveness in renewable fuels.”

The fourth quarter comparable sales margin for renewables was US$242/tonne, down from US$813/tonne during the same period of 2023.

For the full year 2024, the comparable sales margin for renewables was US$377/tonne, down from US$863/tonne the previous year.

Fourth quarter sales volumes totalled 926,000 tonnes, up from 870,000 tonnes during the same period of the previous year.

SAF accounted for 195,000 tonnes of fourth quarter sales in 2024, up from 40,000 tonnes in the same period of the previous year.

During the fourth quarter, approximately 53% of volumes were sold into the European market, with 47% sold to North America, compared to 61% and 39%, respectively, during the same period of 2023.

The share of waste and residue inputs was 90% of total renewable materials inputs in 2024, compared to 92% in 2023.

Looking at 2025, Neste said it expected renewable products sales volumes to be up compared to 2024.

Malinen said he expected the renewables market to continue to be challenging in 2025, and the company did not expect a return to the exceptional margin levels of previous years.

“Possible changes in the regulatory framework, especially in the USA and Europe, will have an impact on Neste’s overall supply chain optimisation. Changes in trade policy, such as tariffs in different forms, can also affect Neste’s competitiveness,” he added.

Malinen also said he was confident the company could reverse the current trend in its financial performance.

The renewables segment reported EBITDA of €13M (US$14M) in the fourth quarter, down from €433M (US$467.7M) during the same period of 2023.

Renewables comparable EBITDA for the full year was €514M (US$555M) for 2024, compared to €1.91bn (US$2.06bn) the previous year.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Neste-logo-to-use-sized-2023.jpg?mtime=1695303450,N,,2025-03-11 08:50:49.991371

This agreement, announced by SK Energy on March 11, will see the South Korean energy company supply over 20,000 tons of SAF to the Hong Kong-based airline by 2027. This collaboration marks SK Energy as the first domestic refiner to supply SAF to a Hong Kong airline, underscoring the growing importance of sustainable practices in the aviation industry.

The partnership between SK Energy and Cathay Pacific is not new. Since November last year, Cathay Pacific has been utilizing SAF supplied by SK Energy for all flights departing from Incheon International Airport. This move aligns with the broader industry trend towards reducing carbon emissions and complying with international environmental regulations. SAF, a biofuel produced from sustainable resources like waste oils and agricultural residues, is designed to significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

The signing of the agreement comes at a time when the global SAF market is poised for rapid growth. According to Global Market Insights, the market is projected to expand from $1.7 billion last year to $74.6 billion by 2034, with an average annual growth rate of 46%. This growth is driven by regulatory mandates and the aviation industry’s commitment to sustainability. The European Union has already mandated a 2% SAF blending starting this year, with plans to increase this proportion to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Similarly, the United States aims to replace all aviation fuel with SAF by 2050, and South Korea plans to mandate SAF blending for all international flights departing domestically starting in 2027.

SK Energy’s commitment to capturing the SAF market is evident in its strategic plans to strengthen cooperation with global partners. Lee Young-chul, head of marketing at SK Energy, emphasized the company’s proactive approach, stating, “We will closely monitor market conditions, including changes in domestic and international SAF policies and demand fluctuations, and work with strategic partners like Cathay Pacific Airways to build a stable global SAF supply chain.”

The Asia-Pacific region, where Cathay Pacific operates extensively, accounts for 80% of domestic refiner export volume, highlighting the strategic importance of this partnership. Hong Kong International Airport, ranked fifth worldwide in passenger numbers last year, serves as a major hub for international travel in the region, making it a critical point for implementing sustainable aviation practices.

SK Energy’s establishment of a mass production system for low-carbon products with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons in September last year further solidifies its position in the SAF market. The coprocessing method used by SK Energy integrates bio-feedstock into existing petroleum refining processes, allowing for an efficient transition from traditional fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SK-Energy-and-Cathay-Pacific-Airways.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 05:50:39.278468

This recognition highlights ongoing industry efforts toward transparency and sustainability in aviation.

Industry milestone in environmental disclosure

Bombardier’s Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) initiative provides a comprehensive life cycle analysis of its aircraft, assessing environmental impact from production to retirement. The company first introduced an EPD for its Global 7500 aircraft in 2020, followed by the Challenger 3500 in 2022, and expanded to include the Global 5500, Global 6500, and Challenger 650 by 2024.

“Our initiative set a precedent in the industry and demonstrates how Bombardier is ahead of the curve in openly sharing environmental data,” said Sean Johnson, Vice President, Aircraft Innovation.

EPDs, a common tool in industries such as construction and automotive, remain rare in aviation. Bombardier’s decision to publicly release these reports places it among the few aerospace manufacturers engaging in full environmental impact transparency. The company’s approach aligns with broader industry trends, as regulatory bodies and consumers increasingly demand sustainable solutions and clearer emissions reporting.

Environmental data and industry impact

The release of EPDs is part of a broader shift in aviation toward sustainable innovation and emissions reduction. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry contributes approximately 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, prompting efforts to improve efficiency and explore alternative fuel sources such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

While business jets represent a smaller portion of overall aviation emissions, industry analysts suggest that greater transparency in environmental data can help accelerate the adoption of cleaner technologies. The inclusion of life cycle assessments in corporate sustainability strategies may also serve as a model for other manufacturers navigating evolving regulatory frameworks.

Recognition at Aviation Week Laureate Awards

The 2025 Aviation Week Laureate Awards, held on March 6, 2025, at the National Building Museum in Washington, DC, recognized Bombardier’s efforts in environmental disclosure as a step toward increased industry accountability. The award underscores the growing importance of data-driven sustainability initiatives in aerospace.

Broader trends in aerospace sustainability

Environmental reporting and emissions reduction remain key issues for aviation. Recent policy initiatives, such as the EU’s Fit for 55 package and the U.S. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, emphasize the need for greater corporate responsibility in carbon emissions reporting and reduction.

Industry experts note that transparency initiatives, such as those adopted by Bombardier, could become a standard practice in the coming years as stakeholders push for increased sustainability in private and commercial aviation. The extent to which these disclosures lead to measurable reductions in emissions and operational efficiency remains a topic of ongoing assessment.",https://gmipost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GMI-POST-logo-1-100x100.png,N,,2025-03-11 11:50:38.740397

This initiative is part of the broader SAF Mandate, which requires SAF integration into the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025 and reaching 22% by 2040.

Aviation's Green Transformation:

The aviation sector, responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions, is undergoing a critical shift. The UK government has launched a consultation to introduce an RCM funded by a levy on jet fuel suppliers. This mechanism will provide price guarantees to SAF producers, ensuring stable revenue even amidst fluctuating market prices. By reducing financial risks, the initiative aims to attract investments into SAF production facilities, which require up to £2 billion in capital per plant.

The SAF Mandate and Industry Challenges:

The SAF Mandate, effective from January 2025, obligates jet fuel suppliers to blend sustainable fuels into their mix, starting at 2% and scaling up to 22% by 2040. While SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 85%, its high production costs and limited supply remain barriers. The proposed levy aligns with the ""polluter pays principle,"" spreading costs across the aviation supply chain and ensuring those benefiting from fossil fuels contribute to decarbonization efforts.

Economic and Environmental Impact:

This initiative is expected to create thousands of green jobs while fostering innovation in SAF technologies. By supporting domestic SAF production, it positions the UK as a leader in sustainable aviation and contributes significantly to achieving net-zero targets.

Key Takeaways

The proposed levy will fund a price guarantee mechanism for SAF producers, mitigating investment risks.

The SAF Mandate ensures gradual integration of sustainable fuels into aviation, with ambitious targets through 2040.

This policy aligns with global decarbonization efforts and strengthens the UK's leadership in green aviation technologies.

The agency on Dec. 5, 2024, issued a proposed rule to partially waive the compliance year 2024 RVO for cellulosic biofuel. The rulemaking also proposed to extend the RFS compliance reporting deadline for 2024 and included language to revise certain biogas provisions included in RFS regulations.

The proposed rule was issued following a petition filed with the EPA by the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers on Nov. 1 seeking a partial waiver of 2024 cellulosic RVOs.

Within the proposed rule, the EPA explained that in finalizing the 2024 cellulosic RVO in July 2023, the agency projected that 1.09 billion cellulosic renewable identification numbers (RINs) would be generated in 2024. Projections included in the proposed rule estimated that only 970 million cellulosic RINs will be generated in 2024, creating a shortfall of 120 million cellulosic RINs. Data published by the EPA in January indicates that cellulosic biofuel production exceeded the projections included in the proposed rule, with net cellulosic RIN generation reaching 1.01 billion for the full year 2024, which equates to a shortfall of 80 million cellulosic RINs.

The EPA on March 7 published a final rule extending the 2024 RFS compliance deadline. The rule, however, does not take any action on the proposed cellulosic RVO revision. The EPA is expected to address the partial cellulosic RVO waiver in a future rulemaking.

The 2024 compliance deadline, which was set by statute for March 31, 2025, will now be set for the “next quarterly compliance reporting deadline after the effective date of the action finalizing the revised 2024 cellulosic biofuel standard.” In the rulemaking, the EPA explains that it expects that the effective date of the revised 2024 cellulosic biofuel standard will not occur until after the statutory March 31 compliance deadline. The extension is needed in order to provide obligated parties with sufficient time to carry out and adjust their compliance strategies once the agency finalizes the revised 2024 cellulosic standard, according to the agency. The 2024 attest engagement deadline is also being extended to the next June 1 annual attest engagement reporting deadline after the revised 2024 RFS compliance reporting deadline.

The final rule also includes several other provisions, including those consolidating and simplifying the existing provisions for the RFS program’s annual attest engagement deadline; updating the standard specification for biodiesel; and making technical corrections.

Clean Fuels Alliance America has expressed disappointment in the EPA’s actions. “The biomass-based diesel industry needs policy certainty that supports our continued growth and significant contribution to American energy security,” said Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels’ vice president of federal affairs. “In response to the proposed waiver of cellulosic volumes, Clean Fuels asked EPA to make decisions on outstanding small refinery exemptions to assess the potential impact on 2024 RIN availability. It is frustrating that EPA is delaying important program decisions and adding to uncertainty for our industry.”

Introduced by Congressman Max Miller in late February, the bipartisan act would aim to boost the production of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.
RELATED: ""What it's doing is really writing the rules,” Tadd Nicholson, executive director of the Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association.
""The benefit to us is that we, as farmers, one of the things that we can mix into sustainable aviation fuel out of is corn ethanol,” Nicholson said.

It's called the Farm to Fly Act. Introduced by Congressman Max Miller in late February, the bipartisan act would aim to boost the production of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

To begin with, 50% ethanol from a variety of feed stocks, such as corn and soybean oil, would be mixed in with petroleum-based jet fuel to create what is known as a ""biofuel.""

Supporters of biofuels say this bill is setting parameters for the growing industry.

RELATED:

""What it's doing is really writing the rules,” Tadd Nicholson, executive director of the Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association. “This is a market that's probably going to be developing over the next decade or so, but the rules have to be written right now.""

Similar to the use of e15 in cars, Nicholson said mixing ethanol into the jet fuel will bring a big boost for Ohio’s farmers.

""The benefit to us is that we, as farmers, one of the things that we can mix into sustainable aviation fuel out of is corn ethanol,” Nicholson said. “That's a new demand that we are very excited about.

""It would just really solidify the ag economy because it would just sort of really make a new use for corn ethanol, and that's what we're all about is securing the future of farming because of the ripple effect that it has all across Ohio's economy.""

With farmers growing corn to be used as a biofuel mix, some might be worried that the price of corn will go up or there won't be enough to eat. Nicholson said that is a myth.

""We're not talking about sweet corn, we're talking about field corn,” Nicholson said. “That's 99% of what you see grown throughout our state is field corn. We use it for ethanol production, livestock feed. Some of it, only about 5% of it, is used for ingredients that go into our foods. So, it's not sweet corn, plenty of availability out there.""

In addition to the act's potential economic impacts, Nicholson said the environmental impacts are also immense. Aviation emissions contribute significantly to climate change, according to studies, and Nicholson said the decarbonization factors of biofuel production for aviation can help with that carbon footprint.

""It's all about lowering that carbon footprint,” Nicholson said. “The airlines are very serious about it. They're making large investments in their own sustainability, and the manufacturing of this is being incentivized and encouraged.""

For Nicholson and the Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association, the sky's the limit when it comes to the use of ethanol for biofuels.

Cathay Pacific already began to use a mix of SAF produced by SK Energy in all of its planes that depart from Korea's Incheon International Airport in Korea in November, it said.

SK Energy shipped the country's first batch of SAF to Europe in January. SAF is produced through a co-processing production method using bio-based materials, including waste cooking oil and animal fat.

The European Union requires all aircraft departing from the region to mix at least 2 percent SAF in their fuel starting this year.

The ratio is set to rise to 6 percent from 2030 and 70 percent from 2050 in the EU. The United States aims to replace all existing jet fuel with SAF by 2050, the release said.

The trip to Olympia was part of an ongoing series of advocacy efforts StART has participated in since its inception in 2018.
""StART continues to be a valuable platform for collaboration, bringing together airport communities to push for meaningful change,” said SeaTac City Councilmember Joe D. Vinson.
“Our visit to Olympia reinforced the importance of working together at all levels to address noise, air quality, and sustainable growth.""
StART will continue to meet on a bimonthly basis to collaborate on and advance progress on these community priorities.","OLYMPIA, WA — Members of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) Stakeholder Advisory Round Table (StART), elected officials and staff from nearby cities, and Port staff traveled to the state capital last month to meet with Washington state legislators and Executive Branch staff and discuss five key shared policy priorities for the 2025 Legislative Session. While operational growth at SEA provides significant economic benefit to the region, StART members are advocating for new approaches to address the unique issues faced by near-airport communities. The group of 20 participants successfully navigated caucus meetings, votes, and busy schedules to speak on the identified state-level policy and budget items.

“StART is an important part of our community engagement efforts for SEA, and we really value the ongoing collaboration with our nearby cities on joint priorities like these,” said Aviation Managing Director Lance Lyttle. “We’ve made real strides in recent years on both operational changes and federal advocacy efforts, and we’re happy to expand the group’s work to state level policies. This trip is a great example of what can be accomplished when we work together.”

The five shared policy priorities include:

Effectively implementing the Port of Seattle’s Sound Insulation Repair and Replacement Pilot Program by ensuring that state regulations continue to complement the Port’s program and keep pace with updated federal regulations

Making tangible progress toward identifying additional regional airport capacity through the work of the state’s Commercial Aviation Working Group (CAWG)

Sustaining existing state programs to enhance air quality with partners like the Department of Ecology and the Office of Superintendent for Public Instruction

Maintaining and expanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and use in Washington by effectively implementing SAF incentives, creating more policies in support of SAF production, and supporting the SAF Research and Development Center at Paine Field

Continuing to decarbonize ground transportation networks that serve the airport through more investment in EV infrastructure, clean trucking incentives, multi-modal networks like high-speed rail, etc.

The trip to Olympia was part of an ongoing series of advocacy efforts StART has participated in since its inception in 2018. In fact, several StART members who went to Olympia last month were also part of the 2023 D.C. Fly-in, which sent 20 local and state elected officials and staff to the nation’s capital to advocate for the inclusion of mutually agreed-upon aircraft noise and emissions reduction policies. Those efforts led to multiple key policies in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill passed last May.

""StART continues to be a valuable platform for collaboration, bringing together airport communities to push for meaningful change,” said SeaTac City Councilmember Joe D. Vinson. “Our visit to Olympia reinforced the importance of working together at all levels to address noise, air quality, and sustainable growth.""

“The day with our state legislators was a welcome opportunity, for us as representatives of affected communities, to emphasize the issues that are important to our residents’ quality of life and to share our collective policy agenda and priorities,” said StART Community Representative from Normandy Park Moira Bradshaw.

StART will continue to meet on a bimonthly basis to collaborate on and advance progress on these community priorities. Overall, the trip was a success, and attendees were well received by those in Olympia. From here, the Port of Seattle’s Government Relations staff will continue to advocate for the committee’s shared agenda and work with the Washington State Legislature to ensure that the committee’s priorities are included in passed legislation and within the enacted state budget. The ongoing legislative session is currently scheduled to conclude on April 27, 2025.

Cosmo's strategy involves producing 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually at Sakai, scaling up to 150,000 kiloliters from its Sakaide site by 2029 using bioethanol, and importing 120,000 kiloliters from Thailand’s Bangchak and other Asian suppliers.
SAF production remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel, with costs estimated at three to five times higher.
Additionally, Idemitsu has secured funding for a separate 100,000-kiloliter SAF facility at its Chiba refinery near Tokyo.
These projects are crucial for reducing Japan’s reliance on imported SAF and positioning the country as a leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.","Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to commence Japan’s first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in April, marking a major step toward the country's goal of replacing 10% of jet fuel with cleaner alternatives. However, cost challenges and raw material constraints remain key hurdles.

As Japan’s third-largest refiner, Cosmo will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan. ""Our goal is to supply 300,000 kiloliters of SAF by 2030 through domestic production and imports,"" said Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development. Japanese refiners are mandated to supply SAF equivalent to 10% of their total aviation fuel sales by 2030, aligning with global efforts to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aviation sector.

Cosmo's strategy involves producing 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually at Sakai, scaling up to 150,000 kiloliters from its Sakaide site by 2029 using bioethanol, and importing 120,000 kiloliters from Thailand’s Bangchak and other Asian suppliers. A final investment decision for the Sakaide project is expected in fiscal 2026, with government subsidies covering approximately half of the capital expenditures for both initiatives.

The Sakai refinery is projected to produce 24,000 kiloliters in fiscal 2025 after accounting for maintenance. Cosmo has already secured most of its customers, including Japan Airlines (JAL), All Nippon Airways (ANA), and DHL. By launching production and sales ahead of competitors, the company aims to gain expertise and establish strong customer relationships despite ongoing challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials, and locking in long-term buyers.

SAF production remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel, with costs estimated at three to five times higher. While increasing production volume may help reduce distribution costs, major cost reductions are unlikely due to the high price of raw materials, which represent a large portion of expenses. ""Japan's subsidy scheme is at a medium level by global standards. Countries will compete to offer attractive incentives for SAF deployment to maintain their hub airport status,"" Takada noted.

Cosmo’s SAF initiatives are part of a broader national effort to boost local production and meet Japan’s projected SAF demand of 1.7 million kiloliters by 2030. The government has allocated 340 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in subsidies over five years to support multiple SAF projects, including Eneos’ 400,000-kiloliter facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan’s 250,000-kiloliter plant in Yamaguchi, and Taiyo Oil’s 200,000-kiloliter project in Okinawa, all currently in the design phase. Additionally, Idemitsu has secured funding for a separate 100,000-kiloliter SAF facility at its Chiba refinery near Tokyo.

These projects are crucial for reducing Japan’s reliance on imported SAF and positioning the country as a leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-10 16:50:22.283353

The bill was put forth by Ohio Congressman Max Miller (R-7th District), who was previously recognized as a Champion of Ohio Corn & Wheat.
“The Farm to Fly Act is a win for Ohio growers,” said Tyler Drewes, President of the Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association.
“The Farm to Fly Act creates new opportunities for Ohio’s corn growers,” said Tadd Nicholson, Executive Director of Ohio Corn & Wheat.
“The Farm to Fly Act will provide access to new markets for our nation’s farmers, drive rural economic development, and strengthen our domestic energy resources,” Congressman Miller said.","The Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association commends the Farm to Fly Act, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, February 27, 2025. The bill was put forth by Ohio Congressman Max Miller (R-7th District), who was previously recognized as a Champion of Ohio Corn & Wheat. Senators Moran (R-KS), Grassley (R-IA), Duckworth (D-IL), Ricketts (R-NE), Klochubar (D-MN), and Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Senate companion, S.144, in January.

The Farm to Fly Act is a bipartisan measure that would enable the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish programs aimed at boosting the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This initiative connects farmers in Ohio and across the nation with the aviation sector, encouraging the use of clean aviation fuel produced from agricultural products such as corn.

“The Farm to Fly Act is a win for Ohio growers,” said Tyler Drewes, President of the Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association. “Ohio farmers are proud to play a role in producing clean, renewable fuels that will power the aviation industry for years to come.”

Alongside its environmental benefits, the Farm to Fly Act would greatly benefit producers and rural communities by boosting the demand for their crops. The growth of SAF usage is expected to improve domestic energy security, expand fuel options for airlines, and generate jobs related to fuel production.

“The Farm to Fly Act creates new opportunities for Ohio’s corn growers,” said Tadd Nicholson, Executive Director of Ohio Corn & Wheat. “Investing in SAF solutions strengthens Ohio’s agricultural economy and enhances national security. We look forward to collaborating with policymakers to support the ongoing partnership between Ohio’s corn growers and the aviation industry.”

Specifically, the Farm to Fly Act would:

• Clarify eligibility for Sustainable Aviation Fuels within current U.S. Department of Agriculture Bio-Energy Programs expanding markets for American agricultural crops through aviation bioenergy;

• Provide for greater collaboration for aviation biofuels throughout U.S. Department of Agriculture agency mission areas, increasing private sector partnerships; and

• Affirm a common definition of SAF for USDA purposes, as widely supported by industry and congressional leaders to enable U.S. crops to most effectively contribute to aviation renewable fuels.

“The Farm to Fly Act will provide access to new markets for our nation’s farmers, drive rural economic development, and strengthen our domestic energy resources,” Congressman Miller said. “I’m grateful for the close collaboration between my colleagues, Ohio and American agricultural producers, and the aviation industry. I look forward to seeing this through to lift American farmers to new heights and strengthen our nation’s energy supply.”

SAF has bipartisan support in Congress and at the state level and is likely to be protected, United chief executive Scott Kirby said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston, Texas.

Electrification is not practical in large scale aviation and hydrogen has a different set of problems, leaving SAF as the better option, Kirby said.

The US has provided strong incentives to develop SAF under laws passed during the administration of former-president Joe Biden and will likely produce enough to export to Europe to help that continent meet aggressive targets.

US president Donald Trump issued an executive order upon taking office which paused all disbursements of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2022 and a complementary infrastructure law passed in 2021. The order called for ending the ""Green New Deal"", echoing language he used on the campaign trail when criticizing the IRA. Trump said the funding should be held back until federal agencies ""review their processes, policies and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts or any other financial disbursements"" to ensure they fit with policy objectives.

United announced in December that it agreed to buy SAF from Phillips 66's Rodeo facility in northern California as soon as the product came online.

The airline inked a similar deal with Neste last year for SAF as it continues to take advantage of the Illinois SAF buyers' tax credit in supplying its major hub at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

Other US independent refiners have recently announced that SAF projects are advancing.

Specialty refiner Calumet said last month that a project to expand SAF production in Montana is moving forward after it received an initial $782mn loan from the US Department of Energy (DOE).

The funding is the first portion of a $1.44bn loan from the DOE that will allow Calumet subsidiary Montana Renewables to expand operations at its Great Falls, Montana, biofuel plant.

For those who don’t already know the background, the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport (GALBA) has been campaigning, successfully, since 2020 to prevent any expansion of the airport. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Leeds West and Pudsey MP Rachel Reeves, originally objected to the expansion but now supports the idea, claiming that ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel will solve the airport’s greenhouse gas problem.

This public inquiry follows LBA’s breaches of the night flight rules, which were set by Leeds City Council in the 2022, 2023, and 2024 summer seasons. GALBA revealed each breach of the rules and alerted Leeds City Council by making formal complaints. Over those three years, there were 2,145 unlawful night flights departing from LBA.

After the council upheld GALBA’s complaints for the 2022 and 2023 summer seasons, the airport’s management applied for Certificates of Lawful Existing Use or Development (CLEUDs). These aimed to persuade the council to reinterpret the meaning of the night flight rules, but Leeds City Council rejected all of LBA’s applications. The airport then appealed to the Planning Inspectorate, hence the public inquiry.

Public inquiry details

Anyone can come and watch all or part of the public inquiry, but only the witnesses and lawyers can speak during the proceedings. You don’t have to book in advance; just come when you can. The hearing will commence at 10am on Tuesday 11 March and end that day at 5.30pm. Each subsequent day will start at 9.30am up until Friday 14 March, the final day. It will take place in the council chamber in Leeds Civic Hall.

Night flights are bad news for human health

We feel confident that the planning inspector will uphold the plain and simple meaning of the night flight rules, which put a limit on the number and type of planes allowed to fly between 11pm and 7am. These rules exist to protect the health and wellbeing of people living under the flight path. They also limit the damage to the climate and the air we breathe caused by LBA’s business.

As almost everyone who lives under LBA’s flight paths will tell you, nighttime flying is bad news for human health. The noise disturbance from these flights causes all kinds of serious illnesses, including heart disease. Jet engines also release ultrafine particles that pollute the air and are linked to lung diseases. Essentially, the rules that limit nighttime flying are a public health measure.

LBA’s local ‘charm offensive’

In related news, it appears that LBA’s bosses have realised that their reputation with the public is in the gutter, so they’re going on a ‘charm offensive’ this year. They’re holding public meetings in areas under the flight paths on the theme: LBA is a ‘good neighbour’ and a ‘sustainable business’. No, I’m not making that up!

GALBA thinks that a ‘good neighbour’ wouldn’t carry out hundreds of unlawful night flights over your house in the summer. And a ‘sustainable business’ wouldn’t want to pollute the air and the climate even more by trying to increase its number of flights.

We can assume that the ‘sustainable’ claim relates to LBA’s promise to cut emissions from the airport’s terminal and other ground operations. That’s welcome, but around 95% of the greenhouse gases associated with the airport come from planes; only around 5% come from its terminal. So, while it’s good to reduce those emissions, it’s the flights that are the problem and LBA wants thousands more of them every year.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuels can’t solve the industry’s climate problem fast enough

Rachel Reeves has trumpeted ‘sustainable’ aviation fuels as the solution. There are four big problems with alternative fuels.

Firstly, biomass fuels release as many emissions as fossil kerosene at the point of combustion. Their only claim to be ‘green’ is that you can, over time, regrow the plants used to make biomass fuels, which can capture emissions from the atmosphere. But we don’t have time: we have to cut emissions now.

Secondly, alternative fuels, both biomass and hydrogen, are an awful lot more expensive than kerosene. So, airlines are reluctant to pay the extra amount, meaning it would be passed on to customers, increasing ticket prices and reducing demand.

Thirdly, the rate of expansion envisaged by LBA and the rest of the industry – and the resulting rise in emissions – would far outstrip any reduction in emissions from using alternative fuels. Biomass fuels will, at best, make up just a tenth of aviation fuels by 2030 and only a fifth by 2040. Plus, many experts doubt even these small amounts will be achieved.

Finally, and most importantly of all, there are simply not enough raw materials or manufacturing capacity to make enough alternative aviation fuel for airlines’ existing fleets, let alone for the kind of expansion that LBA and other airports want. That may change over the years, but the fact is alternative fuels are decades away from making a serious dent in the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted from flights.

Sustainable aviation growth is not currently possible

Talking of LBA’s expansion goals, a couple of weeks ago the government’s independent watchdog, the Climate Change Committee, published its seventh carbon budget. This included advice on how UK aviation could reach net zero by 2050, saying there should be a 0.6% decrease in passenger numbers between now and 2030, only a 2% rise by 2035 and no more than 10% by 2040. LBA wants to increase its passenger numbers by 57% by 2030 and 143% by 2045. That is totally irresponsible.

Truly sustainable growth is simply not possible for the aviation industry at the moment. More flying means more greenhouse gases, polluting the climate and causing more extreme weather. We’ve all seen the terrifying consequences of that kind of weather in the Los Angeles wildfires and flooding here in the UK. That’s the reality of climate change that we all have a duty to mitigate, including LBA.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSNCRcNFBlA4Mnts/67f967909d5e6144acd4363c716db145ac037bc5a6245ffdcddceaf453231b9b/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=basic-6&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fyorkshirebylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F10%252Fyorkshire.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fyorkshirebylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F03%252Fleeds-bradford-airport2.jpeg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Leeds%2520Bradford%2520Airport%2520night%2520flights%2520public%2520inquiry%2520starts%2520on%252011%2520March%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fyorkshirebylines.co.uk%2Fregion%2Fleeds-bradford-airport-night-flights-public-inquiry-starts-on-11-march,N,,2025-03-10 13:51:45.205728

DB Schenker has secured an arrangement to use 12,000 metric tons of biofuel components for its consolidated cargo, less-than-container load (LCL), full-container-load (FCL), and refrigerated containers (reefer containers) on MSC vessels. This purchase is expected to save an additional 35,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) along the entire production chain (well-to-wake).

The agreement involves the use of certified sustainable, second-generation biofuels derived from used cooking oil, replacing conventional fossil-based marine fuel. The 12,000 metric tons of biofuel component will be blended between 20 and 30%, resulting in approximately 50,000 metric tons of blended biofuel used in MSC’s container ships.

Certified Emission Reduction for Customers

This partnership allows DB Schenker to offer its customers a readily available solution for net-zero ocean transport. Customers can book regular net-zero ocean transport and receive an annual certificate of their emission reduction for their carbon footprint, similar to net-zero flights using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“Together with MSC, we are offering our customers a convenient and clean solution using the latest generation of marine biofuel to help them achieve a real additional reduction in their emissions,” said Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight at DB Schenker.

“We are proud to contribute to the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport,” said Radu Căprău, member of the OMV Petrom executive board responsible for refining and marketing.

“SAF is produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, transformed into fuels with properties similar to conventional kerosene using innovative technologies,” Căprău said. “At OMV Petrom, we have started construction works on a 750-million euro (USD$812.5 million) investment so that starting 2028 we can produce such fuels in Romania, at the Petrobrazi refinery. We believe in Romania’s potential to become a regional hub for such fuels.”

David Ciceo, the general manager of Cluj International Airport, added, “Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to initiate the process by which the aircrafts operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fueled with sustainable aviation fuels. This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfill our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport.”

With nearly 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni.

As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuel, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft deicing/antiicing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft.

It has the potential to provide a lifecycle-carbon reduction of up to 80 percent compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces.

SAF will play a really important role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon-reduction targets.

Starting Jan. 1, the ReFuelEU aviation regulation mandates the use of SAF at European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2 percent, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6 percent by 2030.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_be8876eb974a4edf82c68eddcb0ec4ba~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_960,h_640,al_c,q_85/80995f_be8876eb974a4edf82c68eddcb0ec4ba~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-03-10 16:50:50.681119

Like air freight, emissions in this sector are also notoriously hard to abate, though some progress is being made.","Cutting back on emissions in logistics needs to be a bigger part of net zero goals moving forward. A report from AllChiefs, Smart Freight Centre and the Rotterdam School of Management shows how companies that are leading the way in decarbonization integrate sustainability into their daily business operations.

A report released last year by MIT on supply chain sustainability found that only 35% of companies currently have net zero goals in place. What’s more, many of those companies were unprepared to meet upcoming deadlines.

One of the main takeaways from the analysis is that companies with a clear roadmap are more successful in meeting their net zero targets. The hard part is not setting a target; rather it is ensuring the organization follows through. Companies need to set milestones and carefully track their progress.

Companies with a higher level of sustainability maturity follow a number of management practices that set them apart. These sustainability leaders have a more involved leadership, dedicated sustainability teams, clear governance, and above all, center sustainability as an integral part of day-to-day business operations.

Air freight a major emitter

When it comes to hard-to-abate sectors, the aviation industry is near the top of the list. These significant challenges in achieving sustainability are linked to an enormous usage of fossil fuels, huge demand, and a notable lack of global coordination and policy.

Source: IATA

The most promising innovation in cleaning up the aviation industry is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAFs are fuels that are made from up to 80% renewable materials, which provide a huge reduction in emissions. These fuels are designed to be compatible with existing aircraft that use standard fossil fuels.

The challenge is that, despite the promise that SAFs offer, both supply and adoption remain very low. Only about 1% of the total amount of aviation fuel used in 2023 was sustainable aviation fuel. Some government policies in favor of SAFs have been put forward by countries like Australia and the United Kingdom.

There also has been notable industry action taken to boost the use of SAFs. For example, United Airlines has set up the Ecoskies Alliance, which is made up of 40 members who are taking collective action to purchase SAFs. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global airline trade association, has also been working towards accelerating the transition to SAFs.

Alternative fuels for ocean transport

Around 90% of total global freight volume is moved around the world by sea. Ocean transport is the first choice for industries that move large volumes of cargo over very long distances. Over 8 out of 10 respondents in the survey by AllChiefs, Smart Freight Centre, and the Rotterdam School of Management said they use ocean freight.

Overall, ocean transport contributes around 3% of global CO2 emissions, a figure which will rise considerably without serious intervention. In order to meet net zero goals, companies will need to explore a variety of different decarbonization strategies.

Similarly, sustainable fuels stand out as a key solution for decarbonization of the ocean freight industry. For example, biofuel – just like SAF for aircrafts – is created from renewable sources and dramatically reduces overall emissions.

There also several other fuel solutions, including bio-methanol, bio-ammonia, liquid natural gas, and hydrogen. Green hydrogen, in particular, is promising, though the technology to produce it is complex and production plants are only just beginning to be built in Europe.

Prioritizing rail freight

For long distances, rail transport is significantly more energy-efficient than air and road transport, with trains capable of moving much larger volumes of goods using less fuel. In fact, many rail networks in Europe, China, and elsewhere are already electric.

The study found that respondents see multimodal freight transportation – in which various modes of transport like rail and road are combined – as increasingly important. The European Green Deal is set to increase train capacity by optimizing rail usage and improving cross-border rail freight corridors.

The researchers provide examples such as Ikea, which has been working hard to shift transport from road to rail in recent years. Just this year the Swedish giant announced it reached over 50% share of intermodal land transportation.

Electric trucks in road transport

Road freight makes up around 30% of all transportation emissions globally, making it a major contributor of harmful emissions. Like air freight, emissions in this sector are also notoriously hard to abate, though some progress is being made.

Electric trucks were indicated in the survey as the most important road transport sustainability solution. Rapid improvements in electrical vehicle technology have helped lead to a growing supply of electric commercial vehicles. There are high up-front costs and some issues with range, but overall, electric trucks are likely to be one of the main decarbonization solutions in this sector.

Biofuels are also a potential solution in the road freight sector. They are, however, not expected to be as important as in air freight. That is because battery-powered vehicles are far more feasible on the road.

Though adoption of electric trucks is still quite low, there will likely soon be a substantial increase in the number of vehicles on the road. A number of companies in Europe, including DAF Trucks, MAN, Scania, Volvo and Mercedes, have begun or will soon scale their production of electric trucks.

An important but challenging goal

Overall, the importance of sustainability is clear to a majority of the companies surveyed. A total of 94% have already set net zero targets and 76% reported that logistics decarbonization is important to them. “Talking to leading organizations and experts, it became clear that while decarbonizing logistics is challenging, there are practical steps and innovations that can help us make real progress,” said Pim Roest, partner at AllChiefs.",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-03-10-024353858-Logistics_ecosystems_are_a_growing_part_of_the_global_net_zero_puzzle_spot.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 12:52:27.093531

DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.

While poised to significantly contribute to carbon removal, however, DAC faces cost barriers, with Spiritus citing a current average of $1,000 per ton of CO2.

Founded in 2022 by CEO Charles Cadieu and CTO Matt Lee, Spiritus has developed a solution to significantly slash the cost of DAC, with the company targeting a 90% reduction to $100 per ton. The company’s “Carbon Orchard” approach utilizes passive air contacting, without fans, absorbing CO2 from the ambient air through passive contacting, using a unique carbon capture sorbent, and a novel low-temperature desorption process. According to the company, the combination of a highly cost-effective sorbent material, low-energy consumption, and modular design enables a scalable, low-cost solution to allow for megaton-scale carbon removal.

Cadieu said:

“We’re seeing soaring demand for data centers and heavy industries, yet we can’t ignore the carbon that comes with it. Our DAC technology brings large-scale decarbonization within reach. This funding advances our vision of supporting America’s explosive growth while keeping emissions in check.”

The financing round was led by Aramco Ventures and joined by Khosla Ventures, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, and TDK Ventures. Spiritus said that the new capital will be used to advance projects including its 1,000 ton DAC New Mexico Pilot Facility, and its “Orchard One” project in Wyoming, designed to sequester 2 megatons of CO2 annually, making it one of the largest DAC and sequestration (DAC+S) facilities in the U.S. Spiritus is also partnering with Aramco to further develop the technology and scale deployments in the Saudi Arabia.

Bruce Niven, Executive Managing Director of Strategic Venturing at Aramco Ventures, said:

“Direct Air Capture has the potential to play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors of the economy, but until now, it has been too expensive to be meaningful. Breakthrough approaches like Spiritus are needed. We are excited to partner with Spiritus and bring this important technology to market.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Spiritus.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 12:52:40.264348

Total freight at the country’s biggest port grew five per cent year-over-year to reach 158 million tonnes in 2024, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority said Monday.

Crude oil exports climbed 527 per cent thanks to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion that began operations last spring.

The project twinned the existing pipeline and nearly tripled its capacity at a total cost of $34 billion. The pipeline extends from a storage terminal in Edmonton to the Rockies before winding southwest to a terminal in Burnaby, B.C.

“Trans Mountain’s expansion coming into operation last May was a significant milestone for Canada and the port, adding export capacity and opening up new opportunities for Canadian producers,” said port authority CEO Peter Xotta in a release.

Container traffic recovered in 2024, rising 11 per cent from 2023 in a return to pre-pandemic levels. The boost came on the heels of a post-COVID dip, which in turn followed a spike driven by demand for consumer items at the height of the pandemic. Household goods and construction materials led the resurgence of products imported via steel box.

Several hurdles hampered port activity last year. Among them were extreme weather — wildfires and low temperatures halted freight trains at various points — and work stoppages at B.C. ports and both major railways.

Nearly 470,000 vehicle imports — another record — rolled onto the docks last year in a three per cent increase driven by Canadians’ appetite for new cars, the port authority said.

Canola shipments increased 23 per cent, but wheat volumes — by far the biggest grain category — fell 10 per cent year-over-year.

Log exports dropped 38 per cent and mineral shipments 21 per cent. Coal exports dipped two per cent in 2024.

However, another type of traffic hit a new high-water mark. Cruise ship passenger volumes swelled to a record 1.33 million, jumping seven per cent from the 1.24 million cruisers who made landfall in Vancouver Harbour in 2023, most of them en route to or from Alaska.

But Casey Wasser with the Missouri Soybean Association says the change could be part of a shift in language from climate to value-added.

International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, has pledged to invest up to €200m into tech startups shaping the future of aviation.

The organisation – registered in Madrid, Spain with corporate headquarters in London – also counts Aer Lingus, Iberia, LEVEL and Vueling among its airline brands.

It said IAGi Ventures, its new corporate venturing arm, will back firms at the cutting edge of customer experience, operations and sustainability.

IAG will target early-stage investments, with the flexibility to explore earlier and later-stage opportunities, in companies across all global markets.

“Adopting new technologies will improve our business and the value we generate, which is why we are seeking to work with and learn from top innovators through venturing,” said Jorge Saco, IAG’s chief information, procurement, services and innovation officer.

“By launching venturing, alongside our accelerator programme, we plan to work with the best start-ups and scale-ups tackling today’s challenges.”

SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
The new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.
The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.
Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said: “We are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.","The UK Government’s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a “revenue certainty mechanism” (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

The new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Among the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of £600 million to £2 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.

According to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.

The consultation outlines the government’s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the “polluter pays principle” for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

“We are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.

“As part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airport-Heathrow.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 10:51:06.540547

I would like to sincerely thank our people for their incredible support and commitment, without which these award wins would not have been possible.

“Cargo has long been an important line of business for Cathay, and as the largest cargo operator at the world’s busiest cargo airport, we are committed to doing our part to strengthen Hong Kong’s position at the forefront of the global cargo industry. Sustainability is also an area where Cathay strives to be a leader, especially in the transition towards renewable energy in aviation. We are immensely proud to have been recognised in these two areas, and these accolades will serve as further motivation as we continue striving towards becoming one of the world’s greatest service brands.”

Cargo Operator of the Year

Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: “We are honored to receive the prestigious title of Cargo Operator of the Year, the second time in three years. This achievement reflects the unwavering dedication of our team and our crucial role in maintaining Hong Kong’s status as a leading global air cargo hub. As a homegrown carrier, we take immense pride in transporting cargo that matters, leveraging our efficient operations and extensive network. We remain committed to pushing the boundaries of air cargo services and collaborating closely with stakeholders to further establish Hong Kong as a premier gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland with the rest of the world.”

This recognition attests to Cathay Cargo's unwavering pursuit of innovation and excellence in air cargo services. Cathay Cargo’s best-in-class services and solutions are built on a foundation of strategic initiatives and technological advancements that enhance operational efficiency, customer experience, and sustainability.

Cathay Cargo's innovative intermodal services between Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Dongguan exemplify Hong Kong's strategic role as a gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland with the world. By pioneering upstream cargo acceptance in Dongguan for exports and now offering direct sea-air transport for inbound shipments, Cathay Cargo enhances efficiency and connectivity in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

In 2024, Cathay Cargo opened new application programing interfaces (API) that allow forwarders to access its Click & Ship booking platform on their own in-house systems, and refreshed its Cathay Courier special solution by adding piece-level tracking to express delivery for small urgent shipments.

Earlier this year, Cathay Cargo also became the first carrier to adopt the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) ONE Record data protocol in some of its day-to-day operations with forwarders, one year ahead of IATA’s target date for ONE Record implementation in January 2026.

Both Cathay Cargo and the Cathay Cargo Terminal in Hong Kong hold the full set of IATA Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certifications, demonstrating their expertise in handling special cargo. Cathay Cargo Terminal was also one of the first cargo-handling companies to achieve the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) certificate in Asia.

In addition, Cathay Cargo is committed to championing innovation to empower its people while elevating the experience for its customers. Through digital tools such as the digital hub, Cathay Cargo ensures timely interactions with its customers. Meanwhile, the introduction of the Cargo Connect app improves operational efficiency and the experience of its frontline teams by providing easily accessible information such as assigned duties, rosters and flight schedules all in one place.

Eco-Airline of the Year

Sustainability is at the core of Cathay’s purpose — to move people forward in life. In line with this ethos, Cathay has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2050 and transitioning towards more sustainable use of resources and circular solutions along the way.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “At Cathay, we believe that sustainability issues are complex and require collective effort. This recognition highlights the power of collaboration and our commitment to bringing together our people, customers, suppliers, business partners, regulators, and communities for a more sustainable future.”

To accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Cathay launched its Corporate SAF Program in 2022, enabling corporate partners to reduce their indirect emissions associated with air travel and airfreight services. In 2024, the programme firmly established its leading position in Asia, with the introduction of new members and a record commitment of over 6,050 metric tonnes of SAF. Cathay has also successfully conducted SAF uplifts at both Hong Kong and other airports worldwide.

Last year, Cathay also co-initiated the launch of the Hong Kong SAF Coalition together with the Business Environmental Council (BEC). Joining hands with partners from across the value chain, Cathay has taken concrete steps in promoting the development of a supportive SAF policy at its Hong Kong hub.

In addition to addressing climate change, Cathay has made great strides in adopting sustainable and circular solutions for resource use. In particular, Cathay Pacific has committed to reducing its reliance on single-use plastics (SUP), with a pledge to cut the use of passenger-facing SUP items from 7.7 pieces per passenger in 2019 to 1.5 pieces by the end of 2025. As of the end of 2024, Cathay Pacific’s SUP usage had been reduced to 2.6 pieces per passenger.

Navigating complexities

The SAF supply chain remains fragmented, with key challenges arising from feedstock availability, production capacity, logistical infrastructure, and policy inconsistencies across jurisdictions. Current SAF production primarily relies on waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and municipal waste. However, the availability of these resources is constrained, raising concerns over long-term scalability.

Emerging technologies, including power-to-liquid and biomass-based SAF, offer promising alternatives but require significant investment and regulatory approval before they can be commercialised at scale. There is an urgent need for coordinated investment in refining capacity and transportation logistics to support SAF distribution. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF production facilities are not yet integrated into existing fuel supply chains, requiring additional infrastructure development. Transportation bottlenecks, particularly in regions lacking pipeline connectivity, further complicate large-scale SAF deployment.

Policy and regulatory considerations

Regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in SAF market expansion, but disparities between regional policies create operational and financial challenges. The European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) and the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offer contrasting approaches to incentivising SAF adoption, leading to market fragmentation. While the EU has mandated binding SAF blending quotas, the US relies on tax incentives and carbon credit schemes to drive investment. This lack of regulatory alignment complicates international SAF trade and creates uncertainty for investors and suppliers.

The establishment of a globally recognised SAF certification standard, potentially under the oversight of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), was a key recommendation to ensure compliance with sustainability criteria while reducing administrative burdens on producers and air cargo operators.

Growing demand for SAF

Air cargo operators are among the stakeholders pushing for expanded SAF availability, given the sector’s reliance on airfreight and its exposure to carbon reduction mandates. With global SAF demand projected to rise exponentially as governments enforce stricter emissions targets, industry leaders are looking at the necessity of de-risking investments through long-term commitments and financial incentives. One proposed solution is the establishment of SAF offtake agreements, whereby airlines and logistics companies commit to purchasing specific SAF volumes over extended periods.

Such agreements provide financial security to producers and encourage further investment. Additionally, industry stakeholders have advocated for the development of SAF-specific trading platforms to enhance market transparency and liquidity.

SAF supply chains

There are challenges remaining when it comes to the scaling up of SAF production to meet industry demand. While technological advancements and investment strategies continue to evolve, the pace of deployment remains contingent on policy alignment, infrastructure development, and financial backing. To accelerate progress, industry leaders urged governments to establish clear long-term policies, reduce regulatory barriers, and facilitate cooperation in SAF certification and distribution. For the air cargo sector, the transition to SAF is both an operational necessity and a regulatory imperative. As SAF projects move from concept to execution, ensuring a stable and efficient global supply chain will be paramount in achieving aviation’s long-term decarbonisation targets.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-10-at-15.39.16-1080x712.png,N,,2025-03-10 09:50:26.071475

“We’re going to make materials that are based on porous tungsten-based alloys, but they’re optimised for the mechanical and thermal properties we want,” said Balk.

Fusion power, which mimics the sun’s energy generation, offers a clean and limitless energy source.

However, materials that can endure plasma temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius are yet to be developed.

Balk’s team will leverage machine learning to identify alloys that balance durability and efficiency.

UK’s Beth Guiton highlighted the importance of the research, stating, “Keeping the plasma contained without accidentally stopping the fusion reaction or damaging your reactor materials is a challenge and a huge roadblock in this work.”

If successful, this research could bring commercial fusion closer, helping cut emissions and drive the transition to sustainable energy.",https://www.energylivenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Shutterstock_382655644.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 08:50:56.694951

There are few companies that understand this imperative as well as BGN International, which has made clear its aim of guaranteeing energy security while mitigating financial and geopolitical risk.
The idea for traders like BGN International, is to actively reduce global reliance on high-emission fuels while guaranteeing global energy security.
BGN International understands those risks and subsequently takes a different approach - it doesn’t rely on a single technology.
Winston Churchill famously held that the key to energy security was diversity in sources of supply.","As the energy transition steams ahead, the international community faces the crucial question of how to effectively and responsibly gravitate towards low carbon energy. There is an understanding that this must be done in a way that does not trigger economic instability, blackouts and ultimately social backlash.

Many challenges already weigh on energy markets, from the war in Ukraine to Middle East instability so the last thing the world can afford is a sudden, wholesale shift to renewables. Texas’ power crisis in 2021, South Australia’s in 2016, and California’s infamous 2020 blackout are all examples of millions being left without power because of an overzealous rush to renewables.

The key to this puzzle lies in transition fuels that bridge the gap between the energy realities in today’s market and a sustainable future. There are few companies that understand this imperative as well as BGN International, which has made clear its aim of guaranteeing energy security while mitigating financial and geopolitical risk.

There are many lofty visions for the energy transition which focus on an idealist all-renewable clean future, although realists, like BGN International, are aware that there is no such thing as an immediate, perfect solution. Rather, getting to a clean and sustainable future requires a number of steps. Immediate ‘low hanging fruit’ solutions to cut emissions, followed by the expansion of transition fuels to keep powering the economy all the while aspiring to incorporate other clean energy sources into the global supply chain. This has been the basis of the company’s heavy investment in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—all of which BGN International sees as critical bridging, or transition, fuels.

These fuels offer steep emissions reductions compared to traditional fossil fuels like oil and coal. LPG, for example, emits 50% less CO₂ than coal and 20% less than heating oil, making it a cleaner alternative for heating and industrial applications. LNG boasts a 30% greenhouse gas reduction compared to conventional marine fuels (used for both shipping and power generation).

SAF, which is created from biofuels and synthetic processes, offers a whopping 80% lower lifecycle emissions than traditional jet fuel. Those who dream of a decarbonized aviation sector cannot do so without relying on such solutions. The idea for traders like BGN International, is to actively reduce global reliance on high-emission fuels while guaranteeing global energy security.

Indeed, energy security is a major concern as we shift away from fossil fuels. Relying too heavily on any single solution—say battery storage or solar power—causes grid chaos and supply chain issues. California is a prime example - while its policies encourage electrification and reduced emissions, its residents face regular brownouts, blackouts and energy shortages. Strangely, the state often has a surplus of solar power highlighting the inconsistency and inefficiencies of its energy mix.

BGN International understands those risks and subsequently takes a different approach - it doesn’t rely on a single technology. Rather, the company works with governments, industries, and infrastructure partners to facilitate a slow, steady and balanced transition that mitigates the risks of both energy shortages and subsequent economic dislocation. Its core model is paring LPG and LNG investments with renewables, encouraging a transition which does not disrupt activity in an economy that still depend on fossil fuels.

This collaborative approach echoes a principle that has long underpinned energy security. Winston Churchill famously held that the key to energy security was diversity in sources of supply. “Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety and variety alone,” he told Parliament in 1913. His argument has been brought back into sharp focus this year, as geopolitical instability constrained by the world’s reliance on its oil, gas, and coal. The lesson is clear: the more diversified the energy mix, the greater the resilience in times of geopolitical and economic instability.",https://www.gulftoday.ae/gulftoday/uploads/images/2025/03/10/939969.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 07:50:07.230172

“The overall proceeds for Eni group, after accounting for cash adjustments and other items, amount to 2.967 billion euros [$3.2 billion], including a capital increase in Enilive of 500 million euros to support the company's growth plan”, Italy’s state-backed Eni said in an online statement.

“Enilive, with its integrated business model, represents a prime example of the progress of the business satellite model, further confirmed by a post-money valuation of 11.75 billion euros of Equity Value for 100 percent of Enilive's share capital and KKR's commitment to strengthen its role as a key partner through an agreement, announced to the market on 18 February, to increase its stake in Enilive by a further 5 percent”.

Eni’s satellite model involves “creating focused and lean companies able to attract new capital to create value through operating and financial synergies and the acceleration of growth”, in the company’s words.

On February 18, 2025, New York City-based KKR said it has entered into another agreement to acquire a further five percent in Enilive for EUR 587.5 million.

“Having first signed our investment in Enilive in October last year, this transaction reiterates our confidence in the business’ ability to provide innovative and effective emission-reducing technology solutions, in line with our strategy to support transformative energy projects across Europe”, KKR managing director for European infrastructure Marco Fontana said in a statement. “We’re excited to continue working alongside Eni to further establish Enilive as a market leader”.

Enilive produces biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels, as well as offers electric vehicle charging and car sharing.

For Versalis, which makes basic chemicals, chemical products including plastics and biochemical products such as biolubricants, Eni has finalized a plan involving an investment of about EUR 2 billion. The plan “aims to reduce emissions by approximately 1 million tonnes of CO2 [carbon dioxide], currently about 40 percent of Versalis' emissions in Italy”, Eni said last year.

“It includes the set-up of new industrial plants consistent with the energy transition and decarbonization of industrial sites across sustainable chemistry, as well as biorefining and energy storage”, Eni added. “To enable the construction of the new plants, activity at the cracking plants in Brindisi and Priolo, and the polyethylene plant in Ragusa, will be phased out”.

“Eni aims to significantly reduce Versalis' exposure to basic chemicals, a sector that is facing structural and irreversible decline in Europe, and which has led to economic losses that have been close to 7 billion in cash terms over the last 15 years, 3 billion of which was in the last five years”, the company said.

Eni expects to complete the plan by 2029.

In February 2025, Microsoft reported a 30% increase in emissions since 2020, primarily due to its AI data centre buildout.

Microsoft’s 2023 report, “Accelerating Sustainability with AI”, laid out five steps the world needs to take to unlock its full potential:

Invest in AI for sustainability

Develop infrastructure for the inclusive use of AI for sustainability

Minimise resource use in AI infrastructure

Advance AI policy principles and governance

Build workforce capacity to use AI for sustainability.

The company has released another report, titled “Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future”, exploring progress on each of these steps.

The foreword, written by Microsoft’s Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President, and Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “At Microsoft, we believe the world needs AI that is broadly accessible and trustworthy, this also includes addressing the sustainability challenges associated with this technology.

“Across our sustainability work, we regularly assess our progress and adjust our strategies for greater impact.

“One lesson from this last year is that minimising the sustainability impact of AI operations requires more than minimising resource use in datacenter operations; it also requires supporting the communities where data centres are located and expanding access to zero carbon electricity.”

Investing in AI for sustainability

Microsoft says that AI can help to accelerate the transition to net zero energy which will support the decarbonisation of AI data centres.

More than 40% of global CO₂ emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation.

LineVision, a company Microsoft has invested in, is working with National Grid in Upstate New York to deploy dynamic line rating technology on transmission lines that can help to unlock the power of renewables.

In some regions, this technology has increased transmission capacity by up to 60%.

Microsoft is also working directly with renewable energy companies to optimise energy production.

It says the use of reinforcement learning and Microsoft Azure high-performance computing can help to optimise wind farm performance, predict maintenance needs and enhance energy production efficiency and reliability.

Microsoft’s investments extend beyond the energy transition too.

The loan, disbursed by the Loan Programs Office under the Inflation Reduction Act, would allow manufacturer Calumet to expand a sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Montana. Currently, the facility produces 140 million gallons per year of biofuels; the expansion would more than double production to 315 million gallons and generate 500 jobs.

Biofuels have been in development for decades but have recently come to the fore as an alternative to dirty fossil fuels used in the aviation industry. Biofuels are made from plant and animal material, which is often waste from food production, and making and using these fuels generates less heat-trapping air pollution than collecting and using the same amount of fossil fuels.

Unlike making aircraft electric — which requires extensive modifications to the equipment — biofuel can be used in the same engines as traditional fuel. That makes it an easy change to make immediately.

That's good news for the planet because excess heat-trapping gases from air pollution are overheating the Earth.

That causes damage to the environment and crops and leads to dangerous natural disasters. Much of that air pollution comes from the aviation industry — 2.5% of global heat-trapping gas emissions in 2023, per the International Energy Agency. Reducing that pollution is one of the necessary steps in getting the world's temperature in check.

While this is good news, this isn't the last word on the subject.

Like everything else around us, aviation is changing too, and it does so at a rapid pace. From new ways to power the planes to new and more efficient shapes of airplanes' bodies, the biggest players in the industry are working head-to-head with startups to advance their goals.

One way the industry plans to evolve is to turn to a blended wing body (BWB) design. That's a type of aircraft that integrates both wings and body into a seemingly unique design, allowing it to use a larger surface to generate lift.

It's an idea that has been tested before, but because of its limitations, including the fact that the plane's shape could prove a nightmare for the evacuation of the occupants in case of an emergency, it never stuck.

The first time somebody tried to design a blended wing body was in the 1920s, when something called the Westland Dreadnought came to be. Many decades later, in the 1990s, McDonnell Douglas and NASA created something called the BWB-17. Research into this was also conducted by Airbus and Bombardier.

And now a California startup called JetZero believes it has what it takes to create the world's first passenger blended wing body aircraft. It doesn't have a proper stage name yet (as far as we can tell it is known internally as the Z5), and the full details on it are not entirely known, but the pieces are slowly falling into place.

Photo: JetZero

JetZero says it will fly a demonstrator of its BWB as soon as 2027, and last week it gave us a few details on what to expect in terms of the engines powering it and some of the other systems that will be used.

As far as the engines are concerned, the company settled on the PW2040 made by Pratt & Whitney. It's the same powerplant that powers the Boeing 757 aircraft (including the military C-32A version), and from which the F117 deployed in the C-17 Globemaster III aircraft is derived. It comes with a power output of between 37,000 and 43,000 pounds of thrust, but we're not told how much it will spit out in the JetZero BWB.

Another company, Collins Aerospace, has been tasked with making the nacelle structures for the engines, including the inlet, fan cowl, fan duct, fairings, and the engine support structure.

The demonstrator plane will be used by the company to validate the key technologies that will go into the final design. When ready to be made, the BWB will be offered in three main variants, namely jetliner, freighter, and trainer. A fourth application, aerial refueling tanker, is also being considered.

As far as the passenger BWB is concerned, we're told it should provide the same capabilities as that of a widebody aircraft, meaning a capacity of about 250 passengers. Because the engines will be installed on top of the aircraft, it should also be a lot quieter that existing designs.

Photo: JetZero

The BWB will be capable of flying on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but it will also burn about half the amount the comparable planes (meaning conventional tube-and-wing ones) of today are burning. That's because of its design, which creates less drag, increases the lifting surface area, and provides even load and lift distribution. On top of it all, the entire plane should be lighter than existing planes in the same class.

Because of all of the above, but also thanks to the fact the BWB could easily use existing airport infrastructure, some of the aviation industry's biggest players have already been drawn to the idea. Delta Airlines, for instance, joined the party back in 2021, looking at ways of ""how to best commercialize the aircraft.""

The U.S. Air Force (USAF) is interested in the technology as well, and back in 2023 it granted JetZero an award to help it build its full-scale demonstrator. As a side note, these guys are not the only ones the USAF is looking at in its quest to find a suitable BWB, with a total of $235 million on the military branch's table to get to the right solution.

It was almost one year ago to the day when JetZero announced it had received an Airworthiness Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The certificate was awarded back then for a scale model of the blended-wing prototype called Pathfinder, a rather small machine by comparison with the final design – it only comes with a wingspan of 23 feet (seven meters).

JetZero is not the only company presently looking at blended wings as a potential solution for an aviation revolution. The same can be said for a crew called Natilus, which is working on a large variety of cargo drones that have been designed in such a way. It's unclear exactly when these guys will fly their creation for the first time.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/first-blended-wing-body-aircraft-in-decades-to-fly-with-pratt-whitney-engines-248176_1.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 05:50:17.027951

Read the full interview for deeper insights:

Q. DHL has been a steadfast supporter of SMEs over the years. Can you share some specific ways in which DHL has helped SMEs navigate the challenges of global trade?

A. We have always believed that SMEs are the backbone of the economy. Today,India has 633.9 lakh registered MSMEs, contributing 30% ofits GDP and over 40 per cent ofits exports. Despite this, the most reported challenge for MSMEs, particularly in Asian countries, has been the limited information on international markets and lack of understanding of foreign traderegulatory requirements apart from the gap in skillsets. Hence,we see our global initiative, DHLGoTrade, as an important initiative to empower entrepreneurs from developing countries to access global markets.DHL Express in India has been working with non-profits to skill and enable women entrepreneurs and MSMEs to take their first steps into e-commerce and eventually equipping them to become proficient in cross-border trade.

In India, we have signed an MoU and are working with our government through the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Ministry of Commerce, to equip Indian MSMEs with the necessary tools and knowledge to thrive in the international e-commerce market. The objective is to build a start-up kitfor first-time MSMEs by handholding them through the process of going global. It will cover 76 districts in three phases, and DHL is providing capacity-building sessions, training, and workshops to make these Indian MSMEs export-ready. This collaboration was recently extended via the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) to Indianjewellery exporters. Here we aim to make the jewellery exporters more competitive in the global arenaby leveraging our time-definite solutions, which in turn leads to faster customs clearance processes and less paperwork, resulting in shorter transit times.

We also have severalIT tools such asMy Global Trade Services (MyGTS), MyDHL+, and services like On-Demand Delivery (ODD) that are incredibly beneficial for our customers, are particularly useful for SMEs. For example, using MyGTS, an AI powered tool, a small business or a growing e-commerce merchant can instantly calculate the estimated duties and taxes for the shipment, the landed cost, compare differences across international trade lanes, and help one comply with import and export regulations easily.

Q. Please tell us more about the Go Trade initiative—what are its core objectives and key elements? Are there any success stories that demonstrate the lasting impact of this program on SMEs?

A. DHL GoTrade helps us foster international trade and promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by empowering SMEs to engage in cross-border commerce. Our expertise lies in logistics,customs, and trade. Leveraging this, we aim to educate SMEs on the strategic advantages of global trade and equip them with the necessary tools to access international markets. Having said that, this is only one part of the GoTrade story.

One of DHL's signature programs under GoTradeis a collaboration with Prayatna NGO to establish Enterprise Resource Centres that providetrainers, machines, raw materials, and other necessities. This resource centre model aims to provide new skills or improve existing ones, allowing beneficiaries to start their own businesses eventually.We are extremely happy to share that the women beneficiaries we trainedhave experienced a 178% increase in their income. 25 of our beneficiaries have also established independent micro-businesses, investing in their own business transactions.

Additionally, we are working with Vrutti NGO on an accelerator program that will bring 200 MSMEs on board the government-approved ONDC e-commerce platform. The collaboration aims to boost growth and foster sustainable local economies.

Q. Sustainability has become a critical focus for businesses worldwide. How is DHL Express embedding sustainability into its operations and services?

A. Sustainability has been a fundamental pillar of the DHL Group. We understand that our decisions today have a lasting impact on future generations; therefore, our corporate social responsibility is not only a business mandate but our purpose. This purpose drives our actions, aligning them with our values and goals.

At DHL, our purpose – ‘Connecting People, Improving Lives’ is deeply ingrained in our DNA. It influences our decision-making process, as we consciously consider the world we operate in. Our current goals are closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

To ensure progress, we have integrated social, environmental and governance goals into our Corporate Strategy 2030. Our bottom lines, which reflect our commitments, include being an employer of choice, a provider of choice, an investment of choice, as well as being a green logistics of choice. Through this framework, we measure our progress and focus our efforts on achieving these commitments. For instance, we have added the GoGreen Plus service to our product portfolio to enable customers to leverage sustainable aviation fuel and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of their international deliveries. We are also set to lead the way in sustainable aviation, aiming to have at least 30% of our operations powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. Our journey towards sustainability is not isolated.We also believe in actively involving our people as the foremost flag bearers of our sustainable programs.

Q. DHL aims to achieve ambitious sustainability targets, such as electrifying last-mile deliveries and increasing the use of sustainable fuels. What progress has been made so far, and what challenges remain in achieving these goals?

A. The most notable progress is that we are one of the few organisations worldwide and the first in logistics to take a stand in reducing our Scope 1,, 2, and 3 emissions. We are doing what is technically feasible and commercially viable right now.

We have set milestones to focus our efforts and measure our progress. These transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs are integral to our strategic planning and decision-making processes, much like our financial goals. By 2030, over the base of 2021, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to <29m metric tons of carbon* by doubling down and accelerating decarbonization measures across all operations.

- Target >30% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) blending in our Express and Global Forwarding businesses.

- Electrify 66% of our last-mile delivery vehicles.

- Leverage a carbon neutral design for all new buildings.

As of 2023, DHL Group is incredibly proud that we have made significant headway against these targets. In 2021, GHG emissions stood at 40 million metric tons. Comparatively, in 2023, this was reduced to 33 million metric tons CO2e.In 2023, we sourced 14% of global SAF supply for our own aircrafts, achieving a ratio of 3.2% – the highest of any global airline.By 2023, over half of our 66% last-mile electrification target was already achieved, as 37.6% of our pickup and delivery vehicles were electrified.

The primary challenge we face in our journey toward sustainability is the commercial viability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). While SAF and other sustainable fuels are available, their high price point presents significant barriers to scaling their use effectively. To successfully transition to an electrified delivery fleet in India, it is essential to establish a robust charging infrastructure and ensure the ongoing availability of electric heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs), which are still in the process of expanding. Nevertheless, DHL remains unwavering in its commitment to decarbonization, recognizing that collaboration with our customers and suppliers is essential to make sustainable solutions commercially viable. With our global reach and innovative approach, we are dedicated to leading the logistics industry toward a more sustainable future.

Q. India is a cost-sensitive market. How is DHL ensuring that its sustainable logistics solutions remain accessible and affordable for Indian SMEs? What advice would you give to SME leaders who are skeptical about its ROI or view it as a secondary priority- particularly in markets like India and China?

A. We recognize the cost-sensitive nature of the Indian market and have designed our sustainable logistics solutions, including the GoGreen Plus program. Our goal is to remain as ‘insanely customer centric’ as possible. Therefore, the right of choice remains with the customer. While booking a shipment, customers will have two options to select the GoGreen Plus service with DHL Express: either on a contractual basisor by choosing shipping service through MyDHL+, DHL Express’ online shipping and tracking platform. Via the contractual model, the customer decides how much they would like to reduce their CO2e and how much to invest in SAF. Complete flexibility is offered in this case. DHL Express uses the contribution to invest in SAF.

Sustainability has become a strategic imperative for SMEs, significantly influencing their long-term value and credibility. To better understand the growing prioritization of sustainability across the supply chain operations, DHL Express conducted an in-depth survey of 5,000 SME decision makers across 11 markets: the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, China, Singapore, Japan, Mexico, Canada and India. Findings show that SMEs in India and China are leaning towardsustainable logistics practices. 72% of Chinese SMEs and 59% of Indian SMEs said that sustainability is “extremely important” to their business – versus a global average of 35%. Globally, SMEs are not confident their customers are on board with paying extra for sustainable shipping options: across all countries, most SMEs said their customers would only be “slightly willing” to pay. In contrast, 51% of SMEs in India and 47% of SMEs in China think their customers would be “extremely” or “very” willing to pay more for sustainable shipping – versus a global average of 29%.

We believe that embracing sustainable practices not only strengthens brand reputation and fosters customer loyalty but also equips businesses to adapt to future regulatory changes and evolving market preferences that prioritize green operations. Through DHL's diverse initiatives and tailored solutions, we empower SMEs to make gradual yet impactful strides toward integrating sustainability into their operations, helping them stay competitive while contributing to a more sustainable future.

Q. What role do you see the government playing in steering the logistics industry toward a more sustainable future? Are there any policy interventions or incentives that you think are critical to this transition?

A. Sustainability is becoming an important focus for businesses across industry segments. We see this daily as more customers from different industries sign up for our GoGreen Plus service. The DHL Global Sustainability Survey also supports this claim with real data. The government is already making significant strides in sustainability, from expanding renewable energy and implementing the National BiodiversityAction Plan to advancing the Smart Cities Mission. Government involvement will help guide sustainable logistics progress, and we look forward to seeing what the upcoming union budget has in store for us.

Q. What role do consumers play in driving sustainable practices across the logistics chain?

A. Customers need to have a similar interest in making a drastic difference in the way they operate. With the introduction of GoGreen Plus in the market, we realised that the demand for the service was always there. Our customers too want to be more socially and environmentally responsible. To date, over 6000 customers have signed up with us for our GoGreen Plus service, highlighting their commitment to sustainability as well as their demand driving us to do better.

Q. With the rise of e-commerce, how is DHL addressing the challenge of scaling operations sustainably to meet the growing demand for fast and green delivery services?

A. We are consciously making an effort to incorporate responsible practices into our systems and processes. For example,through GoGreen Plus, we leverage SAF to “inset” greenhouse gas emissions while also meeting customer demand. While GoGreen Plus is the first-of-its-kind service in the industry, we also are amongst the largest users of SAF in the world.

Q. Looking ahead, what are the key trends you foresee shaping the logistics sector in the next five to ten years?

A. The logistics industry is on the cusp of significant transformation over the next five years. Trends shaping the industry over the next decade would include:

- Sustainability: Sustainability is at the top of everyone's agenda. The emerging trends carry a significant impact on decarbonization, alternative energy solutions, circularity, and environmental stewardship. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are becoming a priority in the express logistics industry to promote the global harmonization of sustainability. The express industry will also see a rise in investments in e-cargo planes.

- Digitalization: Digitalization has created exciting and endless possibilities and coupled with automation we are witnessing a rapid transformation in express logistics to set us up for the next decade, enabling growth across the world, especially for India for our largeSME market. Digitalization and automation solutions have helped supply chains to become more streamlined and ensured durable sustainability for businesses even when faced with interruptions. The operations playbook in express logistics is now enriched with rapidly evolving technologies such as blockchain for secure transactions and across-the-supply-chain visibility, Internet of Things for real-time visibility and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to minimize manual intervention and leverage our skilled labour for more strategic tasks.",https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/DHL RH Subramanian Cover.JPG,N,,2025-03-10 05:50:58.063884

The product, which is further processed into synthetic kerosene, will then be used in engine tests by turbine manufacturers and research partners.","In order to achieve the climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that are difficult to electrify. ""Air traffic in particular will be dependent on sustainably produced kerosene for the foreseeable future,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from the Institute of Micro Process Engineering (IMVT) at KIT. ""Synthetic fuels that are produced using power-to-liquid processes withCO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water and green electricity are particularly suitable."" Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus project P2X and leads the corresponding research work at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: the globally unique coupling of the innovative and highly efficient water vapor/CO2 ""Co"" electrolysis technology of industrial partner Sunfire on an industrially relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis power) directly with synthesis.

Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient

Synthetic kerosene is produced at the KIT Energy Lab in a multi-stage process in modular plants. First, synthesis gas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - is produced fromCO2 and water. In principle, the synthesis gas can be produced in various ways. In the new configuration, a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire is used, which simplifies this process step and, above all, makes it more efficient. ""The special thing about co-electrolysis is that it electrochemically and highly efficiently converts water vapor andCO2 directly into synthesis gas in a single step. Up to 85 percent of the electrical energy used for this is recovered as chemical energy in the synthesis gas. In addition, the coupling demonstrated that our co-electrolysis has very high system availability and reliability and was therefore able to deliver synthesis gas of the desired quality at all times,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire. ""This eliminates the usual separate hydrogen production with downstream synthesis gas production, which significantly increases the efficiency of the overall process towards synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the researchers also integrated a compressor with safety devices into the process chain, with which the synthesis gas is brought to reaction pressure. The synthesis gas is then converted into long-chain hydrocarbons - known as syncrude - in a microstructured reactor using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products. This reactor technology was developed by scientists at KIT and is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a spin-off from KIT. In the future, the heat generated during synthesis will also be used in the form of steam for co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy requirement of the entire process and demonstrate the product preparation for the target product kerosene on this scale. The combination of these process steps allows optimum utilization of the carbon dioxide used and the greatest possible energy efficiency, as the material flows within the process chain can be efficiently recycled in addition to the energy flows.

One ton of kerosene per day in the next step

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to one hundred liters of syncrude per day. The coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus project P2X. The plant is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters of syncrude per day. In the third and final funding phase, the research team is building a larger Fischer-Tropsch production plant in parallel through INERATEC in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""Production on a ton scale will be realized there for the first time,"" says Dittmeyer. The product, which is further processed into synthetic kerosene, will then be used in engine tests by turbine manufacturers and research partners. Accompanying analyses will ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.

About the Kopernikus project P2X

In the Kopernikus project P2X, the partners Climeworks, Sunfire, INERATEC and the Institute of Micro Process Engineering at the KIT Energy Lab are setting up and operating an integrated process chain. Following the ""power-to-fuel"" concept,CO2-neutral fuels, also known as e-fuels, can be produced in this way. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the project.

El futuro del SAF y la disputa por el cultivo múltiple La aviación enfrenta el enorme desafío de reducir sus emisiones sin comprometer la eficiencia del transporte aéreo.
El rechazo de Estados Unidos a la propuesta de ICAO parece más una maniobra de defensa de su industria agrícola que un verdadero argumento ambiental.","El crecimiento de la aviación y su impacto en el cambio climático han llevado a la Organización de Aviación Civil Internacional (ICAO) a buscar estrategias para reducir las emisiones de carbono en los vuelos comerciales. Entre sus últimas recomendaciones, aprobadas en el Comité de Protección Ambiental de la Aviación (CAEP), se encuentra el impulso del cultivo múltiple para la producción de Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

ICAO es el organismo especializado de las Naciones Unidas encargado de establecer estándares y regulaciones para la aviación global. Su objetivo es garantizar la seguridad, eficiencia y sostenibilidad del transporte aéreo, incluyendo iniciativas para reducir las emisiones de carbono.

En la lucha contra el cambio climático, ICAO lanzó en 2016 el programa CORSIA (Esquema de Compensación y Reducción de Carbono para la Aviación Internacional, por sus siglas en inglés), diseñado para mitigar el impacto ambiental del sector. CORSIA establece que las aerolíneas deben compensar sus emisiones de CO₂ a través de distintas estrategias, como el uso de biocombustibles sostenibles (SAF, por Sustainable Aviation Fuel), inversiones en eficiencia energética y adquisición de créditos de carbono. Su meta es lograr un crecimiento neutro en emisiones a partir de 2027 y reducir significativamente la huella de carbono de la aviación hacia 2050.

Para cumplir con estos objetivos, ICAO busca expandir la producción de materias primas elegibles para SAF, incluyendo residuos agrícolas, aceites usados, biomasa lignocelulósica y cultivos específicos producidos utilizando prácticas agrícolas de bajo impacto ambiental. Dentro de estas se encuentran el cultivo múltiple o multicropping como se lo conoce en inglés.

La encrucijada del SAF: el fallo de la corte europea que redefine el futuro de la aviación sostenible

El cultivo múltiple

El cultivo múltiple es una técnica agrícola que consiste en cultivar dos o más cosechas en la misma superficie en un mismo año, optimizando el uso del suelo sin necesidad de expandir la frontera agrícola. En el caso de los biocombustibles, esto permitiría aprovechar cultivos de invierno como la colza, la carinata y la camelina sin desplazar la producción de alimentos.

Países como Brasil, Argentina y Uruguay han adoptado esta práctica con éxito, promoviendo la siembra de oleaginosas invernales en campos que de otro modo quedarían improductivos entre cosechas principales. Sin embargo, la iniciativa ha encontrado un fuerte opositor: Estados Unidos.

La objeción de Estados Unidos: ¿preocupación técnica o interés económico?

El gobierno estadounidense ha expresado su rechazo a la recomendación de ICAO, argumentando que la propuesta es “prematura y carece de justificación técnica o científica suficiente”. Según Washington, su implementación podría perjudicar a los agricultores estadounidenses y otorgar una ventaja competitiva injusta a Brasil, un gigante en la producción de materias primas para biocombustibles.

Los biocombustibles en el transporte marítimo: un potencial inmenso con desafíos a superar

Pero, ¿hasta qué punto esta oposición se basa en fundamentos técnicos? En el fondo, la disputa parece tener un fuerte componente geopolítico y comercial. Estados Unidos ha apostado históricamente por cultivos tradicionales como la soja y el maíz para la producción de biocombustibles, con subsidios y regulaciones que favorecen a su propia industria agrícola. El avance de cultivos invernales en Sudamérica podría desafiar su hegemonía en el sector.

Además, el argumento de que la medida incentivaría la deforestación de bosques tropicales es cuestionable. La carinata, la colza y la camelina se cultivan en tierras ya utilizadas para la agricultura y no requieren expansión de la frontera agrícola. Por el contrario, al aprovechar tierras ociosas en invierno, el cultivo múltiple podría reducir la presión sobre los ecosistemas naturales.

Sudamérica avanza en la producción de oleaginosas para SAF

Mientras Estados Unidos bloquea la iniciativa en ICAO, Sudamérica avanza con fuerza en la incorporación de cultivos de invierno en sus esquemas productivos. En Argentina, la carinata y la camelina han despertado el interés de productores y empresas biotecnológicas, impulsadas por la creciente demanda de SAF.

Una alianza japonesa suma a la industria forestal en la carrera por el SAF

Brasil, con su histórico liderazgo en biocombustibles, ya ha comenzado a integrar cultivos de segunda siembra dentro de su rotación agrícola, aprovechando la infraestructura existente para procesar aceites vegetales en combustibles sostenibles. Uruguay, por su parte, también ha dado pasos firmes en la adopción de estos cultivos, incentivando su producción con políticas alineadas a la reducción de emisiones.

El futuro del SAF y la disputa por el cultivo múltiple

La aviación enfrenta el enorme desafío de reducir sus emisiones sin comprometer la eficiencia del transporte aéreo. En este contexto, el SAF emerge como una de las soluciones más viables, y el multicropping podría ser una estrategia clave para garantizar su producción sin competir con los alimentos.

El rechazo de Estados Unidos a la propuesta de ICAO parece más una maniobra de defensa de su industria agrícola que un verdadero argumento ambiental. En un mundo donde la transición energética es inminente, la pregunta no es si el multicropping será una alternativa viable, sino cuándo terminará de consolidarse a nivel global.

Sudamérica ya está dando los primeros pasos, mientras Washington se mantiene firme en su posición. ¿Se trata de una legítima defensa de sus agricultores o de una estrategia para preservar su dominio en los biocombustibles? El tiempo y las políticas internacionales darán la respuesta.",https://i0.wp.com/www.bioeconomia.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Estados-Unidos-desafia-la-propuesta-de-ICAO-sobre-doble-cultivo-para-SAF-proteccion-agricola-o-estrategia-geopolitica.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 01:51:29.033950

The scheme could be a £100m investment in the district, and is said to set new sustainability standards for treating waste in the UK in a flagship scheme announced for West Berkshire.
The facility proposes to turn residual waste into usable products, including bio-naphtha for use in sustainable available fuel, hydrogen and solid carbon.
The proposed facility will take residual waste, as shredded waste flock, from local waste sources, to produce a source of fuel and solid carbon.
The applicant says the creation of bio-naphtha as a product of the process also helps to support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector as it can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","The Government has stepped in on whether to allow West Berkshire Council to decide whether the first hi-tech waste recycling plant in the country producing aviation fuel can go ahead in Theale.

The scheme could be a £100m investment in the district, and is said to set new sustainability standards for treating waste in the UK in a flagship scheme announced for West Berkshire.

The site, at Theale Quarry, aims to use a process called pyrolysis – the chemical decomposition of organic material with heat in the absence of oxygen.

But the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government has called the application in, so it can decide instead of the council.

No reason has been given.

“No one thinks of waste treatment as sexy or fun, but when it comes to carbon removal I am really rather proud there is a site being considered here in West Berkshire,” said Vicky Poole (Lib Dem, Burghfield and Mortimer) at Wednesday’s eastern area planning committee, which was in favour of the scheme.

The facility proposes to turn residual waste into usable products, including bio-naphtha for use in sustainable available fuel, hydrogen and solid carbon.

There is no burning or combustion and therefore there are no emissions.

The process proposed for this site is protected by patent.

It results in a controllable process and produces a high-quality fuel gas, bio-naptha, and the proposed facility will be the first full-scale commercial operation of its type in the country.

The feedstock for the process will come from non-recyclable, non-hazardous residual waste that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated.

The planned development consists of two large single-storey industrial buildings, with two two-storey buildings for staff welfare.

The proposed facility will take residual waste, as shredded waste flock, from local waste sources, to produce a source of fuel and solid carbon.

The applicant says this will help to reduce the environmental impacts associated with landfilling and incineration, as well as reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The process also has the capacity to achieve highly significant levels of carbon capture with the whole process calculated to be overall carbon negative. and can play an important part in meeting the council’s climate change targets, as well as supporting the UK’s aims to be carbon net zero by 2050.

The applicant says the creation of bio-naphtha as a product of the process also helps to support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector as it can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

The development is expected to provide jobs for approximately 36 people, working a three-shift system.",https://www.newburytoday.co.uk/_media/img/U2QLU66VGI0X0H7GWT95.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 01:51:36.012149

The new arrangement, a source familiar with the development hinted is coming on the heels of infractions associated with the operations of private jets in the last few years forcing the government to lose over N120 billion .

Besides the huge revenue loss, the government, it was learnt is not comfortable with infractions associated with the business jet value , which could jeopardize national security, deepen illicit activities as well as advance drug trafficking and money laundering.

Part of measures considered to clean up private jet operations may include temporary closure of the General Aviation Terminal (GAT), at Abuja Airport and other aerodromes majorly utilised by fixed based operators.

The Federal Government is embarking on these measures to enable the country optimise benefits in the burgeoning private jet global market which has grown from $28.01 billion in 2024 to $30.08 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4 per cent.

The growth in the historic period, experts say is attributed to rising demand for business travel increasing need for private aircraft, growing wealth among high-net-worth individuals boosted private jet purchases, increasing global economic growth, rising frequency of international travel expanding the market for long-range private jets and increasing adoption of fractional ownership programs making private flying more accessible.

Global air transport data base provider : Statista projects that private aircraft market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years.

According to Statista data , private jet operations will grow to $39.62 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1per cent.

It projected growth in the forecast period as attributable to expansion of on-demand private jet services. It cited the anticipated growth to be triggered by technological advancements in aircraft efficiency and safety, growing emphasis on personalized travel experiences occasioning increase in private jet usage, increasing number of high-net-worth individuals in emerging economies.

The data listed other drivers to include : technological advancements by major companies that will introduce more efficient and eco-friendly private aircraft models, increased adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the rise of hybrid and electric private aircraft , which is expected to transform the industry, growing demand for customized and luxury interiors.

Only last week, Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Mr Festus Keyamo vowed to tackle all illegal chartered operations and related matters in Nigeria.

Keyamo spoke while receiving the report of the seven-member committee on illegal chartered operations and related matters at the ministry’s headquarters in Abuja.

The minister said the issue of illegal charter operations by private jets and private aircraft owners has been besetting Nigeria’s aviation sector.

He said those who obtain licences under the permit for non-commercial flight (PNCF) use the aircraft for other illegal transactions.

Keyamo said the federal government is poised to mitigate the acts, pledging that his ministry will not fail to safeguard the aviation industry in line with its mandate.

“This practice has been going on for many years before I became Minister, but I thought there was a need to confront it headlong,” he said.

“When you cannot track them, it leads to money laundering, drug trafficking, illegal entry and exits into the country and all kinds of illegal activities.”

Keyamo commended the efforts of the task force in producing the report and outlining recommendations to tackle the challenge.

He assured that the ministry would critically examine the report and its recommendations, stressing that it would not be swept under the carpet.

Meanwhile, during the presentation of the report, Ado Sanusi, chairman of the task force, said the committee conducted a thorough investigation into illegal private charter operations in Nigeria and identified critical challenges which include regulatory weaknesses, loopholes in the PNCF system, inadequate oversight, security vulnerabilities, and significant revenue losses to the government.

Sanusi said the findings pose risks to aviation safety and also create an uneven playing field for legitimate operators.

He said part of the committee’s recommendations is that the government should strengthen regulatory oversight, enhance security measures, improve compliance with aviation laws, and ensure that private charter operations are conducted transparently and in line with international standards.

He appealed to the minister to ensure a quick implementation of the suggestions, saying they would create an economically viable aviation industry in Nigeria.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/26202351/Charter-jets.jpg,N,,2025-03-09 21:50:51.739266
