MUMBAI: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently announced that it has enhanced its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator to account for carbon emissions reductions related to the usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added, said IATA.

“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modelled averages. With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improve—for individual travellers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonisation powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

The development follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which helps airlines and industry stakeholders accurately report SAF-related emissions reductions and sets the accounting foundation baseline in the upcoming IATA SAF registry. It also provides guidance to reflect SAF emissions reduction in per-passenger and per-shipment emissions calculations.

Developed in collaboration with more than 40 airline experts worldwide, the methodology is designed to complement existing international frameworks and to reinforce consistency without duplicating efforts, according to IATA. The IATA methodology fully intends to serve as a reference for both regulatory and voluntary environmental initiatives, it said.

SAF has been identified as the biggest lever in decarbonizing aviation. As airlines scale up SAF, the need for the aviation industry to demonstrate clearly and transparently the emissions reduction from SAF use becomes more eminent, said IATA. ""Clarity in a global and robust SAF accounting framework is essential for SAF deployment and its commercial viability. A robust, feedstock-agnostic, and technology-neutral methodology, irrespective of chain-of-custody used, is critical to avoid double-counting and uphold environmental claims’ integrity,"" it added. A robust and global SAF accounting framework can also help to deploy SAF most efficiently while widening market access of SAF irrespective of its uplift locations, said IATA.

Last month an agreement was signed to establish a joint venture to manufacture and sell bioethanol made from wood biomass. Airbus and JAL have subsequently joined the project and will promote the use and expansion of domestic SAF by collaborating with businesses involved in the supply and demand of SAF.

Plans call for the five companies to work toward enabling a low-carbon society by reducing greenhouse gas emissions during raw material procurement and production, and by producing and selling domestic wood-based bioethanol that has a low life cycle analysis and is compliant with CORSIA (※2). This will be achieved through the developing society's circular economy of ""cutting, using, planting, and growing"" trees, regional revitalization including job creation, and the utilization of domestic SAF.

JAL aims to promote domestically produced SAF and has set a goal of replacing 10% of all onboard fuel with SAF by 2030. By connecting the SAF suppliers with stakeholders involved in production, JAL will advance the construction of a supply chain. Airbus will support the work to obtain the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation certification for the domestic woody biomass of this project and contribute to the industry target to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Avfuel remains committed to leading the industry forward in all aspects of sustainability.","CR Sincock, Avfuel’s Executive Vice President, answers questions on sustainable aviation fuel availability, Avfuel’s investment in SAF production and distribution, and his confidence that business aviation sustainability initiatives will continue even if federal support is lost

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) seems to have been more easily available in the US on the West Coast. Is that still the case?

Since SAF was introduced to business and general aviation operations in 2019, its availability has been heavily concentrated in the West, largely due to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the state’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions.

However, in 2025 we’re seeing a shift as supply infrastructure on the East Coast strengthens. At Avfuel, we’re actively working to close the gap through strategic collaborations, including a new supply relationship with Valero Marketing & Supply Company, and an expanded agreement with Neste.

Through our agreement with Valero, we now have SAF supply sources in Port Everglades, Florida, Linden, New Jersey, and Pasadena, Texas. These locations are instrumental in broadening our reach and ensuring SAF is available at key hubs across the eastern US.

This is supplemented by a proprietary book-and-claim registry that allows Avfuel to effectively sell SAF attributes no matter where an operator flies. With multiple purchasing options, new supply locations coming online and our investment in multimodal delivery methods – including truck and pipeline solutions – we’re ensuring greater nationwide availability of SAF for our customers.

Avfuel sells fuel globally. How are your sustainability efforts looking in overseas markets?

Avfuel operates with a global mindset. Sustainability is a universal challenge, making the demand for SAF grow internationally. In Europe and the UK, regulatory momentum – including ReFuelEU and various SAF mandates – is pushing SAF adoption forward.

We not only continue to monitor those developments, but also directly support them. Along with 24 SAF locations in the US, Avfuel’s customers can purchase physical SAF molecules at 26 locations across the EU and into the UK.

With our focus on supply agreements and the future of fuel, Avfuel is positioned to significantly expand its SAF footprint and help advance global SAF adoption.

Avfuel supplies the full spectrum of aviation segments along with business aviation. Does SAF translate across other segments?

As a drop-in replacement for jet fuel, SAF is a viable solution across all aviation segments. Business aviation operations have been early adopters, driven by the industry’s ability to move quickly on ESG [environmental, social, governance] commitments. However, we’re also working with airline and cargo companies who are increasingly interested in supporting the SAF initiative.

As commitments from these segments grow, the next challenge will be scaling production to keep pace. Scalability will be crucial in ensuring all segments can access SAF at the volumes they require; it will also likely contribute to the price gap between SAF and jet fuel narrowing, which can only further encourage adoption.

Avfuel was among the first companies to offer SAF. How has it differentiated itself from other companies who have since entered the space?

Avfuel has been a leader in SAF’s adoption and supply from the beginning, and remains a definitive leader in supplying SAF to business aviation operations.

Several companies offer sustainability programmes, audits or book-and-claim, but don’t have direct access to physical SAF molecules – they have to source these molecules from other suppliers in order to meet the needs of their end customers. At Avfuel, we provide a full, end-to-end sustainability programme – AvfuelZero – that not only helps customers pinpoint their emissions, set goals and report on their progress, but also effectively reduce emissions with in-house products. These products include physical SAF molecules, carbon credits and a robust book-and-claim system with the highest regard for accuracy, ensuring each environmental attribute is only counted once.

AvfuelZero is a complete, closed system that simplifies what has historically been a complex process. Our aim is to make it easy for operators to adopt sustainable practices by supporting them from end to end, or anywhere in between, with the assistance of ESG experts and the products that make the biggest difference within any budget.

Along with supplying SAF, Avfuel has become an expert industry resource on the matter. Where do you see the SAF market going?

The SAF market is at a critical juncture. With production capabilities expanding, supply chains maturing and increasing adoption rates, 2025 and beyond hold significant potential for SAF to become a mainstream fuel solution. Industry analysts predict continued exponential growth, with Avfuel expecting to once again increase its supply capabilities in 2025 and beyond, particularly with extended supply reach geographically. This is fuelled by strategic agreements with producers including Neste, Valero Marketing & Supply Company, and Gevo, whose new production facility will contribute to a more robust supply chain.

One of the key drivers of market growth will be the advancement of next-generation fuel technologies, which will diversify SAF feedstocks. To this end, Avfuel has made significant investments in technology-driven fuel solutions coming from organisations like AIR Company, Alder Renewables and VerdeGo Aero.

For instance, AIR Company’s carbon conversion technology represents a major step forward in producing SAF from CO2. Similarly, Alder Renewables is advancing woody biomass-based SAF production, while VerdeGo Aero is working on hybrid-electric power solutions to complement sustainable fuel strategies. These collaborations allow Avfuel to remain at the cutting edge of the industry and ensure our customers have early access to next-generation solutions.

As the US changes presidential administrations, what is the state of sustainability initiatives?

No doubt policy will also play a pivotal role in determining the pace of SAF’s market expansion. With the US presidential administration changing, there’s been a bit of uncertainty regarding the future of sustainability initiatives. Federal incentives like the Producers Tax Credit and other state credits have historically supported SAF affordability and production expansion. If these incentives are renewed or expanded, the market could see unprecedented acceleration.

Should federal incentives not be renewed, we still expect state-level initiatives to come into play in the coming years, much like we’ve seen in California with low-carbon fuel standard credits and its new emissions reporting legislation. Support from the states will certainly help maintain progress in sustainability initiatives.

Furthermore, public and private corporations alike have made ESG commitments; we expect those initiatives to remain in place, helping to maintain and grow SAF commitments from business aviation operations.

Avfuel remains committed to leading the industry forward in all aspects of sustainability. Our efforts in securing new supply agreements, investing in future-ready fuel technologies, and working alongside regulatory bodies position us to help customers transition toward a more sustainable future. The SAF market is evolving rapidly, and Avfuel is leading the charge to ensure its success.

Avfuel is also taking a leading stance on removing lead from avgas. Can you provide an update on that initiative?

Beyond SAF, Avfuel has heavily invested numerous resources toward the unleaded avgas initiative. We understand the importance of providing a viable, safe alternative to 100LL, and we’re actively engaged with industry partners to progress this initiative. While there’s still work to be done in terms of approvals and infrastructure, we’re making meaningful progress. Our goal is to ensure orderly, safe and widespread adoption of unleaded avgas while maintaining the reliability and performance that general aviation operators depend on.

Transitioning away from leaded avgas is a complex process, but with industry collaboration and continued investment, we are optimistic about a future where general aviation supports a cleaner world.",https://evaint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/09-Av-Fuel-2-10-25-Florida-596-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 16:56:34.512650

A not-for-profit organisation based in Montreal, Canada, CADO will oversee the SAF Registry’s operations, with IATA providing technical support.

Membership in CADO is open to organisations involved in the SAF value chain, state and quasi-state entities with a direct interest in SAF, and related groups benefiting from SAF adoption in aviation.

IATA sustainability senior vice-president and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA’s SAF Registry aims to provide a global system for tracking SAF transactions in a transparent and standardised manner.

It will facilitate the verification of the environmental benefits of SAF and compliance with regulatory and voluntary schemes.

By connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers worldwide, the registry seeks to address the challenge of limited SAF availability.

It will also enable corporate customers to contribute to in-sector emissions reductions and support decarbonisation efforts.

SINES, Portugal (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia's gasoline exports to the United States could be curtailed if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on European goods, but the company is confident it can find alternative destinations.

Executive Board member Ronald Doesburg, who is in charge of industrial assets, told Reuters on Tuesday that if U.S. demand for gasoline drops as a result of higher prices stemming from the proposed 25% tariffs, Galp will be able to deal with it.

Galp's only refinery in Sines usually produces about 2 million metric tons of gasoline per year, of which between 1.2 million and 1.5 million tons are exported to the United States. The remainder is taken by the Portuguese market.

Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all European goods, raising the risk of a trade war that could prove damaging for export-oriented European companies.

""The energy market is global, gasoline streams are global, and hence our gasoline production will have sufficient flexibility to find its way to different markets,"" Doesburg said.

Tariffs would have an impact, ""but it's an impact that will be managed ... We will look at our options"", he said, adding that Galp has handled trade-related disruptions in the past and that Sines could be realigned towards different types of products, depending on prices and demand.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

In the meantime, Galp continues its shift towards greener fuels and expects to start producing biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste, such as used cooking oil, by mid-2026 at a unit it is building at its refinery, said Galp's head of hydrogen, Sergio Machado.

The 400 million euro ($432 million) Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) plant, a 75% to 25% joint venture with Japan's Mitsui, will have annual production capacity of 270,000 tons and will be using green hydrogen from a 100 megawatt electrolyser that will cost 250 million euros.

""Our expectation is to have both units in production by mid-2026 and to reach cruising speed shortly thereafter,"" Machado said.

In an online statement, the airport claimed it is already one of the “largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021.”

Through the supply deal with H2R, Farnborough Airport will become the “first and only” airport in the world to offer fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, according to CEO, Simon Geere.

The CEO added, “The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen.”

UK and European SAF mandates began taking effect at the start of 2025. Aircraft operators, EU airports and managing bodies must blend an increasing level of SAF with kerosene, starting this year.

“This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill,” claimed Stephen Voller, CEO at H2R.

Non-recyclable waste may be abundant, but its inconsistent composition can undermine syngas quality and SAF yield – an issue the IEA flagged as a key barrier to scaling in 2023.

Offtake agreements offer a way to derisk investment in crucial climate tech.

These four examples of best practices can build a winning offtake strategy.

As the world works towards reducing emissions from fossil fuels, it is increasingly important to develop new technologies that can maintain our quality of life without contributing to climate change. Many promising solutions that could enable a circular carbon economy already exist, but not at the necessary scale. These first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects need to scale up, but that’s easier said than done.

Offtake agreements can boost investments

Scaling up takes financing, which can be difficult to acquire. This is because climate tech projects are inherently risky. New technologies that test well in a lab may not work in the real world. Investors know about these high risks, and don’t want to waste their money. But without investment no new technologies can be developed, preventing new climate tech from coming to market.

Offtake agreements offer a solution to this problem. Under an offtake agreement, a buyer agrees to purchase a certain portion of a seller’s goods once produced, guaranteeing cash flow as soon as the product is ready. This security makes a product seem less risky to investors, significantly increasing funding chances. Plus, offtake agreements demonstrate market interest to stakeholders, boosting a company’s credibility.

The right offtake agreement for each stage: the 'Maslow Pyramid'

Not all offtakes are created equal. Different types of offtake agreements are useful at different stages of a project’s life. Think of this like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, where the bottom of the pyramid is occupied by basic needs that must be fulfilled in order to build up to greater things.

The “Maslow Pyramid of Offtakes” looks a bit like this (bullet points start from the bottom of the pyramid):

Soft agreements: Non-binding letters of intent (LOIs) and memorandums of understanding (MOUs) are essential at the Prototype stage (TRL 4-5). These build early trust without heavy commitments.

Binding agreements: During the pilot/demo phase (TRL 6-7), binding agreements offer legal certainty for short-term engagements or smaller quantities, often tied to conditional milestones.

Bankable agreements: By the time you reach FOAK and NOAK (Nth of a Kind) (TRL 8-9), bankable agreements provide long-term cash flow certainty, crucial for securing major capital and scaling.

When the right offtake agreement type is used, offtakes help founders secure project financing by de-risking projects for investors. Think of offtakes for climate tech as equivalent to Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) for software startups – they're critical indicators of an ability to develop technology the market actually wants and will pay for.

Here are four best practices which can be used to build winning offtake strategies:

1. Don't sell – partner

If you want to succeed in the long run, you have to be strategic from the very beginning. Strategic players repeatedly mention that they aren't interested in signing offtake agreements as customers – they want to be partners for the journey.

Secure key corporate partners who align with your vision at an early stage. This will allow you to collaborate on co-development opportunities, leveraging their expertise and infrastructure to help you refine your product, giving you credibility at an early stage and allowing you to negotiate for favourable terms. Use pilot plants to showcase your technology, allowing partners to test and validate it early.

For example, consider the partnership between Holcim and Sublime Systems, which included both equity investment and offtake agreements, creating a win-win relationship beyond mere customer-supplier dynamics.

2. Diversify offtakers to mitigate risks

Offtakes mitigate risks for investors, but they come with their own risks. Never put all your eggs in one basket. Offtake agreements can fall through, so it’s important to avoid over-reliance on a single customer. Instead, it’s a good idea to engage multiple offtakers across the value chain.

This means you’ll want to move beyond just your own direct offtakers, and start thinking about your offtakers’ offtakers. Having a diverse group of offtakers at different parts of the value chain reduces your vulnerability to market volatility and means that your projects can progress even if one partnership fails.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

3. Design flexible contracts

Uncertainty is a fact of life, so if you want to make investors feel comfortable financing your project, you need to ensure that your offtake contracts are adaptable in the face of those uncertainties. While early-stage agreements are flexible by default, as you move towards more binding agreements you’ll need to balance flexibility and preparedness to get the most out of your offtakes.

Include mechanisms like cost caps, tiered pricing, and competitive bidding to manage risks and align with ever-evolving project realities. Avoid rigid terms that could limit you in the future. Don’t rush into firm commitments, but keep agreements flexible until you’re ready. By staying flexible, you can ensure that both parties can adapt to changes without compromising commitments.

4. Align agreements with offtakers' operational cycles

When making offtake agreements, it helps to remember that your offtakers are running companies of their own, which means they’re also beholden to procurement, R&D, or seasonal cycles. To get the most out of your offtake agreements, integrate them into your offtakers’ normal operational dynamics, ensuring seamless adoption of your product. Tailoring your agreement to their timelines significantly increases the likelihood of success.

Climb the offtake pyramid

Whatever you decide to do, and whoever your offtakers are, offtake agreements are a necessary part of financing your FOAKs. If you play your cards right, you can use your offtake agreements to help you negotiate complexities and balance your scalability needs with customer expectations, manage fluctuating demand and pricing uncertainties, and transition your FOAK projects to scalable, NOAK operations.

Start with low-risk commitments and work your way up to bankable agreements as you deliver on key milestones, and build customer relationships and trust. Take things step by step, be strategic, and soon enough, you'll make these contracts work for you, helping you scale up your solutions and tackle climate change.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_GMr9F4K84fB47M9c4-WWEMagI-IE-_FVdheqRddiTNM.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 15:56:52.858107

The ground tests are planned to happen as of Q3 2025 and the flight tests in 2027. YMX International Aerocity of Mirabel airport managed by ADM (Aéroports de Montréal) will support this collaboration. The CRYSTAL project will be one of the key projects under Espace Aero – the first official Quebec aerospace innovation zone project this year.

The project includes expertise from Polytechnique Montréal, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) and FSM Management Group. Airbus and its partners are in discussion with government programmes including Canada’s Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology (INSAT) and Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Québec (CRIAQ) to support the project.

Mélanie Lussier, president of Aéro Montréal, said, “Espace Aéro is proud to see a major project take shape with CRYSTAL, driven by Airbus’ leadership and its partners. This collaborative initiative, led by CRIAQ and INSAT, perfectly reflects our innovation zone’s commitment to decarbonization and showcases how Quebec’s ingenuity and innovation are helping to shape the sustainable aviation of tomorrow. By bringing together industrial and academic players around concrete solutions, we are strengthening Quebec’s position as a leader in aerospace environmental performance.”

Airbus Head of Future Programs Bruno Fichefeux said, “Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonize aviation. While we've adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionize air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

These technologies were showcased as part of a new concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel cell systems would be supplied via two liquid hydrogen tanks. This concept will continue to be refined over the coming years as additional tests will help mature the technologies associated with hydrogen storage and distribution, as well as with the propulsion systems.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project Glenn Llewellyn added, “Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”

In 2023, Airbus demonstrated a 1.2MW hydrogen-propulsion system, and in 2024, end-to-end testing of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters and heat exchangers was completed.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to ""book"" a certain amount of SAF and ""claim"" the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can help reduce carbon emissions, provides an opportunity for India, where sustainability is high on the agenda, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury has said. One of the world's fastest growing civil aviation markets, Airbus sees ""more and more potential in India"", with one of the senior officials saying the country is nothing but ""growth"" for the company.

Apart from having hundreds of aircraft orders placed by Indian carriers, the plane maker has a joint venture Final Assembly Line (FAL) for C295 aircraft and a FAL for helicopter H125 will be set up this year in India.

Besides, Airbus sources more than 1 billion euros worth of components and services for global exports from the country.

""SAF is an opportunity for India... sustainability is something that is very high on the agenda in India.... India has a bigger share of aviation... of the global aviation. Therefore India has a bigger role and a bigger responsibility to play in the global equation,"" Guillaume Faury told PTI on Monday.

He was speaking to PTI on the sidelines of the Airbus Summit 2025 in Toulouse.

Aviation accounts for around 2-3 per cent of the global carbon emissions and SAF can help in reducing these emissions.

By replacing 10 per cent of global jet fuel consumption with SAF, the aviation industry could reduce the emissions by around 50 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year, as per Airbus.

India has a great potential to become a SAF producer, Head of SAF and CDR Developments Sustainability Organisation at Julien Manhes said.

For SAF production, the country can look at utilising its ethanol supplies and availability of lipids feedstocks like non-edible industrial oils.

Talking about the development of the global aviation sector, Faury said the first revolution was about getting in the air more than a century ago and the second was to have a safe mode of transport.

""The third was making travel affordable for people. Going to sustainability, which is the fourth revolution, we do not want to lose the benefits of what we have achieved so far,"" he emphasised.

Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus Christian Scherer told PTI on Monday that the company is growing its supply chain in India.

""We are increasing our supply, whether it is engineering services where India is really good, it is intellectual supply compared to metallurgical supplies. We are also increasing our metallurgical supplies,"" he said and stressed that ""India is nothing but growth for Airbus"".

Executive Vice President Operations of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus Florent Massou said there are more and more products being made and also sourced from India.

""We see a lot of opportunities... we see more and more potential in India.... many companies are ramping up their capabilities, automotive for instance... we are having a lot of discussions with them and see under which conditions they could join our club of suppliers,"" he said.

Production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by Biden administration incentives.

Stakeholders in the aviation industry must navigate these changes carefully, as the stakes are becoming higher.","The future of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) under United States President Donald Trump in this new year is uncertain. Trump’s administration has promised to significantly scale back federal efforts to mitigate climate change, which could impact the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by Biden administration incentives. But early moves by the Trump administration are fuelling uncertainty about what will come next in the United States and ultimately globally.

SAF is a fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including, but not limited to; the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10 percent and 50 percent, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.

The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included a tax credit for SAF production, has been frozen by Trump’s administration. This tax credit was crucial for the development of SAF, as it helped bridge the price gap between SAF and traditional petroleum-based fuel. The Trump administration has also removed some federal web pages related to SAF initiatives, including sites detailing the $244.5 million in grant funding the FAA allocated last year to SAF projects, according to reports.

Also, the Trump administration’s potential increase in tariffs on imported goods from China could affect the availability of non-petroleum feedstocks needed for SAF production.

Despite these challenges, some experts believe that the SAF industry could still thrive under Trump’s administration. For example, Trump’s focus on rural economic priorities could lead to an increase in corn-based ethanol production, which could be used as a feedstock for SAF.

However, the long-term outlook for SAF under Trump’s administration remains uncertain. The industry relies heavily on government incentives and support, which could be reduced or eliminated under Trump’s administration.

IATA estimates that SAF will be responsible for 65 percent of the emissions reductions that will be required for the industry to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, also adopted by the United Nations aviation arm. It seems SAF is entering a turbulent future, with many questions arising from the uncertainty that currently clouds it around achieving net zero.

Less than four years after boldly pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2050, IATA appears to be dropping the target. Willie Walsh, IATA director general, speaking at an industry event in Phoenix, expressed strong doubts airlines could meet their emissions goals in the next 25 years. Facing a diverse audience of financiers, lessors, banks, and industry stakeholders, Walsh acknowledged for the first time that the sector is unlikely to meet its long-standing target. This admission not only marks a turning point for IATA but also calls for deep thinking about the feasibility of the aviation industry’s current sustainability plans.

The benefits of SAF point to how fundamental its production is for achieving net zero. The aviation industry accounts for 2.5 percent of global Co2 emissions, but it has contributed around four percent to global warming to date, say reports. With SAF, however, it has the potential to lower flight emissions by 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. It is also a drop-in fuel, meaning there is no need for modifying aircraft or constructing new fuelling stations. SAF produces fewer harmful pollutants and contains lower levels of sulphur and aromatic components, allowing aircraft engines to burn more cleanly and generate less pollution compared to conventional fuels.

Perhaps there are indications that the ESG landscape is in a state of flux. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have officially exited the Net Zero Banking Alliance, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse around financial commitments to climate goals. Their departures signal not just a retreat from collective climate pledges but also raise questions about the future of net zero ambitions among U.S. banks.

From high-profile exits of major banks to ambitious corporate sustainability goals, the actions taken now will shape the future of responsible investing and corporate accountability.

This move by Airbus marks a step forward in the effort to make aviation more environmentally responsible.","Sustainable aviation fuel is getting a major push forward thanks to a new initiative by Airbus, which has launched a “Book and Claim” system to make SAF more accessible and scalable.

Through this model, Airbus aims to overcome existing challenges that limit the adoption of sustainable fuels, especially for smaller operators and those located far from SAF supply points.

The Book and Claim approach allows buyers to “book” a specific amount of SAF and “claim” the related emissions reductions, even if the physical fuel is used elsewhere. This system separates the sustainability benefits from the actual delivery of fuel, creating flexibility and opening the door for wider use of SAF across the aviation sector.

As part of a year-long pilot program running throughout 2025, Airbus will act as a facilitator by purchasing SAF certificates and managing them through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognized certification body. These sustainability attributes will then be resold to interested customers—ranging from aircraft to helicopter operators—helping to create short-term demand for SAF and support long-term growth.

SMBC Aviation Capital was the first company to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to support this program. Other key partners who have since confirmed their interest include AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup. Their participation reflects a growing commitment across the aviation industry to scale SAF adoption through innovative and collaborative models.

The pilot is expected to generate valuable insights into the operational capacity and effectiveness of the Book and Claim system. Airbus will use these findings to explore the potential for third-party facilitation of similar SAF solutions and gauge broader market interest.

By enabling companies to financially support SAF production and usage—even when physical access is limited—the Book and Claim method lowers the barrier to entry for operators of all sizes. This is particularly significant for smaller carriers and private aviation firms that often face logistical or economic hurdles in securing SAF for direct use.

Julien Manhes, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals at Airbus, emphasized that this system is designed to simplify and derisk the process. By purchasing certificates upfront and distributing them when needed, Airbus aims to make SAF more viable and attractive for a broader group of stakeholders. Manhes also noted the opportunity to prove that Book and Claim is both reliable and scalable, paving the way for its adoption in both voluntary and regulatory frameworks.

This move by Airbus marks a step forward in the effort to make aviation more environmentally responsible. SAF has long been seen as one of the most promising tools to cut carbon emissions in flight, but limited supply and complex logistics have slowed progress. By decoupling sustainability benefits from fuel logistics, Airbus’s system offers a practical workaround that can help bridge the gap between current demand and future capacity.

While this pilot program is still in its early stages, its success could signal a turning point for green aviation. If the system proves reliable, it could become a cornerstone of sustainable strategies in the sector, especially as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to reduce its climate impact.

To learn more about Universal Fuel Technologies, please visit unifuel.tech.","To support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production goals and increase feedstock availability, Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) has completed a successful five-month pilot project. The campaign demonstrated the effectiveness and viability of the company’s Flexiforming technology in producing SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel from various renewable feedstocks. The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

From 10 to 11 March, the RAeS and IATA hosted a joint workshop on how the management of aircraft contrails can play its part in this in relation to other solutions such as eco-friendly fuels. JACK RICHARDSON reports.

Looking into the sky, eyes are regularly drawn to the tiny shapes of aircraft flying high above, in their wake, are contrails, formed when water from the combustion process freezes to form ice crystals before turning into water vapour. Although these can either be short or stretch for many miles looking harmless and perhaps even photogenic, there is a risk that they may have longer lasting environmental implications through trapping heat from the Earth in the atmosphere, leading to increased atmospheric warming. RAeS Past President 2001-2002, Professor Ian Poll has argued that through basic measures such as managing the altitude and routes of aircraft to avoid zones most likely to form contrails, the environmental impact of aviation can be significantly reduced for relatively little intervention (see AEROSPACE January 2025). In order explore these issues, the RAeS jointly hosted a workshop with IATA from 10 to 11 March, entitled ‘Contrails: From modification to avoidance to management’.

Addressing the problem

An Emirates Airbus A380 leaves long contrails in its wake, with a range of potential consequences for the environment.

Opening the event, Hemant Mistry, Director Net Zero Transition at IATA said ""there are no quick fixes,"" something that is apparent when the various options to mitigate the climate impact of aviation are examined. Managing demand for flights would have adverse impacts on the economy while solutions such as electric aircraft are not practical for long distance flights due to their limited range and small size. Also, there are well publicised issues with producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) due the costs involved (see AEROSPACE March 2025) with many of the proposed solutions yet to be produced at scale. Giving a keynote address, Stephen Barrett, Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University made the point that although aircraft designed to reduce emissions are in the process of being developed, with innovations such as the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, these are still some time away from maturity. He added that they will take ""a generation"" to bring into service when the length of production backlogs for existing aircraft are taken into account. With these issues in mind, Marc Stettler of Imperial College London described contrail management as “lower hanging fruit” for addressing aviation emissions. With the modern technology ecosystem being key to this strategy, Dinesh Sanekommu of Google Research, said to delegates: “Hopefully, what we can be for everyone in this room is one of those grabbers that help you get the fruit or like a footstool that will help you reach what you want to reach.” Taking many different factors into account, techniques are emerging to counter the environmental impact of contrails.

Finding the contrails

If the management of contrails is to play its part in reducing climate impact, ways in which to do this will have to be trialed and perfected. An initial step is being able to observe contrails, their formation and dissipation. At a basic level, real-time observation of contrails can be achieved in some parts of the world by using cameras placed on buildings at ground level. However, companies all over the world are developing more sophisticated methods. German holiday carrier TUI performed test flights in January 2024 at first involving ten pilots, who would carry out post flight evaluations and take photographs on the contrails whilst inflight. Managing contrails requires a significant amount of data and in order to get this, SWISS has taken advantage of the data which is generated from the aircraft’s flight data recorder combined with sophisticated modelling to produce methods for its aircraft to circumvent areas where contrails are most likely to form.

Other well-known organisations working on the observation of contrails include NASA, measuring emissions from both ground and air vehicles as well as the world first use of a downward looking LIDAR in order to examine the exact structure and moisture level of contrails. Another way of monitoring contrail pattens to minimise the extent of aircraft forming them can be observation from space. The first image of a contrail from space was taken in 1975 and since then, more advanced methods have been employed to exploit this imagery, including deep learning systems from 2022. The effectiveness of this method very much depends on the type of satellite used, with those in geo-earth orbit (GEO) being able to provide a broad view due to their higher altitude, but their distance from the earth as well as the time it takes for the contrail to become visible, means information they generate can quickly become outdated. By contrast, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the ability to observe the aircraft which produces the contrails, although these have a more narrow field of view. This is a disadvantage which can potentially be mitigated through the deployment of an LEO satellite array, such as the FireSat system Google is deploying order to monitor wildfires.

Business aviation too, is also looking at contrail management as way of reducing its climate impact, with Flexjet sustainable aviation spin-off 4AIR conducting research and integrating contrail forecasting into Flexjet long range aircraft dispatch automatically- giving pilots and dispatchers visibility of contrail areas.

Trade-offs

With a growing number of tools to monitor contrails emerging, Adrien Chabot of Amelia, a French Airline which has deployed contrail management techniques on its routes within France using an Embraer jet with plans to extend this over 2025 to 10,000 eligible flights on larger aircraft including the A320 family, delivered a message to delegates. “Come and experiment contrails mitigation with us.” Although progress has been made and the potential of contrail management to reduce emissions is attractive, questions still have to be asked about how effective and desirable they will be.

While Sian Andrews from the UK’s NATS described contrail management as: “a very small price for a large climate benefit” she sounded a note of caution about key questions that have to be asked. These are in terms of practicalities around the feasibility for a large number of airlines to alter their flight paths to manage contrails when many others are looking to do this at the same time, leading to the risk of congested airspace. On this theme, she raised the question of how any changes could increase the workload of air traffic controllers across the world, with solutions currently being focused on existing tools instead of AI. Similarly, several speakers raised the point that in order to manage the contrails produced by their aircraft, airlines could end up sending their aircraft on longer routes and therefore generating more carbon emissions. Brice Bergantz of Airbus pointed out planning for contrail management will vary according to route, with short haul flights being able to plan their whole route prior to departure, but long haul flights have to keep up-to-date with contrail conditions for the journey’s duration. As a result, Sigrun Matthes of Germany’s DLR said that fuel and time costs will have to be factored into flight plans. She showed delegates an example of planning software, in which contrail avoidance can be turned on and off at will. She stressed during her remarks however that: “we need to investigate if such eco-efficient flight trajectories are feasible.”

Trails to the future

Despite the return of notable climate change sceptic President Trump, the world is still moving towards net zero with all of the behavioural and technological change this entails. The workshop showed that managing contrails could be a potent tool in this arsenal, but it also highlighted key challenges. Examples include having the necessary information to know where contrails are as well as being able to tell when their management would be counterproductive. As with any new environmental technology in aerospace, this innovation has several trade-offs that need to be managed. With tough questions now being asked over whether SAF can help meet aviation's net zero targets, contrail management is thus becoming more important.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26130/contrail-control-gathers-pace-header-web.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 05:56:08.734711

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC, a project to study the impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions on Local Air Quality and Climate with a focus on contrails.
The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.
Airbus Chief Technology Officer Sabine Klauke says, ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight.
The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions.","The PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) consortium gathering 11 partners from four countries has answered the Horizon Europe call for proposal on Accelerating climate neutral aviation, minimising non-CO2 emissions.

The PACIFIC project will investigate the impact of fuel composition and engine cycle on particle emissions, from laboratory tests to full-scale aircraft ground testing.

The project, funded by the European Union, started in January 2025 and will last until June 2028 with the aim of improving modelling and prediction capabilities to better assess contrail formation and the broader climate impact of aviation.

The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations to minimise the environmental footprint of aviation.

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC, a project to study the impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions on Local Air Quality and Climate with a focus on contrails. Recent studies suggest that the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAF.

PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) seeks to bridge the gap in understanding aviation’s non-CO2 emissions by testing an unprecedented range of fuels under controlled conditions. The project will ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to full aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions. It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions. Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques. Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

By consolidating these insights, PACIFIC will contribute to a robust cost-benefit assessment of various fuel options, providing crucial inputs for potential future fuel-related regulations. The project will ultimately help define new fuel specifications aimed at reducing aviation’s climate and air quality impact while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable aeronautics.

Airbus Chief Technology Officer Sabine Klauke says, ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight. Through collaborative science-based approaches and innovative technologies, we're committed to minimising these effects while maintaining operational efficiency. The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions. Using an innovative ground experiment process, we will be able to replicate conditions without delay and repeat them if needed. We look forward to the results of this multi-year project.""

Since its introduction, this pioneering technology has redefined approach operations, delivering remarkable environmental benefits and operational efficiencies that have set a new standard for the aviation industry.

TBS dynamically adjusts the spacing between arriving aircraft based on time rather than distance. This intelligent approach has been instrumental in reducing the need for extended airborne holding, saving fuel and cutting carbon emissions and improving on time performance.

Since its introduction for Heathrow in 2015, TBS has achieved remarkable results, cutting headwind delays by 62%, reducing airborne holding by 1,500,000 minutes – the equivalent of almost three years of holding time – and saving over 100,000 tonnes of fuel, worth approximately $70 million based on current jet fuel prices. Additionally, TBS has saved over 300,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry.

The success of TBS is a testament to the power of collaboration between industry leaders. Originally developed and delivered by NATS and Leidos for Heathrow Airport, the technology has set a benchmark for airport arrivals management worldwide, inspiring the adoption at other major airports across the globe as part of the Intelligent Approach toolset.

Chris Norsworthy, NATS Director Airspace and Future Operations, said: “Time Based Separation is a great example of how technology can transform air traffic management. By working closely with Heathrow and Leidos, we pioneered and delivered a solution that benefits passengers, airlines, and the environment. We’re incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together.”

Beyond its environmental benefits, TBS has delivered substantial economic savings. By reducing the time aircraft spend holding, TBS has delivered cost savings for airlines. Based on an estimate of €100 per minute for the operational costs associated with extended flight times - as per a 2015 Eurocontrol study - airlines have saved an estimated €184 million since TBS was introduced.

Dale Reeson, Heathrow Director of Airside and Airspace Operations, said: “Time-Based Separation has been a game-changer for Heathrow. For airlines, it has unlocked major efficiencies, cutting fuel consumption and costs. For passengers, it has meant smoother, more reliable journeys. And for us, it has enabled Heathrow to be more resilient while reducing our environmental impact. TBS is a perfect example of how innovation can deliver benefits for everyone.”

The success of TBS as part of Intelligent Approach demonstrates the potential for advanced air traffic management solutions to deliver significant benefits for the aviation industry and the environment. As the industry continues to evolve, NATS and Leidos remain committed to driving innovation and enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of air travel.

The organization’s mandate is to operate the SAF Registry as an independent entity, distinct from IATA, to ensure credibility, transparency, and inclusivity across the SAF value chain.
The SAF Registry, a key infrastructure component in IATA’s decarbonization strategy, will allow aviation stakeholders to track and verify SAF production and consumption globally.
Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared his perspective on the initiative’s importance: “The SAF Registry is indispensable in building a transparent, global market for SAF.
By involving a wide range of stakeholders, CADO aims to ensure that the global SAF market is built on shared principles and international cooperation.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), a new entity tasked with managing the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry. This move aims to drive the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts by establishing a transparent and efficient framework to support the global adoption of SAF, which is a key component in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

CADO’s creation marks a pivotal moment in IATA’s broader strategy to accelerate sustainability in the aviation sector.

The organization’s mandate is to operate the SAF Registry as an independent entity, distinct from IATA, to ensure credibility, transparency, and inclusivity across the SAF value chain.

The registry will play a crucial role in developing a liquid and transparent global market for SAF, fostering trust and enabling stakeholders from governments to fuel producers and investors to engage in SAF production and use.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, emphasized the significance of this initiative. “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its role is critical in managing the registry with an open, global approach that supports scrutiny from all stakeholders. The door is open for any entity within the SAF value chain to join CADO, including governments. This inclusive model is crucial in harmonizing the principles that govern SAF registries worldwide,” she said.

The SAF Registry, a key infrastructure component in IATA’s decarbonization strategy, will allow aviation stakeholders to track and verify SAF production and consumption globally. This transparency will help drive confidence in SAF as a viable, scalable alternative to conventional jet fuel. CADO’s leadership in managing the registry will help the industry meet the ambitious goal of ramping up SAF production to significant levels, a necessary step to reduce the aviation sector’s overall carbon emissions.

Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared his perspective on the initiative’s importance: “The SAF Registry is indispensable in building a transparent, global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to launching the registry and establishing CADO as its manager should encourage governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage more vigorously in the SAF market. Our common goal is to significantly increase SAF production, and the structure we are creating with CADO is a vital step forward in advancing aviation decarbonization.”

As the aviation industry navigates the path toward sustainability, the SAF Registry will serve as a critical tool to ensure the transparent and efficient scaling of SAF. By involving a wide range of stakeholders, CADO aims to ensure that the global SAF market is built on shared principles and international cooperation.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented: We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.
Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power.
“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.
We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.","Farnborough Airport, the Birthplace of British Aviation and Europe’s leading airport for premium air travel connectivity, has today announced that it has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million litres or 10,000 tonnes per annum of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced locally from waste.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks. SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented:

We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.

“Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030. What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.

He went on to comment:

The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen.

“Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

This news follows a series of successful milestones in recent years at the Airport. In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five UK airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition. Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power. In 2022, for a two-week trial period in the lead up to the Farnborough International Airshow, Farnborough Airport became the first airport in the world to offer SAF at the same price as standard Jet A1 fuel, after it took a major step in driving the adoption of SAF by offering it to all customers the year prior. Also in 2022, Farnborough Airport made a commitment to be Net Zero by 2030 or sooner for emissions within its control, setting one of the most ambitious targets in the aviation industry.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented:

We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling.

“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill. We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.

This new entity was created to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry once it is released.

IATA senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA director-general Willie Walsh added: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward.”

What exactly is CADO?

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

CADO membership is open to organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry; and related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

The SAF Registry that CADO will take charge of helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally.

The Registry will do this by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location.

In addition, it gives access to airlines’ corporate customers to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/03/01d01186-iata-saf-registry.jpeg,N,,2025-03-25 00:57:03.828421

Indonesia is accelerating its efforts to embrace clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) technologies, forging stronger partnerships with South Korea to meet its environmental goals. The country aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89% by 2030 and its growing collaboration with South Korean companies is seen as a key factor in achieving these targets.

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto met with the Vice President of and President of an advanced materials company. The discussions aimed to explore new investment opportunities and expand technology-sharing agreements. The meeting focused on enhancing the cooperation between the two countries in the clean energy and EV sectors. The company is a global leader in battery technology and has already played a significant role in Indonesia’s EV ecosystem and both parties expressed their commitment to strengthening this collaboration.

Minister Hartarto emphasised the significance of ongoing international support for Indonesia’s green energy initiatives. His remarks underscored the government’s commitment to strengthening partnerships that drive the development of the EV ecosystem and clean energy sector, reinforcing Indonesia’s position as a key player in the global transition to sustainable technologies.

Despite challenges in the global EV industry, such as declining demand, discussions highlighted Indonesia’s strong potential for growth in this sector. The country’s abundant natural resources, skilled workforce and supportive policies were noted as key advantages. Emphasis was placed on Indonesia’s strategic importance in the green industry, reinforcing its role in the broader transition to sustainable technologies and its expanding presence in the global EV battery supply chain.

A major highlight of the partnership is the ongoing development of an EV battery cell factory in Karawang, West Java. The factory is being built in two phases. The first phase, which has a capacity of 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh), was completed in 2024. The second phase, which will expand the facility’s capacity to 20 GWh, is currently under construction. This factory is part of a larger collaboration and it is expected to play a key role in providing batteries for the growing EV market in Indonesia and beyond.

In addition to its work in the EV sector, the company has proposed further collaborations in areas such as biodegradable plastics. These innovations could help Indonesia reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability. This aligns with Indonesia’s broader sustainability goals, as the country is looking to expand its clean energy solutions across various industries.

Minister Hartarto welcomed the proposal, emphasising Indonesia’s openness to attracting investment in a variety of clean energy projects. The government is eager to tap into new technologies that can help address the environmental challenges the country faces.

One of the most promising initiatives discussed during the meeting was the potential to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using Indonesia’s abundant palm oil resources. Indonesia’s vast palm oil plantations position it as a leader in the production of SAF, which could significantly reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint.

The company, which has already developed SAF production capabilities in South Korea, expressed a strong interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop this alternative fuel. Such advancements could enhance energy security while reducing emissions in aviation.

Indonesia and South Korea are positioning themselves at the forefront of global efforts to combat climate change while advancing the green economy. These collaborations provide not only technological advancements but also a pathway to a more sustainable, low-carbon future.

As Indonesia continues to drive its green transition, its global partnerships, particularly in the areas of clean energy and EV technology, will be crucial.

The country’s total UCO exports, however, fell by 60% between November and December after the government of China eliminated a 13% export tax rebate on UCO.
In addition to the 60% reduction in UCO exports experienced in December, the GAIN report indicates that the China’s UCO market slowed further in February due to declining order numbers and prices, traffic congestion and logistics delays.
Despite China’s sluggish domestic UCO market, international demand for UCO has reached unprecedented levels, according to the report.","China’s exports of used cooking oil (UCO) reached a record high in 2024 but fell sharply in December after the Chinese government eliminated the 13% export tax rebate for UCO, according to a report filed with the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service’ Global Agricultural Information Network.

The U.S. was the top export market for Chinese UCO in 2024, at 1.27 million tons. That volume is up approximately 52% when compared to 2023, accounting for 43% of China’s total UCO exports in 2024. The country’s total UCO exports, however, fell by 60% between November and December after the government of China eliminated a 13% export tax rebate on UCO.

The elimination of the UCO export tax rebate was announced on Nov. 15, 2024, and became effective Dec. 1, 2024. According to a November 2024 GAIN report, the policy shift aimed to redirect China’s biobased diesel industry from an export-focused model to a more domestically oriented industry. The change is also expected to create export opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in China, as the European Union provisionally excluded SAF from proposed antidumping duties in July 2024.

The policy shift triggered immediate changes in UCO pricing, according to the report. Leading Chinese UCO producers set initial December and January contract prices at $1,000 to $1,050 per metric ton, an increase of $100 to $150 over previous rates.

In addition to the 60% reduction in UCO exports experienced in December, the GAIN report indicates that the China’s UCO market slowed further in February due to declining order numbers and prices, traffic congestion and logistics delays. According to the report, many UCO traders are reluctant to sell at lower prices and are minimizing purchases to avoid losses from price fluctuations.

Despite China’s sluggish domestic UCO market, international demand for UCO has reached unprecedented levels, according to the report. The current domestic market slump in China is expected to be temporary, as growing international demand and tightening domestic supplies lead to a market rebound.

A full copy of the report is available on the USDA FAS GAIN website.

The 330,000m² Lufthansa Cargo Center will undergo phased upgrades to minimise disruption while enhancing operational capabilities.","As global trade patterns shift, digitalisation accelerates, and sustainability pressures mount, airlines are reassessing their strategies to remain competitive.

But in an increasingly competitive environment, can European carriers keep pace with the rise of Middle Eastern and Asian cargo hubs?

Global air cargo demand has been in flux since the pandemic, with new trade corridors emerging and geopolitical uncertainties reshaping supply chains. While Asia-to-Europe routes remain a dominant force, new markets like India and Vietnam are growing rapidly, requiring airlines to adapt their networks.

“Trade is becoming more diverse, and airfreight markets are evolving,” said Lufthansa Cargo.

“We see strong growth in Southeast Asia, and to remain competitive, European cargo hubs must ensure they are well-positioned to handle these shifts efficiently.”

This diversification is reflected in Lufthansa Cargo’s 29 percent increase in freighter capacity to Asia during the last peak season, with new stations added in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou to support the e-commerce boom. However, the question remains—will Europe continue to lead global air cargo, or is it at risk of losing its stronghold?

e-commerce revolution

The rise of e-commerce-driven air freight has been one of the most significant shifts in recent years. The need for rapid delivery times has increased demand for dedicated freighter capacity, particularly from Asia.

Airlines must adapt to the fast-paced nature of e-commerce logistics, ensuring long-term capacity commitments and flexible charter options. However, with passenger flights returning to full capacity, the balance between freighters and belly cargo remains a delicate challenge.

“We’re seeing increased demand for long-term capacity commitments, particularly from e-commerce customers,” Lufthansa Cargo’s representative added.

“Adjusting our freighter network accordingly is essential to maintaining efficiency.”

While dedicated freighters offer greater control over cargo operations, belly capacity remains a crucial part of European carriers’ strategies.

However, the industry is facing yield pressures, with Lufthansa Cargo reporting only a 3 percent increase in cargo yield in 2024, a sign that post-pandemic peak freight rates are now stabilising.

AI and automation

European cargo hubs have long been criticised for inefficiencies, particularly in handling times and operational bottlenecks, addressing this by embracing automation and AI, positioning itself at the forefront of digital transformation in air cargo.

A pilot project launched in the autumn of 2024 saw autonomous tow vehicles (AGVs) introduced in Frankfurt, transporting freight between buildings without human intervention. Meanwhile, AI-driven automation has reduced response times in Lufthansa Cargo’s customer service centres, with 40 percent of inquiries now handled automatically.

“Automation and AI are not just about efficiency—they are about resilience.”

“As the industry faces a growing skills shortage, digitalisation will play a key role in ensuring smooth operations and reducing delays.”

Additionally, Lufthansa Cargo is supporting the push towards IATA’s ONE Record initiative, which aims to create a standardised, open data-sharing framework for air freight. If fully implemented, such initiatives could revolutionise cargo visibility and tracking, eliminating inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems.

Despite digitalisation and network expansion, the biggest challenge for European cargo carriers remains sustainability. With net-zero targets looming, airlines are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and invest in cleaner technologies.

Lufthansa Cargo has committed to halving net CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieving full carbon neutrality by 2050. However, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption remains limited due to high costs and restricted availability.

“Our biggest CO2-saving potential lies in the air,” stated Lufthansa Cargo.

“Sustainable aviation fuel and fleet modernisation are critical, but the reality is that the industry needs broader collaboration to make SAF scalable and commercially viable.”

xThe airline has already transitioned its entire freighter fleet to Boeing 777Fs, the most fuel-efficient aircraft in its category. It also has seven Boeing 777-8 freighters on order, which promise further emission reductions. However, with SAF still making up a small fraction of overall fuel use in aviation, sustainability remains one of the biggest hurdles for Europe’s air cargo industry.

Investing in the future

As European cargo hubs face rising competition from the Middle East and Asia, investment in infrastructure modernisation is seen as a key differentiator.

Lufthansa Cargo is investing €600 million into modernising its Frankfurt hub through the LCCevo project, aimed at boosting efficiency, reducing handling times, and expanding digital capabilities. The 330,000m² Lufthansa Cargo Center will undergo phased upgrades to minimise disruption while enhancing operational capabilities.

The development has been welcomed as attempts are being made to reduce the carbon emissions of the aviation sector.

But not all experts are as enthusiastic about the focus on so-called “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” which are synthetic sustainable aviation fuels produced from fossil-free electricity and recycled carbon dioxide.

How to fly green

“There’s a collection of sectors such as aviation, long-distance maritime shipping, chemical industry, steel production. Making these sectors sustainable is not as easy as for other sectors, where you can just directly apply electrification,” chemical engineer Maartje Feenstra tells Cosmos. Feenstra is a senior research consultant at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures in Australia.

“For instance, batteries are not viable technical solutions for airplanes,” she continues. “They don’t provide the right energy density. So that means that for aviation, we have a limited amount of technical possibilities for the energy transition. That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels.”

University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd is an expert on energy policy. She says in an interview with Cosmos that she believes the aviation industry is trying to lobby for the right policy environments for sustainable fuels.

“But I think even with the best projections, it’s only going to be 1% of fuel globally,” she says. “That’s a drop in the ocean. How can we say we have this sustainable aviation revolution?”

She says that the technology exists for the transition to sustainable fuel sources.

“There are a number of synthetic biofuels that can be used in existing aircraft, so they don’t need to change the fuels. … There’s also algae which has huge potential, but costs more because that feedstock can be used in other things, like pharmaceutical products. And there are new pathways that scientists are exploring, like hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels,” she says.

“So every day we have a new innovation. The problem is scaling it up.”

What is sustainably produced aviation fuel?

The European Union (EU) roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels says these fuels will make up 2% of the supply in Europe by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050.

“The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” says Roland Dittmeyer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany.

“Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable,” Dittmeyer adds.

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernicus P2X project that announced advances in sustainable fuel production last week.

KIT, along with industrial partner Sunfire, say they have used water vapor and CO2 co-electrolysis technology to produce synthetic kerosene at a scale that could be used industrially.

“It’s nice to see this technology scaling up and getting sort of demonstration volumes,” says Feenstra, who is not involved in Kopernicus P2X.

Sunfire and KIT say this is a world first. Their “syngas” – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are converted into long-chain hydrocarbons called “syncrude” – has a 220-kilowatt (kW) output.

A Boeing 777’s twin-jet engines have a total power output of about 130,000 kW.

“Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step,” says Hubertus Richter, senior engineer at Sunfire. “Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.”

“In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,” Richter says. “This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.”

Feenstra helps illustrate Kopernicus P2X’s output another way: “With a daily production of 300 L of syncrude, it would still take 796 days (over 2 years) to fill up a Boeing 747-400. For the next envisioned production of a tonne a day it would still take slightly over half a year to fill up a Boeing 747-400.”

So there’s some way to go yet.

A problem of soaring costs

“The challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. … The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra says. “If we want to make aviation sustainable, we’ll have to enable these fuels in one way or another.”

Dodd has been outspoken in her concerns about “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2 emitting aircraft. While scientists have raised concerns about global tourism emissions, Dodd says we need to consider ways of tackling the issues collectively.

She says that people “shouldn’t necessarily have to stop doing what we love doing and what makes the world tick. We just need to be really innovative about how we can move forward. And in innovation, research shows us the only way you can move forward is if you understand the problem. And I think don’t talk about aviation enough.”

“It is a sector that’s really hard to abate, and everyone I know in that sector is really committed to it. I really want to support and encourage that work. And I know how hard it is, because I work in the renewable energy sector, that we do have to focus on decarbonising the electricity system in Australia.”

Feenstra says that conversations around sustainable aviation fuels in Australia tend to be based around biofuel alternatives.

Dodd says that one way forward would be to encourage businesses and universities that require long-distance travel to function to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.

“I think just even businesses being aware of and paying attention to how impacted their supply chain is by aviation and how for us to move forward, that perhaps they could be supporting and partnering the the airlines to scale up commercial availability of sustainable aviation field,” she says.

“You want to make sure that that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive, and then it’s not going to price certain people out of the market to fly, or price certain people out of the market of things like flowers or coffee that we ship.”",https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-172190964.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 15:56:08.378733

Large global technology companies have become the main buyers of renewable energy to power their data centers and operations.
The DeepSeek announcement surprised many in the industry, leading to initial market volatility in the renewable power sector.
About 30 countries—ranging from sophisticated economies to developing nations—are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs.
Renewables are expected to one day deliver enough capacity to meet electricity demand peaks and provide critical grid-stabilizing and ancillary services.","The global demand for electricity is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, outpacing prior forecasts and reshaping the energy landscape. Driving this surge are large corporations looking for reliable, low-cost energy solutions. Enter renewables, the cheapest source of bulk power in most regions of the world.

As a result, renewable power is playing a leading role in the “any and all” approach to increase generation capacity. Two decades from now, annual energy transition and grid investments must reach $7.8 trillion—a 3.7x increase from today’s annual investment—to achieve net zero (see Figure 1). For investors, we believe that renewables offer both immense growth potential and attractive risk-adjusted returns with embedded downside mitigation.

While some recent developments have caused some volatility in the renewable power industry—including shifting U.S. policy and the implications for a new artificial intelligence (AI) model from DeepSeek—they also have positive implications for energy and renewables demand that we believe markets have not priced in. Investors who focus on the lowest-cost, most mature renewable power and transition technologies—which are experiencing the greatest demand from corporate customers and are not reliant on government subsidies—are best positioned to benefit in the current environment, in our view.

Corporations are the single largest driving force behind this increasing demand for renewables. Large global technology companies have become the main buyers of renewable energy to power their data centers and operations. That, along with the electrification of a wide range of industries, has resulted in a 12-fold increase in corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) volumes since 2016.1 Today, corporate demand from these “hyperscalers” is exceeding, by far, the renewable projects that are available to supply it.

For example, Microsoft and Brookfield announced in May 2024 the signing of a global renewable energy framework agreement to contribute to Microsoft’s goal of having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030.2 The agreement provides a pathway for Brookfield to deliver over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity between 2026 and 2030 in the U.S. and Europe, and the scope could potentially expand to deliver additional renewable energy capacity within the U.S. and Europe, and beyond to other regions.

This corporate demand is mobilizing at dizzying speeds. In 2023, Amazon achieved its goal of matching 100% of the electricity it consumed across its operations with renewable energy, seven years ahead of its original 2030 goal; Meta is matching its electricity use with 100% renewable energy and has set a net-zero goal across its value chain by 2030; and Google aims to achieve net-zero targets across all of its operations and value chains by 2030 by reducing its emissions by 50% and investing in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions.3,4,5

These hyperscalers have committed to the most aggressive decarbonization targets across businesses in different sectors—and the fastest and easiest way to get there is through renewable power. But here’s the bottom line: Regardless of net-zero targets, companies will seek to secure as much renewable power as they can simply because it’s the cheapest.

The Race to Power Data Centers

AI is poised to transform every industry worldwide, fueling explosive growth in data center construction to compute and store the enormous volume of data created. Global data center power demand is expected to rise 15-fold by the end of this decade.

But access to power in high demand regions is increasingly the bottleneck hindering data center and AI development. Businesses are now ramping up their efforts to lock in supply to ensure they can achieve their growth targets—and they are looking to power all these new data centers with renewables.

Recently, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made headlines with the news that its advanced models reportedly achieved comparable results to leading U.S.-based AI labs while using less-expensive hardware, less computing power and less energy. The DeepSeek announcement surprised many in the industry, leading to initial market volatility in the renewable power sector. Yet, AI implementation was never expected to be linear, and AI deployment will continue to require significantly more computing power and energy for inference and model training than is currently available, in our view.

If DeepSeek and other models emerge to make AI cheaper, it will likely accelerate AI adoption for training and inference models, robotics and other promising technologies. In other words, cheaper AI is likely to spur more demand for AI—and subsequently more power. We view this as positive for continued long-term demand for data centers and new energy infrastructure.

Also, it’s important to remember that the expected increase in electricity demand is due to much more than just data centers—industry, buildings, transport and other sectors are all demanding more power (see Figure 3).

Clean Energy Solutions Are Stepping Up to the Plate

Solar has made incredible leaps and is on course to be the largest source of generating capacity for electricity by mid-2035. To put it in perspective, back in 2004, it took an entire year for solar sources to produce a gigawatt of power. Now it takes just half a day. But electricity grids always need to be balanced between supply and demand—and while sunshine and wind are plentiful and free, they’re not available 24/7.

Companies need access to stable, consistent baseload power. To complement wind and power, they require a diverse range of decarbonization solutions to mitigate the intermittency challenges from traditional renewable sources and to decarbonize hard-to-abate areas of their business. These decarbonization solutions are at various stages of scaling, ranging from well-established technologies like wind, solar and large-scale nuclear to rapidly maturing options such as batteries and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). And over the longer term, technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs), microreactors and hydrogen show a lot of promise.

But today, three technologies are making notable strides: nuclear, batteries and SAF.

Nuclear

Currently, nuclear is the only commercially viable provider of baseload carbon-free power. Over time, technological advances, shifting public sentiment, the need among governments for energy security and increasing corporate demand have resulted in a nuclear industry resurgence.

Indeed, several global technology players have recently announced plans to restart or enable the development of nuclear capacity. For example, Microsoft signed an agreement in 2024 to restart the Palisades reactor in Michigan, which had been decommissioned in 2022, to serve its data center footprint. And Meta announced that it is seeking up to 4 GW of new nuclear power to help meet its AI and sustainability objectives.6 Hyperscalers need reliable, low-cost, stable baseload solutions at scale—and they are increasingly looking to a small number of trusted partners to deliver what they need, where they need it and when they need it.

These tailwinds have resulted in life extensions for an increasing number of existing nuclear reactors as well as renewed interest from federal and local governments expanding nuclear power by building new plants. About 30 countries—ranging from sophisticated economies to developing nations—are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs.

Looking ahead into the next decade, advances in SMRs and microreactors are opening up new possibilities for nuclear power applications—particularly for behind-the-meter and off-the-grid use by industrials, technology and mining companies, as well as remote communities. These innovative solutions are not only more flexible and scalable but also offer enhanced safety features. The development of long-duration energy storage systems further complements nuclear power, making it an even more attractive option for meeting future energy needs. While full-scale deployment is still several years out, we expect small-scale nuclear to form part of the long-term energy solution.

Batteries

Battery prices have dropped dramatically over the past few years, following a trajectory similar—but faster—than what we saw with solar. This was mainly due to improving technology, economies of scale, market dynamics and a fall in prices of critical battery metals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. For example, lithium carbonate prices fell from a high of approximately $70,000 per metric ton to well below $15,000 in 2024.7 Batteries now also require less time to plan and install than solar and wind systems (see Figure 4).

Renewables are expected to one day deliver enough capacity to meet electricity demand peaks and provide critical grid-stabilizing and ancillary services. Batteries will play a crucial role in achieving that, making energy production more efficient and creating value for renewable platforms. Today, growth in both solar and batteries is breaking records,9 a trend we expect to continue over the next decade.

Sustainable aviation fuel

SAF is considered one of the only viable near- and medium-term pathways to decarbonize the hard-to-abate long-haul air transport sector. It is produced by combining hydrogen generated from renewable electricity with captured carbon dioxide. It is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning the same jet engines can operate on either SAF or traditional jet fuel or a mixture of both. Crucially, it enables a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions relative to the same volume of conventional jet fuel.10

Similar to solar and wind, SAF is a proven technology seeing increasing demand from airlines and corporations seeking long-term take-or-pay contracts to secure supply to meet their net-zero targets and regulatory requirements. SAF benefits from significant policy tailwinds contributing to the supply demand. For example, under RefuelEU, a component of the European Union Green Deal, all planes refueling at European airports must use a blend containing a minimum percentage of SAF starting this year.

SAF is at the point where both the technology and the commercial uses are ready to go—and the tailwinds in this sector are strong. Fourteen airlines, controlling half of the market for jet fuel, have SAF targets,11 suggesting strong long-term demand for this technology. According to a study by the World Economic Forum and Kearney,12 global SAF demand is expected to reach 17 million tonnes per year by 2030, about 5% of total jet fuel consumption. By the end of 2024, production capacity was expected to be 4.4 million tonnes per year, with an additional 6.9 million tonnes per year expected from new refineries and facility expansions. However, to meet 2030 demand, an extra 5.8 million tonnes of production capacity is needed by 2026.

The Effects of Shifting U.S. Policy

The new U.S. administration has introduced some market uncertainty around renewables. However, we believe fundamentals for power remain exceptionally strong and we expect demand to continue to outpace supply, driving growth in required energy capacity—regardless of what happens in Washington.

Today, demand for clean power is driven by a “corporate pull” due to its position as the lowest-cost form of bulk power in most markets, which will continue to support new and existing projects. Certain industries, such as U.S. offshore wind, wind on federal land, and electric vehicles, will likely be affected by U.S. policy changes, but most technologies will not. In our experience, focusing on low-cost renewable power and decarbonization technologies and high-growth regions allows developers to mitigate impacts on their businesses from regulatory or subsidy changes.

The U.S. has indicated that it will take an “all of the above” approach to providing energy and solidifying its energy dominance. Given how integrated renewables are in the energy mix, they will continue to supply domestic energy as well as support exports of any potential surplus in the country’s oil production. With respect to fully repealing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), we still feel it would be difficult because not all Republican lawmakers support such a drastic step. The IRA has generated significant investment in new clean energy projects while creating a meaningful number of jobs, directly benefiting Republican states.

While shifting U.S. policy does introduce some (manageable) risks into the renewable power sector, we believe that other positive developments have captured less attention in the markets. For example, the new administration is expected to drive significant growth in U.S. industries through its focus on manufacturing and data center development. This would likely generate incremental power needs on top of the already significant demand growth and supply-demand fundamentals that we are seeing today. The “any and all” approach in the U.S. will benefit renewables, as the lowest-cost source of power, as well as other forms of generation such as gas and nuclear.

The aviation industry is considered as one of the hard-to-abate sectors in the green transformation, and sustainable aviation fuels are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 % quota in 2025 and aiming for 70 % SAF in all EU airports from 2050. The BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels (RED EU definition), and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RED EU Definition, also called e-fuels). The technology brings proven process building blocks which have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium consisting of Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Total Energies and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

The PRENFLO® gasification technology is part of thyssenkrupp’s Decarbon Technologies portfolio and will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF. With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO® technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility, capable of handling a wide range of feedstocks.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy: “After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change.”

Nadja Håkansson, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde: “We are proud to see how the E-BioTfueL concept – which includes our advanced PRENFLO® technology – has now turned into a first commercial Biomass-to-SAF application in the European Community. The collaboration with our French partners underscores our commitment to driving the green transformation and delivering sustainable value to our customers and stakeholders.”",https://www.chemengonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ce-sm-logo-400x400-sb.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 13:56:44.758560

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, shared her thoughts:

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

Later, Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, continued:

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping up SAF production is the common goal, and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward.”

What is expected from CADO ?

CADO is a not-for-profit Canadian corporation established in Montreal. As a founding member, IATA will provide technical assistance and operational services to CADO on a regular basis. The company is prepared to:

Organisations operating in or supporting the SAF value chain and also organisations or groups affiliated with SAF stakeholders.

States or pseudo-state actors who have direct stakes in the SAF Registry’s operations and profits.

Interest groups indirectly benefiting from deployment in sustainable aviation fuel.

About the SAF Registry

IATA is developing the SAF Registry as a global system to standardise and transparently record SAF transactions. The system ensures that the environmental value of SAF is accurately recorded and allocated in the SAF value chain for airlines and corporate buyers so they can meet regulatory obligations and take advantage of voluntary decarbonisation schemes.

The SAF Registry is designed to mitigate the obstacle of limited availability of SAF by aggregating airlines, SAF suppliers and manufacturers together regardless of location. It also enables corporate customers to contribute toward funding in-sector emissions reductions by co-funding decarbonisation.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will transition to a cost-recovery model.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tall27vc-web.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 12:56:10.280642

This newly formed entity will oversee the management of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a critical tool designed to enhance the transparency and traceability of SAF transactions within the aviation sector.

CADO’s Role and Membership

CADO is officially incorporated as a not-for-profit organization based in Montreal, Canada. As the founding member, IATA will continue to play an integral role in CADO’s operations, providing essential technical support and contributing to its ongoing development. Membership in CADO is open to a variety of organizations, including those directly involved in the SAF value chain, governmental bodies with an interest in SAF operations, and other groups indirectly benefiting from the broader environmental impacts of SAF in the aviation industry.

The SAF Registry: Tracking Sustainability in Aviation

The SAF Registry, which is poised for launch, will serve as a global platform to record and track SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent manner. This system aims to address the complexities associated with SAF supply, which is currently limited and geographically restricted. By connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, the registry will facilitate greater access to sustainable fuel options, regardless of location, and will enable airlines to track the environmental benefits of SAF as they move through the value chain.

Supporting Regulatory Compliance and Voluntary Sustainability Goals

In addition to supporting regulatory compliance, the SAF Registry will also allow airlines and corporate customers to claim emissions reductions against voluntary sustainability commitments. This feature is particularly valuable as companies seek to co-finance the cost of decarbonization and contribute to a more sustainable aviation sector.

Free Participation Until 2027

To ensure accessibility, participation in the SAF Registry will be free of charge until April 2027. After this period, the registry will transition to a cost-recovery model, ensuring its long-term sustainability while continuing to provide a vital service to the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Conclusion: Empowering a Sustainable Aviation Future

By supporting the development of the SAF Registry and empowering a wide range of stakeholders, CADO plays a key role in the global push towards reducing aviation’s carbon footprint and advancing sustainable fuel solutions.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO.

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry when it is released.

""CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

""The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry's commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA's Director General.

About CADO

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations. CADO membership is open to:

Organizations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain

Speaking at the Airbus Summit 2025, Faury reflected on the evolving trajectory of the aviation industry, which he described as entering its “fourth transformation.” He outlined how the industry had evolved from simply achieving flight to becoming safe, then affordable, and now sustainable.

Making aviation sustainable

“We want to make it sustainable,” said Faury. “Because of its success—being a mode of transport that is safe, that is affordable—the impact on the global CO₂ emissions is 2–3%. It’s a sort of victim of its success.”

One of the critical elements in that transformation, according to Faury, is hydrogen. “It’s a very personal conviction,” he stated. “Hydrogen has a role to play. It is the energy of the future.”

Airbus launched its ZEROe hydrogen aircraft project more than five years ago, aiming to pave the way toward zero-emission aviation. While technological progress has been encouraging, Faury shared an update, “We’ve learned that we can develop and manufacture a hydrogen plane that works—a commercial aeroplane that works. [But] the competitiveness of such a plane would not be good enough to compete with others.”

Is hydrogen the solution?

Key barriers remain, including a lack of regulatory support and the absence of a green hydrogen production ecosystem. “We don’t have the development of decarbonised hydrogen at scale for when we need the plane to enter into service,” Faury added.

Still, Airbus isn’t backing down. “We continue to believe in hydrogen. We’re absolutely convinced that hydrogen is an energy for the future of aviation,” he emphasised. “But there’s just more work to be done—more work for purpose, more work for the others around us to bring that energy to something that is at scale, that is competitive, and that will lead to success.”

As the aviation industry charts a course toward decarbonisation, Airbus is urging governments, industry partners, and innovators to accelerate the development of hydrogen infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.

Electricity drove surge in energy demand in 2024: IEA

London, 24 March (Argus) — Electricity demand drove a jump in overall global energy consumption growth in 2024, lifting it well above the average pace of increase in recent years, energy watchdog the IEA said today. Global energy demand rose by 2.2pc in 2024 — higher than the average annual demand increase of 1.3pc between 2013 and 2023 — according to the Paris-base agency's Global Energy Review . Global electricity consumption rose by 4.3pc, driven by record-high temperatures that led to increased cooling demand, growing industrial consumption, the electrification of transport and from data centres and artificial intelligence, the IEA said. Renewables and nuclear covered the majority of growth in electricity demand, at 80pc, while supply of gas-fired power generation ""also increased steadily"", it said. New renewable power capacity installations reached around 700GW in 2024 — a new high — while renewable power sources and nuclear together made up 40pc of total generation in 2024, it said. Global gas demand rose by 2.7pc in 2024, with an increase in ""fast growing Asian markets"", the IEA said. It noted growth of more than 7pc and 10pc in China and India, respectively. But ""growth in global oil demand slowed markedly in 2024"", the organisation said. Oil demand rose by 0.8pc — compared with 1.9pc in 2023 — and oil's share of total energy demand fell below 30pc last year ""for the first time ever"". A rise in electric vehicle (EV) purchases was a key contributor to the drop in oil demand for road transport, and this offset ""a significant proportion"" of the rise in oil consumption for aviation and petrochemicals, the IEA said. The rate of increase in coal demand slowed to 1.1pc in 2024, half the pace seen in 2023. ""Intense heatwaves"" in China and India ""contributed more than 90pc of the total annual increase in coal consumption globally"", for cooling needs, the IEA found. Renewables limit rise in emissions The IEA repeatedly noted the significant effect that extreme weather in 2024 had on energy systems and on demand patterns. Last year was the hottest ever recorded, beating the previous record set in 2023. ""Weather effects contributed about 15pc of the overall increase in global energy demand"", the IEA said. Global cooling degree days were 6pc higher in 2024 on the year, and 20pc higher than the 2000-20 average, it said. But the ""continued rapid adoption of clean energy technologies"" restricted the rise in energy-related CO2 emissions, which fell to 0.8pc in 2024 from 1.2pc in 2023, the IEA said. Energy-related CO2 emissions still hit a record high of 37.8bn t in 2024, but the rise in emissions was lower than global GDP growth, it said. ""The majority of emissions growth in 2024 came from emerging and developing economies other than China,"" the IEA said.

US strikes Houthis with eye on Iran — to what end?

Stoking regional tensions to get Tehran to the negotiating table appears unlikely to have Trump's desired outcome, write Nader Itayim and Bachar Halabi Dubai, 21 March (Argus) — As US president Donald Trump's administration intensifies its military campaign against Yemen's Houthis, it has issued yet another stark warning to Iran and its leadership — end support for the rebel group or face ""dire"" consequences. The ultimatum is in line with the ‘maximum pressure' approach Trump has adopted to force Iran back to the negotiating table. But success looks far from certain. This past week saw US forces carry out a series of air strikes against Houthi targets, soon after the rebel group said it would restart attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the Bab el-Mandeb strait and Gulf of Aden after Tel Aviv ignored a Houthi warning to resume the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The Houthi threat since late 2023 has severely curtailed international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, impacting the global economy. The Trump administration says its campaign has set out to put an end to that. The US' ""economic and national security has been under attack by the Houthis for too long"", Washington says. And rising shipping rates, as a result, have probably increased global consumer goods inflation by 0.6-0.7pc, according to the White House. The diversion of oil and LNG flows has been stark (see charts). Trump's message to the Houthis is that their ""time is up"". Although Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, also carried out air strikes against the group, observers say the latest attacks are not just more of the same. ""Is this a different campaign? 100pc it is,"" says Mohammed al-Basha, founder of the US-based Basha Report security advisory. Some sites targeted in the Houthi-held capital Sana'a are ""a first"", he says, signalling that the Houthi leadership is now firmly in Washington's crosshairs for the first time since 2015, he says. The current campaign is also more proactive than the strikes that took place last year, says general Joseph Votel, a former commander of US Central Command, which is overseeing the attacks. ""Last year, our approach was more defensive, and focused on protecting ships passing through the area,"" he says. But this campaign is larger in scope, more geographically dispersed and more intense. Votel says the Trump campaign is more ""counter-terrorism focused"", which indicates a more targeted and sustained approach to degrade Houthi capabilities and put pressure on its network. Also, there is a subtle change in the strategic messaging, according to Votel. While the Biden administration mostly focused on preventing an expansion of the regional conflict, the Trump administration is making clear that its focus is on ""restoring freedom of commerce and navigation"". While slight, this change ""takes us from a defensive posture to an offensive one"", he says. Threats and opportunities Arguably, the biggest distinction between the two strategies is the degree to which Iran, the Houthis' main backer, appears to have featured in the administration's calculations before launching this latest campaign. ""The hundreds of attacks being made by [the] Houthis… all emanate from, and are created by, Iran,"" Trump wrote via his social media platform on day three of the strikes, by which point the Houthis had claimed two retaliatory attacks on the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. ""Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran, and Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!"" This kind of tough-talking rhetoric is in keeping with Trump's strategy of applying pressure on Iran's leadership to the point that it has no choice but to negotiate the future of its nuclear programme, and ideally, more than that. ""It's very clear the US wants to see sweeping concessions from Iran on the nuclear file, on the regional proxy file, and probably the missile and drone programme,"" says Gregory Brew, senior analyst at US consultancy Eurasia Group. ""Trump ultimately wants a deal. But he also wants to look tough and push the Iranians into a deal that aligns with his maximalist view."" After Iran's other regional proxies — Gaza-based Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah — saw their capabilities heavily degraded at the hands of Israel last year, the Houthis are one of the last remaining pieces in what Tehran calls its regional ‘Axis of Resistance'. In a letter sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, earlier this month, Trump says he encouraged Iran's ultimate decision maker to ""make a deal"" or face military action. Iran has since confirmed receipt of the letter, but is yet to formally respond, with foreign minister Abbas Araqchi saying this week that its contents are still being evaluated. ""Trump's letter is mostly a threat, but he also claims it has opportunities. We are evaluating it and paying attention to all points,"" he says. Iran's response ""will not take long"", Araqchi says. But the mood music coming out of Tehran over the past two weeks has not been positive. ""You've had Khamenei's tough rhetoric, laying out a tough line for everybody that [they] are not going to talk to the US,"" Brew says. But ""Araqchi and others have clarified that what they are really pushing back against is the sense of talking under pressure. They don't want to appear as if they are succumbing to Trump's pressure. They do want to talk, but from a position of relative strength"". Carrot and multiple sticks So long as Washington continues to turn the sanctions screw on Iran — just this week the Treasury for the first time imposed sanctions on a small Chinese refiner over its purchases of Iranian crude — prospects for de-escalation, or nuclear diplomacy, look slim. This raises the question — what next? For now, Trump's inferred threats of military action against Iran look premature, says Arman Mahmoudian, a research fellow at the Global and National Security Institute, especially in response to Houthi actions. Trump seems to be ""employing a Reagan-era ‘peace-through-strength' strategy… focused on demonstrating force, particularly by targeting the Axis of Resistance, which is currently in a fragile position"", Mahmoudian says. ""By launching the strikes, Trump is signalling he has both the capability and willingness to escalate if necessary. That said, I feel his ultimate goal is negotiations, not full-scale war."" Brew agrees, describing the Houthis as ""an easy target"". They ""have been redesignated a terrorist organisation [by the US] and are in an entrenched position. So bombing them gives this administration the chance to look tough, and appear to be applying pressure on Iran, without having to take action directly"". But if Washington expects such military action against the Houthis to trigger a change in posture or behaviour from the Iranians, they might be disappointed. ""The Iranians won't really care if the Houthis are getting bombed. [The group has shown] over the years that they can absorb these kinds of attacks,"" Brew says. ""But also, Iran doesn't have the same influence over, or relationship with, the Houthis as it does Hezbollah or the Shia militias in Iraq."" The commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has suggested as much, insisting this week that the Houthis ""make their own strategic decisions"" and that Iran ""has no role"" in determining their policies or activities. With both sides seemingly keen to talk, a return to negotiations in the not-too-distant future cannot be ruled out. But the sudden escalation of tensions in the Mideast Gulf region, following the collapse of the ceasefire in Gaza, will almost certainly make things more difficult than they already were.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

About CADO

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations. CADO membership is open to:

Organizations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain

States or quasi-state organizations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry

Related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system

About the SAF Registry

IATA is developing the soon-to-be-launched SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

The SAF Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply —which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally —by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, it gives access to airlines’ corporate customers to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonization.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasted that the average return airfare in 2025 would drop by 1.8 per cent compared with 2024.
Mr Kadam Aggarwal, a partner at Asia-focused management consulting firm YCP Auctus who specialises in aviation and airports, forecasts that airfare will be cheaper in 2025 as a result of lower jet fuel prices.
“It is expected that ticket prices this year should be similar to 2019’s prices , seeing as average jet fuel prices – the most critical parameter driving airfare – are becoming very similar to 2019’s levels ,” he adds.

To predict trends for the year ahead, travel companies often utilise vast amounts of data to identify pricing patterns and analyse traveller behaviour. Reports of late have listed more affordable airfare among their findings.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasted that the average return airfare in 2025 would drop by 1.8 per cent compared with 2024.

In another report by flight-tracking company Hopper, it found that long-haul flights have become more affordable. Its data indicated that flights between the United States and Asia , for instance, cost 11 per cent less in the first half of 2025 than in the same period in 2024.

In February, travel booking platform Expedia released its 2025 Air Hacks Report for Singapore, stating that average economy class ticket prices dropped by 12 per cent, while premium travel was 8 per cent cheaper in 2024 than in 2023.

Its findings were based on a comparison of average round-trip ticket prices for January to October in 2024 and the same period in 2023 , sourced from Airlines Reporting Corporation’s (ARC) global airline sales database.

American company ARC manages the world’s most comprehensive airline ticketing dataset, with information from over 12 billion annual passenger flights operated by more than 480 airlines worldwide, according to Iata.

Referencing the Expedia report, Mr James Marshall, vice-president of global air partnerships at Expedia, says: “The data we have gives us a good indication of how trends are going, and usually, we can expect such trends to continue.”

Fuel prices drop, flight options rise

Experts say prices are largely dictated by supply and demand. When airlines struggle to fill seats, they lower fares to attract passengers. Conversely, strong demand allows them to charge higher prices.

However, multiple other factors – fuel cost, aircraft availability, geopolitical tensions and seasonality – also shape pricing.

Mr Kadam Aggarwal, a partner at Asia-focused management consulting firm YCP Auctus who specialises in aviation and airports, forecasts that airfare will be cheaper in 2025 as a result of lower jet fuel prices.

“It is expected that ticket prices this year should be similar to 2019’s prices , seeing as average jet fuel prices – the most critical parameter driving airfare – are becoming very similar to 2019’s levels ,” he adds.

Iata predicts jet fuel will average US$87 (S$116) a barrel in 2025 – US$12 less than in 2024.

One key area to watch, however, is the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is roughly three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, and is likely to affect ticket affordability in the future.

Still in the nascent stages of adoption, SAF is an alternative fuel produced from non-petroleum sources, such as waste oil and agricultural waste. It remains expensive due to limited production capacity and high feedstock costs.

Post-pandemic, travellers are venturing farther and airlines are responding by opening new routes and increasing flight frequencies to popular destinations.

Mr Marshall says: “People realise they have more choices now and can shop around for good deals.”

Mr Alan Lim, a director of management consultancy Alton Aviation in Singapore, agrees. “The business model for low-cost carriers (LCCs) is to run as many flights as possible and try to keep costs down, which can have an impact on overall airfare.”

More than 100 airlines operate out of Changi Airport, of which around a fifth are LCCs.

Mr Kadam says both the airport’s extensive network and the presence of multiple LCCs drive up competition among airlines in Singapore.

“Compared with Western markets, South-east Asia has a dominance of low-cost carriers simply because its markets are more price-sensitive. LCCs have thrived a lot more here,” he adds.

In other words, as flight options increase, one of the ways airlines will have to vie for travellers’ dollars is by keeping airfare competitive.

How travel patterns affect airfare

Business travel influences airfare patterns, especially when it comes to identifying the cheapest months and days to book flights for leisure travellers.

Expedia’s 2025 Air Hacks Report found that February is the most expensive month to travel for Singapore travellers – likely due to the Chinese New Year holidays.

In comparison, June and July are the cheapest months to fly premium and economy classes respectively.

Mr Marshall says corporate and leisure travel create distinct booking patterns, which are important levers of how airfare will be calculated.

He notes that corporate travellers typically book premium seats, while economy seats are booked by a mix of both leisure and business travellers.

He hypothesises that in June – Singapore’s school holiday season – leisure travel increases and more economy seats are snapped up by families or larger groups travelling together.

As such, demand for premium class seats in June may be relatively lower than in other months, and airfare for those classes of travel dips.

In July, as leisure travel slows and corporate travel picks back up after the June holidays, bookings for premium classes will likely increase with less demand in economy, resulting in lower airfare for economy seats.

While travel reports offer valuable insights, airfare largely remains unpredictable. Alton Aviation’s Mr Lim advises travellers to stay flexible.

“Stick to the basics, such as avoiding travel on peak days and timings by flying mid-week and being flexible with your choice of airline,” he says. “With so many carriers flying out of Singapore, shopping around can often make a difference.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d1dafd144604541de042039f5fe1a287dc4dac22791736815d515c2925c37efb,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:07.218713

Valoriser le CO2 biogénique de Ryam

Il vise à produire chaque année jusqu’à 81 000 tonnes de carburant d’aviation durable, de l’e-Saf (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), appelé à remplacer le kérozène actuel fabriqué à partir d’énergies fossiles. L’unité sera installée sur le site landais de l’américain Ryam, qui dispose encore de 30 hectares disponibles. Cette plateforme est mondialement connue pour sa production de cellulose de spécialité. Cette production à partir de bois génère du CO2 biogénique. Le projet de Verso Energy consiste à récupérer ce CO2 biogénique dans les fumées, estimé à 334 000 tonnes par an. ReSTart permettrait d’éviter l’équivalent en émissions annuelles de 22 500 Français, estime Verso Energy.

""La capacité à financer ces projets découle directement de l’existence d’un marché, avec des clients prêts à contractualiser l’achat des volumes de e-SAF.""

En parallèle, Ryam pousserait le curseur de sa décarbonation. En avril 2024, le site a déjà lancé la fabrication de bioéthanol. Les deux entreprises sont aussi liées dans des expérimentations similaires aux États-Unis, sur le site de Ryam en Géorgie.

Ouverture de la concertation préalable

RTE, le Réseau de transport d’électricité, est aussi associé à ReSTart en tant que porteur de la partie raccordement électrique (via le poste électrique de Berge à Bégaar à environ 5 km, soit via celui de Cantegrit à Morcenx-la-Nouvelle à environ 20 km). C’est ensemble que RTE et Verso Energy ont entamé les démarches administratives. Celles-ci donnent lieu à une concertation préalable entre le 25 mars et le 19 juin. ""Pour être opérationnelle en 2030, l’usine devra avoir obtenu ses autorisations au plus tard fin 2026 pour permettre un début des travaux au plus tard mi-2027"", précise l’entreprise.

I thank President Trump for recognizing the importance of homegrown Iowa biofuels and appreciate his commitment to our energy security.
Homegrown fuels like E-15 lower gas prices for our families, support our farm producers, and reduce our dependence on foreign energy from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.
By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes.
Liquid fuels and homegrown energy will grow our economy, strengthen our energy security, and put American families and farmers first.","Domestic energy production is a critical component of both our short- and long-term economic growth, bolsters our national security, and strengthens our international competitiveness. From getting to work and heating and cooling homes to keeping the lights on and growing crops, our families, farmers, businesses, manufacturers, and many other sectors of our economy rely on reliable, affordable, and abundant sources of energy. President Trump recognized this reality when he declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office and later established a National Energy Dominance Council to explore and implement ways that we can increase domestic energy production and lower energy costs for American families and consumers.

In his declaration of a national energy emergency, President Trump explicitly noted what those of us in Iowa and across the Midwest have known for a long time – biofuels play a pivotal role in restoring American energy independence and supporting U.S. energy dominance. I thank President Trump for recognizing the importance of homegrown Iowa biofuels and appreciate his commitment to our energy security. Now, it is incumbent upon lawmakers to put these words into action. Representing the largest biofuel-producing congressional district in the nation, I have led and cosponsored several pieces of legislation to unleash the full potential of American biofuels and prioritize our energy independence.

First, I helped introduce the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act with my colleague from Nebraska, Rep. Adrian Smith, to make E-15 permanently available year-round at gas stations in all fifty states. Homegrown fuels like E-15 lower gas prices for our families, support our farm producers, and reduce our dependence on foreign energy from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. This simple amendment to federal law would not cost taxpayers a single penny but would deliver fuel savings for drivers to the tune of nearly $21 billion every year and generate more than $66 billion to our Gross Domestic Product annually. Reducing gas prices for Iowans means that our families can save at the pump and invest their money in other ways.

Second, I recently introduced the COST Act, which would direct the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office and U.S. Secretary of Energy to compare the financial and environmental costs of replacing the entire federal gasoline-powered vehicle fleet with either electric vehicles or E-85 capable flex fuel cars and trucks. Back in 2021, President Biden pledged to replace the entire federal fleet with electric vehicles – a decree that would have been extremely costly and inefficient. That’s why we need to study the full cost of making the entire federal fleet electric because I am confident that vehicles powered by biofuel blends would be much more cost-effective and reliable.

Furthermore, I appreciate President Trump for ending the Biden administration’s radical electric-vehicle mandate on our families, farmers, and businesses. Electric vehicles are expensive, unreliable, and unworkable, especially in rural communities. The components needed to make EV batteries are also largely sourced from China, and we should not be bankrolling the Chinese Communist Party’s mission to undermine the United States and hurt our economy. By promoting flex fuel vehicles, we can support Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers, prioritize homegrown U.S. fuels over foreign batteries, and strengthen our strategic position against China.

Third, I helped introduce the Farm to Fly Act with my colleague from Ohio, Rep. Max Miller, to advance the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and promote the role that Iowa agriculture plays in developing this future fuel. This legislation would add a definition of SAF to USDA programs, advance SAF research and development, and promote the use of the GREET model. It would also direct the Secretary of Agriculture to work collaboratively within USDA and with other federal agencies to find ways to promote the commercial adoption of SAF. By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes.

Finally, I helped lead the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act with my colleague from Iowa, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, to support the use of biodiesel and other biomass-based diesel for ships, boats, and other ocean-going vessels. Growing new markets for biofuels is crucial to increasing demand for Iowa agricultural goods and putting more money into the pockets of our producers. Just like we’re doing with jet fuel, we need to expand the use of renewable fuels across more transportation sectors, including boats and ships, to promote homegrown fuels and support our agricultural community.

As the only member of Congress serving on both the House Agriculture Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, I’ll continue to push for policies that open new markets for biofuels, lower energy costs for our families, and support our farmers, energy producers, and rural communities. Liquid fuels and homegrown energy will grow our economy, strengthen our energy security, and put American families and farmers first.

But speeding too far ahead of even the green-friendly European Union on so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could prompt carriers like easyJet EZJ, Wizz Air WIZZ and Ryanair RYAI to fly more elsewhere.
Using SAF, made from more sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and often blended with conventional jet fuel, can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%.
Still, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
The EU and UK governments have aimed to tackle the demand side of the problem via so-called “mandates”: in 2025, 2% of jet fuel supplied at EU and UK airports must be SAF.","Britain has long punched above its weight in global aviation. The UK is home to cutting-edge technologies like Rolls-Royce engines and Airbus wings, and Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports – as proved last week when a power outage caused international travel upheaval. But speeding too far ahead of even the green-friendly European Union on so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could prompt carriers like easyJet EZJ, Wizz Air WIZZ and Ryanair RYAI to fly more elsewhere.

Decarbonising aviation, which accounts for around 2% of global carbon emissions, is a thornier problem than the electrification of cars. Getting an 80-tonne short-haul aircraft off the ground with existing battery technology is a fool’s errand. Using SAF, made from more sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and often blended with conventional jet fuel, can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%.

Still, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). It’s also around three times as expensive as the conventional version, and while airlines want greater investment from energy majors to bring prices down, producers are reluctant to commit to higher output lest carriers spurn their pricey SAF. The EU and UK governments have aimed to tackle the demand side of the problem via so-called “mandates”: in 2025, 2% of jet fuel supplied at EU and UK airports must be SAF.

But it’s there that the flight paths begin to diverge. By 2030, the UK has a 10% SAF mandate, while the EU only has 6%. Moreover, the UK’s mandate increases linearly every year, whereas the EU has, on paper, a straightforward step up from 2% in 2029 to 6% in 2030.

UK-heavy carriers are therefore likely to be spending more on SAF than their European counterparts for the rest of the decade. That’s a competitive headwind in an industry that generally operates with tight profit margins – and in which fuel is usually the largest single expense. IATA estimated in December that global airlines would on average see net profit margins of just 3.6% in 2025.

Carriers could just lump part of the expense on to consumers – as with Deutsche Lufthansa’s LHA announcement of an “environmental cost surcharge” last year. But the industry is already battling stubbornly rising expenses elsewhere, from air traffic control fees to increased maintenance costs to emissions charges. In the UK, for all the fanfare around airport expansion, the government is also raising air passenger duty. There’s a limit to how much consumers will stomach.

As such, it’s quite possible carriers opt for a different solution. If flights that touch the UK incur a significantly higher cost, one simple workaround is to fly more within the EU. Unless Brussels wants to toughen up its own standards – or if the UK proves unsuccessful in its attempts to stimulate much more SAF production and help bring prices down – the likeliest outcome is fewer flights for holidaymaking Brits.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:35.904486

In 2024, revenue will reach nearly 123,000 billion VND

BSR has just announced its audited financial report with positive results such as net revenue from sales and service provision reaching 122,986 billion VND; payment to the State budget reaching 13,554.5 billion VND and profit after tax reaching 316.7 billion VND.

Although the results are somewhat lower than in 2023, BSR's revenue in 2024 is still significantly higher than in the previous period, far exceeding the plan set by the board of directors.

This is an encouraging result in the context of strong fluctuations in crude oil prices, leading to narrowing profit margins in the oil refining industry. Many oil refineries in the world and in Vietnam have been forced to restructure or suspend operations.

Faced with that challenge, BSR has proactively and drastically implemented solutions to respond to the very complex market developments to minimize losses as well as seize opportunities when the market shows positive signs; continue to improve management capacity, market forecasting ability and proactively propose solutions to adapt flexibly.

Crude oil tanker arrives at the SPM.

Over the past year, Dung Quat Oil Refinery has always operated safely, stably and continuously at optimal capacity. BSR has also conquered new operational limits, at times the plant operated at 118% capacity and achieved an output of more than 6.6 million tons of various types of gasoline and oil.

BSR's closing equity for fiscal year 2024 reached VND55,491.5 billion. Regarding investment, during the year, BSR continued to disburse investment for the Dung Quat Oil Refinery Upgrade and Expansion Project, the Project to add crude oil tanks to Dung Quat Oil Refinery and other projects with a total value of VND1,352.5 billion.

In 2025, BSR set a target of output of 6.69 million tons; revenue of 114.5 trillion VND; budget contribution of about 12,992 billion VND; estimated after-tax profit of about 746 billion VND; investment value of about 1,740 billion VND.

This target has been adjusted higher, based on the results exceeding expectations achieved in 2024. However, given concerns about the development of crude oil prices in the world, the profit target is still calculated cautiously. Compared to the implementation level in 2024, BSR's leadership still expects the enterprise to regain profit growth momentum in 2025.

Build multiple scenarios and synchronized solutions

BSR always focuses on forecasting to be proactive in production and business, ensuring flexible response and adaptation to market fluctuations. Previously, BSR's professional department assessed that 2025 would continue to be a challenging year for the market.

Dated Brent crude oil prices reversed and fell sharply below $70/barrel on March 5, 2025, compared to an average price of more than $79/barrel in January 2025, after the US announced many new policies.

In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to increase production again from April 2025 to 138,000 barrels/day. Oil prices are also under downward pressure from geopolitical and economic factors, including increased economic tensions due to US tariff policies, the Russia-Ukraine peace process promoted by the US, and signs of cooling down in the Middle East.

Dung Quat Refinery is always operated safely, stably, and continuously at optimal capacity. At times, the refinery's capacity has reached 118%.

At the latest meeting of the Steering Committee for responding to the decline in crude oil prices, BSR General Director Nguyen Viet Thang directed the activation of production and business operations from VUCA to BANI, clearly analyzed and proposed 3 sets of scenarios for BSR: Real scenario, management scenario and forecast scenario so that any fluctuations in oil prices will have specific response solutions.

In addition, Mr. Thang also emphasized that BSR needs to take advantage of the price difference between input materials and output products, which is still at a good level, to increase the capacity of Dung Quat Refinery, first of all, increasing the capacity of some workshops with room; continue to maintain good relationships with customers, apply flexible sales policies, compete with imported goods, and maintain Dung Quat Refinery inventory at a stable level.

At the same time, BSR synchronously deploys solutions on production operations, business - regulation and investment - finance. In which, production operations are guaranteed to be safe, stable, and maintain high capacity.

Regarding business and regulation, continue to purchase crude oil to optimize capacity, maintain low inventory, urge customers to receive goods on schedule, and consider suitable warehouse rental options. Promote production of new products such as plastic pellets and intermediate petroleum. Regarding investment and finance, optimize cash flow and investment activities, ensuring strong financial resources for the company.

Regarding management, continue to review and improve production processes to increase efficiency and cut unnecessary costs. Complete the quality management system according to international standards, ensuring high-quality products. Expand domestic and international cooperation, exchange experiences, acquire new technologies, and improve competitiveness.

In addition to 3 scenarios for coping with crude oil prices, BSR has also proposed a series of solutions to cope with fluctuations. These include focusing on adapting to crude oil and product prices to increase the operating capacity of the Dung Quat Refinery.

For scientific research and innovation, it is necessary to promote research and application of advanced technology to improve productivity, quality and production efficiency. Strengthen digital transformation, apply AI and information technology in management and operation. Research and invest in renewable energy, circular economy, towards sustainable development and environmental protection.

By flexibly applying appropriate solutions, combining solidarity and creativity, BSR is confident in overcoming challenges and proactively responding to oil price fluctuations. The company will continue to optimize production activities, control costs, improve operational efficiency and promote digital transformation. At the same time, it will take advantage of opportunities from the market and macroeconomic policies to ensure the completion of production and business targets in 2025, maintaining its core role in the Vietnamese petrochemical industry.",https://cdn.petrotimes.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2025/032025/24/16/croped/220250324162538.jpg?randTime=1742817400,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:45.653130

With society continuing to value environmental concerns, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from non-petroleum feedstocks is currently one of the only promising solutions to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the aviation industry. Although there are other alternatives such as hydrogen-powered or electric aircrafts, they face major challenges regarding safety and weight. This project aims to design an SAF production process that produces aviation grade fuel with lower lifetime carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

The proposed plant is in Cattaraugus County, New York, and involves converting woody biomass waste from industries such as the pulp and paper industry into synthetic paraffinic kerosene via the Fischer-Tropsch process (FT-SPK). This conversion was accomplished with a design of three main steps; gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and refining. The gasification stage involves converting woody biomass pellets into syngas, followed by purification and adjustment in a water-gas shift reactor. The syngas is then transformed into heavy FT liquid which is refined further in a hydrocracker and distilled into various products including SAF.

In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.
To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016.
As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem.
Looking forward, Airbus plans to continue to increase the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of at least 30% SAF in its global fuel mix by 2030.","What do Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin and Mirabel have in common? All of these Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

Thanks to this development, by the end of 2025, all Airbus customers, regardless of where they are taking delivery of their aircraft, can do so with SAF on board, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.

SAF remains a key lever for the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals. SAF is anticipated to provide the bulk of the emissions reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions required.

In recent years, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its own operations to 16%, which includes business travel, delivery flights (where a plane is delivered to the home base of the purchasing airline following the transfer of title), and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites.

To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Thanks to a partnership signed in 2024, TotalEnergies supplies more than half the SAF to meet Airbus’ needs in Europe. We have also joined forces with airlines. Volotea, which operates a Hamburg-Toulouse flight for Airbus employees as part of our internal shuttle service, has been using a 34% SAF blend on this route since 2022. And following a successful pilot in 2023, since 2024 Air France-KLM and Airbus have had a “SAF fares agreement”, with Airbus purchasing SAF options for employee business travel connecting Paris with five locations: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich and Toulouse.

Partnerships and pilots

Looking further afield, in 2024, Airbus launched a pilot scheme with easyJet, who operate flights on the Toulouse-Bristol route, a popular route for business travel due to the proximity to Airbus’ Toulouse and Filton sites. Running between November 2024 and January 2025, the scheme saw Airbus finance 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the period.

In January 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air and Moeve and Charleroi Airport completed a SAF operational trial. Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise during the trial, which saw Wizz Air operate more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel. A survey was also completed during this period, which shone a light on passenger awareness of, and attitudes towards, low-carbon aviation including SAF.

Scaling the SAF ecosystem

Even though the quantity of SAF available has increased in recent years, demand remains suppressed due to the higher cost of SAF compared to kerosene – 2.8x according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. The industry has to address this disparity and reduce the price gap with traditional fuel.

Although Airbus is not a SAF producer, there is a role it can play. As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem. In 2024, Airbus invested in SAFFA, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA focuses on SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification, although the investments can take place across different production pathways and regions. SAFFA’s first investment, in US-based Crysalis Biosciences, will help the company produce low-carbon intensity SAF and biochemicals.

In 2024, Airbus also made an investment in sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. Airbus’ investment supports LanzaJet in scaling its SAF production process which uses ethanol, known as the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet recently opened a new SAF plant in Soperton, Georgia, with the capacity to produce 9 million gallons of SAF each year.

“Since the launch of the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), I have personally seen the surge of foreign interest into our OGSE , particularly from Japanese companies in our renewable energy (RE).

“Unfortunately, there is a mismatch in our supply as we do not have enough local players positioned to capture these opportunities,” said Economy Minister Datuk Seri Rafizi Ramli during the launch of the National OGSE Industry Blueprint 2021-2030 Mid-Term Review (MTR).

“By 2030, (the ministry) aims to have 10 OGSE companies that have successfully expanded into the RE space. We want to show how innovative projects like plastic to fuel, can be integrated and diversify revenue streams,” he pointed out.

He further mentioned that the ministry’s second vision is to sale the local OGSE players to becoming regional champions, as 80% of the OGSE companies are SMEs.

Participants in the ‘regional champions programme’ needs to be mid-tier size with over RM50 million in revenue in order to quality, and they must have a positive profit-before-tax (PBT) over five years with no legal issues.

“The idea is to play an identification and matchmaking role of opportunities. We support the deal making process by enabling access to financing and marketing.

“This can be in the form of mergers and acquisitions, management buyouts or joint ventures (JVs). The point is to increase commercial activity and boost export revenues to at least 50%,” he explained.

The COVID-19 pandemic – Razifi believes – exposed many of the financial vulnerabilities within the OGSE industry, with companies finding themselves trapped in overspecialized business models, burdened by excessive debt and diminishing profit margins.

Geopolitical shocks from wars have also triggered significant oil price fluctuations, creating an uncertain landscape that compromised the security of supply chains.

“If we look at pre-pandemic levels, the industry was able to attract approved investments amounting to RM3.3 billion in 2019. By 2022, investments dropped to RM363 million (-89%),” Razifi noted, saying that the MTR comes at a critical juncture in OGSE’s history.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

INTERNATIONAL

Money for trees – Norway is providing NOK 70 mln ($7 mln) to strengthen Indigenous governance in the Colombian Amazon. The support aims to enhance the ability of Indigenous organisations to govern and protect their territories, which are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. The grant will be managed by the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT) in collaboration with Colombian Indigenous organisations. The funds will be channelled directly to Indigenous authorities for activities such as climate monitoring, territorial management, and community development. This initiative is part of Norway’s broader efforts to support Indigenous peoples as key stewards of tropical forests. It also aligns with Colombia’s commitments to reduce deforestation and strengthen Indigenous rights.

Auf Wiedersehen – Germany’s second chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat, has voted in favour of a spending package that loosens borrowing limits, allowing billions of euros of investments in defence, infrastructure, and climate change. The package includes €100 bln for climate action as part of a new €500 bln infrastructure fund, and a historic reform of the country’s debt brake, obtained by the Green Party in exchange for their support to pass the package in the outgoing Parliament. The amendment was backed in the Bundesrat with 53 out of 69 votes in favour, passing the 46-vote threshold, reports DW. Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Rhineland-Palatinate abstained, with abstentions counted as opposition votes, reported the national news outlet. This means expenditures on defence, cybersecurity, intelligence, and civil protection exceeding 1% of German GDP can now be financed with new debt. (DW)

GDP growth – Goldman Sachs Research raised its forecast for the euro zone’s real GDP growth this year to 0.8%, up from 0.7%, driven by a new fiscal plan in Germany and higher defense spending on the continent. The fiscal plan from Europe’s largest economy includes a €500 bln off-budget infrastructure and climate protection fund and increased defense spending, estimated to boost economic activity across the region. Some €100 bln of the fund will be earmarked for climate action. Further out, the economists increased their 2026 forecast for the currency area by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, and boosted the 2027 numbers by 0.3 percentage points to 1.6%.

CCS – Porthos, the EU’s flagship CO2 transport infrastructure project in the port of Rotterdam, is progressing as planned, according to the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). “CINEA visited the section of the onshore pipeline, which is already mostly completed,” the EU agency reported on Mar. 19. The Porthos project aims to develop an open access, 33 km long, onshore pipeline to transport CO2 across borders between the ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Ghent. The captured CO2 will then be sent through a 20km offshore pipeline that will transport the compressed CO2 to depleted gas fields for storage in the Dutch section of the North Sea. “The designated site for the compressor station at Azieweg is also taking shape, with supporting infrastructure such as electrical buildings already in place, while the actual compressors will arrive later towards the end of the construction phase,” CINEA said. The offshore pipeline is still in its early stages, it added, but preparatory activities have already started. The project is expected to be fully operational and start operation “by 2026”, CINEA said.

England’s Western Forest – The UK government has announced plans to plant 20 mln trees and create 2,500 hectares of new woodland in the west of England as part of a ‘national forest’ drive. The new ‘Western Forest’ will consist of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds, and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester. It will be the first of three new national forests pledged by the government to help meet a legally-binding target of achieving 16.5% woodland cover in England by 2050. England’s woodland cover currently stands at 10%. Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 ha of woodland to be planted every year, with latest annual figures showing about 21,000 ha were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 ha in England. The Western Forest, funded by £7.5 mln of public money, will particularly target urban areas like Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester. (BBC)

CBAM for textiles? – An anti-fast-fashion bill is expected to be discussed by the French Senate in the week of May 19th, following its postponement at the start of the year, which prompted widespread discontent with environmental organisations. Article 6 of the bill states that within six months of the law’s promulgation, the government shall submit to Parliament a report examining the opportunity of extending the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to textile products manufactured outside the EU’s territory. Doing so would subject textiles imported into the EU to a carbon emission tariff equivalent to that applied to European makers of the same items. The bill would aim to penalise fast-fashion products on the basis of their environmental impact as well as their commercial practices. The bill is suggesting that penalties be placed on fast-fashion products, and that part of the monies collected will be used to finance collection and recycling in non-EU countries.

What farmers want – In a recent policy brief, the OptFor-EU research project examines challenges and opportunities through expert surveys and stakeholder workshops in alignment with the EU’s Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the European Green Deal. It lists financial constraints, information gaps, competing social priorities, fragmented governance, and differing perspectives based on gender and experience as the main threats in achieving forest-based carbon removal. However, the policy brief suggests there are opportunities to enhance forest resilience through improved data sharing, policy coordination, and innovative tools such as decision support systems and digital monitoring technologies. Moving forward, it recommends stakeholders to reinforce strategic priorities, adopt climate-smart forestry practices, and strengthen financial sustainability to support long-term climate resilience.

Teaming up – The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, supported by the ASEAN Secretariat, held expert consultations on carbon markets with representatives from Russia and Southeast Asian countries this week, reported website TV BRICS. The summit emphasised carbon markets’ role in emissions reduction and energy transition and featured a session on Russian carbon markets, where representatives from the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Russian registry showcased the country’s climate projects. Experts from Myanmar, Malaysia, and Indonesia also shared regulatory developments and future plans for carbon markets, as per the reporting. The consultations were aimed at strengthening Russia–ASEAN collaboration, to foster joint climate initiatives and promote carbon trading across the region.

Brain drain gain – A group of 12 European countries is planning to attract researchers from the US in response to US government cuts to education and research funding. In a letter to EU Innovation Commissioner Ekaterina Zaharieva, the governments called for an “attractivity boom” to bring in talent affected by funding reductions and research interference. The letter, signed by France, Czechia, Austria, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Spain, Slovenia, Germany, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania, urges the European Commission to take action to draw more researchers to the EU.

ASIA PACIFIC

To-do list – Government agencies in the Philippines are developing the Climate Finance Strategy (CFS) to help finance climate priorities, support active membership in the global multilateral funds, and scale up sustainable finance efforts through the Inter-Agency Task Force on Sustainable Finance (ITSF), according to the Philippine News Agency. The task force is also prioritising the crafting of a policy and legal framework for carbon markets and the potential for financing green projects. The country’s finance department is also coordinating with the World Bank for its support for a technical working group on carbon pricing instruments.

The governor speaks – The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended has advocated for creating a pool of bankable projects to increase the flow of climate finance. The Governor Sanjay Malhotra recently said that Indian banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) have limited capacity and expertise which further limits their ability to assess and finance climate change mitigation projects well while increasing the risks associated with funding these projects. Having a pool or collection of financially viable and investment-ready projects can offer multiple benefits, said the governor, suggesting that experienced financial institutions that operate under RBI supervision can contribute to this pool of projects and exchange information, Mongabay reported.

Backwater credits – The Kochi Water Metro in the Indian state of Kerela, is eyeing a substantial additional revenue by monetising the carbon credits it earned through its contribution towards the reduction of GHG emissions, the New Indian Express reported. To facilitate this, the Kerala Water Metro (KWML) has floated a tender for the validation, registration, verification, issuance, and trading of carbon credits. Currently, the entity has deployed 18 ferries on five routes and the first phase of project proposes to connect 38 terminals on 15 identified routes spread across 78 km by operating a fleet of 78 fast, electrically-propelled hybrid ferries. The target is to achieve a reduction of 22,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions by the end of the first phase and the entity has already achieved nearly 20% of the target, KWML said. While the KMRL had entered into a pact with EKI Energy, India’s biggest developer, it has not yet materialised, the media outlet added.

Peak carbon – China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has added a batch of 27 regions to its pilot of cities and areas tasked with hitting peak carbon emissions early. The additions are primarily large industrial parks, including in Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, as well as in provinces such as Jiangsu, Jilin, and Zhejiang. Regional DRCs are now asked to help draw up plans for reaching the goals.

Guide – China’s Guangdong province has issued a notice to provide more clarity for emitters to surrender their emissions permits under the local scheme by July 20, following an allocation plan published earlier this month. Companies are allowed to use offsets issued under the national CCER scheme and Guangdong’s regional voluntary programmes for compliance purposes, with an upper limit of 10%. Priority should be given to credits generated from projects within the Guangdong region, according to the notice.

Jet lagging – Japan’s oil refiners want concrete regulations that are needed to push airlines to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and support supply chain development, the head of the industry lobby said last week. Japan targets 1.7 mln kl of SAF by 2030 to replace 10% of jet fuel with cleaner alternatives by 2030. While refiners face mandates, no binding rules exist for airlines. Petroleum Association of Japan President Shunichi Kito said both suppliers and consumers need regulations, urging cost-sharing and government support for SAF supply chains.

New market – Japanese sustainability solution provider Asuene has formed a business partnership with two Taiwanese companies, Shin Chang Trading and InSynerger, for its expansion in the neighbouring country, it announced Friday. The three companies will support clients in their decarbonisation and ESG efforts as environmental regulations in Taiwan are expected to be strengthened in the coming years.

Domestic expansion – Project developer Bywill has secured a new partnership with Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank and Gifu prefecture’s Kobe town to promote the creation of domestically issued J-Credits. Bywill has formed more than 100 similar partnerships with financial institutions and local governments across Japan over the past two years, company data showed.

AMERICAS

Trump ‘hit list’ – The US DOE appears to be creating a “hit list” of clean energy projects awarded billions of dollars in government funding, according to sources who spoke to Politico. Journalists wrote Trump officials have requested the list by the end of the week, including projects under the IRA. Any programme or project that has spent less than 45% of its appropriated of awarded funding is required to be reviewed. Carbon Pulse reached out to the DOE for comment but did not receive a response.

Not on EDF’s watch – US environmental non-profit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the US EPA’s extension of the reporting deadline for the federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. The EPA filed the extension on Thursday, shifting the deadline for reporting year 2024 from Mar. 31 to May 30. The measure did not take any public comment. EDF alleged that the delay was unlawful and filed a petition for review in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The lawsuit is one of several that EDF has filed against the EPA under the Trump administration.

Big oil battle – A District of Columbia judge heard arguments on Thursday on whether Chevron and other major energy companies should be held financially responsible for climate change impacts. DC Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams considered industry lawyers’ motions to dismiss the case, citing similar lawsuits dismissed in other state courts. Attorneys for oil companies argued that state courts are not the proper venue for such claims. If successful, the lawsuits could cost the fossil fuel industry hundreds of billions of dollars. Williams said she would issue a ruling in four to six weeks.

Rolling along – A proposed clean fuel standard is making its way through Hawaii legislature, according to bill filings published Thursday. SB 1120 was referred to the House Finance Committee after making its way through the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. The bill text currently proposes a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2035, and an at least 50% reduction by 2050, both relative to 2019 levels.

ECCC boasts climate gains – The Canadian federal government released its 2025 National Inventory Report Friday, showing that national greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 dropped by 8.5% from 2005 levels, equivalent to nearly 700 MtCO2. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) suggests that this data shows that Canada’s climate and pollution policies are working. “This year’s final National Inventory Report shows that even as Canada’s economy has become stronger, and more sustainable, the emissions intensity of our economic growth has decreased by 34%,” the agency said in a press release Friday. “Canada’s emissions are now the lowest they have been in 27 ears, excluding the pandemic years, and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.”

Chemists weigh in – Canada’s Chemistry Industry Association (CIAC) has called for a review of industrial carbon pricing rules in light of ongoing trade and tariff tensions. While CIAC supports carbon pricing as a tool to drive emissions reductions and investment in low-carbon projects, it urged policymakers to reassess the system’s fit for energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The statement comes as Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has suspended the federal consumer carbon tax but pledged to retain and improve industrial carbon pricing.

Canadian energy poverty – A study examining energy spending by Canadian households, and the extent of energy poverty across the country, has found 11% of households were energy poor in 2021 — when in–home energy expenditures, such as electricity and natural gas, and gasoline were included. The study, by right-leaning think tank Fraser Institute, defined energy poverty as spending 10% or more on energy expenditures. Regional disparities in energy poverty appear pronounced. In 2021, Atlantic Canada had the highest incidence of energy poverty at 24.6% of households, while British Columbia had the lowest in the country, at 8.1%.

Passage on pause – The Panama Canal Authority has yet to provide guidance on its Low-Carbon Transit Slot initiative, set to launch on Apr. 1. Initially announced in Aug. 2024 as part of efforts to decarbonise shipping and achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, the programme aims to encourage energy efficiency measures and low-carbon technologies. The delay, announced in Nov. 2024, followed an analysis of eligibility criteria, including energy efficiency indicators, fuel types, and regional infrastructure availability.

VOLUNTARY

New biochar system – French biochar developer NetZero has launched a new modular system for large-scale biochar production, which it said will halve land requirements and double output compared to its current technology. The company, a finalist in the XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition, said the patented ‘Gen2’ system was designed to accelerate deployment, lower costs, and improve performance by reducing the need for concrete and steel by 90% and 80% respectively. The first units will be deployed this year in biochar projects using coffee and sugarcane residues in Brazil. NetZero aims to reach 1 mln tonnes of CO2 removal annually by 2030.

Mangrove permanence – Land uplift and related sea level changes could reshape blue carbon ecosystems, affecting their carbon storage potential and restoration strategies, according to a recent study published in ScienceDirect. The research highlights how a 2004 tsunami-driven uplift in Indian island North Andaman degraded large areas of mangroves and led to vegetation shifts that altered carbon dynamics across the region. As sea levels permanently dropped, terrestrial forests replaced mangroves in areas where tidal flooding ceased, while mangroves migrated seaward, colonising former reef beds now exposed by the retreating coastline. Blue carbon projects should factor in long-term geomorphological changes when assessing carbon stocks and ecosystem resilience, as land movement can create new carbon sinks but also disrupt existing ones, the research concluded.

AVIATION

Verification for Dummies – ICAO has provided guidance on verification of CORSIA-eligible fuel claims, providing VVBs bodies with a structured framework for assessing aeroplane operators’ emissions reduction claims related to the use of CORSIA eligible fuels (CEFs). Developed by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), the guidance supports the implementation of Annex 16, Volume IV, and ensures consistency and integrity in emissions reporting under the international aviation offsetting programme. Verification follows a six-step approach: confirming sustainability certification through Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) or Compliance (PoC); tracing documentation back to the last certified entity in the fuel supply chain; validating the operator’s monitoring and reporting systems; checking the Emissions Report and supplementary CEF template for accuracy; ensuring no double claiming of emissions reductions; and reporting any post-verification findings to the State. Claims lacking a verifiable PoS/PoC or traceability to certified entities must be excluded. A key focus is on preventing double claiming of emissions reductions, especially for Scope 1 emissions. Operators must declare participation in other GHG reduction schemes and confirm that no claims have been duplicated. Verification bodies must assess both documentation and internal processes to ensure compliance. Risks associated with non-certified fuel traders, fuel resale, or overlapping claims across schemes must be thoroughly evaluated. The guidance also acknowledges challenges such as documentation time lags and evolving reporting systems. It outlines a variety of supporting documents – mandatory and optional – that may be used to substantiate claims.

AND FINALLY…

Melting away – Glaciers across many regions in the world may not survive this century if current melting trends continue, posing a threat to the millions of people living downstream, UN climate experts warned on Thursday. Ahead of the the first World Day for Glaciers, experts said there have been irreversible changes within the past few years, with the period over 2022-24 experiencing the largest-ever three-year loss. For instance, in central Europe, almost 40% of the remaining ice has melted, they said. “If this continues at the current rate, glaciers will not survive this century in the Alps,” Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) at the University of Zurich, said in a statement.",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-03-24 07:57:38.674728

Le croisement entre le développement des technologies des piles à combustible et la volonté mondiale de rendre le secteur de l’aviation plus durable crée un espace sur le marché pour les avions à hydrogène, qui constituent une approche pour rendre les voyages aériens plus durables. Les rapports d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts » et « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Players, Forecasts », se concentrent sur les technologies émergentes liées à la décarbonisation de l’industrie aéronautique.

Les projets d’Airbus en matière d’hydrogène

Airbus, l’un des principaux constructeurs d’avions opérant en Europe, s’était fixé pour objectif de commercialiser un avion fonctionnant à l’hydrogène d’ici le milieu des années 2030, ouvrant ainsi la voie à un transport aérien plus durable. Cependant, des informations récentes ont indiqué que cet objectif serait retardé en raison d’une sous-estimation du temps nécessaire à l’installation des infrastructures et des technologies requises pour lancer l’aviation à hydrogène.

La nouvelle date de lancement prévue pour le projet se situe désormais dans les années 2040, ce qui met en évidence les défis liés à cette nouvelle technologie, en particulier dans un secteur aussi vaste que l’industrie aéronautique. Bien que ce projet d’avion ne soit qu’une goutte d’eau dans l’océan des objectifs de décarbonisation, son lancement ouvrirait la voie à d’autres entreprises.

IDTechEx propose différentes approches pour une aviation durable

Le dernier rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts », couvre le potentiel de diverses approches de la durabilité dans l’aviation, qui comprend les piles à hydrogène ainsi que la combustion d’hydrogène, les avions électriques à batterie, etc.

Le carburant d’aviation durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) est actuellement la principale approche de la durabilité dans le secteur, en attendant que les piles à hydrogène puissent être adoptées. Le rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Players, Forecasts », considère en détail les SAF comme la prochaine grande tendance dans la décarbonisation de ce secteur, avec des exigences réglementaires dans de nombreuses régions pour la mise en œuvre de certains pourcentages de SAF parallèlement au kérosène traditionnel. Issu d’huiles de cuisson usagées et de graisses végétales plutôt que de sources pétrolières conventionnelles, le SAF, dont les processus de production réduisent les émissions de carbone, constitue une approche plus respectueuse de l’environnement pour alimenter les avions.

Alors que les avions à hydrogène sont de plus en plus encouragés, le SAF semble être la meilleure solution d’ores et déjà disponible. Virgin a été la première à faire voler un avion alimenté à 100 % en SAF de Londres Heathrow à New York JFK, soulignant ainsi les capacités du SAF à fonctionner aussi bien que le carburant ordinaire, malgré les coûts de production, comme le détaille le rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035 : Technologies, Players, Forecasts ».

Coûts environnementaux des nouvelles technologies

Les coûts environnementaux de la production d’hydrogène font l’objet d’un débat qui, à court terme, peut sembler s’opposer aux incitations à en tirer profit à long terme. Comme pour toute nouvelle technologie nécessitant des infrastructures et des investissements pour décoller, il existe un compromis entre les coûts initiaux et les avantages de la mise en œuvre à long terme, qui peut également être considéré comme prévalant avec les SAF.

The Cessna 172 is the most produced aircraft ever made, and the company also produces the popular Cessna 182 Skylane, 206 Stationair, and the 208 Caravan. These planes are propellor aircraft used for personal transport and for utility work in the case of the 206 as well as the turboprop-driven 208.

Then, there's the latest Cessna 408 SkyCourier , the largest propellor-driven Cessna has ever made. With two turboprop engines and a passenger capacity of up to 19, this is a plane so big that Textron Aviation, Cessna's parent company, had to redesign its manufacturing plant to assemble the plane.

But also in the Cessna lineup are the Citation business jets. Introduced in 1972, the Citation series is one of the most successful business jet families in history. While most of these planes are small, light jets or very-light jets designed for short flights with a handful of passengers, the Cessna Citation Longitude is not.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the biggest Cessna jet ever made, more than 50% longer than the Citation II. This and the SkyCourier are the biggest planes that Cessna has ever made from its two main types of aircraft. Today, we're going to explore Cessna's biggest propellor plane and its biggest jet aircraft.

The Cessna 408 SkyCourier

Cessna has produced the single-engine 208 Caravan since the 1980s. With over 3,000 units produced, the type has proved popular with militaries, air freight, and commuters. The Caravan has undergone numerous modifications to its basic design, and multiple variants have been developed. However, in 2017, Cessna unveiled a new entry into this market space.

At the request of FedEx Express, Cessna developed a clean-sheet design that would be both larger and more capable than the Caravan. Dubbed the Cessna 408 SkyCourier , nearly 50 have been constructed since the aircraft entered service in 2022, and Textron announced at the plane's launch that FedEx Express had ordered up to 100 examples to be used for its Feeder brand.

The Cessna 408 is nearly 20 ft (6 m) longer than the 208 Caravan, with a 20 ft (6 m) wider wingspan. Its Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) is more than twice that of the Caravan, and its two Pratt & Whitney Canada turboprops make nearly double the horsepower of the 208's single motor.

Flying with two engines as opposed to one makes the 408 far more capable and faster than the Caravan, all the while being operated by just a single pilot. Just like all Cessna propellor planes, the 408 SkyCourier features a high-wing design, and the plane is equipped with rugged fixed landing gear designed to tackle rough fields.

The 408 comes with many features to improve time efficiency, such as single-point refueling, which reduces turnaround time. The plane also comes in three versions, to capture different market segments.

A freighter version.

A passenger version for commuter airlines.

A ""combi"" variant that has nine seats in the front of the cabin and a cargo hold taking up the rear half of the aircraft.

Inside the 408

This Cessna plane features a Garmin G1000 NXI glass cockpit as standard, while 19 passengers can fit inside the passenger version. This plane is not pressurized, so while it can be flown up to 25,000 ft, most operators will typically cruise much lower.

Inside, the seats are removable in a process that can typically take less than an hour, permitting operators to use the plane for both passenger and cargo flights. The cabin is arranged in a three-abreast two-one layout and features a generous 32"" seat pitch. There's also enough headroom for most people to stand up straight, and the plane even features overhead bins, unlike the 208 Caravan.

The freighter version, meanwhile, features a huge cargo door with space inside the cabin for three LD3 containers. Cessna also offers a wide range of options to suit the needs of various customers, such as cargo nets and floor rollers.

The Cessna Citation Longitude

Cessna is best known for its iconic 172 Skyhawk, a plane with a smaller wingspan than the original Wright Flyer. But the company also produces the highly successful Citation business jet family. With thousands being delivered across 53 years and a dozen main variants, the Citation has brought Cessna great success over the years.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the largest business jet ever made by the legendary company. Developed from the Citation Latitude, this all-aluminum plane was first announced in 2012 and entered service seven years later in 2019.

At 73 ft 2 in (22.3 m) long and weighing over 23,389 lb (10,609) empty, the Longitude is the longest, heaviest, and most capable aircraft that Cessna has ever made. Its two Honeywell turbofans can produce well over 7,000 lbs of thrust each, and the aircraft can fly a maximum distance of 3,500 NM (6,482 KM), meaning that it can operate short transatlantic flights, such as between London-City and Teterboro.

This jet actually has a narrower wingspan than the Cessna 408 SkyCourier, and its tail stands slightly below the 408. However, it has a wing area of 537 sq ft (49.9 meters squared), meaning that its wing is overall much bigger than the one on the SkyCourier. It was also given a low-wing design, which is typical of a jet aircraft.

Inside the Longitude

The Cessna 408 is a plane made for work. It was designed to carry paying passengers and containers for decades without compromising reliability, The Longitude is a different type of aircraft, designed with comfort in mind to appeal to wealthy buyers.

The Longitude can seat between eight and 12 people, which is less than the capacity of the 408. However, the SkyCourier is a utility plane first and foremost. The Cessna 408 in its passenger form essentially operates like a mini airliner, with rows of economy-style seats and overhead bins. It will carry passengers, cargo, or both across short distances, and it was designed to be both cheap to run and reliable.

The Longitude still features a row of seats, this time in a one-one layout, but these seats are designed with comfort and style in mind. The legroom is limitless, and the entire inch of the cabin can be customized to fit any customer's desires, such as changing the cabin sidewalls or adding a sofa.

Despite being powered by two noisy jet engines, passengers wouldn't be able to tell the difference, as the Longitude features one of the quietest cabins in its class. Onboard, passengers are also in for a more physically relaxing experience, as the Citation Longitude features an ambient cabin altitude of around 6,000 ft, similar to an Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Flight crews meanwhile, are treated to a Garmin G5000 avionics system, with five main screens and an optional Heads-Up Display (HUD).

Cessna: A never-ending story of success

These two planes are another example of the success that Cessna has enjoyed. The company has not only followed up on making a larger complement to the utility-focused Cessna 208, but they also continue to iterate on the Citation business jet, with the Longitude being the biggest version yet.

The company originally started out making small, piston-powered aircraft for general aviation, but then they expanded into the business jet market, and then they entered another new market with the 208 Caravan. Now, they continue to find tremendous success in both categories.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/artboard-16_9-5-3.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 07:57:47.719392

This is the view of Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific and Middle East director general Stefano Baronci, who stressed the need for vital stakeholder engagements in prioritising sustainable growth.
He cited examples like the use of hybrid or electrical vehicles on the ground, renewable energy and solar panels for the region.
That consensus has translated to the commitment during the last COP conference to reach 5 per cent of SAF by 2030.
“At the moment it is very costly because supply is not enough, the price that is set for it is still very high.","SWITCHING to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 will be a costly marathon for airports.

But it is possible.

This is the view of Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific and Middle East director general Stefano Baronci, who stressed the need for vital stakeholder engagements in prioritising sustainable growth.

The airport sector, he said, is the first to commit to net zero emission, a target shared by other aviation stakeholders and formalised at the last ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) assembly.

“From an airport perspective, we have to make sure the service on the ground can reach that level of due diligence from an environmental perspective; and you do that through the electrification of the service,” Mr Baronci told this newspaper in an interview in Suva yesterday.

He cited examples like the use of hybrid or electrical vehicles on the ground, renewable energy and solar panels for the region.

“And then of course, you have to create the right dialogue with the airlines to planning long term on how to reduce emissions of the aircraft.

“This is certainly a much more difficult challenge to win because it requires tools like SAF.

“The supply is still not there to meet the demand. The cost is still too high, and again, this is where partnership with supplier industries and authorities will be essential.”

Mr Baronci, who is in Fiji attending the 3rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in Suva, said aviation stakeholders and authorities have been reaching a consensus, an area where industries, suppliers and authorities have to work together and prioritise their efforts.

That consensus has translated to the commitment during the last COP conference to reach 5 per cent of SAF by 2030.

“This is certainly a very important achievement,” he said. “As airports, we can do only to a certain extent but of course we have to create again the right environment, we have to prepare to install the right infrastructure when SAF will be ready.

“In my view it’s possible because it is the best way to reduce emissions. I don’t have the crystal ball for it but I think it requires the engagement of all.

“You need to work by adjusting your processes, by adjusting solutions, and this is what we have to commit to, all of us.

“At the moment it is very costly because supply is not enough, the price that is set for it is still very high.

The aspiration is that once the supply will be there, the cost will be lower and eventually will be economically sustainable.”

For the Pacific aviation sector to achieve this, he said coordination from the top was essential by having a policy framework, and to ensure to be able to monitor the price of SAF.

“We cannot play on our own, we cannot play in silos and this in my view is the most difficult part to manage but there is the commitment of the big airlines, the big airports of States to do so.”",https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_4603-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 22:56:15.669805

A closer look at the Dassault Falcon 7X So then, what can be said about Sir Richard Branson's private jet of choice?","Back in October 2024, an article was published on the private jet collection owned by Sir Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin mega-brand. It was explored in the article that the billionaire owned two Dassault Falcon private jets; the 50EX, the first of which flew in 1996, and the 900EX, which entered service in the same year. As a follow-up, and slight correction to that article, this piece will confirm which private jets Branson currently owns, and takes a deeper look at his history of private jet ownership.

Sir Richard Branson's history with Dassault

It turns out that Branson does not, in fact, currently own multiple Dassault Falcon private jets. Rather, the jet he currently owns, and the latest in his string of Falcons, is a 7X with the tail number M-GGAL, pictured above. Branson has owned a total of three Dassault Falcons, but two of those have since changed hands, according to Airport-Data, and corroborated by SuperyachtFan.

To provide a more comprehensive look at Branson's full list of private Falcons and what became of them, their models and designations are listed below in order of age, the 'youngest' jet first:

Dassault Falcon 7X: Tail number M-GGAL. Built in 2012, this jet is currently owned by Branson, and still registered under private ownership with this designation.

Dassault Falcon 900EX: Tail number G-GALX. This jet was built in 2006, and registered under this designation on July 13th, 2006. It was then sold and deregistered on July 12th, 2012. Currently, it is registered TVPX Aircraft Solutions Incorporated, in Utah.

Dassault Falcon 50EX: Tail number M-VGIN. This jet was built in 2001, and registered under this designation on September 29th, 2012. It has since been sold and deregistered, and since July 18th, 2017, it has been owned by Sky Helicopters Incorporated, Texas.

From a layperson's reading these jets' registration records, it does appear that the oldest 50EX was owned by Branson at the same time as the newest 7X, which he still owns, meaning that he did indeed own multiple Dassault Falcons between 2012 and 2017. Unless there are other Branson-owned private jets before the ones listed, the first one he owned outright was the 900EX, which served between 2006 and 2012.

The Falcon 7X, 50EX, and 900EX compared

With all three of these Falcon variants having three engines and being suitable for long-range executive travel, what is it that made these jets the choice of the globetrotting billionaire? Sir Richard Branson is no stranger to the aviation industry, having founded Virgin Atlantic Airways, and later making efforts to bring about commercial passenger travel via Virgin Galactic, as discussed in a BJTOnline interview. A brief overview of the three Falcons and their specifications follows:

The Falcon 7X is the second largest of all Falcon private jets designed thus far. After being developed from the Falcon 900, the7X was introduced in June 2007 and is still being manufactured today. The Falcon 7X, the extended-range 8X, and the 900 are the only three-engine jets still in production as of this year. As of 2020, 289 have been built thus far.

The Falcon 900EX EASy first saw service as the 900, which took its first flight in September 1984. After a longer-range variant, the 900B, was introduced in 1991, the 900EX replaced this variant, entering service in 1996. The plane would later be developed into the 900EX EASy, produced from 2004 to 2009, and eventually the 900LX, which is the current production model. Since the 900's introduction, it has featured multiple technological upgrades and aerodynamic tweaks, but its overall design has changed remarkably little. Between variations, over 500 have been built so far.

The Falcon 50EX is the oldest on this list, and the progenitor of the other two jets, its introduction dating all the way back to November 1976, when it debuted as the super-midsize Falcon 50. Loosely based on the even older Falcon 20, this jet was a clean sheet design that featured an original wing. The Falcon 50EX features improved engines and other enhancements to give further range increases, and was manufactured from 1996 to 2008. Between both versions, 352 were built.

Specifications of these Falcon models

Additional data from GlobalAir.

As shown by the reduced number of seats on the 7X compared to the 900EX, the more modern business jets are more executive than passenger-oriented in terms of configuration. However, the 7X is a much larger plane than the 50EX, meaning that while Branson owned both, he had two jets that could be used for different purposes, the 7X being suitable for trips to Europe and Asia from his home base in the UK, and the 50EX being more suitable for shorter trips.

How Sir Richard Branson made his millions

Sir Richard Branson first started the Virgin company in 1970, so named because he and his staff were so new to the world of business. The company began as a mail order service, selling records, but soon blossomed into the independent record label, Virgin Records. Two years later, Virgin Records was the biggest independent record label in the world, featuring the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols and Phil Collins, among many others.

In 1984, Branson founded Virgin Atlantic Airways, the first of many travel-related Virgin companies. As of 2021, he is still pursuing his vision of establishing a commercial space travel solution with the Virgin Galactic venture, the name of which played a part in the naming of his 900EX and 7X jets.

For a more detailed examination of how Virgin Atlantic became a global airline, read this article from August 2024.

In July of that year, Branson flew more than 50 miles above the New Mexico desert on the Virgin Galactic rocket plane VSS Unity, in the vehicle's first fully crewed test flight to space. The flight had been in the works for more than 17 years, and represented a major milestone for the project.

Space flight aside, Branson now has more than 11.5 million followers across online social networks, and spends a lot of time as a daredevil adventurer. He holds records for the fastest Atlantic Ocean boat crossing and hot-air ballooning across two oceans. He has written six books, and was knighted by then Prince Charles in 2000.

A closer look at the Dassault Falcon 7X

So then, what can be said about Sir Richard Branson's private jet of choice? Looking at an example available for charter via Clay Lacy, which has an interior finished in 2023. The plane comes with the following creature comforts and modern amenities:

11 seats, convertible to five beds

Two lavatories, the aft having a full vanity

SatCom Direct Wi-Fi with streaming speeds

HD monitors and an airshow moving map

Cabin environment controls

Power outlets & USB-C charging

Kitchen featuring microwave, oven, galley sink, and coffee-making facility

Easy in-flight access to the baggage compartment

With its long range, it makes a great plane for transcontinental or transatlantic travel. It can reach a cruising speed of 0.80 Mach, boasting a fuel consumption of up to 30 percent lower than other jets in its class. Plenty of light is provided by the 28 large windows, and the high-tech cabin management system, with multiple control points, allows passengers to set an appropriate mood for their time of travel.

How much is it to purchase one today?

While the video below may quote the new price of the Falcon 7X as being around $60 million, an article published in March shows the most recent price as closer to $55 million. As the newer 8X exists, pre-owned prices of the jet have begun to fall, ranging from $15 million to $48 million, with the earliest 2007 models being the cheapest.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-85.png,N,,2025-03-23 16:56:24.424140

Collaboration between Ethiopian and Etihad Airlines Boosts Travel Options

The joint venture features a codeshare agreement, which enhances flexibility for passengers travelling on both airlines’ networks. Travellers can now book single-ticket routes that combine Ethiopian Airlines’ reach into the Middle East and Asia. This simplifies the process of connecting through Addis Ababa and Abu Dhabi.

The CEO of Ethiopian Airlines described the significance of the deal as “a significant milestone in our efforts to enhance connectivity and provide exceptional service.”

With the increase in air traffic between these regions, the partnership enhances convenience while reinforcing economic connections, as Abu Dhabi’s tourist attractions and Ethiopia’s lively investments are set to attract more tourists.

Linking Africa and Asia via Abu Dhabi

The recently introduced flights represent a big step forward for Ethiopian and Etihad Airways, both airlines with strong growth goals. Ethiopian Airlines, the continent’s largest airline, will use its modern fleet, which includes Boeing 777s and Airbus A350-100s, on the Addis Ababa to Abu Dhabi route, expanding its footprint in the UAE across existing services to Sharjah and Dubai. Furthermore, Etihad Airways’ daily flights to Addis Ababa are its fifteenth new route in 2025. This highlights Abu Dhabi’s status as a worldwide aviation centre.

“This partnership connects our expanding networks, offering seamless access to a growing list of destinations,” said Antonoaldo Neves, CEO of Etihad Airways.

This strategic partnership enhances the presence of both Airlines’ in an expanding market and promotes greater economic and cultural interactions.

However, it did not factor in additional cost pressures such as increased aviation fuel taxes or the mandatory adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which was considerably more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
This means that the annual emissions from aviation fuel are equivalent to the annual emissions of 856,000 petrol-driven cars.
The RefuelEU Aviation mandate will gradually require airlines to use more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which will make fuel costs higher.
By the end of 2024, KM Malta Airlines will have modernised its fleet entirely, operating eight Airbus A320neo planes.","Flights to and from Malta are expected to get more expensive because of rising costs from the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Ticket prices could go up by about €10.10 per passenger if the cost of CO2 emissions is €80 per metric tonne. The price could go up by as much as €13.92 per passenger if the ETS cost rises to €110 per metric tonne of CO2.

This emerges from a Central Bank discussion paper authored by senior economist Kurt Sant.

The report considered ticket price adjustments if airlines passed on these costs entirely to passengers. However, it did not factor in additional cost pressures such as increased aviation fuel taxes or the mandatory adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which was considerably more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

The report revealed that scheduled passenger flights to and from Malta International Airport in 2024 consumed a staggering 351,977,437kg of fuel. This corresponds to 1,112,248 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions.

This means that the annual emissions from aviation fuel are equivalent to the annual emissions of 856,000 petrol-driven cars. This calculation, made by MaltaToday, is based on EU average emissions of 1.3 metric tonnes of CO2 per car per year. It would take roughly 18 million trees growing for 10 years to absorb this amount of CO2.

The cost of cutting emissions

By 2026, airlines will no longer receive free ETS allowances and will be required to purchase them in full, in line with the EU’s polluter-pays principle. This change will significantly raise operational costs for carriers, particularly those serving smaller and highly seasonal routes like those to and from Malta.

The EU’s Fit for 55 initiatives, which aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, are driving regulatory changes in the aviation sector. The RefuelEU Aviation mandate will gradually require airlines to use more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which will make fuel costs higher. Although the Single European Sky initiative is expected to help airlines save time and improve efficiency by better managing airspace, smaller airlines will still face challenges due to the overall rules and regulations.

Efficiency measures by the new national airline

The analysis also considered measures taken to enhance the efficiency of KM Malta Airlines, which replaced Air Malta as the country’s flag carrier. The new airline inherited a fleet of six Airbus A320neo aircraft from Air Malta, along with two older Airbus A320 models, which have since been replaced by additional A320neo aircraft. By the end of 2024, KM Malta Airlines will have modernised its fleet entirely, operating eight Airbus A320neo planes.

The shift to a fully A320neo fleet partly offsets rising operational costs and environmental obligations. The A320neo offers up to 20% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor and significantly reduces noise levels. The investment in a more fuel-efficient fleet has allowed KM Malta Airlines to cut emissions and fuel consumption, achieving a reduction of 36,367 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2024 alone. If the airline had exclusively operated older A320 models, fuel consumption would have been significantly higher, resulting in additional emissions and costs.

The airline’s fleet renewal is also expected to yield financial benefits in the context of ETS changes. In a scenario where all flights were operated using older aircraft, KM Malta Airlines would have faced an ETS cost of nearly €23 million at an allowance price of €80 per metric tonne of CO2.

However, due to its transition to the A320neo, the airline has managed to reduce this expense to under €20 million. A complete shift to an all-A320neo fleet, including wet-leased flights, would further lower ETS-related costs to below €19 million, generating an additional €1 million in savings.

Total carbon footprint of aviation

The Central Bank report also estimated the total emissions of all flights operating to and from Malta at 1.24 million metric tonnes of CO2. Passenger flights, which accounted for 85% of total flights, were responsible for 1.1 million metric tonnes of CO2.

Cargo flights accounted for the highest emissions among non-scheduled services, releasing 44.8 million kilograms of CO2, closely followed by other commercial aircraft flights, which produced 44.5 million kilograms of CO2.",https://content.maltatoday.com.mt/ui_frontend/thumbnail/684/400/1.1_airport_passenger_pic.png,N,,2025-03-23 12:56:13.816039

Factors influencing salary

There are three main factors that would influence the salary for a private pilot. They are:

Experience and flight hours: There are three experience levels for pilots; entry-level, mid-level and senior level. According to Aviation Career Hub, the salaries are:

Geographical location: The type of employer can also impact the salary. Private pilots can work for large charter companies, smaller companies or privately owned jets. Working for large charter companies or on privately owned jets usually comes with a generous salary and other employment perks. Some examples of the additional benefits include:

Type of aircraft: The type of aircraft a pilot operates is also a huge indicator of their earning potential. Light jets, such as the Cessna Citation , will have a lower pay in comparison to heavier, more complex jets such as the Gulfstream G650. The type of aircraft and expericence level will also contribute to the salary, here is a table showing the salary for a first officer and a capain on differnent types of aircraft, according to BizJetJobs.

The factors influencing private jet traffic.

There are many reasons why people decide to fly privately. Here is a breakdown of a few:

Economic factors such as wealth and spending power can result in higher amounts of private jets needed in operation, resulting in a demand for more pilots with a type rating for a private jet. According to Fortune, between 2012 and 2022, West Palm Beach, Florida and Miami, Florida experienced the most millionaire growth by 90% and 75% respectively. The other cities that made it to the top 5 in terms of millionaire growth were: Austin, Texas (102%); Scottsdale, Arizona (88%); and Greenwich and Darien, Connecticut (72%). Out of the 5 cities, Miami has the most billionaires, 12, and the highest number of residents, with a net worth of over $100 million.

Flying private allows individuals to optimise their air travel experience to their needs and preferences. Flying private allows individuals to save a significant amount of time compared to flying commercial. Additionally, there is more flexibility in terms of scheduling and the route of the flight. Owning or chartering a private jet allows for customization with regard to the interior of the jet so it can meet the needs and preferences of everyone's needs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the desire to fly privately increased due to the travel restrictions as travelling privately allowed for more control over travel plans. This led to highlighting the flexibility and convenience of private jet travel, which in turn influenced more people to travel privately who before the pandemic, would most likely travel in a first-class cabin on a commercial flight.

Private Airports in Florida

There are over 120 airports in Florida, with many having a fixed-based operator (FBOs are terminals for private jet customers). With many airports having a FBO, shows the demand for private jet pilots in Florida. Here are some of the airports which have an FBO according to Air Charter Service.

Miami Executive Airport

Miami Executive Airport is the most popular private jet airport in Miami. It is one of the busiest airports in Florida, and comes with a discrete personalized service, allowing their private jet passengers to choose their VIP lounges, showers and concierge services.

Miami-Opa Locka Airport

Miami-Opa Locka Airport is located 10 minutes away from the Hard Rock Stadium, making it the ideal destination for NFL fans flying to Miami. The airport has four fixed-based operators and is equipped with a VIP lounge, well-appointed conference rooms, showers and sleeping rooms and excellent service.

Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport

Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport is a great option for people who want to avoid the high-speed atmosphere of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. With two runways, it is one of the busiest private airports in Florida. However, it never feels that way due to its 5 fixed based operators.

Palm Beach International Airport

Palm Beach International Airport is located 3 miles south-east of Palm Beach. The three FBOs are located on the south end of the airport, allowing its private jet customers that executive feel.

Boca Raton Airport

Boca Raton Airport is in between Palm Beach Airport and Fort Lauderdale. In 2018, it started to allow international flights to land directly at the airport instead of making a stop beforehand as it added an onsite Customs and Border Protection facility​​​​​​.

St Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport

St Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport is 9 miles from St Petersburg, 7 miles from Clearwater and 17 miles from Tampa. It is used as a hub for low-cost airlines, but over 70% of its traffic comes from general aviation. The airport comes with 2 fixed-base operators that offer passenger lounges, Wi-Fi, courtesy cars and business facilities.

Naples Airport

Naples Airport is located just over 2 miles from the central business district of Naples. The airport currently does not serve any commercial airlines and has one fixed-base operator. The airport's commercial service was at its peak during the 1990s.

What are the private jet pilot salaries globally?

The geographical location of where a pilot is based is one of the many contributors to their salary. Some areas will have more high-net-worth individuals, resulting in pilots having a higher salary. The cost of living in each area will also contribute to the costs.

United States

The United States is known for being the home for many wealthy people, and the U.S is a significant market for private jet services. On average, a private jet pilot in the U.S. will earn $131,000, with a salary ranging from $49,500 - $201,000.

Europe

Europe is home to many high-net-worth individuals and corporations. Countries with the most high net-worth individuals are Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Salaries in Western Europe can be between $76,000 and $164,000. Private jet pilots in Eastern Europe will usually receive lower salaries ranging between $44,000 and $98,000.

Middle East

The Middle East is known for its high concentration of wealth, making it one of the biggest hubs for private aviation. Salaries over here can range from $100,000 and $180,000. Pilots in Dubai or Abu Dhabi will have a salary towards the top end of the pay scale.

Asia

Asia's private aviation market is constantly growing. China has the highest private jet pilot salary, ranging between $80,000 and $160,000. In Southeast Asia, private jet pilots can expect to earn between $60,000 and $120,000.

Australia

Due to Australia being geographically remote, private jets are a viable option. Salaries in Australia range between $77,000 and $102,000.

Canada

There has been a growth in the need for private jets in Canada, especially in business hubs such as Toronto and Vancouver. The average salary for a private jet pilot in Canada can range between $70,000 and $105,000.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-71.png,N,,2025-03-23 11:56:40.501467

A Central Bank report estimates ticket prices could rise by €10.10 per passenger if CO2 costs reach €80 per metric tonne and up to €13.92 at €110 per metric tonne. These estimates assume airlines pass on the full cost but exclude factors like fuel tax hikes and the switch to costly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Malta’s aviation sector produced 1.1 million metric tonnes of CO2 in 2024, equal to the emissions of 856,000 petrol cars. From 2026, airlines must fully purchase ETS allowances, further increasing costs. EU regulations also require a gradual shift to SAF, which is far more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

KM Malta Airlines is mitigating costs by upgrading its fleet to Airbus A320neo aircraft, which are 20% more fuel-efficient. This transition has already cut CO2 emissions by 36,000 metric tonnes in 2024, reducing ETS-related costs from nearly €23 million to under €20 million.

The report also highlighted that while passenger flights are the main source of aviation emissions, cargo flights, business jets, and military aircraft contribute significantly."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.75761-15/485633647_18097156009534349_5206840070241409184_n.jpg?stp=c270.0.810.810a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=1rfVievPOaQQ7kNvgEhuDTt&_nc_oc=AdnX-pf_rkg4EKKJVnBsNFqPtepgySWBmymBAofJDT97ZYDhgmYNk1SxjPSHUfp2mA0&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=nRRfKNn_3y51-rtFppB2FQ&oh=00_AYHThl2Xlzw6bAYYKOsUs9QnDlko1twSprKHo8SxmOWylg&oe=67E61B62,N,,2025-03-23 12:56:16.691297

This article explores how airlines, governments, and innovators are accelerating the shift to cleaner skies.

Why Biofuels Matter in Aviation

Aviation currently accounts for about 2% of global CO₂ emissions, and airlines face growing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Biofuels — particularly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) made from renewable sources — can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional kerosene jet fuel (AFDC, 2024). This emissions reduction is a key driver behind SAF adoption.

The international aviation sector has set an aspirational goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2050, with SAF widely viewed as the best near-term solution. Airlines also see biofuels as a hedge against oil price volatility and supply disruptions. As Delta’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Amelia DeLuca, put it: “SAF is the best-known lever we have to decarbonize aviation… we need as much SAF as we can get” (CARB, 2024).

In addition, SAF enhances brand reputation — helping airlines attract environmentally conscious travelers while signaling climate leadership to investors and regulators alike.

As SAF moves from early adoption to global momentum, several key trends are emerging across the aviation industry. From airline strategies and policy mandates to technological breakthroughs, these developments are shaping the future of biofuels in the aviation industry. The following five trends reveal how the sector is moving from ambition to implementation.

1. Airline commitments to biofuels in the aviation industry

Airlines across the globe have announced bold commitments to incorporate biofuels in their operations. Many see SAF as crucial for meeting industry climate targets (like the IATA pledge for net zero by 2050) and government mandates.

For example:

Delta & Southwest: Have publicly committed to replacing 10% of their jet fuel with SAF by 2030.

Oneworld Alliance (including American Airlines, British Airways, and Qantas): Collective 10% SAF target by 2030.

United Airlines: Leads the U.S. market with multiple SAF investments and off-take agreements, including a $200 million fund dedicated to SAF innovation.

KLM & Lufthansa: Pioneers in SAF adoption, with regular SAF use on select routes and long-term supply agreements.

These biofuel commitments aren’t just PR—many airlines are signing multi-year purchase deals with SAF producers (e.g., Delta with Gevo, Singapore Airlines with Neste). As of 2023, over 360,000 commercial flights have flown using SAF blends. That number is expected to grow exponentially as production ramps up.

Early adoption of biofuels also boosts an airline’s brand image among eco-conscious travelers, demonstrating leadership and innovation in climate strategy.

See Top 5 Advanced Biofuel Companies for key players behind these shifts.

2. The cost & scalability challenges of biofuels in the aviation industry

Despite growing momentum, cost and supply remain major hurdles to widespread SAF adoption. Currently, SAF is significantly more expensive than conventional Jet A fuel. According to industry reports, U.S. jet fuel averages around $2.85 per gallon, while SAF can range from $4.00 to $7.00 per gallon or more—often 2–5 times the price.

This price premium, or “green premium,” reflects high production costs, limited refining capacity, and expensive feedstocks. While SAF can deliver substantial emissions reductions, the economics still make large-scale adoption challenging for airlines operating on thin margins.

In 2022, SAF accounted for only about 0.1% of total jet fuel used in the U.S. The Biden administration’s SAF Grand Challenge aims to scale annual production to 3 billion gallons by 2030, a dramatic increase from roughly 16 million gallons produced in 2021. But even with aggressive investment, projections suggest the U.S. might reach only ~2.1 billion gallons without further policy and capital support.

“A lot of additional investment is needed to hit that target” – Gordon McManus

Meanwhile, producers are working to improve conversion efficiency, build larger refineries, and explore cheaper feedstocks such as municipal waste and used cooking oil. Many SAF pathways are also beginning to benefit from learning-curve effects, with the expectation that costs will decline as technology scales.

3. Government policies supporting biofuels in the aviation industry

Government support is one of the most important accelerators for sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is still in its early days, and clear policies can make the difference between pilot programs and industry-wide transformation.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced a blender’s tax credit for SAF of up to $1.75 per gallon, depending on lifecycle carbon intensity. This helps narrow the price gap with fossil jet fuel. Additional federal incentives, grants, and Department of Energy (DOE) funding have supported new SAF projects and refineries.

California provides further support through its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which offers SAF producers credits that can be sold to emitters, creating a direct financial reward for low-carbon fuel use at airports like LAX and SFO.

The European Union has taken a more regulatory approach. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a minimum of 2% SAF blending by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. The regulation also requires e-fuels (made from green hydrogen and CO₂) to account for at least 2% by 2030, signaling a strong push toward synthetic fuels.

Other countries are also stepping up. Singapore has announced plans for SAF blending mandates by 2026, Japan has a 10% SAF goal by 2030, and Australia is funding domestic SAF production. Globally, the CORSIA scheme from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sets emission caps and encourages airlines to adopt offsets or cleaner fuels.

As more governments implement mandates and incentives, they create stable demand signals that encourage investment and innovation across the SAF supply chain.

4. Can biofuels in the aviation industry replace kerosene?

Many stakeholders are asking the big question: Can SAF and other aviation biofuels fully replace fossil jet fuel?

While the answer is “not entirely”—at least not soon—there’s strong evidence that SAF can replace a substantial portion of aviation fuel over the next two to three decades. According to IATA, SAF could deliver up to 65% of the CO₂ reductions needed for the sector to hit net zero by 2050.

However, aviation demand is projected to grow significantly in that timeframe. This means that SAF will need to expand at an extraordinary pace to maintain or reduce emissions.

Short-haul flights may gradually transition to electric or hydrogen propulsion, but medium and long-haul flights, representing the majority of emissions, are expected to rely heavily on SAF.

Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, made from renewable electricity, hydrogen, and captured CO₂, are another piece of the puzzle. These can be blended with SAF or used as standalone fuels. The EU’s e-fuel mandate is already pushing this segment forward.

Blending levels are expected to increase: from today’s 1–2% SAF on most commercial routes, to 10–20% by the early 2030s, and 50% or more in the 2040s. Some pioneering flights have already flown on 100% SAF in test conditions, proving that the technology works even if it’s not yet widespread.

The consensus is that SAF will be the primary solution for decarbonizing long-distance air travel, but it must be paired with continued R&D, infrastructure investment, and supportive policy.

5. Innovation on the horizon for biofuels in the aviation industry

Although SAF is already viable today, the next generation of technologies and feedstocks will be essential for making it cost-effective, scalable, and truly sustainable. Here’s what’s coming:

Algae-Based Fuels: Algae can produce far more oil per acre than traditional crops, grow in brackish or saltwater, and don’t compete with food production. Companies are racing to commercialize algae as a low-impact SAF feedstock.

Municipal Waste & Captured Carbon: SAF is now being developed from household garbage and even direct air capture (DAC) CO₂ streams. These ultra-low-carbon pathways turn trash and emissions into flight-worthy fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Fuels: These synthetic fuels combine green hydrogen with captured CO₂ to create e-kerosene. Already in European pilot production, PtL fuels are expected to scale significantly in the 2030s.

Advanced Catalysts & Refining Tech: R&D is reducing energy input and increasing conversion efficiency, making fuel production faster, cheaper, and less resource-intensive.

New Feedstock Certification: The industry is working on certifying novel feedstocks like halophytic plants (which grow in saltwater) and volatile fatty acids from fermentation. More approved pathways = more flexibility and innovation.

In parallel, engine manufacturers like Rolls-Royce and GE are testing engines that can run on 100% SAF. Some OEMs are even considering aircraft optimized specifically for SAF use in the future.

As innovation continues, the barriers to SAF adoption—cost, feedstock availability, and conversion efficiency—will likely shrink. That means biofuels will play an even more significant role in the future of aviation’s clean energy.

The aviation industry’s journey toward net zero is just beginning—and SAF will be one of the jet engines powering that shift.
