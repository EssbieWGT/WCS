“Woodchuck’s new facility in Grand Rapids will create good-paying, high-skill jobs and build on Michigan’s leadership in AI, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy,” Whitmer said. “By turning waste into a productive resource, Woodchuck is helping us protect our precious natural resources and build a more cutting-edge, sustainable economy. Let’s keep working together to secure more projects just like Woodchuck in Michigan so we can lead the future and grow our economy.”

At full capacity, the facility will divert tens of thousands of tons of wood waste from landfills each year—converting it into renewable biomass to power local industries, support utility decarbonization, and reduce methane emissions from decomposing wood. By using AI to sort, identify, and process usable materials, Woodchuck drastically increases efficiency and transparency in a sector long plagued by fragmentation and contamination challenges.

“Construction and demolition sites produce an enormous amount of recoverable wood, yet the majority of it still ends up in landfills,” said Todd Thomas, CEO of Woodchuck. “This facility changes that. Woodchuck transforms waste into value, reducing costs, reducing landfill usage, and unleashing an abundant energy future!”

In addition to servicing the construction industry, Woodchuck’s capabilities are already proving critical in emergency response and environmental recovery. Following the devastating ice storms that swept through northern Michigan earlier this month, Woodchuck has partnered with several counties to rapidly process fallen trees and wood debris—turning what would have been landfill waste or burn piles into clean biomass energy. The effort is helping communities recover faster, while reinforcing the value of localized circular economy solutions in the face of climate-driven weather events.

In addition to elected officials, the grand opening was attended by leaders from the energy, manufacturing, and sustainability sectors, highlighting growing national interest in waste-to-energy solutions that close the loop between construction, recycling, and clean power.

They want to restore $5 billion in federal funds meant for EV charging infrastructure.
Public Support – Polls show most Americans support growing EV infrastructure as a step toward fighting climate change.
Taking the Fight to Court The Trump administration defends the freeze on federal EV charging funding.
It will also help them check how well the funding meets U.S. energy and economic goals.","Momentum for electric vehicles (EVs) is growing fast, but a major hurdle has appeared. Seventeen U.S. states, with California in the lead, sued the Trump administration. They want to restore $5 billion in federal funds meant for EV charging infrastructure.

Congress originally approved these funds. They are key to growing charging networks across the country and helping promote sustainable transportation.

States like New York, Illinois, and Minnesota are part of the lawsuit. They say freezing the funds slows down economic growth and harms renewable energy efforts. They believe the freeze blocks progress toward meeting important climate goals.

California Governor Gavin Newsom remarked that such a decision is illegal and can hurt thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said:

“The President continues to roll back environmental and climate change protections, this time illegally stripping away billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends.”

The coalition views this funding as crucial. It helps keep the U.S. a leader in clean energy and ensures a sustainable transportation future.

Frozen Funds, Frozen Progress: Why the Lawsuit Matters

The lawsuit claims that halting access to the $5 billion fund creates serious problems for EV growth. Without a reliable network of chargers, many people might hesitate to switch from gas-powered cars to electric models.

Key points raised by the states include:

Economic Impact – Losing these funds could cost thousands of jobs in industries tied to building and maintaining EV infrastructure.

Climate Goals – Without a solid charging network, states may not meet their carbon reduction goals.

Public Support – Polls show most Americans support growing EV infrastructure as a step toward fighting climate change.

The states say that cutting this funding harms the environment. It also hurts local economies and makes it harder for everyone to access EVs.

Blocking these resources could slow down an EV market that experts expect to boom in the next few years. Analysts project that EVs could make up more than 60% of U.S. auto sales by 2030 if the right infrastructure is in place.

According to the International Energy Agency’s outlook, over a third of automobiles sold globally by 2030 could be EVs.

Taking the Fight to Court

The Trump administration defends the freeze on federal EV charging funding. They say the program is under review. This review aims to ensure it matches the administration’s priorities. These priorities focus on supporting fossil fuel development instead of expanding clean energy initiatives.

President Trump has expressed opposition to federal support for electric vehicles. He promised to roll back EV mandates. He will revoke pollution limits that help zero-emission vehicle sales and plans to eliminate federal EV tax credits.

The administration’s energy policy aims to declare a “national energy emergency.” This will boost domestic oil drilling and cut federal investment in EV infrastructure.

Some administration officials also say there’s a need to pause the program. They believe this will stop foreign competitors, like China, from gaining benefits. It will also help them check how well the funding meets U.S. energy and economic goals.

However, the states argue that this claim is misleading. They say that investing in local EV infrastructure boosts American industries, creates jobs, and strengthens energy independence.

Winning the lawsuit could do more than release the $5 billion. It could set a strong legal example for other renewable energy projects facing political challenges. Future green initiatives might be able to use this case to defend against funding cuts or delays.

At a time when global EV sales rose by 35% in 2023, reaching over 14 million units, according to the IEA, the pressure to keep moving forward is strong. The lawsuit is not just about chargers; it’s about protecting America’s role in a fast-growing, clean-energy future.

EV Market Poised for Growth—But Funding is Key

The electric vehicle market is already shifting rapidly. More drivers want EVs. They like the lower costs, care about the environment, and appreciate government incentives. However, building enough charging stations remains one of the biggest challenges.

In 2024, the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market achieved a record high, with 1.3 million EVs sold, marking a 7.3% increase from the previous year. EVs accounted for about 8.1% of all new vehicle sales.

Notably, while Tesla’s sales declined by 5.6%, other automakers like General Motors and Honda experienced significant growth, introducing new models such as the Honda Prologue, which sold over 33,000 units in its debut year.

In April 2025, EV sales dropped by 5%. This decline came from high vehicle prices, fewer incentives, and worries about charging infrastructure.

On the infrastructure front, the U.S. expanded its EV charging network to nearly 204,000 Level 2 and DC fast charging ports by the end of 2024, doubling the number since 2020. This expansion has improved coverage along major corridors, with 59.1% now having DC fast chargers at least every 50 miles, up from 38% in 2020.

Currently, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and renewable technologies are growing. However, EVs still need thousands of new public chargers to meet rising demand. Without the $5 billion in federal funding, many of these projects could be delayed or canceled.

Here are the major stakes involved in this legal fight:

Access and Equality. Without widespread charger coverage, rural and underserved communities could be left behind.

Speed of Adoption: The more chargers are available, the faster people will feel comfortable buying EVs.

State Leadership. California and other states want to ban new gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035. However, they need the right infrastructure to make this transition work.

What’s Next for EV Infrastructure and Clean Energy Goals?

This lawsuit reveals a larger issue: the clash between state climate efforts and federal policy changes. With governments and companies pushing to cut carbon emissions, strong legal protections for green projects are more crucial than ever.

The legal outcome could change EV infrastructure in the U.S. If the states win, it may lead to more investments in EV chargers and other renewable energy tech. This boost could help the green economy and create thousands of jobs.

If the lawsuit fails, it might delay EV adoption. This is especially true in states that depend on federal support for infrastructure projects. Analysts say that if infrastructure development doesn’t keep up, hitting net-zero emissions by mid-century will be much tougher.

In the coming months, as the case moves through the courts, the outcome may decide if America can keep up with global leaders in clean transportation. This legal battle will greatly impact the future of clean mobility, economic opportunity, and environmental leadership.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/States-Sue-Trump-Over-5-Billion-EV-Charger-Funding-1024x683.png,N,,2025-05-12 18:56:48.630230

In addition, the Group purchased approximately 2,000 tonnes of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of emissions reductions from World Energy, a United States-based producer, utilising the Book & Claim Chain of Custody model. This allows the Group to claim associated emissions reductions without physical fuel delivery. Both deals were completed in the first quarter of 2025 and these transactions are projected to reduce more than 9,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

SIA also participates in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, an initiative designed to boost the demand for SAF in the Asia-Pacific region. Launched by the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, the campaign seeks to enhance awareness and understanding of SAF, while actively promoting its use and fostering strategic partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “These agreements represent important steps in the SIA Group’s broader strategy to scale up its use of sustainable aviation fuel. By working with different suppliers and exploring diverse sourcing models and certification pathways, we gain crucial insights into the SAF landscape and we can better understand the pathways towards a more sustainable aviation ecosystem.

This will allow us to validate SAF demand, enhance our technical expertise in this area, and strengthen our ability to meet our medium-term commitment of 5% SAF use by 2030 and long-term goal net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

The Singapore Airlines Group has developed a comprehensive strategy to support its medium-term commitment of using 5% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030 and its long-term ambition of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It utilises a test-and-learn approach, as the Group partners with stakeholders throughout the value chain to learn about differences in various SAF procurement methods.

Key elements of the strategy include expanding SAF supply through partnerships, driving industry growth with targeted SAF purchases, and advocating for supportive policies. SIA is also focused on raising SAF awareness within the aviation and corporate sectors, while collaborating with industry partners to develop standardised SAF accounting and reporting principles like the Book & Claim system.

United Airlines has invested in hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) start-up Twelve as part of its $83m Series C funding round.
Made through its United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund, the total investment is expected to support Twelve’s plans to develop its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the United States.
The startup will be part of United Airlines’ broader strategy to achieve Net-Zero emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets.
“Because we can deliver our E-Jet sustainable aviation fuel at scale, Twelve is proudly creating a realistic pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational demands and climate goals,” the CEO added.","United Airlines invests in Twelve to develop hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel.

United Airlines has invested in hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) start-up Twelve as part of its $83m Series C funding round.

Made through its United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund, the total investment is expected to support Twelve’s plans to develop its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the United States.

Once operational, the Moses Lake plant is expected to produce up to 50,000 gallons of SAF per year. This will be achieved by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which will be refined into jet fuel.

Additionally, Twelve has also secured a 14-year agreement to supply 260 million gallons of SAF to the International Airlines Group (IAG), which includes airlines such as British Airways and Iberia.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” noted Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures.

The startup will be part of United Airlines’ broader strategy to achieve Net-Zero emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets.

Twelve CEO Nicholas Flanders stated that the company’s alternative SAF fuel will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Because we can deliver our E-Jet sustainable aviation fuel at scale, Twelve is proudly creating a realistic pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational demands and climate goals,” the CEO added.",,N,,2025-05-12 18:57:08.423765

The event, organised by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), under the Assistance, Capacity Building, and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) Africa–India Project.

The five-day hybrid workshop, themed “Access to Finance for SAF Production,” brought together participants from 14 African countries, international financial institutions and SAF project developers. The aim was to explore investment opportunities, address financial challenges and promote risk mitigation and project bankability for SAF development across the continent.

The Nigeria-specific segment took place during the final two days and focused on the country’s domestic roadmap for SAF production.

A major highlight of the workshop was the formal inauguration of six technical working groups (TWGs) by NCAA director-general, Capt. Chris Najomo. Represented by the Lagos regional manager, Bukola Teriba, Najomo emphasised Nigeria’s commitment to advancing sustainable aviation.

The newly inaugurated TWGs will focus on policy and regulation, feedstock and production, funding and investment, technology and innovation, environmental and social impact, as well as infrastructure and logistics.

These working groups are expected to provide strategic guidance on SAF development in Nigeria, laying the foundation for policy, innovation, sustainability and infrastructure growth.

The ACT-SAF workshop also tackled the realities faced by SAF developers and financiers and promoted discussions around de-risking strategies. It underscored the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to achieve viable SAF production across Africa.

Other key objectives included improving understanding of SAF supply chains and financial assessment tools, sharing best practices in financing, mapping key financial stakeholders and identifying available funding instruments to support SAF development.

In her remarks, Teriba reiterated the importance of access to finance in achieving SAF production goals. She noted that investing in SAF aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) long-term aspirational goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050.

Participants included representatives from ICAO, the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), EU delegations to Nigeria and WACAF, industry stakeholders and development partners. The NCAA’s directorate of air transport regulations coordinated the workshop.",https://sciencenigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SAF-Participants.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 16:56:32.108668

Tariffs between the U.S. and China to be dramatically reduced as negotiations continue

As trade tensions and uncertainty continue to drastically impact markets, officials from the United States and China met in Geneva this weekend to discuss tariffs. With current tariffs set at 145% for all Chinese imported goods in the U.S. and 125% tariffs for all exported U.S. goods to China, both economies have felt the effects of these immense import-export fees. Although the discussion is not over, both countries have agreed to reduce these tariffs for 90 days, reducing the 145% U.S. tariff to 30% and the 125% Chinese tariff to 10%. Negotiations will continue as both countries hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. In an increasingly uncertain world, ESG solutions are crucial for keeping your company on track.

EMSTEEL announces new Green Finance Framework taking steps toward decarbonization goals

EMSTEEL, one of the UAE’s largest steel manufacturers, launched its Green Finance Framework on Thursday. Partnering with ING and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), this Framework is a huge step in the company’s efforts to reduce emissions and create long-term sustainability. The projects expected to be financed through this framework include installing renewable energy systems, low-carbon production of cement and steel, and energy-efficient technologies that help drive decarbonization. EMSTEEL’s ESG strategy aims to reduce emissions from steel production by 40% and cement production by 30% in the next five years. Chief Financial Officer Mark Tonkens said, “The launch of our Green Finance Framework marks a pivotal step in reinforcing EMSTEEL’s commitment to sustainability. Aligning our financial strategy with global green finance standards enables us to secure funding for high-impact projects and positions us as a leader in the region’s transition to a low-carbon economy.”

Norwegian wealth fund divests from Israel’s Paz Oil Company as a result of war in Gaza

The world’s largest wealth fund in Norway sold all of its shares in the Israeli oil company, Paz. This is a direct result of the company’s activities of supplying fuel to Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Council on Ethics is enforcing higher standards on businesses, especially those operating in occupied Palestine. In its divestment recommendation, the Council stated, “By operating infrastructure for the supply of fuel to the Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Paz is contributing to their perpetuation.” This recommendation is the second of its kind, as the Council also recommended a divestment from Bezeq, an Israeli telecommunications company, in December.

United Airlines invests in sustainability startups as part of net-zero initiative

United Airlines is proving its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 through its recent investment in the startup Twelve. Twelve aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using carbon dioxide and water. They call the process “industrial photosynthesis,” using electrolyzers to create synthesis gas. The airline has also partnered with Heirloom, a startup focused on carbon capture directly from the air, and JetZero, a startup developing a blended wing body aircraft. With a $200 million Sustainable Flight Fund backed by Google, Boeing, and about 20 other companies and airlines, United is committed to a 2035 target of 50% fewer emissions. Companies trying to reach net-zero targets, like United, can find help through utilizing ESG tools.

Airlines are shifting their approach to a low-carbon future, seeking not only to offset the emissions they generate, but remove them altogether and then use the CO2 to make sustainable aviation fuel.

For United Airlines, this means teaming up with startups that are working to pull carbon dioxide out of the air, mimic photosynthesis to produce jet fuel and revolutionize aircraft design to slash emissions.

Earlier this year, the Chicago-based carrier joined forces with Heirloom, a company specializing in direct air capture of carbon dioxide, in a partnership that not only sees the companies sequester CO2 but also — potentially — use it to make sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. In another deal announced Tuesday, United said it was working with Twelve, a startup that uses industrial photosynthesis to produce SAF from CO2 and water.

Last month, United said it was investing in next-generation blended-wing startup JetZero in a deal that could see the airline buy up to 200 of the wide-bodied aircraft, which according to United, have the potential to reduce fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile compared with traditional planes.

Lauren Riley, the airline’s chief sustainability officer, sets the company’s decarbonization strategy. Her mandate includes reaching an interim sustainability target by 2035: a 50% reduction in carbon intensity compared with 2019, as verified by the Science Based Targets initiative.

At the center of the airline’s strategy is United Airlines Ventures’ Sustainable Flight Fund, a \$200 million investment vehicle backed by the carrier and 22 partners, including Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Boeing and Google.

Andrew Chang, head of corporate development at United, is the managing director of UAV and oversees its investments.

Carbon Removal Using Crushed Up Rocks

Startup Heirloom Carbon uses low-cost limestone to absorb carbon from the air.

Crushed up limestone is heated in a kiln.

That heat separates the limestone into carbon dioxide and calcium oxide powder. The carbon dioxide can then be stored permanently underground or in concrete.

The calcium oxide powder is mixed with water to form calcium hydroxide, which is spread out on large trays that are stacked vertically.

The calcium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. After about three days, it becomes limestone and the process is repeated.

Limestone naturally absorbs carbon. Heirloom accelerates the natural process so it takes days instead of years. To remove carbon from the air, the company warms up crushed limestone in a kiln heated to about 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit and powered by renewable electricity. That heat separates the carbon dioxide, which is stored underground or in concrete, and leaves a chemical powder called calcium oxide.

That powder is then combined with water to become calcium hydroxide and spread onto trays the size of picnic blankets. Outside, the calcium hydroxide puffs up like a cookie in the oven as it absorbs carbon dioxide over about three days. The resulting limestone can go back into the kiln to restart the cycle.

But what makes United’s deal with Heirloom unusual is its versatility: The captured CO2 can either be permanently sequestered—generating carbon-dioxide removal, or CDR, credits—or used in the production of power-to-liquid SAF.

United’s Sustainable Flight Fund has the option to buy 500,000 tons of CO2 from Heirloom. It said capturing that amount of CO2 from the air and sequestering it permanently underground is the equivalent to abating CO2 emissions from a 737 MAX flying about 33 million miles.

The airline acknowledged that SAF, like regular jet fuel, emits CO2 into the atmosphere when burned. But it pointed out the CO2 used to make SAF primarily comes from the atmosphere, whereas the CO2 used to make jet fuel comes from oil that was underground. The advantage of burning SAF is that it results in no net change to atmospheric CO2, the company says.

However, United added capturing and sequestering CO2 using Heirloom’s technology while continuing to use regular jet fuel is currently cheaper than using CO2 to make sustainable aviation fuel. That is because making SAF also requires making hydrogen and combining it with the captured CO2, which is expensive.

Riley said that the type of carbon removal Heirloom offers is preferable to traditional nature-based offsets, which she said lack permanence and are harder to measure.

Chang didn’t disclose exactly how much UAV invested in the three deals, saying only when it comes to investments, “our sweet spot is \$5 million to \$10 million, maybe sometimes up to \$15 million.”

How Twelve makes sustainable aviation fuel

In Twelve’s carbon dioxide electrolyzer, carbon dioxide flows in and comes into contact with a metal catalyst. One of the oxygen atoms in CO2 gets separated, leaving carbon monoxide (CO).

Water flows into a water electrolyzer and comes into contact with a metal catalyst, splitting into hydrogen and oxygen.

Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are combined to make synthesis gas, while oxygen is vented or captured and used in other industrial processes.

While the Heirloom deal is key to lowering emissions in the short term, United’s real decarbonization challenge lies in its long-term fuel strategy. In 2024, United sourced 14 million gallons of SAF—some 0.3% of its total fuel usage for the year. Yet, with SAF costing three to four times more than conventional jet fuel, increasing that share represents a challenge.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” said Chang.

United’s deal with Twelve goes some way to address that. It follows an \$83 million funding round secured by the startup for its first production facility in Moses Lake, Wash. The plant is expected to begin production this year and plans to produce 50,000 gallons of SAF annually, with the potential to reduce life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to United.

Riley and her team helped shape the SAF provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, including the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which provides a credit of 35 cents a gallon for sustainable aviation fuel. Today, following the election of President Trump, questions continue to hang over the future of the IRA, and the path ahead for the aviation industry appears turbulent.

Yet Riley remains bullish. She points to the SAF Coalition, a 60-member nonprofit advocacy group established last year including oil majors, startups, labor unions and agriculture stakeholders that she says are all pushing for the continuation of 45Z.

“What’s really interesting in the U.S. is that the states that are benefiting from new SAF production facilities coming online are largely in red states. It is largely in the geographies that you wouldn’t expect would be behind any kind of climate ambition. This is good for the economy. This is creating jobs in a transitioning industry,” she said.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-05-12 16:56:37.053325

With the Technical Working Groups in place, Nigeria is poised to take a leading role in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels in Africa.","Nigeria has taken a significant step towards developing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) by hosting a high-level regional workshop on Access to Finance for SAF Production in Lagos.

The workshop, organised by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), brought together stakeholders from 14 African countries, international financial institutions, and SAF project developers.

The workshop aimed to address investment challenges, risk mitigation, and project bankability for SAF and marked a major milestone in Nigeria’s transition towards Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

The Director General of NCAA, Capt. Chris Najomo, inaugurated six Technical Working Groups (TWGs) that will guide Nigeria’s SAF development across policy, feedstock, infrastructure, finance, sustainability, and technology.

The TWGs will play a crucial role in shaping Nigeria’s SAF roadmap, and the workshop provided a platform for stakeholders to discuss various de-risking strategies and the role of all actors in achieving viable SAF production in Africa.

Additionally, the workshop enhanced understanding of SAF Direct Supply Line and its financial assessment tools, shared best practices in financial strategies, and identified key stakeholders within the finance sector.

The event was attended by representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), EU delegations to Nigeria and WACAF, other international organisations, industry stakeholders, and partners.

The workshop was coordinated by the Directorate of Air Transport Regulations of the NCAA.

According to Capt. Chris Najomo, access to finance for SAF production projects is critical to reducing the environmental impact of aviation, aligning with ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Najomo stated that the workshop marked a significant step towards achieving this goal and that Nigeria’s commitment to developing SAF is expected to have a positive impact on the environment and the aviation industry.

The development of SAF is a crucial step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, and Nigeria’s efforts in this area are expected to contribute to the global goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

This move is part of United’s Sustainable Flight Fund, and it supports the airline’s goal of cutting aviation emissions by 90% by 2050. The fund is designed to back new ideas that can make air travel cleaner.

Turning CO2 into Jet Fuel: How Twelve’s Tech Works

Twelve has built a new way to make jet fuel that doesn’t rely on crops, waste oils, or fossil fuels. Their patented process takes carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the air or factories and mixes it with renewable electricity (like solar or wind power). The result is a liquid fuel that works like regular jet fuel but with much lower emissions.

This carbon transformation method creates a closed-loop carbon cycle. That means the CO2 used to make the fuel is the same CO2 released when planes burn it — no extra carbon is added to the atmosphere. By closing this loop, Twelve’s process helps slow climate change and reduces the need to pump new fossil fuels from the ground.

It also fixes another problem. Many traditional types of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use materials like used cooking oil, animal fats, or crops such as corn and sugarcane. These feedstocks are limited and can be hard to get in large amounts. They also raise ethical questions about using farmland for fuel instead of food.

Twelve’s technology skips these issues entirely, making it easier to grow the SAF supply in the long run.

United’s investment comes after Twelve raised $83 million in its recent Series C funding round. The company is also building its first commercial facility, called AirPlant™ One, in Moses Lake, Washington. The plant will start operating this year and will produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel each year.

Backing the Future: United’s Sustainable Flight Fund

United Airlines is serious about finding new ways to make flying greener. The airline launched the Sustainable Flight Fund in 2023, raising over $200 million so far. Partners in the fund include Air Canada, Boeing, JPMorgan Chase, and other major companies.

The goal of the fund is to help new SAF projects grow faster. By putting money into companies like Twelve, United hopes to build up the supply of cleaner fuels and cut emissions without relying heavily on buying carbon offsets.

United is also unique among U.S. airlines for its long-term SAF focus. The company has invested in over 5 different SAF developers, including Fulcrum BioEnergy and Cemvita Factory. With these moves, United aims to secure steady supplies of SAF for its future flights.

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, noted:

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels. Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured.”

Why SAF Is So Important (and Growing Fast)

The aviation industry is under pressure to cut emissions. Planes account for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions today, and demand for flights is still growing.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says airlines used only 300 million liters of SAF in 2022, but demand could grow to 7 billion liters by 2030.

That’s a huge jump, showing just how important SAF is becoming. Some key facts to know about this jet fuel:

Today, SAF makes up less than 1% of all jet fuel used globally.

Experts think the SAF market could be worth over $15 billion by 2030.

SAF can lower lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.

Annual SAF demand range over the main and accelerated cases compared with capacity potential, 2020-2026

Even though SAF is good for the planet, it still costs 3 to 5x more than regular jet fuel. That’s why government policies are helping. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers tax credits for low-carbon fuels, making SAF cheaper to buy. The European Union also passed rules requiring airlines to use increasing amounts of SAF starting in 2025.

Many believe that as technology improves and more SAF is made, costs will drop to match regular fuel prices by the early 2030s.

How Twelve Fits into the Bigger Picture

Twelve is one of the few companies working on Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF, which uses only CO2 and clean energy instead of crops or oils. This means their fuel can be scaled up faster without competing for food or farmland.

In 2023, Twelve opened its first demonstration plant in Moses Lake, Washington, to show that the technology works. Their long-term plan is to build bigger facilities that can produce millions of gallons of PtL SAF each year.

The U.S. Department of Energy has recognized PtL as a promising option for deep decarbonization. Studies show PtL fuels could cut aviation emissions by up to 90%, depending on how clean the electricity source is.

For United, working with Twelve is more than just cutting emissions — it’s about staying ahead of competitors. Many airlines still depend on buying carbon offsets to meet their climate goals. United wants to lead with direct emission cuts, which experts say is a stronger, more reliable strategy.

RELATED: Gevo Strikes Carbon Credit Agreement with Future Energy Global to Scale SAF Market

What Other Airlines Are Doing

United isn’t the only airline betting on SAF:

Delta Air Lines partnered with Gevo to buy 385 million gallons of SAF over seven years.

American Airlines signed a deal with Aemetis for 350 million gallons over 10 years.

Lufthansa, KLM, and British Airways are also working with SAF producers like Neste and Velocys.

However, most of these deals are focused on SAF made from used cooking oil, fats, and biomass — not PtL. United’s early and large investment in Power-to-Liquid SAF sets it apart from airlines still relying mostly on crop-based or waste oil SAF.

What’s Next? A Greener Future for Aviation

The future of flight is changing fast. Analysts predict that investments like United’s could speed up a major shift in aviation. As governments around the world set stricter rules on emissions and offer more support for low-carbon technologies, SAF use is expected to soar.

If SAF production grows as hoped, airlines could shrink their carbon footprints by 40% to 70% in the next 20 years.

United’s investment in Twelve and other clean fuel companies shows it’s not just following the trend — it’s trying to shape the future of sustainable travel. The airline’s plan is to use a mix of SAF sources, from waste oils to PtL fuels, to make sure it can meet rising demand.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2039047598.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 13:57:07.241045

Fortunately, there’s a major opportunity that could reverse these trends and bring in economic growth for rural Iowa: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
This is a largely untapped market where Iowa’s farmers should be leading.
Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers are ready to lead, but Washington’s overregulation is shutting them out of the SAF market.
That’s how Iowa farmers can fully benefit from their efficient practices—and how we can ensure America retains control of its energy future.","Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District is home to some of the most productive farmland in the country, and agriculture has long been the backbone of our state’s economy. But with shifting market demands, Iowa farmers are facing the real risk of declining farm income, shrinking cash receipts, and fewer opportunities to grow and compete.

Fortunately, there’s a major opportunity that could reverse these trends and bring in economic growth for rural Iowa: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAF is jet fuel made from biomass products like farm crops and agricultural waste—resources that are abundant in Iowa. SAF was developed to enhance and support fossil fuels in commercial aircraft that millions of consumers are flying in today.

Fuel consumption by commercial airlines has been rising steadily. In 2023 alone, the global aviation industry consumed 91 billion gallons of jet fuel. That figure jumped to 99 billion in 2024 and is expected to continue climbing. This is a largely untapped market where Iowa’s farmers should be leading.

With the right policies, SAF can open a new revenue stream for American farmers, create good-paying jobs in the biofuel sector, support rural economies, and bolster our national energy security by increasing our domestic fuel supply.

Although current federal policies have supported early growth of SAF, Congress must now work with President Trump to ensure that SAF is a pillar of his American energy dominance agenda. That starts with giving energy producers the long-term confidence they need—making it clear the federal government is committed to scaling U.S. domestic SAF production.

By stimulating private investment, we can enable the construction of new facilities and expanded operations to meet the aviation industry’s growing fuel demands. This growth would position Iowa as a leading SAF hub, supporting more than 22,000 permanent jobs and adding $2.7 billion to the state’s GDP by 2050, according to the agricultural economic research firm Decision Innovation Solutions.

I have long supported cutting onerous red tape that holds back American businesses and stifles innovation. Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers are ready to lead, but Washington’s overregulation is shutting them out of the SAF market.

Instead of stringent mandates, we need smart, forward-looking policies that give farmers and SAF producers the certainty they need to invest, expand, and innovate. That’s how Iowa farmers can fully benefit from their efficient practices—and how we can ensure America retains control of its energy future.

SAF is meant to work with our existing fossil fuel supply, not replace it. By expanding SAF production, we will help meet growing demand in the aviation sector while driving down fuel prices and improving market stability. More supply means more competition, and that’s good for both the aviation industry and American consumers.

Integrating SAF into our existing fuel mix can lower overall fuel costs while pursuing President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, making sure that the United States—not China—leads the future of aviation fuel.

I have always supported an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy, with biofuels front and center. Investing in domestically produced SAF will reduce our dependence on foreign fuel sources and support rural economies.

We have the technology, the crops, and the workforce to lead. We just need the policies to unlock these opportunities, realize SAF’s wide-ranging benefits, and ensure Iowa remains at the forefront of American energy leadership for decades to come.

“We are committed to continuing with the other technologies and services we are well known for, including our leading markets and optimisation activities.”

Statkraft’s CEO and president Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal added: “After reducing the ambition level on green hydrogen development last year, we are experiencing even more uncertainty in the market.”

Policy support

Last month, 27 hydrogen projects were shortlisted for the next stage of the UK Government’s Second Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2) support scheme.

The shortlist includes projects across England, Scotland, and Wales that could use hydrogen to decarbonise their manufacturing and industrial practices to tackle the climate crisis.

Some of the lead developers for the projects include Scottish Power, Uniper Hydrogen UK, Centrica Energy Storage, and EDF Renewables Hydrogen.

The HAR2 government support allows projects to apply for funding for capital expenditure through the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund and then ongoing revenue support through the hydrogen business production until its hydrogen levy on energy bills comes into effect in 2025.

The 27 shortlisted projects are all green hydrogen projects, whereby hydrogen is produced via electrolysis processes with water that are powered by renewable electricity. Hydrogen produced from the shortlisted projects would serve a range of industries including glass manufacturing, brick making, ammonia production and the production of alternative aviation fuels.

Energy minister Sarah Jones said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy generation, hydrogen can power our everyday lives and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

Participants included representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), EU delegations to Nigeria and Western and Central African (WACAF), and other global aviation and climate stakeholders.","The Federal Government has shown commitment towards advancing green aviation across Africa and hosted a high-level regional workshop on financing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

The five-day event, held from May 5 to 9, 2025, in Lagos, brought together stakeholders from 14 African countries, international organisations and SAF project developers to address access to finance, investment risks, and project bankability.

According to a statement signed by Michael Achimugu, Director of Public Affairs and Consumer Protection, the event underscored Nigeria’s commitment to climate action and sustainable aviation, while fostering regional cooperation.

Organized by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the workshop formed part of the Assistance, Capacity Building, and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) Africa–India Project.

A highlight of the workshop, as contained in the statement was the formal inauguration of six Technical Working Groups (TWGs) by Chris Najomo, NCAA Director General. These TWGs which includes ; Policy and Regulation; Feedstock and Production; Funding and Investment; Technology and Innovation; Environmental and Social Impact; and Infrastructure and Logistics, will guide Nigeria’s SAF development across key thematic areas.

The final two days of the workshop were dedicated to the Nigeria Engagement on SAF, which focused on developing a domestic roadmap for SAF production and deployment.

The hybrid workshop, themed “Access to Finance for SAF Production,” aimed to confront real-world challenges faced by SAF developers and financiers. It explored de-risking strategies, financial instruments, and the roles of various actors in creating a viable SAF ecosystem in Africa.

Participants included representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), EU delegations to Nigeria and Western and Central African (WACAF), and other global aviation and climate stakeholders.

Speaking at the opening session, Chris Najomo, represented by Bukola Teriba, NCAA’s Regional Manager for Lagos, emphasised the importance of securing financing for SAF projects to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint and achieve ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sustainable-aviation-fuel-financing.png,N,,2025-05-12 12:56:24.443369

Brazil and China are boosting their economic alliance, with Brazil sealing a $1 billion deal with Envision Energy for sustainable aviation fuel and courting other Chinese giants for tech and defense projects.

What does this mean?

In a strategic move during President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's visit to China, Brazil secured a significant $1 billion investment from Envision Energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel using sugarcane. This partnership is part of a broader economic collaboration, as Lula da Silva met with key Chinese firms like automaker GAC and defense company Norinco. These interactions signal Brazil's intent to weave tighter economic ties with China. Additionally, Brazil seeks to amp up its digital infrastructure, with efforts to attract investment in data centers. Beijing-based ByteDance, famed for TikTok, is contemplating data center deployment at Pecem port, bolstered by a staggering planned investment of 50 billion reais ($8.82 billion). Moreover, Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy is set to work with China's Windey Energy Technology and Senai Cimatec on renewable energy projects, marking another segment of this comprehensive cooperation.

The firm said that the fund exceeded its fundraising target, and was oversubscribed at more than $240 million.

ASP6 is Aligned Climate Capital’s largest infrastructure fund to date. The fund acquires construction-ready distributed solar projects from development partners across the U.S., finances their build-out, and delivers returns through tax credit monetization, operating income distributions, and portfolio sales to institutional infrastructure investors.

The firm’s investment strategy focuses on the “middle market” of solar, and typically targets underserved and rural markets. Aligned Climate finances construction with a combination of equity and construction debt, then monetizes the tax credits and secures long-term, low-cost permanent debt.

To date, ASP6 has placed more than 25MW of distributed solar projects in service in Maine and Washington, D.C., and has acquired additional solar projects in other states, which are under construction or scheduled to begin over the next two years. The firm said that ASP6 is scheduled to make its initial cash distribution to investors in 2025 and plans to make annual cash distributions going forward, and then ultimately selling the operating portfolio to institutional investors following the tax recapture period.

Peter W. Davidson, CEO of Aligned Climate Capital, said:

Mega-cap tech companies are expected to report mixed results related to their core businesses and provide varied guidance this earnings season. Management commentary on outlooks will be key, particularly in light of the effect that tariffs may have on tech companies’ operations. A significant concern is whether cloud service providers will maintain their substantial capital expenditure growth in fiscal 2025, as this will influence their ability to scale and innovate.

There has also been a surge in investment in technology infrastructure to support generative AI. This trend, which gained traction over the past year, is anticipated to continue. However, while operating expense growth projections have diminished, the accelerated pace of AI-related capex has raised alarms.

Global solar additions to stall in 2026 on policy, market uncertainty: SolarPower Europe

SolarPower Europe expects global solar photovoltaic installations to slow in 2025 and stagnate in 2026 due to mixed policy signals and geopolitical instability. In 2025, global solar PV additions are projected to grow 10% year over year to 655 GW, down from 33% year-over-year growth in 2024. Stagnation is expected in 2026, with additions reaching only 665 GW.

Growth is then anticipated to resume to 2029, with annual increases of 10% to 14%. However, the forecast for installations during 2026–2028 was revised down to 2.27 TW from 2.34 TW. The slowdown in 2026 is attributed to a new renewable power pricing mechanism in China that may delay investment decisions, potential impacts from rising import tariffs and international trade tensions.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/4-gettyimages-909084582-1360x320?$responsive$,N,,2025-05-12 12:56:27.841929

“I am probably spending about 30-40% of my time just ensuring the fleet works and getting aircraft through the door and so forth.
“Anyone who says it will go away by the end of the year doesn’t know what they are talking about,” he says.
Oman, like Saudia Arabia, has a transformation and economic diversification strategy, Vision 2040, of which tourism is a key pillar.
“How do you deliver Oman’s requirements for its aviation sector, if the OEMs aren’t enabling that?” asks Hamilton-Manns.","During a wide-ranging panel session at IATA’s Aviation Day Middle East North Africa in Jeddah on 7 May, the chief executives of carriers in the region laid bare the extent to which the supply chain challenges, which have plagued the industry since the pandemic, are impacting their day-to-day business.

“It is a real issue,” said Stephen Greenway, chief executive of Saudi Arabian low-cost carrier Flyadeal. “I am probably spending about 30-40% of my time just ensuring the fleet works and getting aircraft through the door and so forth. For a CEO, that is an inordinate amount of time.”

He notes that while the delays in aircraft deliveries are the most visible impact, the issues cascade well beyond that.

“I have two aircraft in Toulouse without engines and I don’t know when I’m going to get them; spare parts are hard to come by; even getting one of our aircraft certified for ETOPS by the end of the year, I can’t get the oxygen tanks for the aircraft, line-fit or retroft.”

He adds: “It's May and I don’t know what my fleet is going to be for the summer peak at this moment in time. We hope to work that out in the next couple of weeks. We were meant to be getting two aircraft prior to the summer that would complete a full aircraft fleet to go into the summer, that’s just not happening.”

Neither does Greenway hold out hopes for a quick resolution to supply chain issues.

“Anyone who says it will go away by the end of the year doesn’t know what they are talking about,” he says. “This is with us for the next three-to-five years, minimum.”

Chief executive of Omani low-cost carrier SalamAir, Adrian Hamilton-Manns concurs and points to the challenge it creates, particularly for carriers that are looking to grow. SalamAir is looking to add 10 more Airbus A320s as it continues on a revamp which has seen it focus back on its core low-cost narrowbody operations.

“We need to get bigger quicker. But we are not going to be able to do that for three or four years. If we were a widebody operator, which we are not, we would not be able to get widebodies until about 2032, 2023. A waiting time of six years to fulfil a business plan you are looking at today is just impossible,” he said

This inability to ramp up creates issues in meeting the wider strategic goals of states in the region. Oman, like Saudia Arabia, has a transformation and economic diversification strategy, Vision 2040, of which tourism is a key pillar.

“How do you deliver Oman’s requirements for its aviation sector, if the OEMs aren’t enabling that?” asks Hamilton-Manns. “We’ve had a very visible issue with that this year in our civil aviation authority believing both ourselves and Oman Air are not going to have aircraft available to meet the demands of travel in the summer.”

This has prompted Oman’s aviation regulator to temporarily open up the market to foreign operators to fly domestic services during the summer peak. “That’s not a reflection of SalamAir’s abilities to carry passengers, or Oman Air’s,” he adds saying It’s a reflection of manufacturing not giving airlines what they need.

Leaders also flagged the fragmented regulatory environment, particularly around sustainability.

Gulf Air chief executive Jeffery Goh, for example, says that individual regulatory bodies need to recognise the industry is international.“For instance, I look at the regulations across the world on sustainability, reductions in greenhouse emissions, requirements for sustainable aviation fuel. It’s almost a repeat of what played out in Covid 19. Every country reacted it in its own way,” he said.",https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/ta-favico.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 10:56:29.391212

Modernised trade The UK-India FTA offers more than just tariff relief; it presents a structural inflection point for cross-border air cargo.
If implemented effectively, the deal could position the UK-India corridor as one of the most dynamic east-west air cargo routes by the end of the decade.","The finalisation of the UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on 7 May 2025 is being hailed as a landmark achievement in bilateral economic diplomacy, with strategic implications for air cargo connectivity and policy frameworks between the two nations. As India emerges as a pivotal export manufacturing base and the UK seeks to diversify post-Brexit trade lanes, the FTA is expected to catalyse both directional cargo flows and systemic adjustments in cross-border logistics.

According to estimates released by the UK government, the agreement is expected to increase annual bilateral trade by £25.5 billion over the long term and contribute £4.8 billion annually to UK GDP. These projections, while headline-grabbing, also underscore a more complex operational reality for air cargo professionals: rising volumes, tighter lead times, and the need for synchronised policy reforms to support trade facilitation and infrastructure.

Tariff reductions

The agreement eliminates tariffs on over 90% of UK exports to India by value, directly impacting sectors with high air freight affinity such as automotive components, medical devices, and premium consumer goods. Notably, the phased reduction of tariffs on British whisky—from 150% to 40% over 10 years—and on luxury vehicles—down from over 100% to 10%—is likely to drive greater utilisation of bellyhold capacity, especially for high-value time-definite shipments.

Conversely, the UK will grant duty-free access to 99% of Indian exports by volume, with textiles, leather goods, and jewellery expected to benefit disproportionately. India’s apparel sector alone exported nearly $5 billion to the UK in FY 2023–24, and analysts expect this figure to rise by 15–20% annually under the new regime. Given the just-in-time nature of global fashion and e-commerce logistics, much of this incremental demand is likely to flow through air cargo channels.

Implications for networks and infrastructure

To accommodate this anticipated surge, both nations will need to reassess and expand current air cargo capacities. While major gateways—such as Delhi, Mumbai, Heathrow, and East Midlands—are expected to absorb a large share of the volume, second-tier airports with airside cargo handling potential could be leveraged to decongest primary hubs.

Revisiting the UK-India bilateral air service agreement (ASA) may be essential to enable higher flight frequencies, open skies arrangements for freighters, and fifth-freedom rights for intermediate stops. These policy adjustments could allow integrators and combination carriers to optimise their networks for rising volumes on the UK-India corridor.

Further, there is a growing need to invest in cold chain infrastructure, bonded warehouse integration, and real-time cargo visibility tools—particularly at Indian airports, where legacy handling infrastructure continues to constrain turnaround times. Trade facilitation improvements such as advance customs data integration, single-window clearances, and adoption of WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) standards will be critical

Sustainability and regulatory considerations

With the anticipated increase in cargo traffic, sustainability challenges come into sharper focus. Aviation accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, and growing air freight movements risk intensifying that share unless mitigated by proactive policy.

Air cargo operators and shippers will be under pressure to invest in lower-emission aircraft, optimise load factors, and adopt Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) solutions—despite current cost premiums that exceed three times the price of conventional jet fuel. From a regulatory standpoint, convergence between EU and UK carbon market mechanisms and India’s emerging SAF policy framework could help harmonise compliance pathways.

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM) and enhanced ESG disclosures are also likely to influence routing and carrier selection, adding another dimension to air cargo planning.

Broader policy synergies

The FTA’s rollout coincides with India’s National Logistics Policy (NLP) and Gati Shakti infrastructure push, which aim to reduce logistics costs from 13–14% of GDP to below 8% by 2030. From the UK side, the Department for Business and Trade’s push to establish the UK as a hub for digital and green trade aligns with the expected use of digitised shipping documentation, AI-driven customs screening, and standardised eAWBs for UK-India cargo.

Additionally, the agreement includes provisions on services, intellectual property, and labour standards, which could indirectly support the development of specialised air cargo services, such as life sciences logistics and cross-border e-commerce.

Modernised trade

The UK-India FTA offers more than just tariff relief; it presents a structural inflection point for cross-border air cargo. For stakeholders across airports, carriers, freight forwarders, and regulatory agencies, the agreement demands a proactive re-evaluation of capacity planning, digital integration, policy coordination, and environmental compliance.

If implemented effectively, the deal could position the UK-India corridor as one of the most dynamic east-west air cargo routes by the end of the decade. But realising that vision will depend not only on trade terms but also on strategic investment, multilateral cooperation, and adaptive policy execution across both jurisdictions.

As global supply chains recalibrate post-pandemic and amid geopolitical realignments, the UK-India FTA stands as a case study in how trade liberalisation and air logistics can be mutually reinforcing pillars of sustainable economic growth.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Page-26-stock-1080x721.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 10:56:36.123160

Eneos may also tap up to 1 trillion yen in management reserves for strategic investments, including in LNG, Miyata added.

Like its global peers, Eneos is shifting its business portfolio to align with the energy transition.

""But the trend toward a carbon-neutral society is slowing, and the full-scale bifurcation of the energy transition, previously expected around 2030, may be delayed,"" Miyata said, adding the company is in no rush to supply hydrogen and ammonia.

In the new plan, Eneos has removed its previous target of supplying up to 4 million metric tons of hydrogen by the fiscal 2040 year.

Instead, stable and affordable energy, including oil, has become more important amid rising energy security concerns, U.S. policy risks, and the growing cost of decarbonisation technologies, Miyata said.

Eneos already holds stake in LNG projects in Asia, but Miyata said U.S. projects, including Alaska LNG, could be considered if economically viable.

The refiner reported a 22 per cent decline in net profit for the year ended March 31 and forecast a 18 per cent drop for the current year.

It aims to raise its refinery run rate, excluding scheduled maintenance, to 90 per cent by fiscal 2027, up from 78 per cent in 2024.

,,2025-05-12 12:21:43+00:00,The Conversation,Governments shouldn't chase growth at all costs. The harms of over tourism show why,"Ilaria Pappalepore, Ko Koens, Shirley Nieuwland",,,,,https://theconversation.com/governments-shouldnt-chase-growth-at-all-costs-the-harms-of-over-tourism-show-why-255038,"In the controversial case of expansion at Heathrow airport, the UK government insists that the benefits of economic growth outweigh the environmental and wellbeing costs.
This provides options to rethink what tourism could look like when the focus is not just economic growth.
Falling under the umbrella term of “post-growth”, there are various approaches that all rethink the role of economic growth.
On the other hand, “doughnut economics” and regenerative approaches are more agnostic about economic growth.
But they cannot do much as long as economic growth is the focus of the Dutch government’s plans.","In the controversial case of expansion at Heathrow airport, the UK government insists that the benefits of economic growth outweigh the environmental and wellbeing costs. But what if focusing on prosperity is a shortsighted approach? The debate about a third runway, placed in the context of exponential growth in travel and tourism, makes the impact on people and the environment clear to see.

Tourism accounts for an estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions, and emissions related to tourism will continue to grow despite technological advances. The Heathrow expansion, for example, has been shown to be incompatible with net-zero requirements.

Meanwhile, many tourism destinations are struggling to cope with growing numbers of visitors. Residents have protested at the impact of overtourism on their quality of life, with harms including overcrowding, loss of amenities for residents and a skewed property market.

London’s airport development plans (expansion is also mooted at Gatwick and Luton) aim to inject investment into a range of sectors beyond tourism. However, our research suggests that aligning tourism with other sectors and better cooperation of decision-making at different levels of government could lead to increased wellbeing, a healthier environment and greater benefits to the local economy.

This provides options to rethink what tourism could look like when the focus is not just economic growth.

It should be possible to look at new models that take a holistic approach to tourism development. This means putting the wellbeing of the community and the environment first. Falling under the umbrella term of “post-growth”, there are various approaches that all rethink the role of economic growth. They advocate prioritising human wellbeing within planetary boundaries.

“Degrowth” argues that limiting growth is essential for a sustainable future. On the other hand, “doughnut economics” and regenerative approaches are more agnostic about economic growth. They argue that human prosperity and wellbeing should be prioritised regardless of whether GDP is going up or down.

In the context of tourism and travel, these approaches provide a different perspective on the role of the sector and what it can bring to a place, beyond economic growth.

They also go further than most strategies being implemented in popular tourist cities to prioritise residents’ wellbeing, quality of life, and lower-carbon travel.

Taking the heat off tourist hotspots

As part of a net-zero emission pledge, and in an attempt to curb overtourism and the frustration of locals, some cities across Europe are enforcing restrictions on cruise ships. And Greece is applying a climate resilience tax on top of the tourism tax on all overnight stays.

One of the cities that has done the most to curb tourism is Amsterdam. After the start of the COVID pandemic, it adopted a citizen initiative to cap tourism at 20 million overnight stays per year.

This number was reached in 2023, and the city has put forward a wide range of measures since then. These include a tourist tax rate of 12.5%, strict rules on short-term rentals, limits on visitor numbers at large attractions and reducing the number of cruises. The city has also strengthened its environmental regulations.

Copenhagen, on the other hand, chooses not to restrict tourism. Rather, it now rewards visitors who engage in climate-friendly actions, with the “CopenPay” pilot project. Visitors who choose to cycle, use public transport or participate in volunteering are eligible for discounts or free access to 24 attractions.

While these initiatives are laudable, there are two reasons why they don’t go far enough.

The first is that the majority of the measures are based on financial disincentives, such as charging entrance fees to destinations and taxing the most polluting transport. They rest on the assumption that we do not need to address the underlying pursuit of growth that led to this unsustainability.

Likewise, arguments in favour of green growth are based on technological advances, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This underpins claims that air travel can continue to grow. However, both within and beyond the travel sector, it has been argued that green growth is a myth.

Read more: There isn't enough 'sustainable' aviation fuel to make a dent in our emissions – and there won't be for years

In the long run, these measures do not cut the ever-growing number of travellers. Nor do they effectively address climate issues.

Second, cities need support from higher levels of government if they want to encourage travel that is more environmentally friendly and contributes to the wellbeing of residents. In the case of Amsterdam, the ongoing expansion of Schiphol airport can be linked to overtourism, as well as noise and air pollution.

City leaders want to cut the maximum number of flights. But they cannot do much as long as economic growth is the focus of the Dutch government’s plans.

This highlights the deep complexities of controlling visitor numbers. And it also suggests that the economic benefits that come with the growth of London’s airports may come with societal and environmental costs. These will be felt by London and its residents, and cannot be solved with local policies.

Rather than going further and faster with growth, when it comes to travel and tourism we may need to go “closer by and slower”.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/666532/original/file-20250507-62-dmn4zm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C275%2C5176%2C2588&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-05-12 08:56:12.559656

Thursday's agreement will see Britain's 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol fall to zero through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota - a figure equating to the size of the UK's entire ethanol market today.

Producers Associated British Foods and Ensus, which operate bioethanol facilities at Teesside and Hull in northern England, together account for nearly all of the UK's bioethanol production capacity.

Along with supply chain partners, they support thousands of jobs. Both said the operating environment ""is now impossible"".

""This (tariff) change comes on top of regulations that give overseas producers an unfair advantage in the British market,"" Paul Kenward, CEO of ABF Sugar, and Grant Pearson, chairman of Ensus, said in a joint statement.

""This vital sector is now facing imminent collapse because of the trade deal. In our current situation, we will have to close these plants,"" they said, going further than a statement AB Foods made on Friday.

Bioethanol is produced from crops like wheat and sugar cane and is used to make petrol. Byproducts of its production include animal feed and carbon dioxide, the latter facing severe shortages in 2022.

Britain's National Farmers' Union has warned the ethanol measure could mean the loss of a profitable outlet for arable growers which supply the industry.

ABF Sugar and Ensus jointly purchase more than two million tonnes of wheat annually.

""We are fast approaching the point where we need to decide whether to sign new contracts. In the current conditions, that would be irresponsible,"" they said, calling for ""urgent government action"".

Britain's concession on ethanol and beef was made in return for the removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said officials from the Department for Business and Trade had met the affected companies, and that ""close engagement will continue in the coming weeks and months"".

The company’s Net ZERO Reverse programme aims to reduce the carbon footprint and financial costs of air freight by exclusively utilising ocean freight to return containers.
Second, we needed to address the significant problem of reverse logistics, which is where our Net ZERO Reverse program comes into play.
“Switching to ocean freight reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99 percent compared to airfreight,” Samsonowicz stated.
Our hardware and software solutions help eliminate these issues, leading to significant CO2 reductions and cost savings today.","The cold chain has seen significant expansion in recent years. With the industry’s growth, ensuring sustainability has become increasingly crucial, not just as an add-on but as a key point of the sector’s DNA.

“We don’t view sustainability as a change; it’s a testament to who we are as a company,” Radek Samsonowicz, Vice President of Sales for Containers at SkyCell, said. “If sustainability isn’t deeply embedded in your company’s DNA, you’re essentially playing catch-up.

“From the design of our products to our processes and the way we treat our solutions—whether hardware or software—sustainability is at the core of it all.”

This becomes particularly clear in one of the key challenges in the sector – the global trade imbalance in pharmaceuticals, particularly the enormous disparity between exports and imports between Western markets and Asia.

“The European Union and the United States export ten times more life-saving products to Asia than they import from there,” Samsonowicz explained. “ This situation has resulted in a huge number of containers and reusable packaging that need to be returned by air. This model creates enormous costs—hundreds of millions of dollars every year for pharma clients—and contributes to a massive CO2 footprint.

Applicable solution

SkyCell has taken steps to tackle this issue by focusing on reverse logistics. The company’s Net ZERO Reverse programme aims to reduce the carbon footprint and financial costs of air freight by exclusively utilising ocean freight to return containers.

“First, we looked at product design: Can we make the containers lighter? Can we optimise the use of space to reduce the number of containers needed? Second, we needed to address the significant problem of reverse logistics, which is where our Net ZERO Reverse program comes into play. This programme is designed to tackle this issue head-on, reducing both costs and emissions associated with airfreight.

“Switching to ocean freight reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99 percent compared to airfreight,” Samsonowicz stated. “Additionally, this solution eliminates the problem of extended lease days, cutting costs and improving efficiency.”

Partnering up for progress

The shift to ocean freight reflects a larger trend in the cold chain: moving away from siloed, individualistic approaches to more collaborative partnerships. SkyCell’s partnerships with airlines like Emirates and United have paved the way for this transformation. “By removing reverse logistics via air, airlines can open up new revenue streams,” he noted. “They recognise the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions and are keen to be part of this change. It’s a win-win for everyone involved.”

The industry has long awaited solutions like SkyCell’s, which offer immediate, actionable steps to reduce emissions today rather than waiting for future technologies like hydrogen or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to become widespread.

“We can’t afford to wait 10 or 20 years,” said Samsonowicz. “The biggest levers right in front of us are cost savings and reducing product loss. Our hardware and software solutions help eliminate these issues, leading to significant CO2 reductions and cost savings today.

“Since launching this programme in the US two weeks ago, the conversations we’ve had with pharma shippers, forwarders, and airlines have been amazing.

“It’s clear that the industry has been waiting for this kind of solution. We’re proud that SkyCell is leading the way, pushing innovation, and taking a brave, ambitious approach to change the market. It’s an exciting time, and we’re thrilled about what comes next.”

Scalable solution

With a successful launch in the US, Samsonowicz is optimistic about the global scalability of the solution. “Our Net ZERO Reverse program is ready to be implemented immediately in markets. We don’t have to wait; the solution is available now,” he explained.

“From today, we can tackle trade imbalances in regions like Europe and the US to China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East—markets that consume a significant amount of life-saving medicines but don’t export much in return.

“We’ve made the leap and invested heavily in the fleet required to manage this activity, particularly in terms of handling reverse logistics by ocean freight. This is a significant step forward, and we’re proud to be leading the way in this area.”

Freight forwarders are seeing the value of this solution. By streamlining operations and improving communication, they are able to offer cleaner, more efficient services to their pharmaceutical clients, resulting in a more effective and sustainable supply chain overall.

“SkyCell’s initiative represents a win-win-win scenario for airlines, pharma clients, and freight forwarders alike,” Samsonowicz declared. “As for competitors, the response is still uncertain. This is a relatively new concept, and while others may follow suit, the significant capital investment required to implement such a solution presents a barrier. Not all companies will have the resources to take on this challenge, making SkyCell’s early investment a bold and forward-thinking move.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cropped-Favicon_ACW-265x265.png,N,,2025-05-12 07:56:07.786298

The comments came during an online press conference as the organization released data showing India would be a valuable market for the nation’s corn growers and benefit rural America should the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to open the market to American goods prove effective.

“We applaud the Trump administration for the trade outreach it is conducting with India, and we will advocate over the next few months to encourage the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to include American corn exports in any new trade agreement it makes with the country,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Building a more level playing field for all American products to access global markets is exactly what corn growers need, especially as we face a projected third consecutive year of negative returns.”

Hartman added that the organization will continue working directly with the Trump administration and the media to highlight how beneficial an agreement with India would be for the nation’s corn growers.

India’s restrictions on genetically modified corn have blocked access for American corn imports, since 94% of American corn is genetically modified. India also imposes technical restrictions that prevent access for distiller dried grains with solubles, a byproduct from ethanol production used in animal feed and limits U.S. ethanol imports. India’s stance puts U.S farmers at a distinct disadvantage and addressing these barriers would benefit American farmers.

If the Indian government were to drop its restrictions on genetically modified corn, it could open the door to $235 million worth of U.S. exports each year, according to data released by NCGA.

Holland Hydrogen 1

Holland Hydrogen 1 is taking concrete form. Shell is constructing Europe’s first major renewable hydrogen plant, with a capacity of 200 MW. Last year, Shell and TenneT signed a connection and transport agreement for the high-voltage grid, and the plant is now linked to it. A hydrogen pipeline, which will also be part of the national hydrogen network, connects the hydrogen plant to the port of Rotterdam.

ELYgator

Earlier this year, the French company Air Liquide announced its plans to develop, construct and operate a 200 MW electrolyser at the first conversion park on the Maasvlakte. This hydrogen plant, named ‘ELYgator’, produces low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy and is expected to be operational by the end of 2027. Air Liquide will harness power from the OranjeWind and Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) wind farms off the Dutch coast to produce hydrogen for the TotalEnergies refinery, among others.

Production and storage of sustainable aviation fuel

At the end of 2024, Power2X and Advario announced the joint development of a large-scale production and storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) with a capacity exceeding 250,000 tonnes of e-SAF per year. This facility will produce enough environmentally friendly fuel for approximately 7,000 flights between Amsterdam and New York each year, while the demand for hydrogen continues to rise.

Succesful ammonia bunkering

In April 2025, Trammo, OCI, and James Fisher Fendercare successfully conducted an ammonia bunkering pilot between two vessels in the port of Rotterdam. This represents an important step in preparing the port for the bunkering of green ammonia. During the pilot, 800 cubic metres of liquid ammonia at -33°C were transferred, validating the port’s safety framework. The first vessels capable of using ammonia as bunker fuel are expected in 2026 or 2027.

Porthos

Porthos is the first large-scale CO2 transport and storage project in the EU, comprising a 30 km land pipeline, a compressor station on the Maasvlakte, and an injection platform located 20 km offshore in the North Sea. Meanwhile, 80% of the land pipeline has been completed. With the arrival of the Valaris drilling platform, offshore work for the construction of the Porthos infrastructure has clearly begun. From here, CO2 is pumped to a depleted gas field, a sealed space of porous sandstone at a depth of over 3 km beneath the North Sea bed. An important step in the development of low-carbon hydrogen production in Rotterdam.

Offshore wind park Zeevonk II

The Zeevonk II project involves the development of a 2 GW offshore wind farm, a 50 MWp floating offshore solar farm, and an electrolyser with a capacity of up to 1 GW at the second conversion park on the Maasvlakte. It will make it possible to convert wind farm energy into green hydrogen. Zeevonk II is a joint venture of Vattenfall and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), which won the government tender for an offshore wind farm with integration systems. The wind farm is expected to be commissioned in 2029.

Green hydrogen from Brazil to Germany via Rotterdam

The ports of Pecém (in Ceará, Brazil), Rotterdam, and duisport (Germany) are collaborating to facilitate the transport of alternative fuels. CEO Port of Rotterdam Authority, Boudewijn Siemons: ‘We recognise Brazil’s potential as a supplier of green hydrogen. We are pleased to welcome duisport to this collaboration aimed at establishing an end-to-end supply chain for green hydrogen.’ In the short term, transport from Rotterdam is possible via inland shipping and will be facilitated by pipelines from 2032.

Fertiglobe

Fertiglobe has been awarded the tender for the first H2Global pilot auction for green ammonia. The product will be imported via the port of Rotterdam and sold by Hintco in standardised volumes through annual auctions. In this capacity, Hintco acts as a ‘market maker’, stimulating new markets for green hydrogen and low-emission fuels.

CO2next

The CO2next project for the temporary storage and handling of liquid CO2 at the Maasvlakte in Rotterdam is entering the FEED phase. Shell and TotalEnergies have partnered with Gasunie and Vopak in this collaboration. The terminal will be supplied with liquid CO2 by vessels and will be connected to empty North Sea gas fields via the Aramis pipeline. With an initial annual capacity of 5.4 million, it has the potential to grow to 15 million tonnes per year. The investment decision is scheduled for 2025. Commercial activities are anticipated to begin in 2028.

Ammonia terminal and cracker VTTI

VTTI aims to develop an ammonia terminal and cracker in both Rotterdam and Antwerp. The European Commission has designated the project as a Project of Common Interest and is providing an €11.6 million EU contribution for Rotterdam. Given the significant market interest in the open season, VTTI is now starting the Heads of Agreement Phase with interested parties to further advance the project.

Construction hydrogen network

The construction of the national hydrogen network commenced in 2023 in the port of Rotterdam. Hynetwork is rolling out the network in phases, with the first section in Rotterdam expected to become operational in 2026. By 2030, the infrastructure will be available in industrial clusters along the Dutch coast. Simultaneously, connections to Germany and Belgium will be established. Between 2031 and 2033, all industrial clusters will be fully interconnected. The west-east connection of the national hydrogen network (the hydrogen pipeline from the Delta Rhine Corridor) will also be completed by that time.",,N,,2025-05-12 07:56:18.365437

The move marks a significant rise from the previous limit of 5% and is now approved globally for the production of Jet A1 fuel.

Def Stan 91-091 is the UK Ministry of Defence’s technical standard for aviation turbine fuel (Jet A-1), specifying requirements for performance, safety, and composition. It ensures fuel compatibility with military and civil aircraft operated by the UK government and aligns with NATO code F-35 standards. The standard is managed by the MOD’s Operational Energy Authority and includes rigorous testing protocols for hydrocarbon composition, additives, and contaminants.

The most recent revision to Def Stan 91-091, published in May 2025, permits co-processing SAF with up to 30% renewable hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) feedstock. The updated Defence Standard, achieved through collaboration with stakeholders such as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), fuel producers and airlines, allows vegetable oils, waste oils and other sustainable feedstocks to be co-processed alongside conventional feedstocks in refinery units. This method enables the rapid scaling of SAF production using existing refinery and fuel distribution infrastructure.

BP noted that this development will help reduce lifecycle carbon emissions from aviation while meeting stringent fuel quality standards. The company already produces SAF via co-processing and plans to increase renewable feedstock content at its refineries from 2025 onwards.

Frederica Berra, senior vice president of Air BP, said the approval is a major milestone that enables high-quality fuel production at scale. Colonel Pete Skinsley of the UK’s MOD Operational Energy Authority added that it demonstrates continued commitment to decarbonising aviation while maintaining performance.

Marie Owens Thomsen, senior vice president at IATA, emphasised the importance of this breakthrough, saying it brings immediate results with minimal capital investment and should serve as a model for broader SAF adoption.

The updated Def Stan 91-091 has already been used for SAF operations by the Royal Air Force and builds on BP’s three-year R&D programme.

What is SAF and Why It Matters Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable and environmentally responsible alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.","Singapore Airlines Group Expands Sustainability Leadership with Major Sustainable Aviation Fuel Agreements

The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group has taken a major step forward in its decarbonisation journey by entering into strategic agreements with global sustainable fuel producers Neste and World Energy. These newly signed agreements aim to procure Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and associated SAF certificates (SAFc), significantly strengthening the Group’s environmental credentials while deepening engagement with key stakeholders in the green aviation fuel ecosystem.

Through this dual partnership, the SIA Group seeks not only to reduce its carbon footprint but also to expand its role in shaping the future of aviation sustainability. The move also supports the global aviation sector’s shift towards greener energy alternatives in alignment with international climate commitments and regulatory frameworks.

Singapore-Based SAF Supply Strengthened

Under the agreement with renewable fuel producer Neste, SIA secured the supply of one thousand tonnes of neat SAF. This fuel, which fully complies with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), was refined at Neste’s advanced facility in Singapore. Following on-site blending, the SAF was delivered directly to Singapore Changi Airport. This marks SIA’s second successful procurement of neat SAF from Neste’s Singapore plant, further cementing the city-state’s emerging status as a hub for renewable aviation fuel production and distribution.

By sourcing SAF locally, SIA is not only reducing transportation-related emissions associated with fuel logistics but also supporting the development of Singapore’s SAF infrastructure and the resilience of its aviation fuel supply chain. This initiative aligns with national goals to position Singapore as a sustainable aviation leader in the Asia-Pacific region.

U.S. Partnership with World Energy Advances Book & Claim Model

In a complementary move, SIA also acquired an additional two thousand tonnes of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of environmental attributes—commonly referred to as SAF certificates—from U.S.-based sustainable fuel pioneer World Energy. This acquisition was facilitated through the “Book & Claim” Chain of Custody mechanism, which allows airlines to account for carbon reduction benefits without the need for direct fuel delivery or physical usage.

The Book & Claim approach is particularly valuable for global carriers like SIA, enabling flexible, scalable access to SAF benefits even in markets where physical SAF availability may be limited. The transaction underscores SIA’s commitment to using innovative models that foster global SAF demand and accelerate the sector’s decarbonisation.

Together, these two agreements—finalised during the first quarter of 2025—are expected to offset over nine thousand five hundred tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. This outcome reinforces SIA’s proactive stance on climate action and positions the airline as a regional leader in sustainable aviation.

Driving Regional Collaboration Through Green Fuel Forward

Beyond procurement, SIA continues to collaborate on broader sustainability efforts. It remains a key participant in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, launched by the World Economic Forum in partnership with Singapore’s GenZero. The campaign aims to mobilize corporate support, boost regional SAF demand, and drive cooperation among airlines, fuel suppliers, and governments across Asia-Pacific.

By aligning itself with high-impact initiatives such as Green Fuel Forward, SIA not only enhances its own sustainability strategy but also contributes to a regional movement focused on long-term carbon neutrality in aviation.

What is SAF and Why It Matters

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable and environmentally responsible alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. Derived from sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, municipal waste, and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to eighty percent over its full lifecycle. Importantly, it is compatible with existing aircraft engines and airport refueling infrastructure when blended with conventional jet fuel, requiring no costly modifications.

SAF usage is tracked and verified through SAF certificates (SAFc), which represent the emissions reductions achieved through its use. These certificates can be traded, sold, or passed on to corporate buyers, enabling both airlines and business clients to claim sustainability benefits, even in scenarios where direct fuel usage isn’t feasible.

SIA’s engagement in SAF procurement and credit systems is closely aligned with CORSIA, the first international framework targeting aviation emissions. Developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), CORSIA encourages airlines to utilize low-carbon fuels—designated as CORSIA Eligible Fuel—to minimize their offsetting obligations.

Accelerating the Aviation Industry’s Low-Carbon Transition

As global aviation works toward ambitious decarbonisation targets, efforts like those by Singapore Airlines serve as essential case studies in innovation, collaboration, and climate responsibility. Through its SAF procurements, strategic partnerships, and participation in regional sustainability campaigns, SIA continues to play a vital role in shaping a cleaner future for air travel—both within Asia and across international skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/283e07ca-db96-4649-af96-4ffb03b0-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 07:56:42.781776

EU mandates are set to increase to 6% in 2030, at which point EU SAF consumption is expected to reach 85,820 b/d, or 8% of jet fuel demand.
By this time, the bloc could be falling short of supplies, burning 507,740 b/d, or 48% of jet fuel demand.
Mandates establish specific targets for SAF blending, Nabil Ahmed, an analyst at energy trade association Energy Industries Council, told Platts.
The UK stipulated a buy-out price for eSAF of GBP6,250/mt ($8,351/mt) in its April consultation on creating the SAF mandate.","The premium of sustainable aviation fuel over conventional jet fuel has dwindled in recent months, and while airlines and consumers welcome this, it has damaged margins for producers and challenged investment prospects in the long-term.

As 2030 looms closer, a significant proportion of planned European capacity has yet to reach a final investment decision, posing the prospect of Europe having to import volumes to meet its own targets.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the premium of SAF produced via the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway on a CIF basis in Northwest Europe at an average premium of $1,091/mt in April, or 163%, over jet CIF cargoes. This has slumped from a 203% difference when the SAF assessment was launched in September 2023.

The price of SAF is a key concern for airlines. Airlines are the core of the SAF value chain, but they earn just a 3.6% net margin, which means profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, said in December.

""Clearly weaker margins"" in the renewables segment of Finnish refiner Neste have kept the business loss-making, according to company figures, and comparable sales margins in its sustainable segment fell from $562/mt in Q1 2024 to $310/mt in Q1 2025, it said April 29.

Biogenic biofuels as a wider commodity class have faced trouble in Europe, amid competitive Asian imports. Biofuels producers across Europe have poured cold water on production plans, with Shell, Chevron and BP all announcing delays or scalebacks.

Looking ahead, concerns about capacity translate into the spread between SAF and jet fuel recovery, although it is unclear at what point this will encourage more investment in SAF and synthetic fuel, or eSAF.

Capacity is unlikely to keep pace as quotas ramp up significantly and as pressure on feedstocks mounts, Nathan Nguyen, a biofuels analyst at Commodity Insights, said. As a result, the EU could fall well behind the bloc's ReFuelEU Aviation mandates and by 2050, shortfalls could exceed 15 million mt, he said.

Analysts at Commodity Insights forecast the difference in price for European SAF and jet will rise from 222% in 2026 to 338% in 2050.

This comes as EU mandates bolster demand in the years ahead and jitters remain about the sustainability of imported feedstocks.

EU mandates are set to increase to 6% in 2030, at which point EU SAF consumption is expected to reach 85,820 b/d, or 8% of jet fuel demand. Consumption is expected to rise steadily to 70% in 2050. By this time, the bloc could be falling short of supplies, burning 507,740 b/d, or 48% of jet fuel demand.

Demand drives price rises

While output shortfalls may lie ahead, producers have faced the opposite problem in recent months, as a well-supplied market pressures price margins.

Global SAF output will be 64,000 b/d in 2025, up 136% on the year, and then rise 55% on the year to 99,000 b/d in 2026, according to analysts at Commodity Insights.

In Europe, 2025 output will be 21,000 b/d, an 83% rise on the year, and then grow 69% on the year in 2026 to 36,000 b/d, Commodity Insights data showed.

The market for biofuels is struggling amid oversupply but toughening mandates boost the longer-term outlook, management at Dutch storage firm Royal Vopak and Austrian refinery OMV said in summer 2024.

Encouragement to invest in SAF production has taken different forms in different jurisdictions, with incentives in the US and mandates in the EU and UK.

Mandates establish specific targets for SAF blending, Nabil Ahmed, an analyst at energy trade association Energy Industries Council, told Platts.

""With the UK and Europe implementing mandates, a clear and growing market for SAF is being created, providing producers with the certainty needed to invest in production capacity and allowing for greater predictability,"" Ahmed said.

Although mandates could initially lead to higher fuel costs for airlines -- potentially passed on to consumers -- mechanisms like the UK's buy-out price and the EU's dedicated SAF allowances within the Emission Trading System aim to mitigate this, he added.

eSAF prospects

A key difficulty lies in sourcing suitable feedstock for HEFA-based SAF for the larger volumes needed, and regulators are, therefore, eying alternative pathways, namely synthetic fuel or eSAF. One difficulty is that the premium for eSAF is even greater. The UK stipulated a buy-out price for eSAF of GBP6,250/mt ($8,351/mt) in its April consultation on creating the SAF mandate.

Lowering renewable hydrogen costs will be instrumental in reducing the price of eSAF, which can be overstated, an official at biofuel license technology provider Honeywell told Platts in February.

In real terms, the costs of producing eSAF could be around 25% more expensive than those of SAF from biogenic feedstock, said Kevin O'Neil, a senior business leader at Honeywell's Sustainable Technology Solutions division.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-12 08:56:34.645352

Airports across both regions pledge to expand infrastructure, embrace innovation, and modernise regulations to meet future aviation demand sustainably.

Airports across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East are gearing up for a projected 7% annual growth in air travel over the next 25 years. To meet this demand, members of ACI Asia-Pacific & Middle East passed a resolution during their 2nd Regional Assembly in New Delhi, prioritising capacity optimisation and infrastructure development both on the ground and in the skies, along with sustainability.

Sustainable airport expansion across Asia-Pacific and Middle East key to supporting long-term air travel growth

The resolution highlights the strategic importance of airports in socio-economic development. The two regions, which represent 58% of the global aviation market and 9 of the 10 fastest-growing aviation markets, are committing to sustainable, long-term airport growth.

Key points include modernising slot allocation systems to reflect current market conditions, promoting Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM), enhancing cross-border Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM), and expanding runways and terminals. Emphasis was also placed on integrating digital technologies and green initiatives, such as climate-resilient infrastructure, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and green energy.

The resolution calls for diverse financing approaches—like Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)—and urges governments to adopt regulatory frameworks that encourage investment while protecting consumer interests. It also promotes global collaboration and industry best practices.

Mr SGK Kishore, President of ACI Asia-Pacific & Middle East, said: “The region’s position as the primary driver of global air travel growth makes investment in modern, efficient, and sustainable airport infrastructure not just prudent but absolutely critical.”

Mr Stefano Baronci, Director General of ACI Asia-Pacific & Middle East, added: “A holistic approach is the need of the hour. This entails not only investment in physical airport infrastructure but also modernisation of air traffic management and a fundamental overhaul of the outdated slot management guidelines.”

The resolution reinforces the region’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and global cooperation to handle exponential growth while securing long-term efficiency and resilience.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/africa-and-middle-east.gif,N,,2025-05-12 07:56:58.852165

Despite the decline in overall impact, the report noted that direct contributions from biofuels in Iowa remain strong, with fuel production reaching a new high.
The Iowa Corn Growers Association also raised concerns.
She pointed out that ethanol production remains high and argued that there are other ways to cut emissions without using thousands of acres of farmland for pipelines.
Shaw warned that if Iowa can’t develop carbon storage systems, other states like Nebraska might become the new leaders in ethanol production.","The renewable fuels industry in Iowa brought in $800 million less in 2024 than it did the previous year, according to a new study from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. The group pointed to stagnant demand for corn as the main reason for the economic drop, reports The Gazette.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the association, said the best way to turn things around is by expanding into new markets that require ultra-low carbon ethanol. He called this the most effective way to support farmers and fuel producers in the state.

Despite the decline in overall impact, the report noted that direct contributions from biofuels in Iowa remain strong, with fuel production reaching a new high. The industry made up 2% of the state’s economy in 2024, or about $5.7 billion, and supported more than 34,000 jobs—down from 52,000 jobs the year before.

Shaw explained that while part of the job loss is due to completed construction projects and a facility closure, most of it results from lower economic activity related to the industry. He said when corn prices drop, farmers have less money to spend on equipment and services, leading to job losses in related sectors.

The Iowa Corn Growers Association also raised concerns. Ryan Sauer, the group’s vice president of market development, warned that if Iowa doesn’t find new ways to use corn, the state could face an economic situation similar to the 1980s farm crisis. He noted that falling corn prices and high farming costs could put many farmers at financial risk.

One possible solution is to expand use of E15, a fuel blend containing 15% ethanol. If Congress approves it for year-round use, it could increase demand for corn by 2.3 billion bushels annually, according to the National Corn Growers Association. Currently, 62% of Iowa’s corn is used for ethanol.

Shaw supported E15 but called it a short-term fix. He said longer-term growth will come from expanding into low-carbon markets, including sustainable aviation fuel and fuels for ships, trains, and heavy equipment. But to enter those markets, Iowa’s ethanol must have lower carbon emissions.

The report suggested that reducing emissions could be achieved through eco-friendly farming methods and by capturing and storing carbon dioxide from ethanol production. Shaw argued that building a carbon capture pipeline, such as the one proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions, could open the door to massive demand for biofuels over the next two decades.

Opposition to the pipeline, however, remains strong. Critics like Emma Schmit of the Bold Alliance said relying on such projects is risky and unnecessary. She pointed out that ethanol production remains high and argued that there are other ways to cut emissions without using thousands of acres of farmland for pipelines.

Summit says it already has agreements for over 75% of the land needed for the first phase of its pipeline. But construction in Iowa is on hold while the company seeks permits in South Dakota, where lawmakers have banned the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines.

Shaw warned that if Iowa can’t develop carbon storage systems, other states like Nebraska might become the new leaders in ethanol production.

“This isn’t a political game,” Shaw said. “The consequences for Iowa’s economy and farmers are very real.”",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ethanol-25.jpeg,N,,2025-05-12 07:57:12.831393

Leading this transformation are cargo community systems that serve as digital platforms connecting all stakeholders in the air cargo supply chain.
“Fraport is actively addressing technological challenges in air cargo operations, primarily through the implementation and development of the Cargo Community System FAIR@Link.
Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) has partnered with Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) to launch Hong Kong’s first air cargo terminal powered by a 5G private network.
She adds, “At Frankfurt Airport, allivate enhances environmental sustainability in air cargo operations by increasing process transparency and optimising planning.","As the air cargo market continues to grow, cutting-edge solutions are essential for solving capacity challenges, improving operational workflows, and promoting sustainability in the industry.

The air freight industry stands at an unprecedented crossroads of innovation and transformation. Long considered the fastest but most expensive mode of cargo transport, air freight is experiencing a technological renaissance that promises to reshape its fundamental operations, efficiency, and environmental impact. As global supply chains become increasingly complex and consumer expectations for rapid delivery continue to rise, technological advancements are providing solutions that were unimaginable just a decade ago. From artificial intelligence and blockchain to automated handling systems and sustainable aviation fuels, these innovations are not merely incremental improvements but revolutionary changes that are redefining what's possible in the movement of goods by air.

This transformation comes at a critical time as the industry rebounds from the disruptions of recent years and looks toward a future where agility, reliability, and sustainability will determine competitive advantage.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has predicted that air cargo volumes will increase by 5.8% in 2025, reaching 72.5 million tonnes. This growth is anticipated to be driven by booming e-commerce and geopolitical factors influencing sea shipments. The industry’s long-term growth outlook remains positive, with forecasts of an average annual growth of 3.1% from 2027 to 2043. This anticipated growth underscores the urgency for the industry to adopt scalable, intelligent technologies.

Digital transformation and community systems

The digitalisation of air freight processes has emerged as the foundational element of the industry's technological revolution. Leading this transformation are cargo community systems that serve as digital platforms connecting all stakeholders in the air cargo supply chain.

Fraport, operator of Frankfurt Airport (FRA), one of Europe's largest cargo hubs, exemplifies this approach through its joint venture allivate with software company DAKOSY to further develop the FAIR@Link Cargo Community System.

“Fraport is actively addressing technological challenges in air cargo operations, primarily through the implementation and development of the Cargo Community System FAIR@Link. Last year, we founded the joint venture, allivate, with software company DAKOSY to drive the digitisation of air cargo handling both in Frankfurt and internationally and to further develop FAIR@Link. This system aims to facilitate efficient, reliable, and well-organised cargo flow by automating data exchange between various stakeholders,” says Martina Schikorr, Managing Director, allivate.

Allivate’s other product, Speedgate Connect, is aimed at handling agents who do not have a transfer area directly on the airport apron. The solution enhances digitalisation at neutral freight transfer points, offering key benefits such as a detailed graphic overview of lanes, intuitive lane assignment, faster processes through technical integration, and improved communication across interfaces.

“Fraport is committed to engaging with international bodies to establish standards that ensure safety, efficiency, and global consistency.”

Martina Schikorr, allivate

At Frankfurt Airport, the Speedgate facility offers direct apron access for both import and export cargo. With Speedgate Connect, the entire process is streamlined through automated slot bookings, delivering greater transparency and full oversight of incoming and outgoing cargo units.

The impact of such digital platforms extends beyond mere convenience. Similar digital transformation initiatives are underway at major cargo hubs worldwide.

SATS, one of the world's largest providers of air cargo handling services, headquartered in Singapore, has implemented its COSYS+ mobility module across its network in Asia Pacific. “This allows our staff to update shipment statuses throughout the warehouse without needing to return to the office, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency,” says Bob Chi, CEO of Gateway Services, Asia-Pacific, SATS.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have emerged as transformative forces in air freight, bringing unprecedented levels of predictive capability and optimisation to an industry historically constrained by manual planning processes. These technologies are being applied across multiple domains, from demand forecasting and pricing to operational planning and cargo handling.

Speedcargo, a Singapore-based technology company specialising in cargo digitalisation and automation, exemplifies the revolutionary potential of AI in the air freight industry.

“Assemble is a deep-tech software solution that plans for optimal cargo capacity utilisation on Unit Load Devices (ULDs) in seconds, while adhering to rules specified by the IATA, the airline, and for revenue and yield maximisation. The algorithms have been designed specifically for use in the air freight environment and are deployed both for planning the load to be carried on a flight and the execution of the build-up plans for each ULD. It auto-generates step-by-step build-up instructions for ULDs. A digital guided workﬂow provides intuitive, visual instructions for cargo retrieval and placement of cargo within the ULDs,” says Dr. Suraj Nair, Founder and CEO, Speedcargo.

Nair mentions that this system enables ground handlers to optimise operations in several ways. Real-time access to information about cargo ready for carriage allows planners to maximise capacity on ULDs by creating efficient build-up plans for each unit. The system can auto-generate a detailed build-up plan, including the sequence of cargo retrieval and a step-by-step guide for build-up, while also remaining flexible to last-minute changes. Productivity is improved by enabling planners to manage multiple flights simultaneously, reducing the number of open pallets, and eliminating manual data entry through digital build-up records. Additionally, cargo occupancy data, including usable space on each ULD, can be shared with airlines, who can use it for forward and hub operations, as well as for creating booking models.

Amplifi by Speedcargo takes capacity utilisation to the next level by optimising the booking, trimming, and load plan generation processes for airlines. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with ground handling agent (GHA) operations through Cargo Eye and Assemble, providing a comprehensive solution that enhances the entire cargo handling workflow.

While discussing this, Nair mentions that it has brought a 6-15% improvement in capacity utilisation.

Beyond loading optimisation, AI and machine learning are transforming other critical aspects of air freight operations. Revenue management systems powered by these technologies now dynamically adjust pricing based on multiple variables, including capacity, demand forecasts, competitor pricing, fuel costs, and weather conditions.

“We are expecting a brownfield deployment first, and as confidence builds in automation to address the needs of the industry, the adoption will move towards large hubs that are looking to upgrade their infrastructure.”

AI adoption has reached cargo terminals as well. Last year, Cathay Cargo Terminal became Hong Kong’s first air cargo facility to integrate AI with its CCTV system, enhancing safety and security monitoring. The technology detects risks like missing safety gear or unsafe proximity between vehicles, equipment, and workers.

Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) has partnered with Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) to launch Hong Kong’s first air cargo terminal powered by a 5G private network. The high-speed connectivity supports AI-powered patrol robots that monitor cargo areas in real time, stream live video to the security control centre, and enhance security by detecting anomalies and reducing manual surveillance.

IoT and advanced tracking technologies

The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed visibility in air freight through the deployment of sophisticated sensors and tracking devices. These technologies now provide unprecedented insights into shipment conditions and locations throughout the air freight journey. Modern IoT devices monitor not only location but also temperature, humidity, pressure, light exposure, and shock events, critical parameters for sensitive cargo such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, and perishables.

These devices now transmit data continuously through cellular networks or satellite connectivity, creating a digital twin of the physical shipment that stakeholders can monitor in real-time.

“SATS has implemented ""Arrow"" and ""eReadback"" technology, these innovations digitise apron loading instructions, monitor the loading of Unit Load Devices (ULDs), eliminate manual readbacks, and enable photo validation of loaded and locked ULDs, enhancing both safety and operational efficiency,” says Chi of SATS.

Beyond condition monitoring, IoT devices are increasingly being used to track ULDs themselves. Major airlines and ULD management companies have implemented RFID and Bluetooth-enabled tracking for their ULD fleets, as battery technology improves and IoT devices become smaller and more affordable, the industry is moving toward a future where item-level tracking becomes standard, even for lower-value shipments.

Transforming cargo handling through automation

The physical handling of air freight is undergoing a robotic revolution, with automated systems increasingly replacing manual processes in cargo terminals worldwide. This transformation addresses an industry where cargo handling has traditionally been labor-intensive, with inherent variability in shipment characteristics creating challenges for standardisation.

“Currently, there are automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) and conveyor systems being used in select ground handling facilities. We envision a staggering approach to automation in the air cargo industry, and we are expecting a brownfield deployment first, and as confidence builds in automation to address the needs of the industry, the adoption will move towards large hubs that are looking to upgrade their infrastructure. This will then translate to a greenfield development where automation will be the new standard for operations,” says Nair of Speedcargo.

“Fraport is actively exploring the integration of driverless ground support vehicles into airside operations. Recent tests of autonomous baggage and cargo tractors have shown promising results, prompting Fraport to focus on critical areas. The deployment of these vehicles is envisioned as a gradual process, with non-time-critical tasks potentially being the first to transition. Despite technological progress, challenges remain, especially in complex airport scenarios, requiring advancements in technology and regulatory frameworks. To address these challenges, Fraport is conducting tests with a focus on operations in adverse weather conditions, taxiway crossings with aircraft and pushback detection, and achieving higher speeds,” says Schikorr of allivate.

“By implementing technologies such as the COSYS+ mobility module, Arrow, eReadback technology, and the Groundstar system, SATS is able to streamline processes, improve safety, and optimise resource management.”

Bob Chi, SATS

Chi of SATS says that the company has implemented its Groundstar, a workforce management system, automating planning, scheduling, and task allocation for cargo handling operations. The company is rolling out this system across its stations in the Americas region. Additionally, the company has successfully tried ContourSpect, a freight dimensioning technology in Copenhagen, which optimises cargo capacity and reduces climate impact by automating dimension capture and eliminating manual measurements. SATS plans to extend this solution to other stations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific.

Another example of advanced automation is CargoSpect, a fully automated scanning solution developed by Cind and recently deployed at IAG Cargo’s London Heathrow hub. The AI-powered system uses ten high-speed cameras to capture real-time cargo data, including dimensions and weight, handling up to 500 measurements per hour.

Digitising air cargo documentation

The air freight industry has long been burdened by paper-based processes and documentation, with a single shipment potentially requiring more than 30 different paper documents. This reliance on physical paperwork has been a significant source of inefficiency, errors, and delays. Blockchain technology is now revolutionising this aspect of air freight by enabling secure, transparent, and immutable digital documentation.

The IATA has been at the forefront of this transformation with initiatives like ONE Record, which aims to create a single digital record for each shipment. Through the IATA governance programmes, airlines have agreed that they will have developed ONE Record capability by 1 January 2026.

According to IATA, more than 200 companies worldwide are participating in pilot projects to test and implement over 25 ONE Record use cases, including the exchange of air waybill data, freight tracking, customs processes, and multimodal transport integration.

“One of the main challenges is overcoming the reliance on paper, optical character recognition (OCR) tools, and legacy systems that limit data quality. Standardisation and harmonisation among diverse stakeholders, alongside initiatives like eAWBs and ONE Record, are crucial to improving efficiency and productivity in cargo operations,” says Schikorr of allivate.

One notable example of digital transformation in customs is South Korea’s UNI-PASS, developed by the Korea Customs Service. It is the world’s first system to enable 100% online customs processing, dramatically improving speed and efficiency. UNI-PASS supports a 24-hour clearance system, export clearance that once took over a day now takes just 1.5 minutes, while import clearance has dropped from more than two days to 1.5 hours. This shift has significantly reduced logistics costs in a sector where speed is critical.

Sustainable aviation technologies

Environmental sustainability has moved from a peripheral concern to a central focus for the air freight industry. Technological innovations aimed at reducing carbon emissions are transforming operations across the sector, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) leading the way.

According to IATA, in 2024, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres), doubling the 0.5 million tonnes (600 million litres) produced in 2023. In 2025, SAF production is expected to reach 2.1 million tonnes (2.7 billion litres).

Schikorr of allivate says Fraport aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across all Group airports by 2045, with a focus on reducing its environmental footprint while maintaining operational excellence through innovation and sustainable practices. Fraport's international portfolio comprises 29 airports and airport-related companies across the globe.

She adds, “At Frankfurt Airport, allivate enhances environmental sustainability in air cargo operations by increasing process transparency and optimising planning. This leads to reduced wait times and transport movements, lowering the airport's carbon footprint. Our focus remains on improving efficiency to reduce emissions through better process management.”

“By generating digital models of cargo, applying proprietary spatial optimisation algorithms, and automating cargo handling in the warehouse, the company’s platform is designed to quickly solve the complex puzzle of safely loading aircraft with the optimal amount of cargo. Doing so allows users of Speedcargo’s platform to maximise capacity utilisation and improve efficiency while minimising their carbon footprint,” says Nair of Speedcargo.

Ground operations at airports have seen perhaps the most immediate transformation, with electric ground support equipment (GSE) rapidly replacing diesel-powered alternatives. This transition has not only reduced carbon emissions but also improved air quality around airports and reduced noise pollution.

Further, many airlines are adopting advanced technologies such as AeroSHARK, a surface film developed by Lufthansa Technik and BASF that mimics the microscopic structure of sharkskin. By reducing frictional resistance and improving airflow, AeroSHARK helps save fuel and lower emissions. Airlines such as Lufthansa, Lufthansa Cargo, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, LATAM Airlines, and All Nippon Airways (ANA) have adopted this technology. ANA recently became the first airline in the world to operate both passenger and cargo Boeing 777 aircraft equipped with AeroSHARK.

The industry is also increasingly adopting circular economy principles, with initiatives focused on recycling aircraft components and repurposing end-of-life aircraft. Several ULD management companies now offer programmes that recycle damaged containers into new products, reducing waste and creating a more sustainable lifecycle for these essential components.

The air freight industry stands at the threshold of a new era defined by intelligent automation, predictive capabilities, and sustainability. The innovations now being deployed across the sector promise to overcome traditional limitations, creating unprecedented possibilities for efficiency, reliability, and environmental performance. As these technologies continue to mature and converge, their combined impact will redefine what constitutes world-class air cargo service in the 21st century.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/05/11/81904-image-1500x900-77-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 01:56:22.120714

“It was great having Sen. Smith out here to get her perspective on what we can do moving forward to pass a Farm Bill, as well as help farmers out,” said Jeffrey Sorenson, who represents Minnesota on the American Soybean Association. “She’s a great advocate for us in D.C.”

In addition to passing a fully funded Farm Bill after two years of extension, the Sorensons and Sen. Smith discussed trade turmoil, the overall farm economy, growing domestic demand and spring planting conditions. Jeff, while a self-proclaimed optimist, said tariffs were weighing on his mind this spring.

“The most concerning part to me is we still haven’t gained back our market share with China since the last trade war,” he told Sen. Smith. “We now export about 10% less to China now than we did back in 2018, 2019, and that’s definitely weighing on us.”

Because the U.S. typically doesn’t export as much soy during the spring and summer, Jeffrey Sorenson said there’s an opportunity to de-escalate trade tensions with China before this year’s harvest.

“But that window is quickly closing,” he said. “It’s definitely a challenge right now for rural America.”

Jeffrey also emphasized that value-added uses, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), could help increase domestic demand for soy.

“Markets like SAF are key to diversifying our markets and not being so dependent on China,” he said. “We’re always looking for new uses.”

Smith agreed.

“Then you’re keeping the value here,” she said.

Kelli, who works in ag lending and grew up on a farm in Nebraska, highlighted how rural communities in Redwood County – and throughout the country – revolve around a healthy farm economy. The current financial outlook is concerning, she said.

“Everything is trending down, and as a banker, I ask, ‘What can we do to turn this around?’” she said. “They’re trying to make a profit, obviously, but it’s hard to stay optimistic. People are aware that it’s tough right now.”

To cap the visit, Sen. Smith gave close attention to the Sorenson’s dog, George, took a closer look at their farm equipment and recorded a video for Jeffrey and Kelli’s three children, Avery, Sydney and Riley. Chatting outside on an overcast May afternoon, the Sorensons and Smith stayed on the sunny side while acknowledging the myriad uncertainties facing farmers in 2025.

“If you’re going to be a farmer, you have to be an optimist,” Smith said, “and you’re also dealing with reality, because farming is a business.”

Asimismo, en los próximos años se prevé un aumento de la demanda de aeronaves, con el objetivo de reemplazar las unidades más antiguas y contaminantes por otras dotadas de tecnología más moderna.

Las principales líneas de investigación abiertas actualmente para mejorar la sostenibilidad del sector se centran fundamentalmente en limitar las emisiones a través del empleo de nuevos sistemas de propulsión con fuentes de energía como la electricidad, el hidrógeno o el SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Por otro lado, la I+D europea busca avanzar en la consecución de diseños más ligeros en componentes estructurales y más eficientes en el caso de los aerodinámicos.

La combinación de ambos aspectos demanda desarrollar nuevas arquitecturas de aeronaves que estén preparadas para acoger estos nuevos sistemas de propulsión y de almacenamiento energético. Cambios para los que las aeronaves actuales no están preparadas y que implican nuevos retos para los sistemas productivos actuales.

En este contexto, con requisitos más exigentes para los sistemas productivos y una demanda creciente de aeronaves, la tendencia actual se dirige hacia la digitalización de los procesos de diseño y producción que contribuirá, en el caso del sector aeronáutico, a mejorar los sistemas productivos y el control sobre la producción, así como a aumentar la capacidad de fabricación y la calidad de los productos finales.

El centro tecnológico vasco Tekniker, con un amplio conocimiento en estas nuevas tecnologías de automatización y monitorización de los procesos, trabaja en el proyecto Reforce junto al fabricante aeronáutico Aernnova, en mejorar y automatizar el montaje de componentes críticos como alerones, timones, estabilizadores o fuselajes, en los que Aernnova es uno de los principales productores.

La iniciativa busca implantar nuevas técnicas de monitorización y control de los procesos de montaje para mejorar la precisión de los componentes fabricados, reduciendo los defectos y aumentando la cadencia de fabricación. En concreto se centra en la problemática asociada a la precisión del eje de giro de las superficies móviles de las aeronaves. “Este tipo de componentes constan de una serie de casquillos, unidos a la parte estructural, que forman el eje de giro; este eje se distorsiona debido a la deformación que sufre el componente durante los procesos de montaje, especialmente en el proceso de remachado de la piel”, explica Oscar Gonzalo, responsable de aeronáutica de Tekniker.

En el marco del proyecto, Tekniker contribuye con su conocimiento en sensorización y nuevas tecnologías de monitorización de procesos para el desarrollo de utillajes inteligentes y sistemas con sensórica integrada. Asimismo, aporta su conocimiento en inteligencia artificial para el desarrollo de una herramienta software de asistencia al montaje orientada a minimizar las distorsiones geométricas y mejorar la precisión del componente final.

Además, Tekniker colaborará con Aernnova en el análisis de datos para optimizar los procesos de montaje. Una vez sensorizado el proceso, se capturarán datos del mismo con el fin de desarrollar un modelo de inteligencia artificial capaz de proporcionar indicaciones sobre los siguientes pasos a seguir. Este enfoque busca minimizar las distorsiones y mejorar la precisión del componente final.

Informalidad y achicarse, secuelas para las industrias más golpeadas por la crisis

Uno de estos es la prueba industrial que realizó Ecopetrol al producir en la refinería de Cartagena 32.000 barriles de Jet coprocesado. Con esta producción se realizó una alianza con Latam con el fin de que más de 700 vuelos sean operados JetA1 coprocesado con 1% de materias primas renovables. El combustible se distribuirá en los aeropuertos de Barranquilla, Medellín y San Andrés.

“La diferencia es que para llamarse SAF tienes que tener una serie de certificaciones de la materia prima del transporte, del almacenamiento, del proceso de refinación en los diferentes eslabones y en Colombia todavía no todos los agentes tienen esas certificaciones. Entonces, hasta tanto no tengas el 100% de los requisitos, no te puedes llamar SAF. Así la molécula sea igual”, aseveró Felipe Trujillo, vicepresidente de Refinación y Procesos Industriales de Ecopetrol.

Por lo tanto, Trujillo aseguró que la refinería de Cartagena ya está lista para producir. Sin embargo, lo único lo que hace falta es el fortalecimiento del marco regulatorio.

“Es decir, que el Ministerio de Minas defina la cancha, las reglas, porcentaje de mezcla, ¿de cuánto estamos hablando con el jet fósil?, la estructura de precios, la cadena de distribución para poder salir a producirlo de forma recurrente, porque todo el mundo nos dice, ""Bueno, pero ¿por qué una prueba?"" Pues porque hoy no está regulado. Y esta esté bache que se produjo fue a costo nuestro”, resaltó Trujillo.

El vicepresidente de Refinación y Procesos Industriales de Ecopetrol, aseguró que la diferencia entre SAF o el jet copresado y jet fósil es de tres o cuatro veces el precio.

“En esta oportunidad lo asumimos nosotros, pero eso obviamente no es sostenible. Hacia adelante necesitamos un marco regulatorio que lo hemos venido trabajando, no están en ceros. Estamos trabajando tanto con el Ministerio de Minas y Energía y la Dirección de Hidrocarburos, así como la Aerocivil y bueno, y muchos otros agentes”, resaltó.

¿Cuánto vale una tonelada de SAF?

Según el experto, en el último año se ha venido reduciendo significativamente el precio del SAF, en marzo del 2024 una tonelada valía más o menos US$380 y en el tercer mes de este año se redujo hasta los $162.

Entre tanto, el funcionario de la petrolera más grande del país aseguró que una aeronave puede usar hasta el 50% de su combustible con SAF.

“Para que el impacto sea manejable o casi marginal, tú puedes hacer mezclas como la que hicimos con Latam en el vuelo inaugural del 1%”, puntualizó.

With a record-breaking number of exhibitors and attendees, the stage was perfectly set for Lufthansa to unveil a dynamic roadmap built around net-zero aviation, premium passenger personalization, and scalable B2B-B2C climate solutions.

Sustainability Takes Center Stage

Sustainability is no longer a buzzword—it’s a battleground. Lufthansa’s environmental roadmap set the tone for the event, showcasing its ambitious goal to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve full carbon neutrality by 2050. But it’s not just lip service. Lufthansa’s path is paved with tangible strategies already in motion.

The group has begun phasing out fuel-hungry, four-engine aircraft in favor of modern, twin-engine models that consume 20–30% less fuel, thereby slashing CO₂ emissions significantly. This structural change is paired with operational efficiencies, digital innovation, and customer engagement tools that drive impact beyond the cockpit.

Moreover, Lufthansa’s “Green Fare” initiative gives passengers the option to offset their carbon footprint in real time during the booking process. The additional cost funds the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and global reforestation and carbon removal projects. According to Lufthansa officials at ATM, the program has seen strong adoption rates among eco-conscious travelers, confirming that modern passengers value ethical choices and are willing to invest in climate-positive flying.

Allegris: The Passenger Experience Revolution

Beyond environmental promises, Lufthansa is investing €2.5 billion into its cabin transformation project, “Allegris”, which redefines the onboard passenger journey across all four classes. The vision is personalization without compromise.

In business class, travelers will enjoy five unique seating options—including a 2.2-meter-long bed, enhanced privacy zones, and customizable comfort controls. First class receives a radical upgrade, boasting ultra-exclusive suites designed for both luxury and seclusion.

The group used the opportunity to strengthen partnerships across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, regions crucial to its growth strategy. With Dubai rapidly asserting itself as a global aviation and tourism nexus, Lufthansa’s presence signals a commitment to deeper collaboration with the region’s travel trade ecosystem.

From meeting new customers to connecting with competitors and exploring regional alliances, ATM offered fertile ground for Lufthansa’s network expansion. The energy on Day 1, as Lufthansa leaders noted, was electric—underscoring the Middle East’s vital role in shaping tourism’s next decade.

This year marks Lufthansa’s third consecutive presence at ATM, and insiders say it was the brand’s most impactful appearance yet. With sustainability now embedded in strategic conversations, and cross-border cooperation at the forefront, Lufthansa is positioning itself as a bridge between climate responsibility and commercial viability.

Lufthansa’s Local Commitment in Dubai and Beyond

With its Dubai office located near the World Trade Centre, Lufthansa reaffirmed its local presence, encouraging visitors to continue conversations beyond the exhibition hall. This proximity ensures long-term accessibility for corporate partners, travel agents, and customers across the GCC and wider MENA region.

Moreover, the airline’s regional footprint complements broader tourism trends. As Gulf countries diversify away from oil toward hospitality, events, and green infrastructure, Lufthansa’s shared vision of sustainable growth finds strong alignment.

The Middle East’s aviation future is bold and fast-moving—and Lufthansa is making it clear that it intends to be part of that journey.

What This Means for the Global Travel Industry

Lufthansa’s showing at ATM 2025 marks a critical shift for legacy carriers. No longer content with simply recovering post-COVID, the airline is setting new standards for what air travel should look like in a climate-sensitive, experience-driven era.

From carbon offset tools and fleet modernization to billion-euro cabin reinventions, Lufthansa is challenging peers to rethink aviation’s business model. The emphasis is no longer on volume alone. Instead, it’s about value creation for travelers, responsibility for the planet, and partnership within the tourism economy.

This message is resonating not just in boardrooms, but with passengers. More and more, travelers are booking based on values—not just price.

Final Takeaway: Leading by Design and Duty

As ATM 2025 continues, Lufthansa has left a lasting impression: aviation can be sustainable, luxurious, and deeply personal—all at once. The airline’s integrated approach to climate action, customer experience, and collaborative growth sets a new bar for the future of travel.

And in a world where trust, ethics, and engagement matter more than ever, Lufthansa is flying ahead—not just with jets, but with purpose.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__32661-1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-11 16:56:08.226076

• Tough to swallow: British farmers’ fears over US trade deal

Kenward and Pearson praised the prime minister for showing “real leadership” in delivering relief for Britain’s car and steel industries.

However, they said: “For another strategically essential sector — domestic bioethanol production — it is now clear that the deal has triggered an existential threat. Without immediate action, this vital sovereign capability will be lost.”

They said that their operating environment was now impossible, given the additional regulations that gave overseas producers an unfair advantage in the British market.

Kenward and Pearson told The Times: “We are fast approaching the point where we need to decide whether to sign new contracts. In the current conditions, that would be irresponsible.

“Hundreds of growers will lose a dependable market for wheat that cannot be used in breadmaking. Instead, they’ll be forced to export it at lower prices, while facing higher costs for imported animal feed.

“Without urgent government action, the UK’s bioethanol industry will simply vanish, leaving the country dependent on imported ethanol — while also losing significant domestic production of carbon dioxide and high-protein animal feed.”

Carbon dioxide and dried grains, which are used in animal feed, are by-products of the bioethanol production process.

Kenward and Pearson added: “CO₂ is indispensable across the economy — from its importance to the NHS for its operating theatres to cooling nuclear reactors. For the food and drink sector, it is used for everything from preserving packaged food to carbonating drinks.”

• Keir Starmer’s team were losing when Trump rang to say he’d won a deal

The closure of both bioethanol production sites could also harm Britain’s net zero drive by reducing possible sources of production of sustainable aviation fuel, Kenward and Pearson said. “The UK is on the verge of turning its back. Our recent discussions with ministers offered hope of fixing the regulatory imbalance that’s undermining the industry.

“The trade deal, as it stands, will reverse that progress — and more. We’re not asking for special treatment — only fair rules, stable policy, and, importantly, recognition of the strategic value sovereign bioethanol production brings to the UK.”

Starmer was urged to “move quickly to protect what it puts at risk” and not sacrifice the bioethanol industry “for a deal that solves one problem by creating another”.

Ensus’s plant on Teesside has been operating for 15 years and buys more than a million tonnes of wheat a year from UK farmers to produce about 400 million litres of ethanol.

It also makes about 350,000 tonnes of high-protein animal feed and 250,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. About 2,000 people are employed across its supply chain.

Vivergo, a subsidiary of ABF Sugar which employs about 150 people, can produce up to 420 million litres of bioethanol and 400,000 tonnes of animal feed a year.

• Tariffs, tax and trust: the US trade deal’s unanswered questions

After the trade deal was announced, Starmer’s deputy spokesman said the government had met representatives from the affected companies and close engagement would continue.

The prime minister heralded a “fantastic, historic day” after the trade deal was announced.

He said: “This is jobs saved, jobs won but not job done and our teams will continue to work to build on this agreement.

“My government is determined to go further and faster to strengthen the UK’s economy, putting more money in working people’s pockets as part of our plan for change.”

By Paul Kenward, Chief Executive, ABF Sugar, and Grant Pearson, Chairman, Ensus

The Prime Minister showed real leadership in securing the UK-US trade deal, delivering relief for Britain’s car and steel industries. But for another strategically essential sector, domestic bioethanol production, it is now clear that the deal has triggered an existential threat.

Without immediate action, this vital sovereign capability will be lost.

Between us, we operate the two largest bioethanol facilities in the country: Ensus in Wilton on Teesside, and Vivergo in Saltend, near Hull, representing nearly all of the UK’s bioethanol production capacity.

The facts are these. The US-UK trade deal is set to remove tariffs on US ethanol and replace it with a zero-tariff quota of 1.4 billion litres, which coincidentally is the size of the UK’s whole ethanol market today, far exceeding previous US exports to the UK. This change comes on top of regulations that give overseas producers an unfair advantage in the British market. The operating environment is now impossible.

Bioethanol plants are profitable across Europe and in the US – and have been in the UK too. Government delays in mandating the switch from E5 to E10 petrol forced the sector to scale back production in the years before the change finally took effect in 2021. Since last September, decisions on imports, tariffs and fuel certificates have put that success at very significant risk.

It’s not the facilities that are unviable, the problem is how British officials apply rules and regulations that undermine their competitiveness.

Together with our supply chain partners, we support thousands of jobs, mostly in the North East and Yorkshire. These are good, green jobs in exactly the kind of industries ministers say they want to grow.

The Government supported the creation of this industry in 2008 through long-term commitments with what was called the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. Ministers of all flavours have repeatedly reaffirmed its strategic value. Most recently this was by keeping tariffs in place after Brexit and by convening discussions across Whitehall earlier this month with industry to identify how the sector, already struggling due to unfair competition from the US, could be sustained.

And yet, today, this vital sector is now facing imminent collapse because of the trade deal. In our current situation, we will have to close these plants.

Bioethanol plays a critical role in decarbonising transport. It powers the UK’s standard E10 petrol blend, reducing emissions from every litre at the pump. Its production also delivers two essential by-products: high-protein animal feed and carbon dioxide. CO₂ is indispensable across the economy – from its importance to the NHS for its operating theatres to cooling nuclear reactors. For the food and drink sector, it is used for everything from preserving packaged food to carbonating drinks.

The National Farmers’ Union has warned of the consequences the trade deal poses for Britain’s agricultural and ethanol industries. Jointly, our plants purchase more than two million tonnes of wheat annually. We have already made commitments to farmers, and customers, which we will, of course, fulfil. But we are fast approaching the point where we need to decide whether to sign new contracts. In the current conditions, that would be irresponsible.

Hundreds of growers will lose a dependable market for wheat that cannot be used in breadmaking. Instead, they’ll be forced to export it at lower prices, while facing higher costs for imported animal feed.

Without urgent government action, the UK’s bioethanol industry will simply vanish, leaving the country dependent on imported ethanol – while also losing significant domestic production of carbon dioxide and high-protein animal feed.

We’ve seen this kind of vulnerability before. In 2022, a national CO₂ shortage sparked headlines about lager shortages during the World Cup. More seriously, it risked delaying NHS operations and threatened the shutdown of nuclear reactors.

The risk extends beyond the immediate. Both of our sites could produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – a central ambition of the Prime Minister’s government. But without a stable domestic ethanol base, one promising route for British SAF production will struggle to take off. And why should any investor back the next generation of clean fuels if policy can be overturned overnight? Other countries are backing that potential. The UK is on the verge of turning its back.

Our recent discussions with ministers offered hope of fixing the regulatory imbalance that’s undermining the industry. The trade deal, as it stands, will reverse that progress - and more. We’re not asking for special treatment – only fair rules, stable policy, and, importantly, recognition of the strategic value sovereign bioethanol production brings to the UK.

The Prime Minister deserves a great deal of credit for unlocking the deal with Washington. Now he must move quickly to protect what it puts at risk. Britain’s bioethanol industry is a strategic national asset, supporting thousands of jobs, and is critical to the country’s net zero ambitions and food security.

It must not be sacrificed for a deal that solves one problem by creating another.

Andrew Petersen is a third-generation oil refinery worker from a small, industrial Scottish town.

When he was growing up, working at Grangemouth refinery meant you “had a job for life”.

But last month “everything changed”, Petersen told AFP near the refinery, its giant cooling towers looming in the background.

On April 29, owner Petroineos announced it had ended operations at the refinery after more than a century, triggering the first of a phased wave of redundancies, including Petersen’s.

The closure of the UK’s oldest and Scotland’s only refinery will result in more than 400 job cuts, which locals say the impoverished adjoining town of Grangemouth can ill afford.

Petroineos — a joint venture of British chemical giant Ineos and the Chinese state-owned PetroChina -– says the refinery was losing around $500,000 (£376,600) a day as a result of changing market conditions and carbon-cutting measures.

It will be replaced by an import terminal, employing just 65 of the workforce including Chris Hamilton, who currently works as a refinery operator.

Since Petroineos announced its intention to wind down operations in 2023, workers like Petersen and Hamilton who are members of the Unite trade union have been campaigning to “Keep Grangemouth Working”.

The campaign was not against ending polluting refinery work, but sought to “future-proof” the site and transition to low-carbon options such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) without job losses, explained Hamilton.

However, Petroineos told AFP the “existing regulatory, policy and fiscal framework did not support low-carbon manufacturing” at Grangemouth, or any of the UK’s other industrial clusters.

A recent report by Scotland’s Just Transition Commission (JTC) concluded that Grangemouth had seen an “accountability breakdown” on the part of the government and Petroineos.

As a result, for the last six months, Petersen and his colleagues have been shutting down the refinery’s units one-by-one.

“It was really tough,” said Petersen. “You got the feeling you’re almost digging your own grave.”

– Just transition –

Located between Glasgow and Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth, the refinery, which first opened in 1924, is part of a sprawling industrial site.

Petroineos and the UK government this year published Project Willow, a feasibility study into low-carbon futures for the site.

However, its suggestions — including SAF production or plastic recycling — would take years to implement and billions of pounds of investment.

And £200 million pledged by the UK government for the site is contingent on private investment, which is not yet forthcoming.

“With the refinery closing… workers can’t wait a decade,” Grangemouth’s Westminster MP Brian Leishman told AFP.

“A real, proper, just transition means that you take the workers and their communities along with you,” he added.

JTC commissioner Richard Hardy told AFP that the refinery’s “car crash” closure was a “litmus test for just transition”.

He argued that the UK and devolved Scottish governments needed to do more to bridge the gap between shuttering polluting industries and the transition to greener energy — which will accelerate closer to Britain’s 2050 net zero target.

Just last month, the UK had to step in to save hundreds of jobs at a British Steel plant after its Chinese owners decided to shut down the furnaces.

Leishman had called for the government to do the same for Grangemouth.

One of the UK’s six remaining crude refineries, Grangemouth was the primary supplier of aviation fuel to Scotland’s main airports and a major petrol and diesel supplier in the central belt.

“Being in charge of our own destiny, for me, that’s just plain common sense,” said Leishman.

– ‘Ghost town’ –

Built around the refinery and once known as Scotland’s “boomtown”, Grangemouth has seen a steady decline in recent years.

The population has fallen in the last decade to about 16,000 residents, with more expected to leave with the refinery’s closure.

Petersen said he would likely move elsewhere, and had even considered the Middle East.

There are options there, he said: “But just not here.

“It’s going to turn into a ghost town,” he added.

In the run-down town centre dotted with half-shuttered shop fronts, the local butcher Robert Anderson said he was already losing business.

“We don’t see them anymore”, he said of the workers in their high-visibility vests.

Hannah Barclay, a homelessness support worker, told AFP that the refinery employed many of her friends.

For a “lot of people here, uni and college and further education, it is not an option,” said the 19-year-old.

The refinery closing is “taking away so much opportunity for people”, and leaving behind an “uncertain” future.

“It’s just quite disheartening to see all these young people who should be really excited for the future, who are just scared.”",https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2812e40bacc8f1f94bc2862289e8589ffd7b17ea.jpg,N,,2025-05-11 13:56:07.105086

Built around the refinery and once known as Scotland's ""boomtown"", Grangemouth has seen a steady decline in recent years.

The population has fallen in the last decade to about 16,000 residents, with more expected to leave with the refinery's closure.

Petersen said he would likely move elsewhere, and had even considered the Middle East.

There are options there, he said: ""But just not here.

""It's going to turn into a ghost town,"" he added.

In the run-down town centre dotted with half-shuttered shop fronts, the local butcher Robert Anderson said he was already losing business.

""We don't see them anymore"", he said of the workers in their high-visibility vests.

Hannah Barclay, a homelessness support worker, told AFP that the refinery employed many of her friends.

For a ""lot of people here, uni and college and further education, it is not an option,"" said the 19-year-old.

The refinery closing is ""taking away so much opportunity for people"", and leaving behind an ""uncertain"" future.

""It's just quite disheartening to see all these young people who should be really excited for the future, who are just scared.""

Right now, he said, the supply outweighs demand for corn and soybean commodities, which has led to decreasing corn prices over the past two years.
One route for increased demand could come from the congressional approval of nationwide, year-round E15, or a blend of ethanol fuel with 15 percent ethanol.
The association’s study found that 62 percent of corn in Iowa is processed by the ethanol industry.
She referenced figures in the study showing another high year for ethanol production, and that corn utilization by the industry has remained consistent.","The economic impact of the renewable fuels industry in Iowa was $800 million less in 2024 than it was in 2023, according to a recent study released by Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.

The industry association said “stagnant corn demand” has affected biofuels’ impact on Iowa’s economy, and said the best way to increase demand is entry to the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets.

“That is the most cost-effective and impactful tool we can provide our farmers and producers,” Monte Shaw, the Iowa association’s executive director, said in a statement.

The association holds that the direct impacts of biofuels “remain strong” in the state, with another “record for fuel production.”

Overall, the report found the renewable fuel industry accounted for 2 percent of Iowa’s 2024 gross domestic product, or $5.7 billion. The industry also created more than 34,000 direct and indirect jobs across the state, down from 52,000 jobs in 2023.

Shaw said some of the change comes from completed construction projects and a closed facility, but the majority is from the indirect impacts of the stalled market.

“The bigger thing is those multiplier effects,” he said. “When you’re buying corn at $7, that income goes over in the economy and supports jobs and other aspects of Iowa’s economy. … When farmers don’t have money, they’re not out buying new equipment, they’re gonna make stuff last another year, and so that is where those job losses have happened.”

Shaw said if the numbers are to increase across the economy, the overall demand for ethanol needs to increase. Right now, he said, the supply outweighs demand for corn and soybean commodities, which has led to decreasing corn prices over the past two years. The trend is projected to follow suit for the 2024-2025 crop year.

“Our farmers are very productive, very competitive … they’re producing more corn with fewer inputs on the same acres,” Shaw said. “But we have not been able to build demand fast enough.”

Ryan Sauer, vice president of market development for Iowa Corn Growers Association, said if the current trends continue and Iowa doesn’t branch into new markets to utilize corn, there could be “a bit of a repeat” of the farm crisis from the 1980s.

“You’ve got commodity prices that are going to stay stagnant, you’ve got input prices that will remain high, and I mean, there’s only so long that the banks can allow a farmer to do that,” Sauer said.

One route for increased demand could come from the congressional approval of nationwide, year-round E15, or a blend of ethanol fuel with 15 percent ethanol.

According to studies from the National Corn Growers Association, a 5 percent increase in ethanol blends, which E15 would represent, equates to an increased demand of 2.3 billion bushels of corn annually. The association’s study found that 62 percent of corn in Iowa is processed by the ethanol industry.

Sauer said the E15 market would be especially important for Iowa farmers if tariffs upset corn export markets. “If we’re not going to be able to export it because of tariffs and all this, we need all the demand domestically we can get, and E15 will allow us to do that,” Sauer said.

Low carbon markets

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association also has been pushing for year-round E15, but Shaw called it a “near-term market.”

“All the other market growth opportunities that we see on the horizon are low carbon, ultra-low carbon markets,” Shaw said. “That’s why we’re fighting so hard … to make sure that our ethanol producers have the tools they need to produce ultra-low carbon ethanol.”

Shaw said sustainable aviation fuel is one of the ultra-low carbon fuels the industry hopes to expand to, but there is also demand for fuels in the marine industry, trains and for some construction and tractor equipment.

The study said ethanol producers would have to “lower the carbon intensity” of ethanol production in order to open up the market for sustainable aviation fuel.

“This is most easily achieved through environmentally friendly feedstock production practices and access to opportunities for carbon capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide from ethanol production,” the study said.

The industries purchasing these fuels want them to be produced with lifetime greenhouse gas emissions below a certain level. Some iterations of guidance for sustainable aviation fuel, for example, required the fuel to be made from corn grown with carbon-reducing farming practices.

Shaw said being able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions via sequestration, like the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, would equate to “tens of billions of gallons” of additional biofuel demand over the next 20 years.

“Do you want to be sitting here around $3.50 corn, and having a bad farm economy?” Shaw asked. “Or, do we want to access these new markets that will literally say, ‘Give me every gallon you can?’”

The Summit pipeline, and the now terminated Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline in Iowa, has drawn opposition from landowners, some politicians and environmental groups like the Sierra Club.

Those opposed to the project believe the carbon dioxide sequestration pipelines are dangerous for communities, often citing a rupture of a pipeline in Satartia, Miss. Landowners oppose the taking of easements in agricultural land for the pipeline, especially after the Summit project was conditionally granted the right of eminent domain in Iowa last June.

Emma Schmit, pipeline fighters director with Bold Alliance, said the “unyielding commitment to carbon capture pipelines” is what’s holding the biofuels industry back.

“To imply stagnation suddenly has the industry on death’s door unless a risky carbon capture pipeline is allowed to destroy over 1,000 miles of prime Iowa farmland is a stretch,” Schmit said in an email.

She referenced figures in the study showing another high year for ethanol production, and that corn utilization by the industry has remained consistent.

“If expanding markets via decarbonization is the goal, there are a multitude of options available that don’t depend on the destruction of thousands of parcels or the misuse of eminent domain,” Schmit said.

According to Summit Carbon Solutions, the project already has secured easement agreements for more than 75 percent of the route for the first phase of the pipeline.

Construction on the pipeline in Iowa cannot begin until the company has secured permit approval in South Dakota, a process complicated by that state’s recent ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines and subsequent denial of the permit application from Summit. The company has pledged to reapply with reduced scope in the state.

Shaw said without carbon dioxide sequestration capabilities, Iowa could lose its title as “most cost-effective place to turn corn into ethanol,” in favor of Nebraska, where a roughly 400-mile CO2 pipeline is set to be operational by the end of 2025.

“People are treating this like it’s some sort of political board game, and they’re ignoring the very real ramifications that are happening around us,” Shaw said.",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=36147d8a-ebec-5c17-ba80-f8649ff5b743&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800,N,,2025-05-11 11:56:43.272456

Announced ahead of Intersolar Europe in Munich this week, the milestone reflects growing power demand driven by AI, industrial electrification and economic growth. RES now also supports 43GW of operational assets through its expanding services business – underscoring the increasing maturity of the sector.

With operations in 24 countries and over four decades of experience across wind, solar, battery storage and green hydrogen, RES is calling on policymakers to accelerate infrastructure investment and enable affordable, secure, and clean energy at scale.

Eduardo Medina, CEO of RES, said: 'The sector is developing and building faster and smarter than ever, but outdated grids and slow permitting are holding back progress—just as demand for clean, secure power is rising. We need systems that move at the speed of the challenge.'

Recent EU reforms offer a clear path forward, providing greater certainty and a more stable investment environment for renewable deployment.

Eduardo added: 'Germany has seen permitting for onshore wind increase sevenfold thanks to new EU rules. Declaring renewables in the overriding public interest is a smart, pragmatic move. It’s working – and other countries can follow that lead.

'Solar now powers more than one in ten homes across Europe and has become one of the most affordable new sources of electricity, as well as supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs'

RES is currently developing an additional 26GW of renewable energy projects – enough to power more than 16 million homes.

Recent highlights contributing to RES’ 28GW milestone include:

Australia – RES developed the 436.5MW Tarong West Wind Farm in Queensland, advancing it to a late-stage development before signing an agreement with Stanwell Corporation which will see Queenslanders own 100 per cent of the project and the clean energy it will produce.

Canada – Development and sale of the 184MWdc Big Sky Solar project to TotalEnergies. Separately, construction continues on Nova Scotia’s largest wind project, Goose Harbour Lake, which RES developed.

Sweden – Development and sale of a 70MW battery storage project in Ånge and completion of the green hydrogen-ready Alby development, supporting sustainable aviation fuel with Norsk e-Fuel and Prime Capital.

United Kingdom – Continued expansion of onshore wind and solar developments alongside advanced analytics and asset optimisation services.

United States – Expansion of services and control centre operations in Denver, alongside major construction projects such as Atrisco Solar in New Mexico and Catclaw Solar in Arizona.

Latin America – Market entry in Brazil, Chile and Mexico through long-term services partnerships to support solar and wind.

RES supports calls from industry bodies including WindEurope for practical reforms that enable faster deployment and greater investor confidence in wind and solar, including:

Applying new EU permitting rules more widely – streamlined approvals have led to a sevenfold increase in permitting for onshore wind in Germany.

Filtering grid queues – removing stalled or inactive ‘zombie’ projects will reduce delays for viable developments.

Making electrification easier – including reforming electricity taxes and enabling renewable PPAs for more industries.

Creating stable investment frameworks – such as 2-sided Contract for Difference (CfD) auctions that improve visibility and reduce capital costs.

Eduardo: 'The global energy market is entering a decisive phase. Solar energy in particular is one of the most affordable new sources of electricity, bringing lasting benefits to rural communities and coexisting with other land uses. What happens next depends on the policy environment. We are ready to deliver faster, more flexible, and more affordable clean energy which benefits everyone.'

Reporting live from the bustling floors of Arabian Travel Market 2025 at the Dubai World Trade Center, Alvina Agha shared a special moment from the event as she interviewed Mr. Luis Monreal, the Senior Director of Sales for the Middle East at Lufthansa Group Airlines. The exclusive conversation highlighted the airline group’s sustainability vision and strategic regional commitments, offering valuable insights into how Lufthansa is shaping the future of aviation across the Middle East and beyond.

We are thrilled to bring you this exclusive conversation, centered on a powerful and urgent theme: sustainability in aviation.

“Sustainability and aviation are like two deeply intertwined forces,” began Monreal, as we dove into the airline’s commitment to eco-conscious travel.

Lufthansa’s Green Horizon: 2030 and 2050 Goals

Monreal explained that Lufthansa Group Airlines—which includes Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, ITA Airways, and Eurowings—has taken bold and specific steps toward sustainability.

“We have clear targets for the future. By 2030, we aim to reduce carbon emissions by 50%. And by 2050, we are working to become completely carbon neutral,” he declared with pride.

These goals aren’t just statements. They’re backed by multi-billion-euro commitments and detailed implementation frameworks.

SAF Fuel Challenges and the Road Ahead

Much of Lufthansa’s transformation is fueled by the gradual shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, Monreal admitted that the journey isn’t easy.

“The production of SAF is extremely limited today. It simply doesn’t meet the volume our industry needs.”

He emphasized the urgent need for governments and energy companies to accelerate SAF production and make it economically viable.

Fleet Renewal: 250 New-Era Aircraft Coming

Sustainability in aviation isn’t only about fuels—it’s about the hardware too.

“From 2025 to 2032, we’re renewing our fleet with 250 new aircraft,” Monreal revealed. “100 of these will be long-haul.”

This massive fleet renewal is focused on two-engine planes, known for their 20–30% greater fuel efficiency.

Lufthansa’s “Green Fare” Innovation Empowers Customers

Another exciting innovation is the introduction of the “Green Fare”—a ticketing option now available on lufthansa.com.

“Yes, it costs a bit more, but passengers can opt into compensating their carbon footprint,” Monreal explained.

This fare model not only allows travelers to consciously choose sustainability—it redirects revenue into SAF purchases and certified carbon offset programs.

Middle East Expansion: UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Beyond

Monreal also discussed Lufthansa Group’s strong and growing presence in the Middle East.

“We now serve 11 cities across the region,” he said. “New routes include Jeddah–Stuttgart and Abu Dhabi–Berlin via Eurowings.”

These additions are part of the group’s broader strategy to strengthen European–Gulf connectivity, especially with eco-efficient aircraft.

Group-Wide Sustainability Culture

Luis Monreal emphasized that sustainability is not a solo effort.

“Lufthansa Group’s commitment is collective. It’s not just about Lufthansa—it’s all our brands moving toward a greener future.”

With a holistic approach, Lufthansa is aligning its customer offerings, fuel procurement, fleet upgrades, and route planning with climate-conscious goals.

The Individual’s Role in Sustainability

As the conversation concluded, Monreal made a heartfelt point about individual responsibility.

“We all can contribute—whether it’s choosing a green fare, turning off a light, or using less water. These habits matter.”

Lufthansa Group is charting a bold course toward eco-responsible aviation, and Luis Monreal’s insights at ATM Dubai 2025 underline just how comprehensive and people-focused their strategy is.

From fleet modernization and SAF adoption to passenger participation through green fares, the airline group is setting an industry benchmark for what sustainability in aviation should look like.

As global travelers and tourism professionals, the conversation doesn’t stop here. It’s time we all board the flight toward a cleaner sky.

Lufthansa Soars into New Horizons: Bold Route Expansion and Global Strategy Define 2025 Growth Vision

In 2025, Lufthansa Airlines is no longer just flying passengers—it is redrawing the map of global aviation. As international travel roars back after years of volatility, the Lufthansa Group has embraced the moment with aggressive growth, sophisticated fleet investments, and a laser-sharp focus on expanding connectivity across continents. The airline’s strategy goes far beyond merely opening new routes; it reflects a broader evolution in how one of Europe’s most prestigious airline groups envisions the future of travel.

This year marks a pivotal moment in Lufthansa’s post-pandemic recovery and long-term planning. The airline has reoriented its growth strategy around three pillars: fleet modernization, strategic long-haul expansion, and regional network densification. These efforts are already taking shape through dozens of newly launched or soon-to-debut routes across Europe, North America, and Asia.

Lufthansa’s network additions are not random—they are targeted and data-driven. The airline has identified where global demand is growing and where it can offer premium service and unmatched reliability. This includes bringing back popular long-haul connections and entering underserved markets hungry for direct transcontinental access. In doing so, Lufthansa is not only regaining its pre-COVID stature but is emerging more competitive and future-ready than ever.

Perhaps the most visible sign of Lufthansa’s transformation is its commitment to fleet renewal. Throughout 2025, the airline is taking delivery of a brand-new aircraft roughly every two weeks. This extraordinary investment includes cutting-edge long-haul models like the Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and soon, the Boeing 777-9. These new-generation aircraft are central to Lufthansa’s sustainability roadmap, offering up to 25% greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions compared to previous models.

These aircraft are not arriving empty. Lufthansa is deploying them on reconfigured and brand-new long-haul routes, particularly to North America and Asia. One of the most celebrated moves is the return of the Airbus A380 to high-demand U.S. routes, with Munich-based superjumbo services now flying to Boston, New York-JFK, Washington Dulles, and Los Angeles. New for this year is Denver, which joins the A380 network, highlighting the strategic importance of secondary U.S. hubs in Lufthansa’s global portfolio.

At the same time, Lufthansa is zeroing in on growing Asian travel demand. While still assessing post-pandemic air traffic flows in countries like China and Japan, the airline is looking southward—towards India and Southeast Asia. Its strengthened codeshare agreement with Air India has already unlocked dozens of city-pair connections between Europe and India, allowing Lufthansa passengers to reach secondary Indian cities such as Kochi, Pune, and Bhubaneswar through a seamless network of joint flights.

The Middle East, too, is becoming an increasingly central focus. The airline’s Eurowings Discover brand is expanding footprint in the Gulf, with a new direct service between Abu Dhabi and Berlin debuting in late 2025. This marks a symbolic milestone, linking two capital cities and reinforcing Lufthansa Group’s confidence in outbound and inbound tourism between Germany and the UAE. Similarly, the new Jeddah–Stuttgart route exemplifies Lufthansa’s goal of making German economic regions more accessible to the Middle East’s fast-evolving travel market.

Lufthansa is not forgetting Europe in its global expansion either. The continent remains its strongest market and backbone for short-haul operations. This summer, the carrier is adding new seasonal and year-round flights to leisure and secondary cities like Sylt, Burgas, and Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Lufthansa City Airlines—its latest regional subsidiary—is turbocharging intra-European capacity with dozens of new flights out of Munich, adding more than 2,000 weekly departures by mid-July.

What ties these initiatives together is not just market presence, but product consistency. Lufthansa’s new cabin concept “Allegris,” set to roll out across the group’s long-haul fleet, is designed to elevate the passenger experience in all classes. From refreshed economy seats to private suite-like business cabins, the airline is investing in quality as much as quantity. All newly delivered aircraft will carry the Allegris design, and existing aircraft like the Boeing 747-8 will be retrofitted to align with this upgraded standard.

This dual focus—more routes and better onboard experience—reflects Lufthansa’s understanding that in 2025, passengers are not just looking for flights; they are seeking reliable, comfortable, and sustainable journeys. In an era of growing environmental awareness, that final point is critical. The airline’s decision to route new, more fuel-efficient aircraft to expanding global markets is also part of its broader sustainability agenda. Coupled with increasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use and carbon offset programs through “Green Fares,” Lufthansa is working to reduce its environmental footprint while growing its network.

Behind these decisions is a strategic shift within the Lufthansa Group itself. The airline is emerging from recent years of financial restructuring, government bailouts, and capacity challenges with a renewed sense of purpose. Now profitable, with steady booking trends and rising corporate demand, Lufthansa is using this momentum to secure its long-term relevance in global aviation.

In many ways, 2025 feels like a renaissance year for Lufthansa. The airline is not merely bouncing back from a downturn—it is fundamentally reinventing itself. Whether you’re a leisure traveler in Toronto eyeing a quick European getaway, or a business executive in Delhi seeking direct access to Frankfurt, the Lufthansa of 2025 is closer, faster, and more attuned to modern travel needs than ever before.

As the airline industry moves deeper into the post-pandemic reality of volatile fuel costs, fluctuating geopolitical risks, and competitive low-cost carriers, Lufthansa’s decision to bet on sustainable, high-quality, globally integrated growth may well become a benchmark others will follow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-11-040715.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 19:56:42.530400

A green economy in ASEAN is no more an abstract concept, but a north star, demanding collective action.","ASEAN faces climate risks impacting economies and food security, urging a shift to sustainable growth. Transitioning to a green economy presents opportunities for jobs, investments, and improved health outcomes.

Even as economies around the world pursue economic growth, these efforts cannot be isolated from a focus on sustainability. Achieving sustainable growth will open the doors to not just unprecedented, future-forward opportunities, but also large-scale risks and challenges that demand innovative solutions.

These include a range of climate and environmental risks that are threatening everyday life for populations across Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states. Due to the region’s fast-growing, dense urban areas and proximity to coastal areas, ASEAN is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change—from devastating cyclones and floods, to unrelenting heatwaves and droughts.

The recent past is replete with examples of how ASEAN’s economies will suffer. In 2024, for example, the Philippines was hit by six typhoons within a span of 30 days. This late typhoon season affected more than 13 million people in the country, greatly straining the country’s fiscal position.

Another less talked about implication of the change in weather patterns is on the region’s food security. As floods and droughts become more frequent and severe in nature, key food producing regions – such as the Mekong Delta region, a major source of rice – will find themselves struggling with crop destruction and less productive harvests.

Frequent flooding could also cause a range of other issues, such as heightened costs in terms of healthcare and damaged infrastructure, which are also contributing to a growing insurance gap in the region. All in all, if climate change isn’t sufficiently addressed, ASEAN could face 11% of GDP losses by 2100.

These costs emphasise the imperative for the region to push forward a new paradigm of growth that prioritises low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive solutions.

Going Green: Path to Economic Growth

Analyses have shown that transitioning to a green economy isn’t just about creating costs but also serious economic growth opportunities. Projections by the Boston Consulting Group suggests that pursuing carbon neutrality can add US$3 trillion to US$5.3 trillion to ASEAN’s GDP by 2050. The push could also attract US$3.7 trillion to US$6.7 trillion in green investments, generating between 49 million and 66 million additional jobs in ASEAN by the middle of the century.

There are also significant benefits in terms of health outcomes, as carbon neutrality can lead to improvements in air and water quality. Air and water pollution are associated with higher risks of heart and lung disease, water-borne diseases, cancer and even developmental delays in children.

Biodiversity is also essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems, ensuring the resilience of food production systems and climate regulation. Consider the mangrove forests in parts of ASEAN, which not only provide a buffer against flooding and erosion but also act as essential habitats for hundreds of plant and animal species. Supporting the long-term maintenance of a biodiverse landscape is thus essential for accessing raw materials for life-saving medicines and preserving food webs.

ASEAN’s Road to the Green Economy

Understanding the myriad benefits that a green economy brings, ASEAN has taken several steps to accelerate its green transition.

To respond to biodiversity loss in the region, ASEAN member states established the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity in 2005 to control biodiversity loss in the region. The centre has launched the ASEAN Green Initiative, aiming to plant at least 10 million native trees across the 10 member states in a span of 10 years, illustrating their commitment to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

More recently, the Centre spearheaded the launch of the ASEAN Biodiversity Plan that sets out priorities for a number of goals to achieve by 2050, including the restoration of 30% of degraded ecosystems and information sharing between member states. In the long run, these efforts will pave the way towards better management of the region’s diverse ecosystems and healthier environments for humans.

Another initiative is ASEAN Green Future, a multi-year research project launched in 2021, involving the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, ClimateWorks Centre, and nine country teams from leading universities and think tanks across Southeast Asia. The project comprises two phases and aims to equip a generation of climate change and decarbonisation researchers, providing them with quantitative and qualitative climate policy analysis to chart a net-zero future for ASEAN.

The project could also offer key insights for businesses by providing essential data and technical advice to assist them as they plan to decarbonise their own operations. Governments may also leverage these data points to set out regulatory frameworks to ensure the effectiveness of any future climate or emissions-focused action plans.

Given the high costs of decarbonisation technologies and transitions, access to financing will be crucial. The ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility (ACGF) was launched in April 2019 by the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund to accelerate green infrastructure investments in Southeast Asia. The ACGF would provide governments with access to over US$1 billion in loans to de-risk commercially-viable green infrastructure projects and make them more attractive to private capital investors.

ASEAN Economic Ministers also endorsed a visionary ASEAN Strategy for Carbon Neutrality in August 2023, which seeks to further ASEAN’s competitiveness on the global stage via four key outcomes:

the development of regional green value chains to unlock ASEAN’s manufacturing and export potential

fostering growth of green technologies by enabling exchange of green electricity, products, and feedstocks

developing globally credible standards to become a top destination for foreign capital flow

investing and developing its human capital of green talent to drive the climate transition.

Acknowledged by ASEAN leaders in September 2023, the strategy has been presented to ASEAN member states with policies being developed to collaborate together on unlocking the immense socioeconomic benefits of a carbon-neutral future.

ASEAN’s Search for Carbon Neutrality

ASEAN is tapping into eight strategies to go carbon neutral. They include:

Collaboration to develop policies and regulations to boost the greening of manufacturing value chains; drive acceptability of locally produced biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel both regionally and globally; and support the development of carbon capture, utilisation, and storage infrastructure.

Upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement to accommodate the inclusion of circular product types.

Standardisation of cross-border infrastructure to enable interoperability of electric, hydrogen, and flex-fuel vehicles, while allowing power trading among ASEAN member states.

Development of a regional measurement, reporting, and verification framework to enable seamless movement of high-quality carbon credits regionally and globally.

Development of globally accepted credible frameworks for climate reporting with the development of a consolidated database to track and collate GHG emissions.

Promoting the deployment of ASEAN green/sustainability linked bonds and sukuk standards, while supporting and incentivising green fund managers and encouraging the development of local funds.

Harmonising standards around green skills qualifications to facilitate the movement of natural persons to close talent supply/demand gaps.

Facilitating best practices sharing on development of sustainable infrastructure and the deployment of smart city technologies such as waste management.

The private sector has much to gain from participating in ASEAN’s transition to a green economy. Other than leveraging on the next phase of growth in the region, businesses can participate in cross-border partnerships, knowledge-sharing initiatives, and joint ventures to scale their own climate action efforts.

Financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank are actively working with ASEAN through the provision of financing and knowledge sharing. The bank is catalysing green and innovative financing solutions through its Southeast Asia Green Finance Hub and helping develop and finance bankable ocean health projects through its Blue Southeast Asia Finance Hub.

Going forward, the region needs to develop a framework that fosters collaboration between public and private leaders, and the development of green financing and talent to realise any potential policy interventions. Proper governance will be needed to ensure that action plans under the framework are clearly defined, with specific tasks and initiatives. A green economy in ASEAN is no more an abstract concept, but a north star, demanding collective action.

Međutim, sat vremena pre poletanja zemaljska stjuardesa Britiš Ervejza obavestila je putnike da je poletanje aviona otkazano.
Da preskočimo jadikovku: Sam Brenson u svom autorskom tekstu objavljenom na njegovom kompanijskom blogu kaže da je shvatio da postoji ""puno ljudi koji žele da stignu na odredište"", a sve što im je trebalo bio je - avion.
Avion je prethodno bio iznajmljen kompaniji Aerolineas Argentinas, a Brenson mu je dao ""ime"" Maiden Voyager (Prva putnica - op.
Danas je Virdžin kompanija koja je ""podeljena"": 51 odsto je u vlasništvu matične kompanije, a 49% udela u vlasništvu ima Delta Er Lajns.","Kompanija Virdžin Atlantik, nastala pre 41 godine, danas ima flotu od oko 40 aviona i prevozi svoje putnike na 22 destinacije. A nekad? Nekad je to, verovali ili ne, bila samo kapriciozna ideja već dokazano sposobnog milionera, Ričarda Brensona.

Brenson je imao 28 godina, kada je, kao već poznati i priznati vlasnik kompanije Virdžin Rekords (Virgin Records - za koju su znali muzičari iz celog sveta koji su želeli da objave svoju ploču), rešio da se sastane sa svojom tadašnjom devojkom (a sada suprugom) Džoan na Britanskim Devičanskim Ostrvima.

Šta bi drugo mogao Britanac da uradi u to vreme osim da - kupi kartu za Ostrva i čeka na aerodromu. Upravo to je Brenson i uradio. Međutim, sat vremena pre poletanja zemaljska stjuardesa Britiš Ervejza obavestila je putnike da je poletanje aviona otkazano.

Brenson je bio veoma razočaran, a kao i svi drugi preduzetnici, odmah je, umesto jadikovki, postavio pitanje: ""Šta ako postoji neki drugi način…?"" Da preskočimo jadikovku: Sam Brenson u svom autorskom tekstu objavljenom na njegovom kompanijskom blogu kaže da je shvatio da postoji ""puno ljudi koji žele da stignu na odredište"", a sve što im je trebalo bio je - avion.

""Otišao sam u kancelarije u zadnjem delu aerodroma, iznajmio avion i pronašao jednu tablu. Iz šale sam napisao: ""Virdžin Ervejz - 39 dolara u jednom pravcu"" i popunio let sa svim putnicima kojima je let bio otkazan."" Odmah po sletanju, jedan od putnika je rekao Brensonu da Virdžin Ervejz nije loš: ""Samo poboljšaj uslugu i mogao bi da napraviš posao"", rekao mu je.

I tako je krenulo. Brenson sam priznaje da je mnogo vremena ""provodio putujući avionom, obilazio bendove (za mlađe - podsetnik: izdavač ploča (kasnije kaseta, pa CD-ova, Blu rej diskova itd) morao je da obilazi bendove, a Jutjub, Dizeri i ostale platforme tada nisu ni postojale). Sa bendovima bi potpisivao ugovore i sklapao poslove.

Putovanje avionom tada nije bilo prijatno iskustvo. Karte su bile skupe, usluga loša, hrana još gora, nije bilo zabave i nije bilo konkurencije koja bi primorala avio-kompanije da se potrude. Shvatio sam da postoji praznina na tržištu – prilika da se napravi nešto drugačije i pruži sjajno iskustvo putnicima"".

Brenson je tada napravio listu stvari koje je želeo da razume oko iznajmljivanja aviona:

""Ako bih mogao da iznajmim jedan avion na godinu dana, uz mogućnost da ga vratim, imali bismo jasan izlaz ako sve propadne. Bilo bi neugodno, ali bismo ograničili gubitke. Do kraja vikenda, odlučio sam: ako možemo da sve ograničimo na godinu dana – ugovore o zapošljavanju, iznajmljivanje aviona, valutne rizike i sve ostalo što podrazumeva pokretanje linije za Njujork – zaštitili bismo se od većine rizika i vredelo bi pokušati"".

Baš tako je zapravo - sve počelo. Kada je pozvao Boing naišao je na podsmeh, jer je Amerikancima bilo smešno što Englez iz muzičke industrije hoće da iznajmi džambo-džet (Boing 747 - ponovo - podsetnik za mlađe) na godinu dana. Posle celodnevnog natezanja i promena sagovornika, na kraju je saznao da Boing ima avione koje iznajmljuje, kao i da imaju jedan polovni džambo džet koji bi ozbiljno razmotrili da uzmu nazad posle godinu dana ako stvari ne uspeju.

Ubrzo potom Brenson se sastao sa ser Fredijem Lejkerom, osnivačem Lejker Erlajnsa, čovekom koji je među prvima primenio koncept lou-kost (niskobudžetne) kompanije.

""Britiš Ervejz će pokušati da te izbriše sa mape kao što su uradili meni (Lejkers Erlajns je bankrotirao 1982.). Zato ću ti dati savet u tri reči: Tuži ta g***a!"", rekao je Lejker Brensonu i dao mu još mnogo saveta i ideja kako Virdžin može da radi drugačije.

Ozbiljno se razmišljalo i o imenu kompanije: jedan od vodećih Brensonovih biznis planera, Dejvid Tejt, protivio se ideji da novi avioprevoznik nosi ime Virdžin (devica, op. aut.): ""Virdžin Atlantik? Hahahha... Niko nikada neće sesti u avion koji se zove Virdžin. To je smešno. Ko bi leteo kompanijom koja nije spremna da ide do kraja?""

Očigledno je: nije bio u pravu. U ranim jutarnjim satima 22. juna 1984. godine Virdžin Atlantik obavio je prvi let između Getvika (London) i Njuarka (Njujork Siti regija, SAD) koristeći Boing 747-200 sa registarskim oznakom G-VIRG. Avion je prethodno bio iznajmljen kompaniji Aerolineas Argentinas, a Brenson mu je dao ""ime"" Maiden Voyager (Prva putnica - op. aut.).

Brenson i njegov tim uveli su mnoge interesantne stvari u industriju: Prema njegovim navodima, prvi su uveli ekrane u sedištima, karte za avione njegove kompanije mogle su da se kupe u njegovim prodavnicama ploča, metalni kusur od prodaje u avionima davali su u humanitarne svrhe...

Da li je sve bilo sjajno u Virdžinu? Ne baš. Bilo je dosta turbulentnih godina u poslovanju zahvaljujući narastajućem broju kompanija i konkurenata, a potom i pandemije korona virusa 2020. Nekoliko puta za sve ove godine dovodilo se i u pitanje poslovanje čitave kompanije. Danas je Virdžin kompanija koja je ""podeljena"": 51 odsto je u vlasništvu matične kompanije, a 49% udela u vlasništvu ima Delta Er Lajns.

Pre godinu dana (19. maja 2024. godine) objavljeno je da oko 200 bivših članova kabinskog osoblja tuži kompaniju zbog nepravednog otkaza tokom procesa otpuštanja koji je usledio nakon pandemije.

Navodi se da je menadžment kompanije zaštitio više od 350 novozaposlenih koji su završili tek jednu nedelju od planiranih 6 nedelja obuke, umesto da zadrže iskusno starije osoblje koje je radilo u kompaniji više od 20 godina.

A Brenson? Eh: on je nakon osnivanja aviokompanije proširio biznis na hotele, železnicu, svemirski turizam... I još mnogo toga. Nedavno je na portalu Aero.rs objavljen i tekst o tome kako je multimilijarder ""ponosan na svoj prvi zeleni preko-okeanski let"" obavljen Boingom 787 uz pomoć SAF-a (ekološki prihvatljivog goriva).

Da li će se zaustaviti na svemu onome što je do sada postigao? Teško. Neki ljudi nemaju vremena za oklevanje, nego za pronalaženje rešenja. A on sam je ne jednom rekao ""ako za 30 sekundi nešto zavolim ili odlučim - to je to."" Probajte: možda je to dobra ideja.

This wasn’t a futuristic concept; it was a glimpse into what’s already possible when innovation meets urgency.

As we face rising temperatures and shrinking natural resources, sustainable fuels have become a vital solution. Unlike fossil fuels, tied to a history of environmental harm, sustainable fuels open the door to a cleaner, low-carbon future. From algae-based biodiesel to hydrogen harvested from renewable energy, these alternatives are transforming industries that once seemed impossible to decarbonize. Yet the shift is more than just technological—it’s a necessary evolution for our economies, ecosystems, and way of life.

What Is Sustainable Fuel?

Sustainable fuel is energy we can rely on without harming the planet. Unlike fossil fuels, which take millions of years to form, sustainable fuels are made from resources that naturally replenish in a short time. These include biofuels from plants, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels created using renewable energy.

What makes these fuels special is their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notes that certain biofuels can significantly lower emissions compared to traditional gasoline. Similarly, hydrogen produced from renewable sources emits only water vapor when used, offering a clean energy alternative.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) emphasizes that to meet global climate goals, the use of low-emission fuels like biofuels and hydrogen needs to double by 2030 and double again by 2050. This shift is crucial for sectors like transportation and industry, where reducing emissions is particularly challenging

Incorporating sustainable fuels into our energy mix isn’t just about the environment; it’s also about energy security and economic resilience. By investing in these alternatives, we can reduce our dependence on imported oil and create new job opportunities in emerging energy sectors.

Examples of Sustainable Fuels

In Brazil, for instance, ethanol derived from sugarcane is blended into gasoline at rates up to 27%, a practice that has been in place since 2015. Similarly, the U.S. incorporates bioethanol and biodiesel into its fuel supply, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

Aviation: The aviation industry is making significant strides with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). A report by The Wall Street Journal states that United Airlines has invested in innovative technologies to produce SAF from carbon dioxide and water, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Air France-KLM has also committed to purchasing up to 25 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2029, aligning with their goal of incorporating 10% SAF by 2030.

Maritime Shipping: Shipping giants like Maersk are leading the charge in maritime decarbonization. Maersk’s vessel, the Ane Maersk, recently completed its maiden voyage powered entirely by green methanol, marking a significant milestone in sustainable shipping. The company has ambitious plans to expand its fleet of methanol-powered ships, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2040.

Electricity Generation

Biogas in Rural India: In rural India, biogas plants are transforming lives by providing clean electricity to thousands of homes. These plants utilize organic waste, such as cow dung, to produce biogas, which can be used for cooking, lighting, and even powering diesel engines. This not only reduces dependence on coal but also improves indoor air quality and health outcomes.

Biomass Power in the UK: The United Kingdom has embraced biomass energy as a renewable source of electricity. Facilities like the Drax Power Station have transitioned from coal to sustainably sourced wood pellets, contributing significantly to the national grid. However, recent analyses suggest that the UK could meet its energy goals without relying heavily on biomass by investing more in wind power and smart energy solutions.

Industrial Use

Hydrogen in Steel Production: The steel industry, traditionally a significant emitter of CO₂, is undergoing a green transformation. In Sweden, the HYBRIT project is pioneering the use of hydrogen to produce fossil-free steel. By replacing coal with hydrogen in the steelmaking process, HYBRIT aims to reduce Sweden’s total carbon dioxide emissions by at least 10%. This groundbreaking initiative has already produced over 5,000 tonnes of hydrogen-reduced iron, with companies like Volvo incorporating it into their products

Domestic Use

Biogas for Cooking in Kenya: In Kenya, biogas digesters are making a significant impact on rural households. By converting animal waste into biogas, families can cook without relying on wood or charcoal, reducing indoor air pollution and deforestation. The Kenya Biogas Programme has been instrumental in providing these systems, improving the quality of life for many, and contributing to environmental conservation.

Environmental Impact: Benefits and Concerns

Benefits

1. Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions

One of the primary advantages of sustainable fuels is their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, biodiesel can significantly lower emissions compared to petroleum diesel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, using biodiesel can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86% compared to conventional diesel. This reduction plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change and improving air quality.

2. Utilization of Waste Products

Sustainable fuels often make use of waste materials, turning potential pollutants into valuable energy sources. For example, converting used cooking oil into biodiesel not only provides a renewable fuel but also reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills. This approach helps in managing waste effectively and reduces methane emissions from decomposing organic matter.

3. Enhanced Energy Security

By diversifying energy sources, sustainable fuels can reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. This diversification enhances national energy security and can lead to more stable energy prices. Countries investing in domestic biofuel production can insulate themselves from global oil market fluctuations.

4. Job Creation

The sustainable fuel industry has become a significant source of employment. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global biofuel sector employed approximately 2.8 million people in 2023. These jobs span various areas, including agriculture, processing, and distribution, contributing to economic development, especially in rural regions.

Concerns

1. Land Use Conflicts

The cultivation of biofuel crops can sometimes compete with food production, raising concerns about food security. Allocating large areas of land for energy crops may displace food crops, potentially driving up food prices and reducing availability. For example, the expansion of biofuel plantations in Indonesia has been linked to deforestation and the displacement of indigenous communities. Such land-use changes can have significant social and environmental consequences.

2. Water Consumption

Producing biofuels, particularly bioethanol and biodiesel, can be water-intensive. The water required for growing feedstock crops and processing them into fuel can strain local water resources, especially in arid regions. A study published by the EPA highlights that increased biofuel production could lead to higher water usage, impacting water availability for other uses.

3. Emissions from Production Processes

While the end-use of sustainable fuels tends to be cleaner, the production processes can generate emissions if not managed properly. For instance, the energy used in cultivating crops, transporting feedstocks, and processing fuels can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Ensuring that these processes utilize renewable energy sources and efficient technologies is crucial to maximizing the environmental benefits of sustainable fuels.

How to Support the Shift to Sustainable Fuel

1. Advocate for Smart Policies

Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of sustainable fuels. The EPA has set ambitious renewable fuel targets for 2023–2025, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance energy security. Additionally, the Clean Fuel Production Credit (§45Z), effective from 2025, offers tax incentives to producers based on the carbon intensity of their fuels.

By supporting such initiatives and urging elected officials to prioritize clean energy policies, we can create a more favorable environment for sustainable fuel development.

2. Make Informed Consumer Choices

As consumers, our choices can drive demand for sustainable fuels. Airlines are increasingly investing in sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) to reduce their carbon footprints. For instance, Air New Zealand has signed an agreement to purchase nine million litres of SAF from Neste, marking its largest SAF deal to date. The fuel, produced at Neste’s Singapore refinery, is expected to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

When booking flights or choosing transportation services, consider companies that prioritize sustainability. Your support encourages more businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices.

3. Encourage Corporate Responsibility

Businesses can significantly impact the transition to sustainable fuels by updating their fleets and energy systems. Many companies are now investing in alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and exploring renewable diesel options to reduce emissions.

If you’re part of a company, advocate for sustainable practices and highlight the long-term benefits of eco-friendly investments. Engaging with suppliers and partners who prioritize sustainability can also amplify your impact.

4. Support Community Initiatives

Local projects play a vital role in promoting sustainable fuels. According to the American Biogas Council, in 2024, the U.S. saw a record investment of over $3 billion in biogas systems, with 125 new projects coming online. These initiatives not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also create jobs and support local economies.

Participating in or supporting local biogas and biodiesel projects can make a tangible difference. Whether it’s through volunteering, investing, or simply spreading the word, community involvement is key to driving change.

No gracias a los motores eléctricos ni a los vuelos con hidrógeno, sino por el avance silencioso, pero estratégico, del SAF: Combustible Sostenible de Aviación (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Colombia, hasta hace poco ausente en esta carrera tecnológica, pero quiere ponerse al frente con una fórmula ambiciosa que combina agroindustria, biotecnología, regulación y alianzas internacionales.

Por primera vez, el país contará con una planta dedicada exclusivamente a producir SAF. La construirá la empresa Bio-D, en sociedad con la firma global LanzaJet, desarrolladora de la tecnología de conversión ""alcohol-to-jet"". Este tipo de producción transforma biomasa en un combustible casi idéntico al Jet A1 que usan hoy todos los aviones del mundo.

El SAF es un biocombustible que se fabrica a partir de materias primas renovables. A diferencia de los combustibles fósiles, el SAF no se extrae del petróleo, sino que se produce mediante procesos bioquímicos o termoquímicos que convierten esta biomasa en hidrocarburos muy similares al combustible convencional de aviación, el Jet A1. Esa similitud es crucial: el SAF puede mezclarse con el combustible tradicional sin alterar los motores ni la infraestructura existente. Por eso se le llama drop-in.

Este combustible puede ser utilizado en mezclas con Jet A1 hasta en un 50 por ciento sin que se requiera modificar motores, tanques o sistemas de distribución. Por esta razón se inserta directamente en la infraestructura existente. Además, cumple con los estándares internacionales de calidad y seguridad establecidos, por lo que es indistinguible en funcionamiento del combustible tradicional.

Existen al menos 11 rutas tecnológicas para su producción. La planta colombiana de Bio-D usará el método ""alcohol-to-jet"", que convierte alcoholes derivados de biomasa en combustible para aviación. Esta ruta ha sido validada internacionalmente y está siendo adoptada por otros países con metas agresivas de descarbonización.

El potencial del SAF no se limita a su origen renovable. Lo que lo hace realmente estratégico es su capacidad de reducir las emisiones netas de gases de efecto invernadero hasta en un 80 por ciento, dependiendo de la materia prima y el proceso de producción. Esto se debe a que el carbono emitido durante el vuelo proviene originalmente de la atmósfera (capturado por las plantas utilizadas como insumo), y no de fuentes fósiles.

Según la IATA y la OACI, el 75 por ciento de la reducción de emisiones del sector aéreo prevista para 2050 provendrá del uso de SAF. En un mundo en donde el transporte aéreo representa cerca del 3 por ciento de las emisiones globales, y en Colombia según Greenpeace es casi el 78 por ciento, esta tecnología podría convertirse en una necesidad.

En Colombia ya se producen pequeñas cantidades de Jet A1 coprocesado con un 1 por ciento de insumos renovables en la refinería de Cartagena gracias a Ecopetrol. Esta mezcla será utilizada por LATAM Airlines Colombia en más de 700 vuelos en aeropuertos de Barranquilla, Medellín y San Andrés. Es un primer paso técnico que valida la capacidad de producir combustibles sostenibles sin afectar el rendimiento operativo.

El plan es escalar. La planta de Bio-D, prevista para 2029-2030, tiene como meta producir 50 millones de galones al año, la mitad del objetivo nacional de 100 millones para 2035. Ecopetrol, por su parte, proyecta producir SAF por coprocesamiento de forma sostenida en Cartagena y desarrollar una planta dedicada en Barrancabermeja. La meta a largo plazo, según la hoja de ruta oficial, es alcanzar 450 millones de galones para 2050, lo que permitiría apoyar hasta el 10 por ciento del consumo nacional y evitar la emisión de 5 millones de toneladas de Co2.

Colombia cuenta con una combinación poco común de factores que hacen viable una industria de SAF: una frontera agrícola amplia, disponibilidad de residuos, experiencia en biocombustibles, infraestructura de refinación, y una geografía estratégica para la conectividad regional. Además, estudios del MIT y Airbus, en alianza con LATAM Airlines, han identificado al país como uno de los de mayor rendimiento potencial por hectárea en producción de SAF.

A esto se suma un ecosistema de cooperación entre sector público y privado que ya ha producido una hoja de ruta técnica, una propuesta de ley con incentivos tributarios, y una serie de pilotos exitosos. La industria nacional de biocombustibles también aporta dos décadas de experiencia que pueden ser aprovechadas para esta transición.

""Estamos en el grupo de los pioneros. Si nos movemos rápido, podremos exportar SAF en el futuro. Pero si esperamos demasiado, otros ocuparán ese lugar en el mercado"", advierte Carolina Rojas, presidenta de Fedebiocombustibles.

El principal obstáculo para masificar el SAF es el costo. Producir una tonelada de este combustible puede costar tres veces más que el Jet A1. Esta brecha solo puede reducirse con economías de escala y con incentivos fiscales que hoy aún no existen en el país.

En ese sentido, cursa en el Congreso un proyecto de ley que busca otorgar al SAF beneficios similares a los de las energías renovables no convencionales. También está en consulta un reglamento técnico del Ministerio de Minas que estandarizará la calidad del combustible producido. Y queda pendiente el diseño de un sistema de certificación y trazabilidad de la huella de carbono que permita exportar el producto.

""No se trata solo de producir. Se trata de certificar, medir, conectar el producto con un mercado global que es muy exigente. Si no hacemos eso bien, el SAF colombiano no será comercializable"", advierte Rojas.

El SAF ya se produce y se consume en Europa, Estados Unidos y Asia. La diferencia está en cuáles países lograrán crear una industria propia y cuáles dependerán de la importación. Colombia está en una posición estratégica para ser proveedor regional. Pero para lograrlo necesita acelerar decisiones políticas, atraer inversión y mantener la cooperación entre los actores del ecosistema.",https://static-uat.cambiocolombia.com/s3fs-public/2025-05/saf.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 16:56:44.479000

The group also discussed the New Dems’ Six Key Priorities for Bipartisan Permitting Reform legislation, which the Coalition released in 2023 and plans to revisit and update for the 119th Congress.

“If we’re serious about finding common ground on building a clean energy economy and advancing real policy, we need to get out of the D.C. bubble and listen. That’s why we’re on the road—meeting with communities, hearing from the people doing the work, and gathering the insight that should shape our decisions,” said Vice-Chair Budzinski. “Today’s event was exactly that: thoughtful, informative, and grounded in real-world experience. It gives us a great path forward for the meaningful change we want to create in Congress. I’m grateful to have been joined by Representatives Bell and Peters—their insight was invaluable and I look forward to taking what we’ve learned back to Washington.”

“In Missouri and across the country, clean energy isn’t just about fighting climate change—it’s about creating good union jobs, sparking regional growth, and revitalizing communities,” said Rep. Bell. “This was a chance to hear directly from folks on the ground who are making that happen. We need smart, commonsense policies that lower energy costs, drive economic growth, and protect our people and our planet.”

“As energy demand skyrockets – leading to higher prices and a less reliable energy system – Congress must make it easier to build the clean energy of the future and an electrical grid that can carry that power to every corner of the country,” said Rep. Peters. “New Dems are going out and meeting with Americans outside of the DC bubble to talk about our vision to lower prices, combat climate change, and build in America.”

indomedia.co -Proyek pengembangan Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi (PLTP) Muara Laboh Unit 2 dan 3 di Sumatera Barat mencatat tonggak penting dengan tercapainya financial close. Proyek strategis nasional ini ditargetkan selesai pada tahun 2027.

Wakil Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM), Yuliot, menyatakan bahwa pencapaian ini merupakan kelanjutan dari penandatanganan Perjanjian Jual Beli Listrik (PJBL) antara PT PLN (Persero) dan PT Supreme Energy Muara Laboh (SEML) pada 16 Desember 2024.

""Salah satu agenda pertemuan bilateral antara Pemerintah Indonesia dan Jepang hari ini adalah di bidang energi, dengan dicapainya financial close untuk PLTP Muara Laboh Unit 2 yang ditargetkan selesai pada 2027,"" ujar Yuliot di Jakarta, Senin, 5 Mei 2025.

Pertemuan bilateral tersebut berlangsung di Kantor Kementerian Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian, membahas berbagai isu strategis termasuk kerja sama menuju transisi energi bersih dan rendah karbon melalui kerangka Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC). Delegasi Indonesia dipimpin oleh Menteri Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian dan Wakil Menteri ESDM, sementara Jepang diwakili oleh mantan Perdana Menteri Fumio Kishida dan anggota House of Representatives Jepang.

""Pertemuan ini menegaskan pentingnya kolaborasi antarnegara dalam mempercepat transisi energi. Pencapaian ini adalah bukti nyata dari kemajuan kerja sama tersebut,"" lanjut Yuliot.

Proyek PLTP Muara Laboh Unit 2 (80 MW) dan Unit 3 (60 MW) didanai oleh PT SEML melalui lembaga keuangan internasional terkemuka, antara lain Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Asian Development Bank (ADB), serta lembaga swasta seperti Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), MUFG Bank, dan The Hyakugo Bank.

Sementara itu, Direktur Jenderal Energi Baru, Terbarukan, dan Konservasi Energi (EBTKE) Kementerian ESDM, Eniya Listiani Dewi, menjelaskan bahwa tarif listrik untuk Unit 2 dan 3 berbeda dari Unit 1 karena sudah mengacu pada ketentuan terbaru.

""Negosiasi Unit 1 dilakukan saat aturan tarif masih lama. Sedangkan Unit 2 dan 3 sudah mengacu pada Perpres 112 Tahun 2022 tentang Percepatan Pengembangan Energi Terbarukan untuk Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik,"" jelas Eniya.

Ia menambahkan, pengembangan Unit 2 dan 3 akan mendorong investasi baru senilai USD992 juta. Selain proyek ini, beberapa inisiatif energi lainnya yang masuk dalam kerangka AZEC mencakup proyek PLTSa Legok Nangka, pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel, PLTP Sarulla, dan proyek jaringan transmisi Jawa–Sumatera. ***

Anggota Komisi XII, Hj. Nevi Zuairina yang ikut dalam kunker itu, menyampaikan sejumlah catatan penting yang menekankan aspek keselamatan, tanggung jawab sosial, serta transisi energi nasional.

Politisi PKS ini mengawali kunjungan dengan memberikan apresiasi terhadap kinerja RU VI Balongan yang telah berhasil memproduksi bahan bakar berkualitas tinggi dan ramah lingkungan seperti Pertamax RON 92 dan Diesel Euro 5. Namun, ia menyoroti bahwa keberhasilan produksi tersebut harus diimbangi dengan komitmen kuat terhadap keselamatan lingkungan dan masyarakat.

“Kilang ini sudah mengalami beberapa kali insiden kebakaran dan ledakan. Ini tidak bisa lagi dianggap sebagai hal wajar. Evaluasi menyeluruh terhadap standar K3 dan relokasi warga yang tinggal di sekitar kilang harus menjadi prioritas nasional,” tegas Nevi.

Terkait dengan pengembangan energi masa depan, Legislator asal Sumbar ini juga mempertanyakan progres pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dan teknologi hidrogen yang tengah digarap Pertamina. Menurutnya, kebijakan transisi energi tidak boleh hanya bersifat simbolik.

“Kami ingin tahu seberapa jauh keterlibatan investor, tantangan teknologi, dan dukungan regulasi dari Kementerian ESDM untuk menjamin bahwa SAF dan hidrogen bukan hanya jargon, tapi benar-benar menjadi alternatif yang siap pakai,” ujarnya.

Dalam pertemuan dengan manajemen PHE ONWJ di Cirebon, Nevi juga memberikan perhatian khusus terhadap penurunan produksi minyak dan gas bumi dari lapangan tua yang dikelola. Ia menanyakan strategi peningkatan produksi di tengah tekanan reservoir, serta pendekatan mitigasi terhadap insiden tumpahan minyak dan emisi karbon.

“Kami ingin memastikan bahwa keberlanjutan operasi tidak mengorbankan lingkungan dan keselamatan kerja,” tambahnya.

Wakil rakyat Sumbar II ini mengharapkan, semua kilang di Indonesia perlu ditinjau kembali dari aspek keamanan, termasuk menyusun ulang tata ruang dan perizinan bagi pemukiman warga di sekitar fasilitas migas.

“Energi kita harus berdaulat, tapi juga harus berkeadilan bagi lingkungan dan masyarakat,” pungkas Nevi Zuairina. (ms/*/ald)",https://mimbarsumbar.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250510-WA0027-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 14:56:44.093110

“สาหร่าย” ทองคำเขียว พืชแห่งอนาคต ภายใต้แนวทางเศรษฐกิจสีน้ำเงิน

By

salika

-

ประเทศไทยมีศักยภาพสูงในการพัฒนา “สาหร่าย” หรือทองคำเขียวของไทย เป็นพืชและอาหารแห่งอนาคต (Future Crop & Future Food) ภายใต้แนวทางเศรษฐกิจสีน้ำเงิน (Blue Economy) โดยใช้เทคโนโลยีสมัยใหม่ผสมผสานภูมิปัญญาไทยยกระดับสู่เกษตรมูลค่าสูง เพิ่มรายได้ประเทศและชุมชน ลดการนำเข้าและตอบโจทย์ความมั่นคงทางอาหาร พร้อมลดปัญหาภาวะโลกร้อนอย่างยั่งยืน

จุดเด่นของการส่งเสริมสาหร่าย คือ

1. ลดการขาดดุลการค้าและเพิ่มมูลค่าสินค้าเกษตร ไทยนำเข้าสาหร่ายติดท็อปเทนของโลก การพัฒนาการเพาะเลี้ยงและแปรรูปในประเทศจะช่วยลดการพึ่งพาต่างประเทศ และสร้างมูลค่าเพิ่มให้สินค้าเกษตร เช่น บะหมี่สาหร่าย อาหารเสริม เครื่องสำอาง และปุ๋ยชีวภาพ .

2. สนับสนุนเป้าหมายความเป็นกลางทางคาร์บอน (Carbon Neutrality ) สาหร่ายช่วยดูดซับ CO₂ ได้มากกว่าไม้บก 5 เท่าและเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของแผนลดก๊าซเรือนกระจกสุทธิเป็นศูนย์ (Net Zero) ภายในปี 2065 สอดคล้องกับทศวรรษวิทยาศาสตร์มหาสมุทรแห่งสหประชาชาติ .

3. ขยายผลสู่ชุมชน 50 จังหวัด ผ่านความร่วมมือของกรมประมง และเครือข่ายวิจัย เช่น ศูนย์ศึกษาการพัฒนาอ่าวคุ้งกระเบน (จันทบุรี) และฟาร์มทะเลตัวอย่าง (เพชรบุรี) เพื่อถ่ายทอดเทคโนโลยีการเพาะเลี้ยงและแปรรูปสู่เกษตรกร

4. ต่อยอดอุตสาหกรรมสีเขียว แปรรูปสาหร่ายเป็นพลาสติกชีวภาพ(Bioplastic) และ น้ำมันชีวภาพ (Biofuel) ลดการใช้พลาสติกจากปิโตรเลียม ซึ่งสอดคล้องกับเทรนด์โลกที่หันมาใช้วัสดุย่อยสลายได้

ทั้งนี้เริ่มมีการพัฒนาสาหร่ายอย่างจริงจังตั้งแต่ปี 2563 ตามนโยบายอาหารแห่งอนาคต (Future Food Policy) ของดร.เฉลิมชัย ศรีอ่อน รัฐมนตรีว่าการกระทรวงเกษตรและสหกรณ์ ซึ่งผมเป็นที่ปรึกษารัฐมนตรีในขณะนั้น รับนโยบายมาส่งเสริมสาหร่ายทะเล (Seaweed) และสาหร่ายน้ำจืด ตั้งแต่การผลิต การวิจัยและพัฒนาสายพันธุ์ การแปรรูปและการตลาด

โดยมอบหมายให้ศูนย์วิจัยและพัฒนาประมงชายฝั่งและศูนย์เพาะเลี้ยงน้ำจืดเร่งเดินหน้าในการรวบรวมพันธุ์ การเพาะเลี้ยงและการเผยแพร่พันธุ์ ดำเนินการในพื้นที่ 51 จังหวัด แบ่งเป็น 23 จังหวัดชายฝั่งทะเลรวมกทม.และอีก 28 จังหวัดโดยความร่วมมือระหว่าง กรมประมง กระทรวงเกษตรฯ. กระทรวง อว. สวทช. ศูนย์ความเป็นเลิศสาหร่าย วว. สภาอุตสาหกรรมแห่งประเทศไทย หอการค้า สภาเอสเอ็มอี. มูลนิธิเวิลด์วิว อินเตอร์เนชั่นแนล มูลนิธิเวิลด์วิว ไครเมตและศูนย์เทคโนโลยีเกษตรและนวัตกรรม (AIC: Agritech and Innovation Center) มีศูนย์วิจัยและพัฒนาประมงชายฝั่งและศูนย์เพาะเลี้ยงน้ำจืดทั่วประเทศเช่นศูนย์ศึกษาการพัฒนาอ่าวคุ้งกระเบน (จันทบุรี) ศูนย์วิจัยและพัฒนาประมงชายฝั่งแหลมผักเบี้ยและฟาร์มทะเลตัวอย่าง (เพชรบุรี) ถ่ายทอดเทคโนโลยีการเพาะเลี้ยงและแปรรูปสู่ฟาร์มเกษตรกร โดยพัฒนาสาหร่ายเป็นผลผลิตและผลิตภัณฑ์ชุมชน (Community based product) สร้างแหล่งอาหารและรายได้ใหม่ให้ประชาชนในท้องถิ่นและเป็นวัตถุดิบป้อนอุตสาหกรรมต่างๆ

ยิ่งกว่านั้นยังมีการพัฒนาสาหร่ายสีเขียวแกมน้ำเงินกว่า 40 ปี โดยคุณเจียมจิตต์ บุญสม ผู้ตั้งชื่อ “สาหร่ายเกลียวทอง” โดยขยายผลเป็น “บุญสมฟาร์ม” ที่อำเภอแม่วาง เชียงใหม่ มีพื้นที่เพาะเลี้ยงสาหร่ายสไปรูลิน่าไม่ต่ำกว่า 40,000 ตารางเมตร รวมถึงศูนย์ความเป็นเลิศด้านสาหร่าย (ALEC) ของสถาบันวิจัยวิทยาศาสตร์และเทคโนโลยีแห่งประเทศไทย (วว.) ร่วมกับปตท.พัฒนาสาหร่ายน้ำจืดมากว่า 20 ปี โดยเฉพาะโครงการน้ำมันชีวภาพ ปุ๋ยชีวภาพอัลจินัว

ปัจจุบันยังมีอีกหลายบริษัทหันมาพัฒนาสาหร่ายเชิงพาณิชย์ เช่น บริษัทบางจากฯ บริษัทผลิตไฟฟ้าราชบุรีโฮลดิ้ง บริษัทล็อกซเล่ย์ บริษัทไทยยูเนี่ยน บริษัทเถ้าแก่น้อย บีจีซี (BGC) และ บริษัท OverDaBlue ซึ่งเป็นสตาร์ทอัพ รวมทั้งโครงการเพาะเลี้ยงสาหร่ายในกระชังของมูลนิธิเวิลด์วิว ไครเมต ร่วมกับชุมชนชาวประมงที่จังหวัดกระบี่ เป็นต้น

สาหร่ายจึงไม่ใช่แค่พืชท้องถิ่น แต่เป็น “ทองคำเขียว” ที่จะพลิกโฉมเกษตร มีบทบาทสำคัญต่ออนาคตของไทยและของโลกในมิติเศรษฐกิจและสิ่งแวดล้อม คือ

1. อุตสาหกรรมอาหาร สาหร่ายใช้ในอุตสาหกรรมอาหารคิดเป็น 77% ของตลาด (ปี2024) โดยเป็นส่วนประกอบในอาหารแปรรูป อาหารเสริม และเครื่องดื่ม ตัวอย่างเช่น สาหร่ายโนริ วากาเมะ และผงสาหร่ายในผลิตภัณฑ์วีแกน

2. อุตสาหกรรมเวชภัณฑ์และเครื่องสำอาง โดยสกัดสารออกฤทธิ์ทางชีวภาพ เช่นฟูคอยแดนและแอลจีเนตสำหรับผลิตภัณฑ์บำรุงผิวและยา

3. ความยั่งยืนสิ่งแวดล้อม สาหร่ายดูดซับก๊าซเรือนกระจกคาร์บอนไดออกไซด์ (CO₂) มากกว่าต้นไม้ 5 เท่า และใช้ทำผลิตภัณฑ์บรรจุภัณฑ์ชีวภาพ (Bio-based Packaging) เช่นบริษัท ZeroCircle ของอินเดีย

4. เชื้อเพลิงชีวภาพ (Biofuel) ความต้องการเชื้อเพลิงสะอาดเพิ่มขึ้น ส่งผลให้สาหร่ายเป็นวัตถุดิบผลิตน้ำมันชีวภาพ พลังงานทางเลือก และน้ำมันอากาศยานแบบยั่งยืน (Sustainable Aviation Fuel : SAF)

ด้วยเหตุนี้รัฐบาลในหลายประเทศสนับสนุนการเพาะเลี้ยงสาหร่ายอย่างจริงจัง เช่น ญี่ปุ่น เกาหลี ประเทศแถบสแกนดิเนเวีย ออสเตรเลีย อเมริกา ไอซ์แลนด์ และล่าสุด อินเดียตั้งเป้าผลิต 1 ล้านตันต่อปีภายในปี 2025

การส่งออกเป็นอีกเป้าหมายสำคัญ เพราะมูลค่าตลาดโลกของสาหร่าย ในปี 2024 สูงถึง 35.35 พันล้านดอลลาร์ (1.5 ล้านล้านบาท) ทั้งตลาดการเพาะเลี้ยงและตลาดสาหร่ายเชิงพาณิชย์ คาดการณ์ปี 2025 จะเพิ่มเป็น 50.03 พันล้านดอลลาร์ (1.6 ล้านล้านบาท) และ 80 พันล้านดอลลาร์ (2.6 ล้านล้านบาท) ในปี 2029 ด้วยอัตราเติบโดปีละกว่า 12.1%.

Continuing with fossil fuel (emitting CO2 leading) is a no go!
Airlines should start paying the higher price for SAF enabling SAF projects to be realized.

An executive from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines indicated sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is about 10x more expensive compared to fossil fuel and that airline industry cannot afford the price difference (or airline customers don't want to pay more). She was right, SAF production at this moment is more expensive than fossil aviation fuel, but she didn't say airline (customers) simply need to pay the higher price (not only KLM) to fight climate change and biodiversity loss. And yes, the result will be airline tickets being more expensive. Continuing with fossil fuel (emitting CO2 leading) is a no go! Airlines should start paying the higher price for SAF enabling SAF projects to be realized. In case they cannot or don't want, in my view they should leave the arena as a colleague technology developer from France told me during the event. There are options to minimize SAF production price. How? By implementing new efficient technologies. An example is GAFT - Sustainable Aviation Fuel Technology, which created a brand-new process to cheaply produce feedstock to substitute or to be supplied together with used cooking oil (or bio-oils) in the so-called HEFA process. They provide a key (there are more keys from others) to deal with foreseen feedstock supply shortages HEFA process. Another option would be using newer innovative technologies which are more efficient than technologies that are presently used. For instance, as Topsoe indicated in their presentation, by deploying new technologies like SOEC and recycling naphtha (a by-product) during FT production processes about 30-35% less electricity is needed for SAF production while about 98% carbon efficiency from the CO2 will be realized. The challenge with the new generation technologies and processes (for SAF as well as other technologies) is not technology. It is offtakers, investors and project developers without sufficient knowledge to understand the new technologies and as a result don't have the appetite to be involved in the first few projects (which definitely will be riskier). But these projects are needed to produce SAF cheaper in due time (consequence: price airline ticket go down and now it won't because the deployment of new technologies is going too slow). Other option to make SAF projects more interesting is Governments to start adding real CO2 penalties in fossil fuel price - including ALL cost airlines contribute to the various disasters Worldwide (consequence: ticket prices will go up), as well the World should start developing SAF projects in countries where conditions are simply best (consequence ticket price going down). At present, EU regulation makes it less attractive for airlines to buy green SAF produced in countries with best conditions, even in case SAF is produced with less CO2 emission compared to the same SAF produced in EU. This is something that should be repaired in the regulations.",https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/c45fy346jw096z9pbphyyhdz7,N,,2025-05-10 12:56:24.549418

Indramayu (10/05) — Dalam Kunjungan Kerja Spesifik Komisi XII DPR RI ke Refinery Unit VI Balongan dan PT Pertamina Hulu Energi Offshore North West Java (PHE ONWJ), anggota Komisi XII dari Fraksi PKS, Nevi Zuairina, menyampaikan sejumlah catatan penting yang menekankan aspek keselamatan, tanggung jawab sosial, serta transisi energi nasional.

Politisi PKS ini mengawali kunjungan dengan memberikan apresiasi terhadap kinerja RU VI Balongan yang telah berhasil memproduksi bahan bakar berkualitas tinggi dan ramah lingkungan seperti Pertamax RON 92 dan Diesel Euro 5. Namun, ia menyoroti bahwa keberhasilan produksi tersebut harus diimbangi dengan komitmen kuat terhadap keselamatan lingkungan dan masyarakat.

“Kilang ini sudah mengalami beberapa kali insiden kebakaran dan ledakan. Ini tidak bisa lagi dianggap sebagai hal wajar. Evaluasi menyeluruh terhadap standar K3 dan relokasi warga yang tinggal di sekitar kilang harus menjadi prioritas nasional,” tegas Nevi.

Terkait dengan pengembangan energi masa depan, Legislator Dunbar ini juga mempertanyakan progres pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dan teknologi hidrogen yang tengah digarap Pertamina. Menurutnya, kebijakan transisi energi tidak boleh hanya bersifat simbolik.

“Kami ingin tahu seberapa jauh keterlibatan investor, tantangan teknologi, dan dukungan regulasi dari Kementerian ESDM untuk menjamin bahwa SAF dan hidrogen bukan hanya jargon, tapi benar-benar menjadi alternatif yang siap pakai,” ujarnya.

Dalam pertemuan dengan manajemen PHE ONWJ di Cirebon, Nevi juga memberikan perhatian khusus terhadap penurunan produksi minyak dan gas bumi dari lapangan tua yang dikelola. Ia menanyakan strategi peningkatan produksi di tengah tekanan reservoir, serta pendekatan mitigasi terhadap insiden tumpahan minyak dan emisi karbon.

“Kami ingin memastikan bahwa keberlanjutan operasi tidak mengorbankan lingkungan dan keselamatan kerja,” tambahnya.

Wakil rakyat Sumbar II ini mengharapkan, semua kilang di Indonesia perlu ditinjau kembali dari aspek keamanan, termasuk menyusun ulang tata ruang dan perizinan bagi pemukiman warga di sekitar fasilitas migas.

The Emirates Group released its 2024-25 Annual Report, achieving new record profit, EBITDA, revenue, and cash balance levels. This outstanding performance places the Emirates Group as the most profitable aviation group globally in the 2024-25 reporting period, with Emirates reporting the best result in its history to become the world’s most profitable airline.

Both Emirates and dnata contributed record revenues in 2024-25, as the Group expanded its operations around the world to meet voracious customer demand for its high-quality products and services.

For the financial year ended 31 March 2025, the Emirates Group reported:

record profit before tax of AED 22.7 billion (US$ 6.2 billion), up 18% from last year

strong cash assets of AED 3.7 billion (US$ 1.0 billion)

The Group declares a dividend of AED 6.0 billion (US$ 1.6 billion) to its owner, the Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD).

This is the first financial year that the UAE corporate tax, enacted in 2023, is applied to the Emirates Group. After accounting for the 9% tax charge, the Group’s profit after tax is AED 20.5 billion (US$ 5.6 billion).

His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates airline and Group said: “It is no accident that Dubai has produced hugely successful global aviation entities including Emirates and dnata. Dubai’s aviation sector has become an influential force on the global stage thanks to visionary leaders, strategic planning, co-ordinated execution, and strong support from our customers, business partners, and all the people of Dubai.

“When the government set up Emirates 40 years ago and we began expanding dnata’s capabilities to support the city’s growth, we had a clear mission - be the best at what we do; and deliver value to Dubai, our stakeholders, and the communities we serve.

“With that in mind, we’ve kept a laser focus on providing great products and services, and we continually invest in technology and talent to increase our competitive edge. We look after our people and our customers, and we work hard to positively impact our communities. We don’t cut corners, and we don’t take shortcuts that put our future at risk for short term gains. By building our business models around these principles and Dubai’s unique strengths, the Emirates Group has thrived and stayed resilient through geo-political and socio-economic challenges over the years.”

HH Sheikh Ahmed added: “For 2024-25, the Emirates Group has raised the bar to set new records for profit, revenue, and cash assets. Through the year, Emirates and dnata were able to move quickly to meet the strong demand for air transport services across markets and win over customers - thanks to our non-stop investments in our people, in building partnerships, and in delivering great products and services.

“I’d like to thank our amazing people at the Emirates Group for achieving another record year, and our customers and partners for their trust and support. My gratitude to Dubai’s visionary leaders HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and his sons HH Sheikh Hamdan and HH Sheikh Maktoum, for their continued leadership and stewardship of Dubai’s strategy, in which the Emirates Group is proud to play a key role.”

In 2024-25, the Group collectively invested AED 14.0 billion (US$ 3.8 billion) in new aircraft, facilities, equipment, companies, and the latest technologies to support its growth plans.

The Group’s total workforce grew by 9% to 121,223 employees, its largest size ever, as Emirates and dnata continued recruitment activity around the world to support its expanding operations and boost its future capabilities.

Commenting on the outlook for 2025-26, Sheikh Ahmed said: “We enter the year ahead with excitement and optimism. Our excellent financial standing enables us to continue building on and scaling up from our successful business models. While some markets are jittery about trade and travel restrictions, volatility is not new in our industry. We simply adapt and navigate around these challenges.

“Emirates will strengthen our network connectivity with the expected delivery of 16 A350s and 4 Boeing 777 freighters in 2025-26, providing much-needed capacity to meet customer demand. Our retrofit programme will continue apace to provide our customers the latest Emirates products and a more consistent experience across our A380, 777 and A350 fleet.

“dnata is on a steady growth path with facility investments coming to fruition in key markets, including the opening of new facilities in Amsterdam, Dubai and Erbil next year which will significantly expand our cargo handling capacity and capabilities.

“Work is already underway at the new Al Maktoum International airport (DWC) and broader development around Dubai South. Our planning teams are working closely with Dubai airports and other entities to design and deliver the future of aviation and the best possible travel experiences.

“We’ve set high targets for ourselves, but I am confident that our talented workforce and Dubai’s winning formula will empower the Emirates Group to forge an even brighter future, and deliver even more value to the people, cities and communities we serve.”

Emirates performance

Emirates’ total passenger and cargo capacity grew 4% to 60.0 billion ATKMs in 2024-25, recovering to near pre-pandemic levels.

During the year, Emirates launched two new destinations - Bogotá and Madagascar; restarted flights to Phnom Penh, Lagos, Adelaide and Edinburgh; and strengthened services to 21 other destinations to meet rising demand. By 31 March, Emirates served 148 cities in 80 countries and territories. Emirates also grew its partnerships to 33 codeshare and 118 interline partners, providing customers smooth access to over 1,750 cities beyond its network.

The first Airbus A350 aircraft joined Emirates’ fleet this year, bringing added capacity for the airline to serve customer demand with its latest products, including the popular Premium Economy Class and a new-generation inflight entertainment system. By 31 March, Emirates had 4 A350s in its fleet flying to Edinburgh, Ahmedabad, Bahrain, Colombo, Kuwait and Mumbai.

With ongoing delays in new aircraft deliveries, Emirates added 99 more aircraft to its retrofit programme which will now see 219 aircraft go through a full cabin refresh at a total investment of US$ 5.0 billion. At 31 March, Emirates’ order book had 314 aircraft pending delivery, including 61 A350s, 205 Boeing 777x, 35 787s, and 13 777Fs.

Total fleet count at the end of March was 260 units, with an average fleet age of 10.7 years.

By strategically deploying capacity to serve surging demand across markets, Emirates’ total revenue for the financial year increased 6% to AED 127.9 billion (US$ 34.9 billion). Currency fluctuations and devaluations in some of the airline’s major markets negatively impacted the airline’s profitability by AED 718 million (US$ 196 million).

Emirates saw a record operating cash flow of AED 40.8 billion (US$ 11.1 billion) in 2024-25, which reflects its strong commercial performance and enables the airline to grow the business going forward.

Total operating costs increased by 4% from last financial year. Fuel and employee cost were the airline’s two biggest cost components in 2024-25, followed by cost of ownership (depreciation and amortisation). Fuel accounted for 31% of operating costs compared to 34% in 2023-24. The airline’s fuel bill decreased slightly to AED 32.6 billion (US$ 8.9 billion) compared to AED 34.2 billion (US$ 9.3 billion) the previous year, as lower average fuel price (down 10%) including hedging gains offset a higher uplift of 5% from increased flying.

With robust appetite for travel across customer segments, the strength of its global network, and strong customer preference for its products, Emirates hit a new record profit after tax of AED 19.1 billion (US$ 5.2 billion), outstripping last year’s AED 17.2 billion (US$ 4.7 billion) result with an exceptional profit margin of 14.9%. This is the best performance in the airline’s history, and in the airline industry for the reporting year 2024-25.

Emirates carried 53.7 million passengers (up 3%) in 2024-25, with seat capacity up by 4%. The airline reports a Passenger Seat Factor of 78.9%, a marginal decline from 79.9% last year. Passenger yield remained consistent at 36.6 fils (10.0 US cents) per Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPKM).

Emirates continued to invest in delivering ever better customer experiences. In addition to a range of inflight service enhancements in 2024-25, Emirates invested AED 63 million in its lounge product, opening two new lounges at London Stansted and Jeddah to bring the total number of dedicated Emirates Lounges globally to 41; and renovated existing facilities in Bangkok and Paris. This is part of a long-standing strategy to provide premium customers with signature experiences at key stations across the network, not only at its hub. The airline also launched its Emirates Chauffeur-Drive Service to Riyadh, expanding this signature service to over 70 cities.

Emirates World, its premium travel retail store, opened in 8 global cities at an investment of AED 34 million, providing a bespoke environment for specialist consultants to serve more customers in person, in their communities.

Emirates SkyCargo delivered an outstanding year, carrying 2.3 million tonnes of goods around the world, up 7% from the previous year as the delivery of 2 new Boeing 777 freighters and 2 wet-leased 747 freighters unlocked capacity to serve surging demand for air transport.

Ably navigating the ongoing challenges in global logistics, the cargo division reported a solid revenue of AED 16.1 billion (US$ 4.4 billion), contributing 13% to Emirates’ total revenue. Cargo yield per Freight Tonne Kilometre (FTKM) increased by 10%, returning to pre-pandemic marketplace levels.

This strong performance reflects Emirates SkyCargo’s ability to win customer preference and serve demand with its specialist logistics solutions, the power and connectivity of Emirates’ global network, Dubai’s world-class intermodal logistics capabilities, and the airline’s ongoing investments in digital technology, infrastructure, and tailored products.

During the year, Emirates added Copenhagen to its freighter network and signed an MoU with Astral Aviation to expand its reach in Africa. Emirates Delivers, an e-Commerce delivery solution, was launched in Saudi Arabia to connect local shoppers with online retailers in the US and UK. As part of its ongoing digitisation push, our cargo division launched eQuote, a digital ‘self-service’ touchpoint that enables customers in 75 countries to request and manage spot quotations anytime, anywhere.

Emirates placed orders for 10 more Boeing 777Fs, a significant investment to strengthen its cargo division’s position at the centre of global trade and logistics. Emirates SkyCargo has 13 freighters on order and expects to operate a fleet of 21 freighters by December 2026.

At the end of March, Emirates’ SkyCargo’s total freighter fleet stood at 10 Boeing 777Fs.

Under Emirates Group companies and subsidiaries, Emirates Flight Catering (EKFC) and MMI/Emirates Leisure Retail (ELR) reported notable results in 2024-25.

EKFC grew revenue from external customers by 11% to AED 1.1 billion (US$ 293 million), uplifting 15.4 million meals during 2024-25 for its 114 airline customers in Dubai. It committed AED 160 million to expand Linencraft’s facility to handle 400 tonnes of laundry per day by 2026, cementing its place as the region’s leading laundry services provider. EKFC also launched its gourmet B2C offering, Foodcraft, to consumers in the UAE.

MMI/ELR posted solid results with revenue growing 6% to AED 3.1 billion (US$ 847 million). During the year, both businesses saw strong customer demand across their portfolio, and extended their footprint with F&B and retail stores opening in 22 new locations, including MMI’s first retail outlet in Sri Lanka.

With a strong cash balance and operating cash flow, Emirates fully met all contracted obligations during 2024-25, including aircraft pre-delivery payments and financing liabilities as they become due, utilising our cash reserves which stood at AED 49.7 billion as of 31 March.

Emirates also fully repaid its US$ 750 million Corporate Bond which was issued in 2013 with a 12-year term. Listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, this bond was the first senior unsecured amortising bond issued by an airline, and the airline’s diligence in honouring the payment schedule further enhances its credit worthiness in global financial markets.

During the year, Emirates continued to deploy simple forward contracts to hedge against Brent crude oil and refining margins; and used long-term interest rate hedges to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations. With significant currency exposure due to its global presence, Emirates continued to manage foreign exchange rate risk through currency options, forward contracts, and natural hedges. Its systematic approach improved cash flow predictability against volatile market shifts, reinforcing financial stability. In 2024-25, the airline’s risk management programme generated savings of AED 1.1 billion (US$ 287 million).

dnata performance

dnata increased its profit before tax by 2% to AED 1.6 billion (US$ 430 million) in 2024-25, with all business divisions reporting a solid performance, and notable contributions from its airport operations and catering and retail divisions.

dnata's total revenue increased by 10% to hit a new record of AED 21.1 billion (US$ 5.8 billion), driven by increased flight and travel activity across the world, particularly in its major markets: Australia, Europe, the UAE, UK, and US.

dnata’s international businesses account for 75% of its revenue, unchanged from the previous year.

Expanding its capabilities and capacity to meet customer needs and its future growth ambitions, dnata’s investments in 2024-25 amounted to AED 579 million (US$ 158 million). Significant investments during the year included: new electric and hybrid ground support equipment for its airport operations as part of its environmental strategy, new catering facilities in Australia, and new cargo facilities in the UAE.

In 2024-25, dnata’s operating costs increased by 10% to AED 19.7 billion (US$ 5.4 billion), in line with expanded operations in its Airport Operations, Catering & Retail, and Travel divisions.

dnata’s cash balance declined by AED 468 million to AED 3.7 billion (US$ 1.0 billion), primarily due to dividend payments to its owner, ICD; plus the funding of investments and debt repayments. The business saw a positive operating cash flow of AED 2.7 billion (US$ 735 million) in 2024-25, reflecting the substantial improvements in revenue.

Revenue from dnata’s Airport Operations, including ground and cargo handling increased to AED 9.9 billion (US$ 2.7 billion).

The number of aircraft turns handled by dnata globally grew by 2% to 794,091; and cargo handled increased by 9% to 3.1 million tonnes, reflecting new contracts won, and increased flight activity by dnata’s airline customers across markets.

This year, dnata’s Airport Operations division launched operations at Rome Fiumicino Airport, after it acquired the remaining 30% stake in Airport Handling to secure full ownership of the Italian ground services provider. Supporting nearly 70,000 flights annually for 22 airline customers, dnata’s new Rome operations nearly doubles its presence in Italy which also includes ground handling teams at two airports in Milan – Malpensa and Linate. During 2024-25, dnata also won a seven-year renewal of its operating licenses in Zürich and Brussels; and added Raleigh-Durham International Airport to its international airport operations network.

On the cargo front, dnata made significant investments to meet growing global demand. In Dubai, dnata Logistics broke ground on a 57,000 m² warehouse in Dubai South, a US$ 27 million investment that will support Dubai’s continued growth as a global logistics hub. In Zürich, dnata’s exclusive lease agreement will see it operate the airport authority’s new, advanced warehouse when it opens in early 2027.

dnata’s Catering & Retail business accounted for AED 7.1 billion (US$ 1.9 billion) of dnata’s revenue, up by 10%. The inflight catering business uplifted 114.0 million meals to airline customers, a 2% decline from last year. During 2024-25, dnata optimised and refocussed its service portfolio on strategic customer segments.

Key customer wins in 2024-25 include: long-term contracts secured with Etihad Airways and British Airways in the USA; and the long-term extension of an agreement for dnata to manage Jordan Flight Catering Company Ltd which delivers world-class culinary services to over 30 airlines in Amman.

Major investments during the year include an AU$ 17 million inflight catering centre at the new Western Sydney International Airport and an expansion at Melbourne Airport to increase production capacity to 25 million meals annually. Both facilities are set to open in 2026

Revenue from dnata’s Travel Services division grew by 11% to AED 3.9 billion (US$ 1.1 billion), with strong contributions from its UK travel business and Imagine Cruising, its cruise holidays business.

Total transaction value (TTV) of travel services sold increased by 9% to AED 9.7 billion (US$ 2.6 billion), reflecting the division’s ability to deliver relevant B2B and B2C travel products across customer segments globally.

In 2024-25, dnata’s travel division continued to enhance its expansive portfolio of products and services to meet the evolving and diverse needs of its customers. In the UAE, dnata Travel relaunched its brand proposition, and made major online and offline investments, including an enhanced booking experience on dnatatravel.com and a vibrant new retail store design. Arabian Adventures introduced new products to cater to the growing number of UAE visitors, including the launch of a premium private dining experience in partnership with Veuve Clicquot; and the opening of The Fort Lisaili, a new multi-experience desert destination in Dubai.

dnata Travel Management onboarded new corporate clients, while dnata Representation Services in Dubai signed six new general sales agent (GSA) contracts with leading international airlines.

Sustainability

During 2024-25, the Group continued to invest and implement initiatives that help reduce its impact on the planet, increase engagement with communities, and develop and reward its people.

Emirates continues to seek opportunities to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) where feasible across its network. During 2024-25, the airline took its first deliveries of SAF at London Heathrow and Singapore. Emirates also joined Germany’s Aviation Initiative for Renewable Energy, which promotes the development and use of renewable aviation fuel.

Tapping on funds earmarked for research in sustainable aviation solutions, Emirates partnered with the Aviation Impact Accelerator at the University of Cambridge, supporting their research in emissions reduction pathways.

Emirates launched a large-scale solar energy project at the Emirates Engineering Centre in Dubai to meet 37% of the centre’s power demand; signed up as strategic partner of the Dubai Reef project which focusses on marine conservation; joined the Move to -15oC global coalition, which aims to reduce energy consumption in the frozen food supply chain; and was the first airline to add donkey hides to its wildlife embargo list after the African Union banned the slaughter of donkeys.

Combining innovative upcycling with social impact, Emirates launched “Aircrafted Kids”, an initiative where seat fabric recovered from the airline’s retrofit programme were made into thousands of durable schoolbags and distributed through NGOs to disadvantaged children around the world to support their education. Emirates also donated 12,000 eyeshades to support teacher training initiatives in the UK for the blind and low vision community.

dnata expanded its fleet of electric and hybrid ground support equipment (GSE) at airports around the world this year, adding electric GPUs in Dubai, electric forklifts in Singapore, and electric tugs in São Paulo. dnata also trialled its first 100% electric catering truck in Prague. During the year, it launched dnata’s ‘Station of Tomorrow’ at Orlando International Airport, featuring a fully electric GSE fleet; and executed its first fully electric pushback operation in Australia.

For its non-electric vehicle fleet, dnata aims to use alternative fuel options to reduce emissions where feasible. In 2024-25, dnata transitioned to a biodiesel blend for all non-electric airside vehicles and GSEs in Dubai; began a trial with ExxonMobil on renewable diesel (R20) in Singapore; and began operating its heavy goods vehicles at London Heathrow with 90% Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO).

During 2024-25, the Group expanded its extensive portfolio of programmes for employee development, training, reward and recognition, and well-being. Highlights include: the opening of Wejhaty, a futuristic one-stop-shop for employees’ HR needs; a bespoke engagement zone tailored to our crew community; an early careers programme and an international scholarship programme for Emiratis; and the enhancement of basic salaries and allowances to balance the rising cost of living in the UAE and across its global network.

Conclusion With these landmark agreements with Neste and World Energy, Singapore Airlines has taken bold and decisive action to secure its position as a leader in aviation sustainability.","Singapore Airlines has taken a bold and decisive step towards a sustainable future by securing groundbreaking agreements with Neste and World Energy to acquire Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and SAF certificates. These landmark deals, announced in the first quarter of 2025, underscore the airline’s commitment to decarbonizing aviation and leading the industry in reducing its carbon footprint. By partnering with Neste for local SAF production and World Energy for emissions reductions, Singapore Airlines is not only advancing its own sustainability goals but also fostering the broader adoption of SAF in the aviation sector, setting a powerful example for airlines worldwide.

In an industry where sustainability is becoming increasingly critical, Singapore Airlines (SIA) has made a bold move by securing landmark agreements with two industry leaders, Neste and World Energy, to advance its decarbonization journey. These partnerships, announced in the first quarter of 2025, not only reinforce the airline’s commitment to achieving a greener future but also highlight its proactive approach to integrating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its operations. This strategic action is set to make a substantial impact on reducing aviation’s carbon footprint while setting a benchmark for other global carriers.

Singapore Airlines’ Bold Strategy for Aviation Sustainability

SIA’s collaboration with Neste and World Energy marks a significant milestone in the airline’s ongoing effort to lead the charge in aviation sustainability. By securing a deal to acquire SAF and SAF certificates, the airline is not only enhancing its environmental credentials but also supporting the broader adoption of low-carbon aviation fuels.

The first key agreement saw Singapore Airlines purchasing 1,000 tonnes of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-eligible neat SAF from Neste, a global leader in renewable fuel production. Produced at Neste’s Singapore refinery, this SAF was blended and uplifted directly at Singapore Changi Airport. This purchase strengthens the country’s SAF ecosystem, helping to ensure that the airport can continue to serve as a key hub for sustainable aviation fuels.

This move is a crucial step in SIA’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with SAF offering a potential reduction of up to 80% in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel. The seamless integration of SAF into existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure makes it a viable solution for airlines looking to mitigate their environmental impact while maintaining operational efficiency.

World Energy Collaboration Drives Further Sustainability

In addition to the partnership with Neste, Singapore Airlines has also reached a strategic agreement with World Energy, a prominent U.S.-based producer of renewable fuels. Through this collaboration, SIA acquired approximately 2,000 tonnes of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of emissions reductions, utilizing the Book & Claim Chain of Custody model. This model allows the airline to claim the environmental benefits of SAF without the physical delivery of the fuel, creating a flexible and scalable approach to sustainability.

By purchasing emissions reductions through World Energy, Singapore Airlines further contributes to its sustainability objectives while simultaneously bolstering the SAF market. The 2,000 tonnes of SAF-related emissions reductions are expected to offset over 9,500 tonnes of CO2 emissions, which further cements the airline’s commitment to carbon reduction. This strategic move underlines the importance of innovative models, such as the Book & Claim system, in enabling the aviation industry to achieve its decarbonization goals.

Green Fuel Forward Campaign Spearheaded by Singapore Airlines

Beyond these strategic fuel agreements, Singapore Airlines is also an active participant in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, an initiative launched by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with Singapore’s GenZero. This campaign aims to increase awareness and understanding of SAF across the Asia-Pacific region, while encouraging airlines, corporations, and governments to adopt and promote SAF as a key solution for the future of aviation.

As part of this campaign, SIA is leading the way in fostering strategic partnerships between regional corporations and airlines, working collectively to enhance the region’s SAF adoption rate. The initiative has the potential to reshape the aviation industry’s sustainability landscape, providing valuable insights into how SAF can be more widely integrated into operations while encouraging a shift toward more sustainable aviation practices.

The Role of SAF in the Future of Aviation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a transformative solution to the aviation industry’s sustainability challenges. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is derived from renewable or waste-derived sources, including plant-based materials, waste oils, and even carbon captured from the atmosphere. This makes SAF an essential component in the broader transition to a sustainable aviation ecosystem, reducing the aviation sector’s reliance on fossil fuels and offering a pathway to achieving long-term carbon neutrality.

While the SAF market is still evolving, it holds immense potential in reshaping the way the aviation industry meets its environmental targets. Singapore Airlines, with its forward-thinking approach and proactive partnerships, is setting an example for other carriers to follow in the global transition to cleaner fuels and greener aviation practices.

Singapore Airlines has taken bold and decisive action in aviation sustainability by securing landmark SAF agreements with Neste and World Energy, advancing its decarbonization goals and setting a strong example for the industry in adopting sustainable aviation fuel.

Conclusion

With these landmark agreements with Neste and World Energy, Singapore Airlines has taken bold and decisive action to secure its position as a leader in aviation sustainability. The airline’s forward-thinking approach to SAF adoption, coupled with its participation in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, sets a powerful example for the aviation industry as a whole.

By reducing over 9,500 tonnes of CO2 emissions through its SAF transactions and fostering regional collaboration on SAF adoption, Singapore Airlines is not just meeting its sustainability commitments but actively pushing the aviation industry toward a cleaner, more sustainable future. These efforts are not only a testament to SIA’s dedication to environmental stewardship but also a reflection of the airline’s ongoing commitment to innovation and leadership in sustainable aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Singapore-Airlines-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 08:56:25.676272

Calumet Inc. (NASDAQ: ) presented its first quarter 2025 financial results on May 9, 2025, highlighting strategic shifts in its renewable fuels business and improved performance across segments. The specialty products and solutions provider reported consolidated Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes of $55.0 million, showing resilience in its core business despite ongoing market challenges in the renewable fuels sector.

The presentation comes as Calumet’s stock closed at $11.87 on May 8, with premarket trading on May 9 showing a 5.05% decline to $11.27, suggesting investor caution about the company’s performance and strategic direction. This follows a challenging fourth quarter where the company missed earnings expectations with an EPS of -$0.47 against a forecast of -$0.21.

Quarterly Performance Highlights

Calumet reported improved year-over-year results across its business segments. The Specialty Products and Solutions (SPS) segment delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $56.3 million, up from $47.2 million in Q1 2024, demonstrating the resilience of the company’s core business. The Performance Brands segment showed an 18% year-over-year improvement with Adjusted EBITDA of $15.8 million compared to $13.4 million in the prior year.

As shown in the following performance summary slide, the Montana/Renewables segment showed significant improvement, posting Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes of $3.3 million compared to a loss of $13.4 million in Q1 2024:

The company’s specialty products business continues to be a stable performer with 23,000 barrels per day of sales volume in the quarter. While specialty products material margin decreased to $57.01 per barrel from $62.90 in the prior year, the company emphasized that operational improvements contributed $1.41 per barrel year-over-year, helping to offset some of the margin pressure.

The following slide illustrates the consistent performance of the Specialty Products and Solutions segment over time:

Strategic Initiatives

The most significant strategic announcement was Calumet’s decision to accelerate its MaxSAF™ expansion, aiming to unlock 120-150 million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) capacity by Q2 2026. Notably, the company has reduced its capital cost estimate for this expansion to $20-$30 million, while maintaining its ultimate goal of 300 million gallons of capacity by 2028.

This strategic pivot is detailed in the following slide, which outlines the revised capacity and cost projections:

The accelerated SAF strategy comes amid signs of recovery in the renewable diesel market. Calumet noted that the Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) is not being met in 2025, with 4.5 billion gallons per year needed to satisfy the 2025 RVO. This market dynamic is creating opportunities for producers like Calumet, as illustrated in the market analysis slide:

The company also highlighted its competitive advantage through dynamic optimization, noting that approximately 60% of Montana Renewables’ shipments were recently shifted to Washington and Oregon markets, demonstrating the flexibility of its operations to respond to market conditions.

Detailed Financial Analysis

Calumet has implemented changes to its financial reporting, now including Tax Attributes with Adjusted EBITDA to better reflect the economic reality of its business. This change is particularly relevant for the Montana Renewables segment, which benefits from production tax credits.

The following slide details these changes to the company’s financial reporting methodology:

The Montana/Renewables segment showed marked improvement, with operating costs at $0.49 per gallon (including $0.67 SG&A). The company noted that its demonstrated SAF production capacity is now ratable, with increased SAF sales expected to commence in late Q2 2025. Management highlighted a potential $1-2 per gallon SAF premium to renewable diesel in the marketplace, which could significantly improve the segment’s profitability.

The segment’s performance metrics are illustrated in this slide:

The Performance Brands segment also delivered strong results, with a focus on commercial excellence driving an 18% year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The company successfully closed the sale of assets related to the industrial portion of the Royal Purple business, which aligns with its portfolio optimization strategy.

Forward-Looking Statements

Calumet emphasized its focus on deleveraging and value creation, highlighting several achievements including the successful funding of a Department of Energy loan, execution of the Royal Purple business sale, and partial redemption of $150 million of 2026 Notes. These efforts aim to strengthen the company’s balance sheet while positioning Montana Renewables for potential monetization.

The company’s deleveraging strategy is summarized in the following slide:

Looking ahead, Calumet appears to be positioning itself to capitalize on the evolving renewable fuels market, particularly in sustainable aviation fuel, while maintaining the strength of its specialty products business. The accelerated MaxSAF expansion represents a strategic pivot that could potentially deliver returns with significantly lower capital investment than previously anticipated.

However, investors should note that the company continues to face challenges, including a substantial debt burden and the need to demonstrate consistent profitability in its renewables segment. The premarket stock decline suggests that the market may be taking a cautious approach to the company’s strategic initiatives and financial performance, despite the positive framing in the presentation.

Rest drew attention to the preservation of the Child Tax Credit, heralded for significantly reducing poverty among children in Minnesota. She asserted, ""This tax bill will be very good for Minnesota. It responds to our modern economy and is the result of months of the Taxes Committee listening to people from across the state, and then taking action on their behalf,"" Senator Rest told the Senate DFL. Detailing the bill's components, Rest emphasized sustainability with incentives for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), potentially elevating Minnesota to the forefront of the SAF industry and stimulating job creation.

The legislation also brings a novel approach to taxing wealthy social media company owners who profit from Minnesotans' data, which until now has been harvested without direct charge. This move is expected to generate substantial revenue for the state while exempting Minnesota taxpayers from footing the bill. Among the many facets of the tax proposal are restitution for defrauded taxpayers, lower property taxes for disabled veterans, and improved tax relief for low-income renters.

Other notable measures include property tax relief targeted at farmers and small resort owners, expanded agricultural homestead eligibility, and the removal of restrictions impacting Minnesota's border cities. Senator Rest explained how the bill would foster new market opportunities for farm products and contribute to the upkeep of rural schools in areas heavily populated by cabin owners.

A Transatlantic Partnership In 2013, Delta Air Lines announced an order for 30 A321ceos and 10 A330-300 s, as Leeham News and Analysis reported.
The A310 fleet may not have lasted long on the Delta flight line, but those A330s are still going strong.
The evolution of Delta Air Lines to what it is now has involved over 40 airlines, with its first international destinations established in 1953.
Bottom Line Delta Air Lines celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2025 with a new partnership with Airbus.","Airbus introduced electronic flight instrument displays in the A310 flight deck, replacing traditional analog dials. The ""glass cockpit"" used six cathode ray tube displays to display flight and navigation information. The A310 was a pioneering airframe in composite material; the -200 introduced new carbon fiber-reinforced plastic in the spoilers, airbrakes, and rudder. Later, the -300 model increased its maximum take-off weight and range thanks to additional fuel tanks, including a tail “trim tank.”

In 1991, Delta Air Lines acquired Airbus A310s from the defunct Pan Am , which would be the first Airbus aircraft to join its fleet. Delta retired nine former Pan Am planes in 1993 and replaced them with new A310-300 s leased from Airbus while returning 12 remaining A310s. The leased Airbus jets wouldn’t last long, but they heralded the coming of a future partnership of epic proportions.

The Fall Of A House

The deregulation of the airlines by the federal government in 1978 allowed them to compete, but it also allowed them to fail, which is exactly what happened with many of them. In the 1970s, Pan Am's service quality deteriorated, and the airline started to lose customers. In 1980, it acquired National Airlines in order to expand its domestic network, but the merger proved to be expensive.

The airline started liquidating its holdings, which included the renowned Pan Am Building in New York and its profitable Pacific routes. Another setback came in 1988 when Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed over Lockerbie, Scotland. Pan American, the nation's top international airline since 1928, ceased operations in December 1991.

Pan Am attempted to revive its transatlantic business with a more modern and efficient Airbus A310 fleet before going out of business in 1991. Delta emerged as a significant transatlantic service provider by purchasing its transatlantic routes. The deal included 45 aircraft, including 21 Pan Am Airbus A310s, the first Airbus aircraft to be added to Delta's fleet.

A Transatlantic Partnership

In 2013, Delta Air Lines announced an order for 30 A321ceos and 10 A330-300 s, as Leeham News and Analysis reported. It was the first Airbus order the American airline giant had made in two decades. When the Gulf War broke out in 1991 and the US airline sector went into an austere period, CEO Ron Allen implemented a cost-cutting measure that removed all A310s. The decision included the new orders before any had even been delivered.

Richard Anderson, Delta's chief executive officer, said at the time:

""This Airbus agreement is another opportunistic fleet transaction for Delta in which we acquire economically efficient, proven-technology aircraft. These A330s and A321s will provide tremendous flexibility for Delta to optimally manage our capacity over the next five years while further improving the flight experience for our customers and returns for our shareholders.“

In 2015, Delta Air Lines would take delivery of A330-300s that featured a 242-ton heavy-weight design. Aerodynamics and engine upgrades would give the variant a higher maximum takeoff weight than any A330 model before it. Wings Magazine reported that Delta specifically procured the jets for its transatlantic routes, quoting Delta Air Lines President Ed Bastian:

“Our new A330s are 20-25 percent more fuel efficient than the 767-300s and 747-400s they replace, and will operate very efficiently on Delta’s long-range routes, our transatlantic routes and in the Pacific – providing great network utility and flexibility.”

The integration of the long-range optimized A330s was announced as a precursor to A350XWB models already in the works. The A310 fleet may not have lasted long on the Delta flight line, but those A330s are still going strong. And just recently, Delta has been taking delivery of a growing number of A350XWB jets fresh from the factory line while ordering even more of them to replace aging Boeing platforms.

Growing Together

Delta currently operates more Airbus aircraft than any other airline, with an additional 200 on order for delivery in the years ahead. Delta rose to become the largest Airbus operator, due in large part to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, which possessed a sizable fleet of Airbus jets. The first airline in North America to fly the Airbus A320 was Northwest.

Since then, Delta has greatly increased the size of its Airbus fleet after the merger, adding models from the A350 , A330, A220 , and A320 families. The evolution of Delta Air Lines to what it is now has involved over 40 airlines, with its first international destinations established in 1953. One of the main reasons for the strength of the Airbus-Delta partnership is due to the maintenance capacity that Delta has developed over the decades, resulting in it now being among the largest engine and airframe service providers in North America and the world.

In January 2024, Christian Scherer, Chief Executive Officer of the Commercial Aircraft business, remarked on the newest Delta Air Lines A350-1000 order:

“We are thankful for Delta’s continued confidence in Airbus’ solutions to meet its fleet needs. Delta was the first U.S. airline to operate the A350-900, and is doing so with great success. Delta now welcomes the A350-1000, which will open even more opportunities for the airline and its customers. We are proud that our aircraft serve the entirety of Delta’s impressive global network as this stellar airline takes fleet efficiency to the next level.”

By The Numbers

The Airbus A310, a condensed version of the Airbus A300 designed for medium- to long-haul flights, was a major aviation milestone. A total of 255 jets were manufactured, with the first A310 delivered to Swissair in 1983. Due to its longer range for transatlantic trips and extra fuel tanks, the A310-300 variant gained popularity among European airlines. The A310 provided effective service for both long-distance and regional routes.

The final deliveries were made in the early 2000s after production ceased in 1998. The A310 was gradually replaced by newer models such as the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767 as airlines looked for more technologically sophisticated and fuel-efficient aircraft. The A310 is still regarded as a significant aviation milestone because of its dependability and adaptability.

Today, the best chance of seeing an A310 is to search for an Ariana Afghan Airlines or Iran Airtour flight. They are the last passenger carriers still flying this unique piece of aviation and Airbus history. Aviationtag.com reports that the final A310 to service destinations in Europe and America was scrapped and, as of 2023, now lies as a stripped-down hulk in the Mojave Desert.

Bottom Line

Delta Air Lines celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2025 with a new partnership with Airbus. Delta has become Airbus’ largest operator. Now under the UpNext program, the two aviation giants will work together toward an innovative future of flying. The partnership explores wing performance, fuel efficiency, superconductivity, advanced aircraft assistance, and other technologies needed for future aircraft.

Delta will offer continuous feedback to refine these technologies through regular technical exchanges, active participation in designing experiments, and observing test runs. Delta will test a new flying technique called ""fello'fly,"" inspired by migrating geese, which can reduce fuel consumption by creating an uplift for the next aircraft. The next flight test phase is planned for the second half of 2025.

Airbus was a founding partner of Delta's Sustainable Skies Lab, which aims to reduce the climate impact of air travel. Airbus has committed to joining the Minnesota SAF Hub, a coalition of stakeholders committed to decarbonizing the airline industry, and a multi-year commitment to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The two companies are working on innovative breakthroughs for a sustainable future of flight, including exploring hydrogen-powered aircraft.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/main-image-16_9-3.png,N,,2025-05-10 07:56:07.267041

Beginning May 7th 2025, passengers aged 18 and over who plan to fly within the US domestically, or visit federal facilities will need a REAL ID.

From what documents you need in order to convert to a REAL ID, what time to avoid the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) for your application, and how to apply for a REAL ID, here is a summary of what you need to know.

What is a REAL ID?

A REAL ID is a driver’s license or identification card which counts as a federally accepted form of ID. These new ID cards are marked with a golden bear and a star, to make checks at TSA or elsewhere easier. You will need one in order to travel via plane domestically within the US.

You will need a REAL ID if you plan to:

Access certain federal facilities

Board Federally regulated commercial aircraft

Enter nuclear power plants

How to apply for a REAL ID:

The first step you will need to undertake in order to gain a REAL ID is to apply online. Homeland Security reported that the online application ‘only takes 9 minutes’ to complete. For this, you will need to have several documents handy. You will need ONE proof of identity, containing your date of birth, and first, middle and last name. This can be anything from:

Proof of citizenship

A valid foreign passport stamped ”processed for I-SS1”

A United States birth certificate

Your valid permanent resident card

A valid United States passport or, passport card

It must present your legal name, date of birth, social security number, two proofs of your permanent residency address and your lawful status.

Next steps

After submitting your online application and receiving a confirmation code, you will need to head to your closest field office or DMV. This is to finish the driver’s license and ID card application process. Be sure to bring along any and all original documents that you included in your online application – along with your confirmation code which you should get shortly thereafter.

Reminder that tests are no longer available at DMV after 4:30pm.

For example, if you are in California, those who do not have a REAL ID but currently hold a passport are able to wait to convert to a REAL ID when your driver’s license is due for renewal.

If you are located in Massachusetts, your driver’s license will indicate whether it already counts as a REAL ID on your driver’s license card by reading ‘NOT FOR FEDERAL ID’, or on the other hand it will show a star in the right-hand corner.

For those in New York, if your New York state license does not show a star or a flag, then your ID is not REAL ID compliant.

What should a European energy security quest look like, and how much should oil and gas feature in such a mission?
How can oil and gas players add value to a broader offshore energy focus on sustainability, safety, and energy security?
These approaches enable the industry to contribute to energy reduction without sacrificing energy security.
Balancing the need for energy security with decarbonization efforts will be key to keeping the offshore oil and gas industry resilient during this ongoing evolution.","As the world is taking steps away from oil and gas to diversify the energy mix with other low-carbon and green sources of supply, while also pursuing more of these resources, Sulzer, a Switzerland-headquartered sustainable flow control innovation player, has pointed out the operators’ need to pursue decarbonization tools to ensure cleaner production and more efficient operations, maximizing productivity and enhancing sustainability to tackle the climate change ticking time bomb and come to grips with energy security challenges.

While oil and gas operators work on cleaning up their act, they keep running into the growing backlash on both sides of the energy spectrum, where fossil fuels are being treated like the plaque on one side and embraced as the key to strengthen energy security on the other side, which also warns about the renewable energy’s current inability to fully replace oil and gas because of its intermittent nature.

During an interview with Murray Wilson, Regional Director (Nordics) at Sulzer, Offshore Energy went on a deep dive into the growing importance of Europe’s energy security and its increasing reliance on the Norwegian oil and gas sector, as it searches for the holy grain of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts, where carbon capture and storage (CCS), alongside other decarbonization offerings in the energy transition toolbox, is seen as the right path to take on the road to strengthening the resilience of the hydrocarbon sector.

Sulzer, which is active in fluid engineering, providing solutions in pumping, mixing, separation, and application technologies for a wide range of industries, including water, oil, gas, chemicals, power, and many more, has also delved into the critical impact of maintenance to minimize downtime and ensure the uninterrupted operation of offshore assets.

OE: The global offshore energy industry is rapidly evolving in response to the energy trilemma conundrum, aiming to tackle not just the double whammy of energy security and sustainability challenges but also the affordability of energy supply amid inflation and rising costs. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and intricacies take things to a whole new level, reshaping the supply and demand flows as new partnerships are forged, laying bare the need for more oil, gas, and LNG within the energy mix of our society. Many industry experts claim that this certainly serves to show the potential perils in advocating energy transition acceleration at the cost of security of supply and the need to keep both in mind while pursuing a new era of low-carbon and clean energy developments. What are your thoughts on this?

Murray Wilson: Energy security is paramount because, without it, our industries and society cannot continue to function efficiently. I believe that we need to ensure a broad portfolio of energy sources. However, it is clear that we need to generate our overall energy requirement in a more sustainable way. Transition to a lower fossil carbon energy mix is something that needs to be carefully phased.

For example, the UK needs to maximise its own resources in a way that allows it to flex its energy mix to smooth energy price fluctuations for its citizens. This means that although we continue to increase national investment in lower-carbon technologies, oil and gas produced from the UK Continental shelf – potentially with reduced emissions through CCU/CCS technologies – should continue to be an important part of our energy mix until we can achieve sufficient energy security and flexibility from alternate non-fossil sources.

OE: Europe, primarily certain members of the European Union (EU), have been upping the net-zero ante by blazing new decarbonization trails on the road to a sustainable future. While European countries work on phasing down their oil and gas production to achieve net-zero goals, the reliability and efficiency of remaining active fields, especially in the North Sea, seem to be of crucial importance. What should a European energy security quest look like, and how much should oil and gas feature in such a mission?

Murray Wilson: Oil and gas will continue to be part of the European energy mix until our energy supply can safely and reliably be provided via non-fossil fuel sources. For example, electrification cannot realistically support the long-haul aviation industry at present, which is driving major investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, the availability of suitable SAF feedstocks is limited, and this is driving the use of blended aviation fuels where SAF is mixed with conventional fuels to meet demand.

In this way, traditional oil and gas production is still a critical part of the energy mix, but the environmental impact is reduced. I believe the North Sea oil and gas industry needs to adopt a similar philosophy. This means recognising that it is currently impossible to completely eliminate its carbon footprint during production, but it can take steps to reduce this as far as practicable through combined energy grids, electrification, and a strong focus on equipment and process efficiency.

OE: Would opening depleted North Sea fields for offshore gas storage be a viable option for European countries to boost their energy security?

Murray Wilson: Opening depleted North Sea fields for offshore gas storage is certainly one of the options that Europe could consider to enhance energy security; however, offshore storage is more expensive, and Europe would be reliant on the integrity and security of supply pipelines to shore.

Onshore storage may be more secure, but may be limited by geographical availability and proximity to population centres. European countries, therefore, will need to carefully balance the costs, logistical challenges, and capacity limitations of all available options when deciding the best approach to bolster energy security.

OE: Norway is continuing to actively pursue further hydrocarbon exploration despite the mature level of its offshore acreage while also searching for ways to bolster its oil and gas production from existing assets with well intervention, digitalization, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, and many other technologies. Will the country continue to play a key role in supplying Europe, and what can other North Sea countries learn from the Norwegian energy sector?

Murray Wilson: Norway will continue to play a key role in supplying Europe, particularly with gas. Norway has consistently taken a long-term view of resource management, which has helped to maximise field life. The country has been a global leader in reducing energy consumption and emissions offshore through projects involving asset electrification, pump and compressor energy efficiency, and smart process control.

Norway’s importance to Europe has increased with the ongoing sanctions against Russian oil exports. As Europe has reduced its reliance on Russian energy sources, Norway has become the top exporter of natural gas to the region, boosting its production by about 8% to meet rising demand. Other North Sea countries can learn from Norway’s strong focus on long-term planning and reducing the carbon footprint of its production.

OE: International energy experts are adamant that oil and gas will remain integral to the energy mix for the foreseeable future; thus, maintaining supply amidst production cessations and aging infrastructure presents a significant challenge, compounded by the need to perform efficiently in an unstable energy market where energy security is paramount. How can oil and gas players add value to a broader offshore energy focus on sustainability, safety, and energy security?

Murray Wilson: Optimising existing equipment to reduce emissions is important. For example, in most offshore oil and gas platforms, equipment has been designed for a specific duty point, but as production tapers in later years, the equipment is not operating at optimum efficiency. Retrofitting older equipment without modifying the existing equipment footprint has the potential to boost efficiency and lower energy consumption.

Enhanced equipment monitoring supports tailored maintenance strategies and optimises equipment uptime and maintenance costs. These approaches enable the industry to contribute to energy reduction without sacrificing energy security.

OE: There is no arguing with the fact that operators stand to benefit on many fronts from reliability by taking advantage of enhanced redundancy, reduced energy costs, decreased production risk, and maintenance workload. What can be done to spruce up oil and gas reliability and overall image in the decarbonization age?

Murray Wilson: Reliability of industrial operations hinges on proactive maintenance. While some operators may cut costs by adjusting maintenance schedules, this can lead to unexpected breakdowns and higher expenses down the line.

A more effective approach is to leverage digital tools that enable predictive maintenance, allowing operators to identify potential issues before they become costly problems. By working closely with the supply chain and using data-driven insights, operators can optimise maintenance schedules, reduce energy consumption, and enhance reliability.

OE: Some, like Saipem, and newcleo, are turning their attention to nuclear energy in a bid to lower emissions by contemplating ways to power offshore oil and gas operations with nuclear. Do you believe that this trend will grow in the future in the North Sea, Europe, and also around the world?

Murray Wilson: The possibility of using nuclear energy to power offshore oil and gas operations has been largely centred on providing power barges that platforms would hook up to and use as the primary energy source, rather than their installed gas turbines. I think this seems a practical solution, but it does present other potential challenges, such as nuclear security, that must be taken into consideration.

Another variable to consider is the life stage of the platform – nuclear energy is more likely to be applicable to early and mid-life platforms, where the cost of electrical infrastructure adaptations generates a net benefit.

OE: Could you tell Offshore Energy’s readers more about the major equipment challenges offshore operators are facing both in the oil and gas arena and within the growing renewables landscape?

Murray Wilson: As production profiles change, there is a need to review the performance and design of older rotating equipment to ensure it meets the latest operational requirements efficiently and its service life is maximised. Meeting these challenges can involve upgrading metallurgy, applying advanced coatings, or even re-engineering internal components to extend service intervals and improve overall efficiency.

The re-rating of assets can play a crucial role in aligning equipment performance with evolving production needs, reducing downtime, maintenance costs, and energy consumption. In the growing renewables sector, the challenges are somewhat different but equally significant.

Integrating cutting-edge technologies and ensuring materials and designs are robust enough to handle the harsh offshore environment are key. Equipment must be optimised for reliability, energy efficiency, and extended service intervals to ensure the success of these renewable projects.

OE: What kind of impact do supply chain issues and long original equipment manufacturer (OEM)/spare parts lead times have on the energy industry, especially the offshore oil and gas segment?

Murray Wilson: Supply chain delays and long lead times for OEM parts have a significant impact on the energy industry. In recent years, many operators have reduced inventory levels to streamline costs, increasing production vulnerability and making them more dependent on OEMs and service providers. As a consequence, the focus is on faster parts production and shorter lead times for critical components.

This is where modern technologies, such as additive manufacturing or reclamation techniques such as laser metal deposition, can make a difference, enabling faster production of parts when they are urgently needed. However, for this to be more widely adopted, the technology must be scaled up and made more cost-effective. Reducing lead times is essential to keep operations running smoothly, as downtime in the offshore sector can lead to substantial financial losses.

OE: How can the supply chain assist oil and gas operators in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and what are some of the most popular clean technologies available today? Are there any such technological advances that you believe will become prominent in the future, even though they may not be as popular now?

Murray Wilson: The supply chain plays a critical role in helping oil and gas operators reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by delivering equipment that is more energy-efficient and that is designed for maximum reliability, leading to extended service intervals. Looking ahead, additive manufacturing has the potential to become even more prominent, as it can reduce waste and enable faster production of customised parts.

As these technologies evolve, they will play an increasingly important role in lowering the emissions footprint. Specialist abrasion-resistant coatings are already prevalent, particularly on high-energy applications, but could be more widely adopted. These do not significantly impact energy reduction in themselves, but by reducing internal wear, they extend equipment life. Therefore, the energy and emissions involved in more frequent interventions are avoided.

OE: How can offshore energy operators come to grips with challenges in retaining and retraining talent, and workforce replacement to future-proof them for work in emerging energy markets while also helping to slash emissions from existing offshore operations?

Murray Wilson: Offshore energy operators can address talent retention and retraining challenges by focusing on cross-training their workforce, ensuring that they are equipped to handle both existing offshore operations and the needs of emerging energy markets. At Sulzer, we encourage our technicians to gain skills in both electrical and mechanical systems.

This prepares them to work not only on current oil and gas equipment but also supports their transition into servicing renewable energy equipment as the industry progresses. We are also supporting exposure to a variety of non-oil and gas equipment with secondments to other service facilities in our UK and Nordics network.

Multi-skilled trainings like these are crucial for future-proofing the workforce, ensuring that companies have the flexibility and expertise to reduce emissions while adapting to the evolving energy landscape.

OE: Would some mild or even comprehensive overhauls of subsea and offshore oil and gas infrastructure be useful in curbing the GHG footprint and putting operators on track to meet net-zero by 2050 goals that most have set, especially in Europe?

Murray Wilson: Mild adaptations are likely to be more practical than comprehensive ones when it comes to curbing the GHG footprint and helping operators reduce their direct emissions. Completely replacing subsea infrastructure or significantly modifying existing platforms is incredibly complex and costly.

For this reason, equipment-centred improvements conducted during normal maintenance operations are more likely to reduce emissions without requiring a full-scale redesign. It is about striking a balance between investment and long-term operational efficiency, particularly as many assets near the end of their operational lifecycle.

OE: How can oil and gas operators achieve the synergy between people, expertise, collaboration, energy efficiency, and innovation?

Murray Wilson: I believe closer long-term cooperation between operators and their maintenance partners is critical in the future. By fostering partnerships and sharing problems and expertise, operators can tap into the technical knowledge and innovation that service providers offer. For instance, sharing asset data on performance or operational problems allows supply chain technical specialists to help solve equipment problems alongside operators.

Optimising maintenance schedules or retrofitting equipment for greater energy efficiency can improve performance, extend service life, and reduce costs. The key is to establish a collaborative approach where all parties are equally invested in delivering better outcomes for operational efficiency.

OE: Can we expect innovative technologies to usher in zero-emission oil and gas energy production, and if so, which technological tools do you believe will have a crucial role in revolutionizing oil and gas operations to such an extent?

Murray Wilson: Zero-emission oil and gas production is achievable, but it will require significant investment, likely limited to new assets due to the cost of modifying existing brownfield sites. Key drivers for reducing emissions include platform electrification, variable speed operation for maximum efficiency, and the integration of advanced control systems.

Carbon capture technologies will play a central role in addressing operational emissions, offering a direct pathway to decarbonizing production processes. When combined with energy-efficient designs, these technologies can dramatically lower the carbon footprint of operations.

Additionally, enhanced data capture and smart analysis tools are transforming maintenance strategies, enabling predictive rather than reactive approaches and reducing emissions caused by inefficiencies. While these innovations bring us closer to zero-emission production, achieving this vision will require careful planning and a long-term commitment to technological advancement.

OE: Thank you for this interview! Are there any other aspects of the offshore oil and gas evolution in the context of the widespread energy security and decarbonization missions that you would like to put the spotlight on as a significant contributor to prolonging the fossil fuel industry’s life?

Murray Wilson: Thank you for the opportunity! To wrap up, I would like to emphasise that the transition to cleaner energy will be a gradual process, and oil and gas will remain a crucial part of the energy mix for years to come. In this context, focusing on greater efficiency, reducing emissions, and implementing smarter and predictive maintenance strategies will be essential to extending the life of industrial assets that currently provide the backbone of safe operational production.

Extending the life of existing offshore assets, while also preparing for the adoption of new energy technologies, will help ensure a smoother energy transition. Balancing the need for energy security with decarbonization efforts will be key to keeping the offshore oil and gas industry resilient during this ongoing evolution.

Six new air traffic control centers also would be built under the plan, and new hardware and software would be standardized across all air traffic facilities.
Duffy quickly said the plan will not involve privatizing the air traffic control system, as Trump had supported in his first term.
But the weaknesses within the air traffic control system have been highlighted for years in hearings before Congress and government reports.
The struggles to keep up with increasing air traffic has been recognized since the 1990s -- long before either Trump or Biden took office.","(AP) -- The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of a U.S. air traffic control system that it said still relies on floppy disks and replacement parts found on eBay and has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of recent deadly plane crashes and technical failures.

The plan calls for six new air traffic control centers, along with an array of technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation's air traffic facilities over the next three or four years, said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

""We use radar from the 1970s,"" said Duffy, who compared the proposal with upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. ""This technology is 50 years old that our controllers use to scan the skies and keep airplanes separated from one another.""

How much it will all cost wasn't immediately revealed. Duffy said he'll work with Congress on the details.

""It's going to be billions, lots of billions,"" he said.

The plan has an aggressive timeline, calling on everything to be finished by 2028 -- although Duffy said it may take another year.

Demands to fix the aging system that handles more than 45,000 daily flights have increased since the midair collision in January between an Army helicopter and a commercial airliner that killed 67 people over Washington, D.C.

That crash -- and a string of other crashes and mishaps -- showed the immediate need for these upgrades, Duffy said in front of airline officials, union leaders and family members of those who died in the crash near Reagan National Airport.

The proposal sets out to add fiber, wireless or satellite technology at more than 4,600 locations, replace 618 radars and more than quadruple the number of airports with systems designed to reduce near misses on runways.

Six new air traffic control centers also would be built under the plan, and new hardware and software would be standardized across all air traffic facilities.

The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week budgeted $12.5 billion to overhaul the system, but that estimate came out before the Transportation Department revealed its plan. Duffy said the final price tag will be higher.

U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, who heads the House transportation committee, called the amount only a ""down payment.""

To build the system quickly, as planned, Duffy said Congress must give the Federal Aviation Administration all the money up front and streamline the permitting process.

""The system we have here? It's not worth saving. I don't need to preserve any of this. It's too old,"" Duffy said.

Trump said Thursday that the plan will revolutionize flying. ""The new equipment is unbelievable what it does,"" he said from the Oval Office. He began to say it may even alleviate the need for pilots before adding, ""In my opinion, you always need pilots. But you wouldn't even have to have pilots.""

The newly revealed proposal appears to have wide support across the aviation industry -- from airline CEOs to the unions representing controllers and pilots -- but this is just the beginning and many details haven't been revealed.

Duffy quickly said the plan will not involve privatizing the air traffic control system, as Trump had supported in his first term.

Following the midair crash near Washington, Trump promised to fix what he called ""an old, broken system"" and to tackle the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers while blaming the previous Biden administration for both problems.

But the weaknesses within the air traffic control system have been highlighted for years in hearings before Congress and government reports. The struggles to keep up with increasing air traffic has been recognized since the 1990s -- long before either Trump or Biden took office.

The Trump administration's overhaul plan will need enough funding to be more effective than previous reform efforts during the last three decades. Already more than $14 billion has been invested in upgrades since 2003 but none have dramatically changed how the system works.

The FAA has been working since the mid-2000s to make upgrades through its NextGen program.

One of the biggest challenges with a massive upgrade is that the FAA must keep the current system operating while developing a new system and then find a way to seamlessly switch over. That's partly why the agency has pursued more gradual improvements in the past.

The shortage of controllers and technical breakdowns came to the forefront in the last two weeks when a radar system briefly failed at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, leading to a wave of flight cancellations and delays.

Without the planned upgrades, those breakdowns will be repeated around the nation, Duffy said. ""Newark has been a prime example of what happens when this old equipment goes down,"" he said.",https://www.dtnpf.com/mydtn-public-core-portlet/assets/images/logo-large.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 05:56:15.688105

Exports to the United States dropped more than 20%, however, as Trump's steep tariff increases took effect.","NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are drifting Friday as Wall Street heads toward the end of an unusually quiet week.

The S&P 500 was up 0.4% in morning trading and on track to erase what had been a small loss for the week. This may be the first week in seven where the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts moves by less than 1.5%, after swinging sharply first on fears about President Donald Trump's trade war and then on hopes that he'll relent on some of his tariffs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86 points, or 0.2%, as of 10 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher.

The big event for the week is likely coming on Saturday, when trading will be closed in financial markets. That's when high-level U.S. and Chinese officials will be meeting in Switzerland for their first talks since Trump launched an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies. The fear among investors and economists is that a recession could hit if the United States doesn't reach trade deals that lower tariffs by enough and quickly enough.

Trump on Friday floated the idea of bringing tariffs on Chinese imports down to 80% from their current 145% rate, but he said it'll be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will be in Switzerland. While that would indeed be a reduction, it would still be high, and Trump's posting on social media caused a brief jolt in financial markets. Futures for U.S. stocks sank immediately.

But markets later calmed as the wait continued for what U.S. and Chinese officials will say after their meeting.

Trump also talked up the potential for more trade deals that could be on the way, following his announcement the day before on an agreement with the United Kingdom.

""Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!"" he said on his Truth Social network.

In the meantime, the flow of earnings reports for the start of the year from companies is slowing but still moving the market.

Lyft rallied 20.3% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell short. The company said it reached the highest weekly ridership levels in its history during the last week of March.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the chip giant known as TSMC, offered an encouraging report after saying its revenue in April leaped 48.1% from a year earlier. That sent its stock that trades in the United States up 1.8%.

Insulet jumped 15.8% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the medical device company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which sells tubeless insulin pump technology, also raised its forecast for an underlying revenue trend for the full year.

They helped offset a 7.5% drop for Expedia. The travel website, which owns Vrbo and Hotels.com, reported a stronger profit than analysts expected, but it also said demand was weaker than it expected during the quarter. It highlighted softer-than-expected demand in the United States, as well as a nearly 30% decline in bookings from Canada to its southern neighbor.

Other travel-related companies, including Hilton and Airbnb, have reported a similar softening in travel demand to the U.S. in their recent earnings reports.

In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.

Stocks rose 0.4% in Hong Kong but fell 0.3% in Shanghai after China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1% annual pace in April. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20%, however, as Trump's steep tariff increases took effect. China is the world's biggest exporter.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.36% from 4.37% late Thursday.

Throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza, the U.N. and other humanitarian groups have been carrying out a massive aid program.","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- A group of American security contractors, ex-military officers and humanitarian aid officials is proposing to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in Gaza based on plans similar to ones designed by Israel.

The Associated Press obtained a proposal from the newly created group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, to implement a new aid distribution system supplanting the current one run by the U.N. and other international aid agencies. The U.N. and aid groups have rejected Israel's moves to control aid distribution.

It was not immediately clear if the proposal from the new group, which is registered in Geneva, would ease those concerns.

Israel has blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for 10 weeks, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians. It has said it won't allow aid back in until a system is in place that gives it control over distribution.

The 14-page proposal circulated this week among aid groups and U.N. officials lays out plans similar to ones Israel has been discussing privately for weeks with international aid groups. The proposal reveals for the first time plans to create the foundation and names the people leading it.

A U.N. official said last week that Israel's plans would ""weaponize aid"" by placing restrictions on who is eligible to receive it.

Aid workers have also criticized the plans, which would centralize distribution at four hubs under the protection of private security contractors. They say the plans could not possibly meet the needs of Gaza's large and desperate population, and that they would forcibly displace large numbers of Palestinians by driving them to move nearer to the aid.

Under the new group's proposal, Palestinians would receive pre-packaged rations, potable water, hygiene kits, blankets, and other supplies at the distribution hubs. The group said it wants to partner with the U.N. and international aid groups in handing out their supplies.

A U.S. official confirmed the authenticity of the proposal and said the former director of the U.N. World Food Program, David Beasley, is the lead choice to run GHF. The proposal could still be revised and Beasley's role is not confirmed, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to detail plans that have not been made public.

Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina, didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Israel accuses Hamas and other militants of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N and aid workers deny there is significant diversion, saying the U.N. strictly monitors distribution.

When contacted Thursday for comment about GHF's proposal, Israeli officials did not immediately respond.

U.S. backing for the foundation

The Trump administration supports the new group's proposal, said a person involved in it. The person said GHF would work ""within the confines"" set by Israel on aid but would be ""independent and committed to humanitarian principles"" -- a nod to U.N. concerns. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan not yet made public.

""This is a new approach with one focus: Get help to people. Right now,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce.

Ahead of his first trip to the Middle East this week, U.S. President Donald Trump said ""a lot of talk"" was going on about Gaza and that his administration will soon have more to say about a new proposal. This may include a new push for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, the release of hostages and an influx of aid to Palestinians.

Aryeh Lightstone, a senior member of U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff's team, was involved in briefing U.N. agencies and aid groups about the foundation as they gathered in Geneva on Thursday, according to two humanitarian workers briefed on the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment to the media.

Who's involved?

GHF's proposal names a 10-member leadership team that includes former senior American military officers, business executives and officials from aid groups. At least two of them have ties to private security companies.

Beasley is listed among them, but the proposal says his role is still ""to be finalized."" Beasley is also a senior advisor to Fogbow, a private U.S. firm that participated in the short-lived project delivering aid to Gaza by sea via a U.S. military-built pier.

The AP contacted people listed in the proposal to confirm their participation. Only one responded, saying he was ""not on the board."" The person involved in planning said the list was still in flux.

How would it work?

According to the proposal, GHF would initially set up four distribution sites, each serving 300,000 people. That would cover about half of Gaza's population. The system would be scaled up to meet the needs of 2 million people. But the proposal does not give a timeframe. Aid workers warn that food is rapidly running out in Gaza under Israel's blockade.

The GHF proposal said subcontractors will use armored vehicles to transport supplies from the Gaza border to distribution sites, where they will also provide security. It said the aim is to deter criminal gangs or militants from redirecting aid.

It did not specify who would provide security but said it could include personnel who previously worked in the Netzarim Corridor, an Israeli-held zone cutting off northern Gaza. A private security company, Safe Reach Solutions, has operated in the corridor.

GHF said people will get assistance based on need with no eligibility requirements. This appears to differ from proposals floated by Israel. Aid workers say Israel has said it intends to vet aid recipients and screen them using facial recognition.

What do aid groups say?

Throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza, the U.N. and other humanitarian groups have been carrying out a massive aid program. They have trucked in supplies and distributed them across the territory, going as close as possible to where Palestinians were located.

What has chiefly hampered the system, aid workers have said, are Israeli military operations and restrictions on movement, as well as the low amount of aid allowed to enter even before the blockade. Convoys have also been attacked by criminal groups stealing aid, and hungry Palestinians have sometimes taken supplies from trucks.

Aid workers contacted by the AP cast doubt whether GHF would meet humanitarian requirements for neutrality and independence.

Shaina Low, communications adviser for Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the main organizations in Gaza, said aid groups are concerned the plan will be used ""to advance military and political goals.""

By forcing the population to relocate around aid hubs, the system would ""depopulate entire parts of Gaza"" and could be used to potentially expel the population, she said.

""They are framing (the plan) to fix the problem that doesn't really exist,"" she said, referring to Israel's contention that it must prevent Hamas from taking aid.

The use of private security companies has also alarmed humanitarian workers. While it's common for private security firms to operate in conflict zones, they have to respect humanitarian law and at a minimum be fully vetted and monitored, said Jamie Williamson, executive director for the International Code of Conduct Association.

Tamara Alrifai, communications director for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which has led the aid effort it Gaza, said the plan was logistically unworkable.

She said the foundation does not appear able to match the current infrastructure needed to distribute food and address other humanitarian needs.

Alrifai called it ""a very dangerous precedent"" for countries to use ""full siege as a tactic of war"" to force the abandonment of ""existing aid structures and the entire international system that exists and is recognized and start creating a new system.""",https://www.dtnpf.com/mydtn-public-core-portlet/assets/images/logo-large.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 07:56:16.990470

Total exports from China rose 8.1% last month from a year earlier, much faster than the 2% pace most economists had been expecting. That was much slower than the 12.4% year-on-year increase in March. Imports fell 0.2% in April from the year before.

Shipments to the U.S. sank 21% in dollar terms as Trump's tariffs on most Chinese exports rose to as high as 145%. With Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods at 125%, business between the two biggest economies has grown increasingly uncertain.

China's imports from the U.S. dropped more than 13% from a year earlier, while its politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States was nearly $20.5 billion in April, down from about $27.2 billion a year earlier.

In the first four months of the year, China's exports to the United States fell 2.5% from a year earlier, while imports from the U.S. fell 4.7%.

A potential break in the tariffs stalemate could come as soon as this weekend. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior trade officials are due to meet with Chinese officials in Geneva on Saturday. But Beijing and Washington are at odds over a raft of issues, including colliding strategic interests that will may impede progress in the talks.

Some of the punitive tariffs, including Beijing's retaliatory 125% tariffs on U.S. exports, could be rolled back, but a full reversal is unlikely, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.

""This means China's exports to the U.S. are set for further declines over the coming months, not all of which will be offset by increased trade with other countries. We still expect export growth to turn negative later this year,"" Huang said.

Whatever the outcome of those discussions, the rapid increase in Chinese exports to other countries reflects a restructuring that began years ago but has gained momentum as Trump has raised barriers to exporting to the U.S.

Global manufacturers have been looking for alternatives to a near total reliance on manufacturing in China after disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for more diverse options.

The need for more versatile supply chains grew more apparent as Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese exports during his first term in office. Most of those remained during former President Joe Biden's term.

Exports to the United States accounted for about a tenth of China's total exports in April and the U.S. is still China's largest single-country market. But the European Union and Southeast Asia are larger regional export markets.

Trade with a broader grouping, the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which does not include the United States, is still bigger. And exports to countries participating in China's ""Belt and Road Initiative,"" a vast network of Beijing-supported infrastructure projects, are bigger still.

In the first four months of the year, exports to the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 11.5% from a year earlier, and those to Latin America also climbed 11.5%. Shipments to India jumped nearly 16% by value, and exports to Africa surged 15%.

Some of the fastest growth was in Asia, reflecting moves by Chinese and other manufacturers to diversify their supply chains outside of the Chinese mainland. Most notable were exports to Vietnam, which jumped 18% year-on-year. Exports to Thailand were up 20%.

Back in China, preliminary data have shown a sharp decline in shipping and other trade activity. Earlier this week, Beijing announced a barrage of measures meant to counter the impact of the trade war on its economy, which was already struggling to regain momentum after the pandemic and a lengthy downturn in its housing sector.",https://www.dtnpf.com/mydtn-public-core-portlet/assets/images/logo-large.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 05:56:22.744729

""And so I just never imagined that we would have an American pope, and I have great confidence that Pope Leo will do a wonderful job of navigating that,"" he said.
Vatican News said Leo is the first Augustinian pope.","VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope Leo XIV, history's first North American pope, celebrated his first Mass as pontiff on Friday, presiding in the Sistine Chapel with the cardinals who elected him to succeed Pope Francis and follow in his social justice-minded footsteps.

Wearing white vestments, Leo processed into the Sistine Chapel and blessed the cardinals as he approached the altar and Michelangelo's ""The Last Judgment"" behind it. He delivered the opening prayers and hymns in Latin, and women read the initial Scripture readings.

Addressing the cardinals in English, he said ""you have called me to carry the cross and to be blessed"" and asked for their help to spread the Catholic faith. It was the first time Leo made public remarks in English, after he spoke in Italian and Spanish only in his first comments from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday.

Leo, the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost, was elected Thursday afternoon as the 267th pope, overcoming the traditional prohibition against a pope from the United States.

In his first appearance to the world Thursday evening, the 69-year-old wore the traditional red cape of the papacy -- which Francis had eschewed on his election in 2013 -- suggesting a return to some degree of rule-following after Francis' unorthodox pontificate.

But in naming himself Leo, after the 19th century social justice reformer pope and referring to some of Francis' priorities, the new pope could also have wanted to signal a strong line of continuity: Another Leo in church history was Brother Leo, the 13th-century friar who was a great companion to St. Francis of Assisi, the late pope's namesake.

""Together, we must try to find out how to be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges, establishes dialogue, that's always open to receive -- like on this piazza with open arms -- to be able to receive everybody that needs our charity, our presence, dialogue and love,"" Leo said in near-perfect Italian in his first comments to the world.

Francis had his eye on the new pope

Francis, the first Latin American pope, clearly had his eye on Prevost and in many ways saw him as his heir apparent. He sent Prevost, who had spent years as a missionary in Peru, to take over a complicated diocese there in 2014. Francis then brought Prevost to the Vatican in 2023 to head of the Vatican's powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which vets bishop nominations around the world and is one of the most important jobs in church governance.

Earlier this year, Francis elevated Prevost into the senior ranks of cardinals, giving him prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals had.

There had long been a taboo on a U.S. pope, given America's superpower status in the secular world. But Prevost prevailed, perhaps because he's also a Peruvian citizen and had lived for two decades in Peru, first as a missionary and then as bishop.

Since arriving in Rome, Prevost had kept a low public profile but was well-known to the men who count, and respected by those who worked with him. Significantly, he presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms Francis made, when he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the pope.

In a 2023 interview with Vatican News, the then-cardinal said the women had enriched the process and reaffirmed the need for the laity to have a greater role in the church.

""Even the bishops of Peru called him the saint, the Saint of the North, and he had time for everyone,"" said the Rev. Alexander Lam, an Augustinian friar from Peru who knows the new pope.

Reactions to a North American

The crowd in St. Peter's Square erupted in cheers Thursday when white smoke poured out of the Sistine Chapel shortly after 6 p.m. on the second day of the conclave. Waving flags from around the world, tens of thousands of people were surprised an hour later when the senior cardinal deacon announced the winner was Prevost.

U.S. President Donald Trump said it was ""such an honor for our country"" for the new pope to be American. The president added that ""we're a little bit surprised and we're happy.""

Prevost has shared criticism of the Trump administration 's migration policies: In past social media posts, Prevost shared articles criticizing Vice President JD Vance's justification of the administration's mass deportation plans.

An Augustinian pope

The last pope to take the name Leo was Leo XIII, an Italian who led the church from 1878 to 1903. That Leo softened the church's confrontational stance toward modernity, especially science and politics, and laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought. His most famous encyclical, Rerum Novarum of 1891, addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the beginning of the industrial revolution and was highlighted by the Vatican in explaining the new pope's choice of name.

That Leo also had close ties to the Augustinian order: He rebuilt an ancient Augustinian church and convent near his hometown of Carpineto, outside Rome, which is still in use by the new pope's order today.

Vatican watchers said Prevost's decision to name himself Leo was particularly significant given the previous Leo's legacy of social justice and reform, suggesting continuity with some of Francis' chief concerns. Specifically, Leo cited one of Francis' key priorities of making the Catholic Church more attentive to lay people and inclusive, a process known as synodality.

""He is continuing a lot of Francis' ministry,'' said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, the chair of religious studies at Manhattan University in the Bronx. But she also said his election could send a message to the U.S. church, which has been badly divided between conservatives and progressives, with much of the right-wing opposition to Francis coming from there.

""I think it is going to be exciting to see a different kind of American Catholicism in Rome,"" Imperatori-Lee said.

Leo said in a 2023 interview with Vatican News that the polarization in the church was a wound that needed to be healed.

""Divisions and polemics in the church do not help anything. We bishops especially must accelerate this movement towards unity, towards communion in the church,"" he said.

Archbishop Bernard Hebda, of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, told reporters he never thought he would see an American pope, given the questions of how he would navigate dealing with a U.S. president, especially someone like Trump.

""And so I just never imagined that we would have an American pope, and I have great confidence that Pope Leo will do a wonderful job of navigating that,"" he said.

Leo's brother, John Prevost, was so shocked that his brother had been elected pope that he missed several phone calls from Leo during an interview Thursday with The Associated Press. He called the pope back and Leo told him he wasn't interested in being part of the interview.

John Prevost described his brother, a fan of Wordle, as being very concerned for the poor and those who don't have a voice. He said he expects him to be a ""second Pope Francis.""

""He's not going to be real far left and he's not going to be real far right,"" he added. ""Kind of right down the middle.""

Looking ahead

In his first hours as pope, Leo went back to his old apartment in the Sant'Uffizio Palace to see colleagues, according to selfies posted to social media. Vatican Media also showed him in the moments after his election praying at a kneeler in the Pauline Chapel before emerging on the loggia.

On Sunday, he is to deliver his first noon blessing from the loggia of St. Peter's and attend an audience with the media on Monday in the Vatican auditorium, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.

Beyond that, he has a possible first foreign trip at the end of May: Francis had been invited to travel to Turkey to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea, a landmark event in Christian history and an important moment in Catholic-Orthodox relations.

The new pope was formerly the prior general, or leader, of the Order of St. Augustine, which was formed in the 13th century as a community of ""mendicant"" friars -- dedicated to poverty, service and evangelization. Vatican News said Leo is the first Augustinian pope.

In Peru, he is known as the saintly missionary who waded through mud after torrential rains flooded the region, bringing help to needy people, and as the bishop who spearheaded the lifesaving purchase of oxygen production plants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""He has no problem fixing a broken-down truck until it runs,"" said Janinna Sesa, who met Prevost while she worked for the church's Caritas charity.",https://www.dtnpf.com/mydtn-public-core-portlet/assets/images/logo-large.jpg,N,,2025-05-10 08:56:44.915548

Air France—KLM’s Flying Blue is changing how it rolls over excess XPs (its version of Tier Points), which will affect my account next membership year beginning on July 1.

The problem is that I would lose close to 200 XPs if I don’t reach 900 XPs by June 30th, as I currently have 801 sitting on my account.

These XPs determine your program status. If you have had Platinum status continuously for 10 years, you will have it for life (yours or the program’s).

If I can get exactly 900 XPs (or slightly more), I will then have 7 years and only 3 Platinum qualification years left (900 XPs are needed, but a maximum of 300 per year).

I need to get to South America next week, so I was looking again at AeroMexico fares ex-Europe. These usually allow you to use KLM and Air France-operated flights over the Atlantic on AM code.

I looked at some destinations in Northern South America (Lima and Bogota), but the latter was not considered long-haul, per Flying Blue.

Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel Redemption:

Barcelona (BCN) – Amsterdam (AMS) = 15 XPs

Amsterdam (AMS) – Mexico City (MEX) = 36 XPs

Mexico City (MEX) – Lima (LIM) = 24 XPS

XPs Earned = 75

XP’s earned from SAS flights = 20

Current XP Balance = 801

Forward Looking XP Balance = 896 XPs

The AM ticket also earns, perhaps, around 20K Flying Blue miles.

Air France and KLM sell SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) credits, and I thought I could buy some to get the last four remaining XPs.

But!

Québec, Canada, May 8th, 2025 - Alder Renewables and Bioénergie AE Côte-Nord are proud to announce Project Avance, a strategic partnership to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from sawmill residues in Port-Cartier, Québec. This new project will establish one of the first biomass-to-SAF production facilities in North America.

""Project Avance represents a pivotal moment in sustainable aviation,"" said Darren Fuller, Chief Commercial Officer, Alder Renewables. ""By converting underutilized and sustainably sourced forest residuals into high-value renewable fuels, we're creating a solution that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Our technology creates a novel viable pathway to help aviation meet its ambitious decarbonization goals, maximizes optionality for our refiners, and supports job growth in regional Québec communities.""

Project Avance will deploy Alder Renewables' proprietary technology to convert bio-oil currently produced at the Port-Cartier Bioénergie AECN plant which is a joint venture between sawmill operator Arbec Forest Products and integrated forestry operations company Groupe Rémabec. The project will demonstrate the entire pathway from certified sustainable forest residuals into low-carbon Alder Renewable Crude (ARC), which will then be refined into SAF — and other low carbon transportation fuels. Production is expected to begin in 2027.

This new project embodies Canada and Québec's commitments to developing innovative clean energy solutions from forest residues and will create high-paying jobs in the sustainable energy sector. It leverages existing forestry infrastructure and aligns with Canada's Aviation Action Plan, which calls for 1 billion liters of SAF by 2030.

""This partnership is another important step forward for Arbec Forest Products and Groupe Rémabec’s vision and strategic plan to transform the forestry industry. Project Avance will be located at Arbec Lumber’s integrated plant, which currently supports sustainable technologies to produce both renewable fuel oil and biochar,"" said Serge Mercier, CPA, President of Bioénergie AECN. ""Our facility in Port-Cartier already converts forest and sawmill residuals into bio-oil renewable products — Project Avance will take this to the next level. The technology that we will utilize with our friends at Alder Renewables has the potential for full commercial deployment across Québec's forest regions, creating new revenue streams for a legacy industry, and helping to decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate sectors: aviation.""

The project team is currently working to secure additional support from both the Canadian federal and Québec provincial governments. Project Avance is expected to become an innovation hub for SAF development, offering testing and certification capabilities for other renewable fuel technologies and establishing Québec as a leader in sustainable aviation solutions.

We aim to become one of the most cost-competitive producers of green hydrogen, green ammonia, and other green molecules in the world”.
AM Green’s target is to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Green Ammonia, Green Hydrogen, Green Chemicals and biofuels and to set up related technology partnerships and services through its various business verticals which are housed in the subsidiaries of AM Green.
AM Green will house production of green chemicals, green hydrogen, and biofuels.
This output will be equivalent to 1 MTPA of green hydrogen, representing one-fifth of India’s target for green hydrogen production and 10% of Europe’s target for green hydrogen imports.","In what would be one of the world’s largest renewable energy contracts, Coal India Limited (CIL), plans to supply 4500 MW of carbon-free energy, in phased manner, to upcoming green ammonia facilities of AM Green. It would be through a combination of solar and wind whose capacities CIL aims to set up on pan India basis. This initiative aligns with India’s national goal of achieving a cleaner energy mix and transition towards net-zero emissions.

A formal non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU), for long-term supply and sourcing of renewable energy, was inked on 7th May between the two entities.

While the solar power capacity would be to the tune of 2500 MW to 3000 MW, wind is expected to account between 1500 MW and 2000 MW at an estimated total outlay of around Rs. 25,000 Crores. Potential sites for wind projects will be explored in the southern states of the county. And, for solar plants in the sunny states like Gujarat and Rajasthan.

AM Green will integrate the two renewable sources supplied by CIL with pumped hydro storage to ensure a steady supply of green energy to AM Green facilities.

“While coal remains our mainstay in meeting India’s expanding energy needs in the near term, our plans include a proactive role in building a greener and more sustainable future. This is in consonance with our commitment to become country’s integrated energy provider” said P M Prasad, CIL’s Chairman.

AM Green promoted by the founders of Greenko, one of India’s leading energy transition solutions providers, targets to produce 5 million tons per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia by 2030. This equals approximately 1 MTPA of green hydrogen and represents a fifth of India’s target for green hydrogen production under the National Green Hydrogen Mission.

Anil Chalamalasetty, Founder of the Hyderabad based Greenko Group & AM Green, said, “We are delighted to partner with CIL on one of the world’s largest carbon-free, renewable energy supply contracts. We aim to become one of the most cost-competitive producers of green hydrogen, green ammonia, and other green molecules in the world”.

The agreement was signed by Sudarsan Bora, GM (E&M) representing CIL while his counterpart from AM Green was Shatanshu Agrawal, Sr. Vice President – Business Development. Present were P M Prasad, Chairman, CIL, Mukesh Choudhary, Director (Marketing) CIL and Anil Kumar, GM (MM & Solar) CIL.

About AM Green: AM Green is promoted by founders of Greenko Group, which is among India’s leading renewable energy conglomerates. Greenko Group has experience in building, owning and operating renewable assets and is in the process of constructing mega closed loop pumped storage assets which will enable supply of round the clock power at a very competitive rate. The founders have established AM Green as a new energy transition platform. AM Green’s target is to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Green Ammonia, Green Hydrogen, Green Chemicals and biofuels and to set up related technology partnerships and services through its various business verticals which are housed in the subsidiaries of AM Green. AM Green will house production of green chemicals, green hydrogen, and biofuels. AM Green is committed to producing green ammonia at scale across multiple locations in India. Goal is to reach 5 MTPA of green ammonia capacity by 2030, which will directly contribute to India’s net-zero targets, while simultaneously supporting OECD markets in their decarbonization efforts. This output will be equivalent to 1 MTPA of green hydrogen, representing one-fifth of India’s target for green hydrogen production and 10% of Europe’s target for green hydrogen imports.",https://cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-09-at-9.59.18-AM.jpeg,N,,2025-05-10 10:57:00.890063

Developed by Swedish hospitality group ESS, the 154-room resort is a design-forward, chef-driven property located just 30 minutes from Copenhagen.

Rox Resort has tapped Spik Studios, ESS Group’s in-house creative arm, to design the interiors. Their past work includes properties such as Fýri Resort in Hemsedal, Jacy’z in Gothenburg and Maryhill Estate in Skåne. At Rox Resort, Spik Studios has layered mirrored surfaces, chalk-painted walls and velvet tones with East-meets-West references: chinoiserie-lined firewood alcoves, rattan lighting and burnished brass details. No two rooms are the same.

F&B outlets at Rox Resort include The Dirty Sichuan Steakhouse, where British fare meets the nuances of Sichuan cuisine; the Dumpling Bar, an all-day poolside venue; a rooftop pool bar; Birdcage bar; a lobby bar; and a hidden cocktail nook inside the Fire Room.

Wellness is central to the Rox experience, too. Guests will find three heated rooftop pools (one indoors), a full-service spa and a high-performance fitness club. For recreation, the resort features two padel courts, golf simulators, a five-a-side football field, indoor games and nine meeting rooms designed for creative collaboration.

Located at the edge of Denmark’s windswept coastline, Rox Resort is also a gateway to its natural and cultural wonders. Concierge-curated escapes include UNESCO-listed Stevns Klint and the newly listed Borgring Vikingborg. Mercedes rentals and custom itineraries are available for guests looking to explore Denmark. Excursions include visits to the Viking Ship Museum, the Forest Tower, Køge Mini Village and local microbreweries.

May 9, 2025

BY Katie Schroeder

Seventy years after its founding by Raphael Katzen, the company that bears his name remains committed to his core tenets: integrity, objectivity and excellence.

Robert Eickelberger, Katzen’s vice president business development, explains that the company’s founder was a pioneer in the ethanol space.

A chemical process design, engineering and consulting firm, most of the company’s work over the last 35 years has been ethanol-related. “We have vast experience in many biochemicals and some of this [experience] helped us become who we are now,” Eickelberger says.

David Lococo, president and CEO of Katzen, has been with the company for over 30 years. He aims to build on the foundation of customized process design, close client partnerships and industry collaboration. “Dr. Katzen created a remarkably resilient business model, and my goal is to preserve that foundation while expanding our capabilities so that we can deliver to the industry more effectively into the future,” he says. “We have a strong vision of biotechnology being a key driver for the sustainability of our planet.”

Industry Pioneer

Katzen began his career developing processes for paper pulp production and acid hydrolysis processes to convert biomass into useful products like plastics and biochemicals. During World War II, he led the team that designed and started the United States’ first commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant that converted wood waste into ethanol.

In 1954, Katzen expanded the sole proprietorship he founded the year before, bringing on additional consultants to meet growing demand. The business was incorporated the following year as Raphael Katzen Associates International Inc. (RKAII)—later shortened to Katzen. The company developed and introduced a myriad of technologies still used in the ethanol industry today. In the 1980s, RKAII designed the first simultaneous saccharification fermentation (SSF) system, which later became the industry standard for batch fermentation. The company also brought high-temperature jet cooking to commercial ethanol production and implemented the first commercial molecular sieve dehydration technology, just to name a few.

The SSF process was first implemented at South Point Ethanol in South Point, Ohio, in 1980. Eickelberger explains that, at the time, the 60 MMgy South Point plant was the world’s largest known motor fuel-grade ethanol facility.

High-temperature cooking was a breakthrough for ethanol producers’ yields, explains Ethan Campbell, lead process engineer with Katzen. The process allowed more starch conversion by keeping the temperature high enough that bacteria, which would consume the sugars instead of the yeast, were unable to survive. The design recovers some of the energy used to achieve those high temps by flash cooling the slurry. According to Campbell, killing the bacteria without antibiotics was vital for Katzen’s European market, where the use of antibiotics in ethanol production is strictly regulated.

As biotechnology has progressed, yeast and enzymes are able to achieve even higher levels of conversion efficiency. In response, Katzen engineers adapted their process designs to capitalize on these enhanced biological capabilities. “We had to make substantial adjustments,” Campbell explains. “The available steam pressure was significantly lower than we typically design for, which ruled out high-temperature cooking as an option. This challenge drove a complete rethinking of our plant-wide energy integration strategy and led us to develop an entirely new low-temperature cooking process.”

The company takes a vendor agnostic approach, working with whichever enzyme supplier the client prefers. With the help of enzyme providers, Katzen engineers tailor a unique enzyme and yeast combination system optimized to fit the producer’s specific feedstock. Campbell explains that this collaboration “gives our clients the best opportunity for commercial success.” Katzen’s design precisely controls cook temperatures to provide an optimal environment for enzymes to do their work.

A Customized Approach

On-site logistics and customer input differentiate Katzen’s plant designs from other engineering firms, explains Campbell. The company takes a custom approach, working closely with the plant owners on decision-making to determine process specifications and select vendors. “We have a good understanding from beginning to end what the customer sensitivities are, site logistics that guide the way that we layout our equipment—it guides the way that we design our control schemes,” Campbell says. “Some things that we add into our designs on paper, the mass and energy balance is completely unaffected. But we know that having this extra line here or having these valves arranged in a different way makes it way easier to start up [or shut down].”

Katzen’s engineers take an inquisitive approach when starting a project, seeking to understand their customers’ goals. “We’re always asking questions about … their project drivers and how we can customize a design to their specific location, their specific needs and to give them a competitive advantage,” he says.

Seeking to give their clients a bespoke ethanol facility makes each Katzen designed facility unique in its own way. “It’s never a cookie cutter design,” Campbell says. “Our designs are continually adapted to accommodate different feedstocks, climates, plant logistics and utilities constraints around the world. Because the same people doing the design work in Cincinnati often travel to the plant site overseeing construction and startup, we are able to see operator pain points first-hand and implement those insights in future projects.”

Campbell emphasizes Katzen’s commitment to honest and fair estimates of process yields. Ethanol plants will not produce their highest volume with new operators, he explains. Because of this, the company gives customers a modest estimate for the plant’s production capability, ensuring that the number given can be achieved on day one. As the operators become more experienced, Campbell expects the facility’s yield could increase by 15% and energy usage reduce by around 10% to 15%. “We don’t want to over promise and under deliver; we would rather somebody go in eyes wide open,” he says.

The company’s Lean team enables a close relationship with customers throughout the design process. “We are a group of lifelong learners and teachers—that’s how we view ourselves,” Eickelberger says. “We learn through research and industry relationships, literature and our empirical experience.” Often the same people who meet with a client for sales discussions and initial introductions will also be there sharing champagne to celebrate the plant’s completion. Katzen’s staff makeup demonstrates its dedication to process engineering—about 60% are engineers, 25% handle business operations and the remaining 15% provide technical support. Lococo plans to add staff to the team to maximize the company’s ability to simultaneously handle more projects, while preserving the work-life balance of its engineers.

Powering Diversification

Katzen uses innovation to help producers access new markets, empowering them to maximize their competitive edge. The company’s Very High Quality (VHQ) distillation system enables ethanol producers to diversify by producing an ultra-pure true neutral spirit.

The first full VHQ system was installed at Golden Triangle Energy in Craig, Missouri, in 2007. Since then, it has been installed in 11 facilities worldwide. VHQ produces a true neutral spirit with less than one part per million of impurities and no detectable organoleptic properties. Because the alcohol produced has no smell or flavor, it has buyers from a variety of industries, including food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, personal care, cosmetics and more. One use for VHQ’s alcohol is as an additive for wine companies that need to increase their beverages’ alcohol content.

The system can also be dialed in for production of pharmaceutical-grade alcohol, which can be sold as an ingredient in cosmetics, solvents, printing inks and more.

Campbell explains that VHQ distillation can be implemented as either a bolt-on addition or integrated system, enabling the production of super high-quality alcohol alongside fuel-grade alcohol. The feed is an intermediate stream from the fuel ethanol process, and the congener draws are recycled into the fuel-grade product. The system can also be tuned to produce various specifications of potable and industrial alcohols.

International Impact

Lococo says Katzen did not participate much in the U.S. ethanol boom in the 2000s. “The U.S. market at the time prioritized speed, uniformity and zero perceived risk,” he says. “Producers wanted the plants built fast, identical to one another, and with minimal customization. That copy-and-paste model was just not our forte.”

Europe’s ethanol boom was happening at a similar time, and Katzen’s customized approach fit that market’s needs well. According to Lococo, the company provided the process technology for around half the plants that make up Europe’s ethanol industry. Designing facilities in Europe gave the company experience adapting to new and different challenges around the world, such as different code requirements, feedstocks and grades of alcohol.

Experience and knowledge gained in the European market furthered Katzen’s worldwide exposure and evolved into designing projects in over 40 countries around the world, including Australia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Canada and more. The company’s engineers are always looking for ways to continuously improve, explains Eickelberger, adding Katzen has enhanced plants with its own designs, as well as those designed by other process engineering firms. One such expansion during 2024 at an Inpasa Agroindustrial facility located in Sinop, Mato Grosso, Brazil, resulted in the creation of the world’s largest grain-based dry mill ethanol plant with a yield of 550 MMgy.

Continuous Innovation

Lococo and his team continue pursuing new ways to help the ethanol industry move forward. Technologies such as chemical upgrading, which Campbell and Lococo call “ethanol-to-x,” could turn fuel-grade ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel or even convert CO2 into methanol. Lococo is enthusiastic about these new innovations and revenue streams, but explains that Katzen wants to assess the commercial viability of these technologies before committing to implementation.

“We will continue to develop those technologies as they come along, but we’re not in the business of promoting a non-commercially viable technology,” he says. “We’re happy to work with partners who want to explore or do independent testing. But we’re also truth tellers in the industry. We don’t want to see failures. It’s not good for the industry as a whole. It’s not good for our clients and it’s not good for Katzen to have a technological failure.” Instead, the company wants to partner with innovators that possess pathways with a high likelihood for financial success, helping them move toward commercial viability, Lococo explains.

This tenet of careful development comes from Katzen himself, according to Lococo. While the company is not afraid to engage with and advance new technologies, doing it responsibly is paramount. “We’ve always operated under the premise that proven technology should be the foundation for advancing new ideas. We never take a risk without making sure our clients fully understand the challenges associated with … some aspect of the project,” he says. “And generally, we work closely with them to mitigate those risks—whether through lab testing, pilot trials or other validation processes.”

Another encouraging trend that Lococo recognizes is the shift toward more sustainable processes and advanced biotechnology. Katzen sees greater interest in driving energy usage down and increasing efficiency. Lococo points out that energy usage in the U.S. ethanol industry back in the 1980s was double the energy per gallon used at European ethanol plants in the 2000s, and that figure has halved again over the last 20 years. “It’s amazing,” he continues. “I mean, it’s really quite an advancement.”

Keeping pace with the industry’s advancement demands a workforce capable of engaging with a growing number of producers. For Lococo, investing in the ethanol industry’s future means investing in the next generation. “We are excited for the future,” he says. “We’re excited about the technology, focused on growth, and we’re investing heavily in our people to make our business model sustainable. We think we have a really good approach to technology development and engineering that’s delivered results around the world. And I want that legacy to continue.”
