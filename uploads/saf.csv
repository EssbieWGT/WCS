The test, conducted on December 30, 2025, clears the enhanced stage for induction into upcoming SSLV flight missions and strengthens India’s launch-on-demand capability.

Successful Static Firing at Sriharikota

According to “Indian Space Research Organisation”, the static ground test of the improved SS3 motor was carried out at the Solid Motor Static Test Facility of the “Satish Dhawan Space Centre”. The motor was fired for 108 seconds, with all performance parameters closely matching pre-test predictions. The SS3 stage is the uppermost solid stage of SSLV and is critical for imparting the required velocity to place satellites into orbit.

Key Design Upgrades and Payload Gain

A major enhancement in the upgraded SS3 motor is the introduction of a carbon-epoxy composite motor case, replacing the earlier configuration. This redesign has significantly reduced the inert mass of the stage, resulting in a payload gain of about 90 kg for the SSLV. The third stage alone delivers velocities of up to 4 km per second. Additional improvements have been made to the igniter and nozzle systems to enhance efficiency, robustness, and overall performance margins while retaining reliability.

Advanced Control and Monitoring Systems

During the test, the SS3 motor was instrumented with around 233 sensors to monitor pressure, thrust, temperature, vibration, and the behaviour of control electronics and actuators. Nozzle control is achieved through a fault-tolerant electro-mechanical actuation system supported by low-power control electronics. Isro stated that these upgrades collectively strengthen operational efficiency and mission assurance for future SSLV launches.

Imporatnt Facts for Exams

SSLV is a three-stage, all-solid launch vehicle designed for rapid launch readiness.

The SS3 is the uppermost stage and provides up to 4 km/s velocity.

Carbon-epoxy composite motor cases reduce inert mass and increase payload.

Sriharikota hosts India’s primary launch and solid motor test facilities.

Boost to Indigenous Manufacturing and Capacity

The high-strength carbon filament-wound motor case was developed at the Composites Entity of the “Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre”, while casting of the solid motor was carried out at SDSC facilities. The test follows Isro’s recent expansion of solid motor production infrastructure, including new facilities at Sriharikota, a second ammonium perchlorate production line at Alwaye, and commissioning of an indigenous 10-tonne vertical mixer. These developments reinforce India’s capacity for large-scale, reliable solid motor production and support both national missions and private space start-ups.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/logopeg.jpg?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-01 02:11:56.125415

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.
Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.
Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.
Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to have doubled in 2025 but will continue to account for less than one per cent of global jet fuel consumption, according to new estimates released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.

However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with production rising to 2.4m tonnes.

Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.

At current price levels, the SAF premium is expected to translate into an additional $3.6bn in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

IATA said the estimated SAF output for 2025 represents a downward revision from earlier forecasts, citing a lack of policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacity.

At the same time, SAF prices exceed those of fossil-based jet fuel by around a factor of two, and by up to five times in markets where mandates apply, the association said.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that “SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry”.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” he said, adding that if the objective was to increase SAF production and support aviation decarbonisation, regulators needed to “learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work”.

Against this backdrop, IATA was sharply critical of SAF mandates introduced in the European Union and the United Kingdom, arguing that they have failed to accelerate production while significantly increasing costs for airlines.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation framework has pushed costs higher amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.

Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to the extent that airlines are paying up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, IATA said, without guaranteed supply or consistent documentation.

In the UK, the SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the financial burden.

As a result, airlines paid a cumulative premium of $2.9bn for the limited 1.9m tonnes of SAF available in 2025, according to IATA.

Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Walsh said, noting that while the European Commission’s recent Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) announcement was a step forward, it lacked a clear timeline.

Turning to the impact on airline climate commitments, IATA warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production capacity would force many carriers to review their targets.

“Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments,” Walsh said, adding that SAF was “not being produced in sufficient amounts” to enable airlines to achieve those ambitions. He said the commitments had been made in good faith but “simply cannot be delivered”.

Looking ahead, IATA cautioned against repeating the same policy mistakes as mandates for synthetic aviation fuels, or e-SAF, approach in the UK in 2028 and in the EU in 2030.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.

Without strong production incentives rather than mandates, IATA said supply would fall short of targets.

Under the current policy framework, compliance costs could rise to as much as €29bn by 2032 if targets are not met, which the association said was likely.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist said that “Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.”

She said regulators must “course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down”, adding that mandates had “done just the opposite” and that it was “outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates”.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/airplane-air-travel-aviation-aeroplane-flying.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 01:11:53.902841

Clean fuel, net-zero aviation, climate tech – Gevo is trying to sit right in the middle of all of it. The promise: turn crops and waste into low-carbon jet fuel and gasoline that can help airlines and big brands hit their climate goals. The reality: a tiny company, a volatile stock, and a whole lot of risk.

Before you smash that buy button on your trading app, let’s talk receipts: social clout, stock performance, real business moves, and how it stacks up against the competition.

The Hype is Real: Gevo Inc on TikTok and Beyond

On social, Gevo is not Tesla-level famous, but in green energy and penny stock circles, it pops up a lot. You’ll see it on:

Fintok creators breaking down “next-gen aviation fuel plays”

Reddit threads debating whether it’s a “future multi-bagger or zero”

YouTube deep dives on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stocks

The vibe: high-risk, high-speculation. This is not a safe boomer stock. It’s the kind people either brag about catching early or rant about after a painful dip.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Gevo a game-changer or a potential total flop? Real talk, it’s somewhere in the middle. Here are the three big things you need to understand before you even think about touching this stock.

1. The Big Pitch: Net-Zero Fuel For Jets And Trucks

Gevo’s core flex is this: take things like corn and other feedstocks, run them through its tech, and turn them into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low-carbon gasoline and diesel. The goal is to make fuel that can drop into existing engines but comes with a much lower carbon footprint.

Why this matters: Airlines, shipping, and logistics giants are under massive pressure to hit climate targets. Governments and regulators are tightening rules, and brands want to brag about climate wins. If Gevo can reliably supply low-carbon fuel at scale and at a competitive cost, it plugs into a huge market.

The catch: Building and running these plants is insanely capital intensive. It’s not an app. It’s hard engineering, big construction, and long timelines. That means delays, cost overruns, and funding risk are always lurking.

2. The Deals: Long-Term Contracts… If They Actually Play Out

One reason people get hyped on Gevo: it has signed multiple offtake agreements (long-term deals) with airlines and big buyers who say they’ll take future volumes of Gevo’s low-carbon fuels.

That sounds bullish, but here’s the twist:

These contracts often depend on Gevo building out enough production capacity.

Timelines can be delayed by permits, funding, tech ramp-up, or market conditions.

Not all announced deals are guaranteed to turn into full cash flow.

Translation: The pipeline looks impressive on slides, but investors are still waiting for meaningful, consistent revenue to catch up with the promises.

3. The Risk Profile: Volatile, Dilutive, And Not For Tourists

Price performance has been a roller coaster. GEVO has had moments of insane spikes when climate policy or airline news hits, followed by brutal pullbacks. Over a longer window, the stock has struggled to hold onto its highest levels and has traded much lower than past peaks.

Because it’s a small-cap clean-tech play, Gevo often needs to raise more money to fund its projects. That can mean share dilution – new shares issued, existing shareholders get diluted, and the price can get pressured. If you hate watching your position swing double digits in a week, this stock will stress you out.

Gevo Inc vs. The Competition

Gevo is not the only one trying to own the sustainable aviation fuel story. Its main clout war is with other companies working on low-carbon fuels and SAF.

Who It’s Up Against

Other SAF and renewable fuel players that already have larger scale or deeper backing.

Big oil and energy companies pivoting into green fuel with serious money and infrastructure.

Alternative climate plays like EVs, batteries, and hydrogen, which compete for investor attention.

In terms of brand clout, some rivals and bigger energy brands win because they’re more established and have more visible commercial-scale plants already operating. But Gevo still gets a lot of niche attention because it’s pure-play, high-upside if it works, and trades like a classic speculative story stock.

So who wins the clout war?

For stability and scale: Larger, more diversified players take the W.

For raw hype and moonshot energy: Gevo still pulls eyeballs in the penny/green growth crowd.

If you want a steadier climate exposure, Gevo is probably not your first pick. If you’re chasing asymmetric upside and can mentally handle the chaos, that’s where Gevo sits.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s answer the only question you actually care about: Is it worth the hype?

Gevo is NOT a safe, passive long-term sleep-well-at-night stock. It’s a speculative climate-tech bet that could pay off big if everything lines up – funding, construction, execution, policy, and customer adoption – or bleed out slowly if those pieces don’t come together.

Here’s the real talk breakdown:

Must-have? Only if you fully understand that this is high-risk and you treat it like a speculative side play, not the core of your portfolio.

Game-changer? The tech and vision absolutely could be game-changing for aviation and low-carbon fuels. The business still has to prove it can scale and generate strong, sustainable cash flow.

Price drop opportunity? Dips can look tempting, but timing this kind of stock is brutal. It can always go lower than you think.

If you’re the type who YOLOs into trending names just because they’re viral, this is a drop until you’ve done serious homework. If you’re a climate-tech nerd willing to hold through chaos and understand that this could go very right or very wrong, then it’s a cautious, highly speculative cop – with small sizing only.

Either way, if you jump in, you’re signing up for a ride. No autopilot here.

The Business Side: GEVO

Here’s the quick company context you need before you start flexing your positions on social:

Ticker: GEVO

ISIN: US3743964062

Sector: Clean energy / low-carbon fuels / sustainable aviation fuel

“Projects like this are crucial to helping to reduce global carbon emissions, while creating jobs and growing our economy,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “And when we welcome projects like this, it continues to position Nova Scotia as a leader in climate change action, innovation and the global clean energy transformation.”

The company will need a second environmental assessment approval for its second phase – a proposed wind energy and solar farm and a transmission line to supply renewable energy for fuel production.

The company expects the project will create about 1,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to 80 jobs during its operation (expected to end in 2081) and direct and indirect economic benefits for local businesses, communities and residents.

The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health. The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.

Quick Facts:

The company would create a new market for Nova Scotia’s oversupply of biomass from forestry activity, including wood chips and bark that are the byproduct of silviculture, harvesting and sawmilling.

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change – the province's environmental regulator – uses the Environment Act and is guided by science and evidence when reviewing environmental assessment requests.

If a project is approved, the regulator typically includes terms and conditions which are designed to ensure the environment and people remain protected throughout the life of the project, while also allowing viable, safe and responsible development to take place.

The Department's inspection, compliance and enforcement staff ensure companies comply with the terms and conditions of their various approvals; in 2024, they conducted about 6,400 inspections to ensure companies were complying with Nova Scotia’s environmental rules and laws.

Hemp growers and retailers in Texas breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a state ban on hemp-based THC products but those in the industry are again concerned after Congress passed a bill banning all hemp-derived THC currently on the market.

Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said the legislation is already having a negative impact on the industry.

""Farmers who grew hemp that was harvested in October are now having problems selling their products on the marketplace,"" Miller reported. ""Prices had dropped, some places by 40 percent. Given the uncertainty farmers don’t know whether to plant seeds in the ground, this spring – they have to make decisions now.""

The Texas hemp industry contributes more than $5 billion to the state’s economy and has created more than 53,000 jobs.

The national ban is scheduled to go into effect in November of next year but last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for cannabis to be rescheduled as a Schedule III substance. It also calls for regulators to work on legal exceptions for some hemp-based products.

Miller pointed out growers see the executive order as a lifeline but admitted the industry needs more regulations and will work with lawmakers over the next 11 months to make changes.

""So that farmers can make their decision and fully have enough time to develop a regulatory framework to replace the ban,"" Miller explained. ""We’re working with members of Congress to introduce and hopefully pass bills that would crack down (on) the bad actors, would robustly regulate hemp products.""

Miller stressed they support drafting new legislation to replace the total ban with regulations requiring good manufacturing practices, truth in labeling, bans on synthetic THC and strong measures to keep products out of the hands of children.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-12-31 13:56:32.337395

The project is called Fello’fly and its goal is to optimize routes using the aerodynamic ascent created by an aircraft flying in front. This method will help reducing fuel consumption, cutting emissions and helping airlines save some money.

They believe that air companies could spend less money on combustion if they could copy how migratory birds fly together. Airbus states that they can reduce fuel in long-haul destinations without changing or modifying their existing planes.

They propose to take advantage of the dynamics of airflow, which is similar to the “slipstream” effect—like they do in Formula 1.

Fello’fly: A pairing flights concept

For this concept you need two planes; one will be leading, and while it flies, it leaves a wake behind, that creates a slight support upwards. The second aircraft can then “ride” that flow to improve efficiency, thanks to the energy it recovers from the first plane’s wake.

Airbus has already done a few trials with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic to validate that the concept works and it’s actually doable in a safe manner, with precision and respecting all regulations.

According to BFM Business, the company executed 8 flights over the North Atlantic between September and October 2025. And these tests demonstrated that it was possible to guide two planes to a precise meeting point (“Rendez-vous”) while keeping the designated distance by the air control.

This could redice up to 5% of fuel requirements in long flights if it is done for commercial flights, according to the air company. Eventually reducing CO₂ too.

What the trials confirm—and what they don’t

When Fello’fly uses the wake the leading plane leaves, this reduces the need to push, and burned fuel. The potential benefit (up to 5% in saving fuel) is still relevant because of rising costs and increasing climate pressure. However, the total impact is more limited than that with all the challenges in structure, like the high cost of cleaner fuels, the shortage of new aircraft and the constant growth of air traffic.

Airbus projects that there will be about 8 billion passengers by 2040—higher than the 4.5 billion in 2019; meaning more flights, and a larger global fleet.

A study by Transport & Environment shows that the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will grow; but, even if the SAF reaches 42% as required by European standards, the sector would burn as much fossil kerosene in 2049 as it did in 2023.

Efficiency in the air—and less fossil fuels

For passengers and airlines, Fello’fly aims for slightly more efficient long-haul flights, with fewer emissions and potential operational savings without changing planes.

And overall, it is a solution that could be implemented in today’s commercial flights without changing much for the customers. It might not fix the whole fuel consumption issue, but it could help to reduce the use of it.

We will still need cleaner fuels, more efficient floats and a better management of traffic growth. But what this air company is doing, it is still very important, because is not about one method, or another; it’s about finding solutions, that together will contribute to a greener and less expensive way to fly.

Airbus’ concept, with the bird-inspired training, the advancement of SAF and technological improvements backed up by big airplane companies, has already shown interesting results. However, the data shows that, even with ambitious SAF quotas, the sector will continue to face a major challenge to reduce the use of fossil kerosene at the rhythm that the industry is asking for it.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Airbus-tests-aircraft.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 14:57:18.485516

The agreement centers on Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel program and relies on its existing global supply infrastructure, integrating the fuel into airport distribution systems where Cathay operates passenger and cargo flights.

Under the agreement, Neste is delivering blended SAF for Cathay Pacific flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the European Union and Los Angeles International Airport in the United States. In Asia-Pacific, Neste is supplying SAF at Singapore Changi Airport for Air Hong Kong, the cargo airline owned by the Cathay Group. In each location, the SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied through standard airport fueling systems.

Cathay Pacific says the agreement supports its broader decarbonization strategy by expanding access to SAF across its network. “Partnering with Neste represents a key step toward our shared vision of decarbonizing air transport,” says Kristof Van Passel, Head of Procurement Operations and Sustainability, Cathay Pacific. “This collaboration is part of our multifaceted strategy to accelerate the adoption of SAF across our global network, strengthening our commitment to innovation and sustainability, and ensuring a tangible impact for our customers and the industry. SAF continues to be the most viable solution currently available to address flight emissions.”

Neste says the agreement reflects its focus on supporting airlines with multinational operations. Mario Mifsud, Vice President of Renewable Fuels Sales and Commercial for EMEA and APAC, Neste, says the company’s production and distribution capabilities enable airlines to increase SAF use across regions. “Our global production and distribution capabilities allow international airlines like Cathay to scale the use of SAF, a key tool for reducing emissions in aviation,” he adds. “At the same time, it enables their customers to reduce the carbon footprint of their travel and logistics operations.”

Neste MY SAF is produced from waste and renewable raw materials, including used cooking oil and residual animal fats. The fuel is certified for commercial aviation use and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or airport fueling infrastructure.

Neste’s global SAF production capacity stands at 1.5 million metric t per year, says the company. It plans to expand that capacity to 2.2 million metric t annually by 2027. Across all renewable fuel products, Neste expects total production capacity to reach 6.8 million metric t per year by the same year.

For aviation, where near-term electrification is not viable for long-haul routes, SAF is widely viewed as the most practical option to cut lifecycle emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with fossil-based jet fuel. The fuel is certified for commercial aviation use. It can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. This enables immediate deployment across existing airline operations.

Neste MY SAF is compatible with aircraft engines and airport fueling infrastructure, reducing operational disruption for airlines. It allows gradual decarbonization without major capital investment in new fleets or systems. The approach is increasingly relevant as the European Union, North America, and parts of Asia drive stricter emissions requirements.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/saf-scaled%20%281%29.jpg?h=e85d0bda&itok=y_SslJIY,N,,2025-12-31 12:56:57.268785

Approximately 80% of Darling's North American fats, including poultry fat, flow to DGD for conversion into renewable fuels.
Carter noted one unique challenge: ""Poultry fat tends to have some higher impurities than we can handle at the facility.
So you could never run 100% poultry fat.
But we are able to run poultry fat in the facility at DGD and we do.""","United Airlines is betting on waste fats from poultry production to help achieve its ambitious climate targets, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) emerging as a critical tool in the carrier's decarbonization strategy.

The airline, one of the world's largest, aims to reduce carbon intensity per passenger seat by 50% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels and reach net zero emissions by 2050. SAF will account for a substantial portion of these reductions — representing 17% of the pathway to net zero through first-generation SAF alone.

""Most of our emissions come from the tail of our aircraft,"" with jet fuel combustion represents 98% of United's emissions footprint, Ryan Backman-Flamerich, United's senior manager of environmental sustainability, told attendees at the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting, co-located with the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit.

Currently accounting for about 3% of global emissions, aviation's share is expected to grow as other sectors decarbonize more rapidly.

""We know that other sectors are decarbonizing. We know that the power sector is decarbonizing, and that will have effects for other industries,"" he said. ""Even as we work to decarbonize, if we did nothing, our share of that 3% will get larger.""

The rendering connection

Enter Darling Ingredients, which processes 15% of the world's animal byproducts and operates Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture with Valero. The facility converts waste fats — including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil — into SAF using a process called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids).

Ethan Carter, director of sustainability at Darling Ingredients, emphasized that the company processes nearly 1.5 million metric tons of low-carbon intensity feedstock annually for biofuels. DGD's facilities in Louisiana and Texas produce approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel yearly, with SAF production beginning in December 2024.

""Every part of the animal is getting used,"" Carter said, highlighting rendering's role in the poultry industry's sustainability story. ""We're looking at collecting materials from animal agriculture, from food industries, and really helping with the sustainability there, helping everyone in this room with your sustainability story.""

Approximately 80% of Darling's North American fats, including poultry fat, flow to DGD for conversion into renewable fuels. Carter noted one unique challenge: ""Poultry fat tends to have some higher impurities than we can handle at the facility. So you could never run 100% poultry fat. But we are able to run poultry fat in the facility at DGD and we do.""

Implications for poultry producers

When asked whether any producers were raising poultry specifically for waste products, Backman-Flamerich emphasized that current SAF production relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding food-versus-fuel conflicts.

He added: ""Until we reach some level of maxing out of HEFA, which is in the tens of billions of gallons, I don't think we're going to be there yet.""

Carter emphasized the supply chain integration benefits: ""It's bringing just that much more of a supply chain integration and being able for us to grow in that space to help customers realize the decarbonization goals that they have.""

The collaboration between poultry production, rendering and aviation illustrates how waste streams from one industry can become premium feedstocks for another — creating economic value while advancing climate goals across sectors. As Backman-Flamerich concluded: ""None of these three pillars happen without engagement from the entire aviation value chain, which includes everyone in this room.""",https://img.wattagnet.com/mindful/watt/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/united-airlines.4esEF0U1eV.avif?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-31 12:12:06.640502

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.
Because it is an issue that is polarizing,” Turnbull said, adding that she can’t speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.
Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.
When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, “Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first.","HALIFAX — In the year since the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives under Premier Tim Houston won a resounding second mandate, the government’s focus has largely been on a topic that didn’t get much attention during the 2024 election campaign.

Houston’s Tories have lifted a moratorium on fracking and a ban on uranium mining, and opened calls for offshore oil and gas exploration bids. They’ve introduced measures to streamline both the environmental assessments for energy projects and the permitting processes for mining. And the premier laid out plans for a massive offshore wind energy development.

To top it off, in October, Houston named himself energy minister.

Political science experts say that had Houston given voters details about his energy ideas, the November election campaign — after which the Progressive Conservatives won 43 out of 55 seats — may have looked different.

“If there had been more details about critical minerals, what that means for private property potentially, that would have been the dominant discussion in the election campaign,” Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Tuesday.

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.

Instead, the Progressive Conservative campaign focused on lowering some taxes, raising the minimum wage, and hiring more doctors to support the health system. Much of those promises have been fulfilled. The Department of Health says there are 453 more physicians working in Nova Scotia now than in 2021 when the Progressive Conservatives were first elected. The department was not immediately able to provide the number of new doctors hired since the November 2024 election.

To address affordability, the premier pledged to “ensure power-rate fairness” by capping increases to the Canadian average, which has not yet happened. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a question about progress toward implementing the promised cap.

Lori Turnbull, a political scientist with Dalhousie University, said Tuesday that political parties never do exactly what they include in campaign materials, because unpredictable challenges arise once they enter office.

“But I think the question is, did you intentionally not tell us because you knew it would be controversial, and you didn’t want the campaign to be taken over by something like this? Because it is an issue that is polarizing,” Turnbull said, adding that she can’t speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.

“If you start talking about the possibility of fracking, possibility of opening up uranium mines, and all of the environmental and health risks that go along with that, that’s the type of thing that, even though it might not be anyone’s Number 1 issue … these other things can become the split issue in the campaign,” she said.

On the campaign trail, the premier did not hold a stand-alone press conference to highlight his natural resources plans, as he did with many election promises. The campaign material said, “the path to future economic prosperity must include a refocusing back to our natural resources.” It made note of critical mineral potential, without specifics, and said efforts will be made to develop sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

When asked why natural resource development was not emphasized as a key issue on the campaign trail, a spokesperson for the premier said Houston made it clear to voters he would be focused on growing the economy.

“Then (U.S.) President Trump launched a tariff war against Canada. That made it even clearer we must be more self-sufficient — at a time when a new prime minister is pushing Canada to be an energy superpower and our deficit remains a reality. So we acted,” said Catherine Klimek.

There has been criticism over Houston’s speedy push for mining and natural resource development, with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs raising concerns in June about government failing to consult with them before the province issued a request for exploration proposals for three sites with known deposits of uranium in. No companies came forward with a bid.

Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, “Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first. He would never put our province at risk. Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.”

On Dec. 22, the government said it was putting Dalhousie University in charge of a $30-million program that will see a call for onshore natural-gas exploration in the new year. Officials said new natural-gas development will allow the province to cut back on burning coal for electricity generation and help it hit its 2030 emission targets.

However, a former university president who oversaw the report that led to a decade-long ban on fracking in Nova Scotia has questioned the government’s claims that natural gas would lower emissions and energy prices.

It is either the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 families. Both have reshaped global aviation profoundly. But today, we are going to talk about the newest Airbus A320neo family. From major hub-to-hub routes to thin regional services, the A320neo has become one of the most recognizable and widely deployed aircraft types in the world. We will explore why the A320neo family has achieved such extraordinary global penetration, examining the technical, operational, and economic forces behind its success.

Since entering service in 2016, the A320neo family has built on the legacy of the original and successful A320 series, which itself revolutionized short- and medium-haul flying. With improved engines, advanced aerodynamics, and cockpit commonality, the A320neo has become a cornerstone of airlines' fleets of every size on every continent of our planet. Understanding why it is everywhere today means looking at how Airbus future-proofed the platform for a rapidly evolving aviation market.

Designing For Scale: How Airbus Built A Global Narrowbody Platform

At the heart of the A320neo family’s global presence is the sheer scale and flexibility of the program. Airbus designed the NEO (New Engine Option) as an evolutionary upgrade rather than a clean-sheet aircraft, allowing airlines to adopt it with minimal disruption. This approach enabled faster certification, quicker airline adoption, a smoother pilot transition, and immediate operational benefits.

The A320neo family includes the A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo, covering a wide range of capacities and mission profiles. According to Airbus, the family delivers at least a 20% reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft, driven mainly by new-generation engines and aerodynamic improvements such as sharklets. These gains translate directly into lower operating costs, a critical factor for airlines operating in competitive short-haul markets. Additionally, the combination of a range up to 4,000 miles and efficiency has made the aircraft attractive not only to full-service carriers but also to low-cost operators and leasing companies worldwide.

But it’s important to mention that the NEO’s success is inseparable from the legacy of the original A320ceo. First introduced in the late 1980s, the A320 was the world’s first commercial jet to feature a full digital fly-by-wire system, setting a new standard for cockpit automation. Over more than three decades, Airbus delivered over 12,000 A320ceo-family aircraft across the A318, A319, A320, and A321 variants, creating one of the largest installed bases in aviation history. This enormous global footprint meant that when the NEO was launched, airlines already trusted the platform, accelerating adoption and reinforcing Airbus’ narrowbody dominance.

Next-Generation Engines & Environmental Performance

One of the most decisive factors behind the A320neo’s global reach is its engine technology. Airbus gave customers a choice between two advanced powerplants: the CFM LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM geared turbofan. This dual-engine strategy reduced risk for airlines and broadened the aircraft’s appeal.

Both engines promise double-digit improvements in fuel efficiency, along with lower noise footprints and reduced maintenance costs over the aircraft’s life cycle. The geared turbofan concept, in particular, introduced a new paradigm in narrowbody propulsion by allowing the fan and low-pressure turbine to operate at optimal speeds. These innovations are frequently highlighted by engineers and pilots in operational videos and technical explainers, which often discuss the aircraft’s performance and efficiency.

Beyond fuel burn, the engines support airlines’ environmental commitments. Airbus emphasizes that the A320neo family is already certified to operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a roadmap toward 100% SAF capability by 2030. This future-proofing has reassured airlines planning fleets in an increasingly regulation-driven environment.

Engine choice has always been central to the A320 program’s evolution. Earlier A320ceo variants relied on CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines, both of which proved exceptionally reliable and contributed to the type’s strong dispatch performance. By offering a similar dual-choice with the NEO, this time, either LEAP-1A or PW1100G, Airbus deliberately echoed this strategy, giving airlines continuity while introducing step-change efficiency improvements. This parallel between CEO and NEO generations has helped airlines transition fleets gradually rather than through disruptive wholesale replacement.

Cockpit Commonality & Airline Operational Economics

Another pillar of the A320neo family’s success is cockpit and operational commonality. Airbus deliberately preserved the A320 family flight deck philosophy, ensuring that pilots can transition between variants with minimal additional training. This commonality has powerful implications for airline economics.

Pilots qualified on the A320ceo can move to the NEO with adjustment training rather than full type certification, significantly reducing training costs. Maintenance crews benefit from similar efficiencies, as many systems and procedures remain unchanged. This continuity has been repeatedly emphasized in industry discussions and pilot-focused video content, analyzing why airlines favor Airbus narrowbodies.

For large operators running hundreds of aircraft, these savings scale rapidly. Fleet flexibility also improves resilience, allowing airlines to swap aircraft between routes and bases without complex retraining programs. This operational simplicity has been a key driver of the A320neo’s rapid adoption across continents.

This philosophy dates back to the earliest days of the A320ceo family. Airbus designed the A319, A320, and the stretched A321 to share a common type rating, allowing airlines to tailor capacity without fragmenting pilot pools. The NEO family preserves this approach, meaning a pilot can fly an A319neo on a short regional sector one day and an A321neo on a high-density or long-range route the next. Furthermore, this commonality goes beyond the A320 family. According to Airbus, pilots with an A320 type rating can transition to larger cousins such as the A330 and A350, in as little as one week to ten days of additional training! This seamless scalability remains one of the A320 family’s most underappreciated competitive advantages.

Production Scale, Availability, & Worldwide Visibility

While efficiency and commonality matter, availability and production scale are equally crucial to global presence. Airbus has invested heavily in expanding A320neo production capacity to meet unprecedented demand. This industrial strategy has helped cement the aircraft’s dominance.

The A320neo family is assembled in multiple final assembly lines across Europe, Asia, and North America. This geographically distributed production model reduces delivery risk and brings Airbus closer to key customers. According to industry tracking and Flightradar24's analysis, the A320neo is now one of the most frequently observed aircraft types in global airspace, reflecting both high delivery volumes and intense daily utilization.

Airbus’ massive order backlog further reinforces the type’s visibility. Thousands of A320neo-family aircraft are on order with airlines and lessors, ensuring that the type will remain a dominant feature of global fleets well into the 2030s.

But this impressive production scale did not emerge overnight. The A320ceo program steadily ramped up output through the 1990s and 2000s as demand surged from Europe and North America, and later from Asia-Pacific. By the time the NEO entered service, Airbus already had decades of narrowbody manufacturing experience and a mature global supply chain. This continuity allowed the manufacturer to transition from CEO to NEO production without the severe bottlenecks often associated with all-new aircraft programs.

Why The A321neo Became The Family’s Standout Variant

A common question is why the A321neo, in particular, has become so prominent within the family. The answer lies in its ability to blur the line between traditional narrowbodies and widebodies. For many airlines, the long-range XLR variant has replaced larger aircraft on certain routes.

Airbus has extended the narrowbody concept to the long-haul market with variants such as the A321LR and A321XLR. These aircraft can operate transatlantic and other long-range routes with lower trip costs than widebodies, opening new city pairs. Airlines and analysts frequently cite this capability as a strategic game-changer, a topic often discussed on social media and in technical forums.

This flexibility has driven strong demand from both legacy carriers and low-cost airlines seeking growth without the financial risk of widebody fleets. As a result, the A321neo has become one of the fastest-selling aircraft in Airbus’ history, further expanding the family’s global presence.

The A321 itself has an important lineage within the family. Introduced as a higher-capacity derivative of the original A320, it allowed Airbus to challenge larger narrowbodies and even some short-haul widebodies. The NEO generation has further elevated this concept, while the A319 and A320 continue to serve as right-sized solutions for lower-demand markets. Together, these subvariants allow airlines to fine-tune capacity while maintaining fleet commonality. This is an approach few competitors have matched at a similar scale.

The A320neo Family’s Long-Term Role In Global Aviation

Looking ahead, the A320neo family’s global presence is likely to grow even further as airlines focus on sustainability, efficiency, and network flexibility. Airbus continues to refine the platform with incremental upgrades and digital enhancements. These improvements ensure the aircraft remains competitive against both current and future rivals.

For airlines, the A320neo represents a low-risk, high-reward investment that aligns with modern operational and environmental priorities.

China's National Energy Administration recently released its five-year plan, which included ways for provinces to use excess renewable energy. During peak production, renewable sources like wind and solar can sometimes produce more electricity than the grid can handle.

Outputs like green hydrogen generation can put that excess power to good use. The National Energy Administration's plan also pointed to green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel as other uses for surplus renewable energy. Like green hydrogen, they can also be used to cut transportation pollution.

China has already started building production facilities that tightly link renewable energy with hydrogen. Meanwhile, Chinese researchers have been able to tap into water vapor as a green hydrogen source.

Burning coal, oil, and gas are the biggest sources of atmospheric pollution, but hydrogen's sustainability depends entirely on how it's made. Hydrogen needs energy to be separated from water. If that energy comes from fossil fuel sources, the resulting hydrogen embodies that pollution, even if using hydrogen doesn't directly produce harmful by-products.

China is the world's largest polluter, thanks in no small part to its reliance on coal power. However, it has also deployed the most solar energy in the world. It's no slouch when it comes to wind power, either. The more it can reliably transition to green energy sources, the sooner it can replace dirty power like coal.

Grid-scale energy emissions are contributing to atmospheric pollution, which exacerbates destructive weather patterns and affects China directly. The country has weathered increasingly severe floods, droughts, and storms like many others, and borne the costs that go with them.

The company says it now operates more than 150 heavy-duty Class 8 electric vehicles across the continent, plans to add more semis in 2026 as Tesla begins its volume production.

Stephan Schablinski, vice president of GoGreen North America at DHL Supply Chain, told Transport Topics that more deliveries are expected to begin from next year’s second half onward. Schablinski said DHL wants to operate the Semi tractors in other states beyond California, including Ohio and Pennsylvania.

According to the company, 30 percent of DHL’s medium- and heavy-duty trucking fleet is expected to be battery-electric or powered by another zero-emissions technology by 2030.

The Tesla Semi pilot took place in Livermore, Calif. over two weeks in October 2026, where the all-electric truck covered over 3,000 miles of regular routes. The trial included one long haul of 390 miles, and was fully loaded with a gross combined weight of 75,000 pounds.

“Our pilot of the Tesla Semi exceeded expectations, proving its ability to efficiently haul a typical DHL freight over long distances on a single charge,” said Jim Monkmeyer, president of transportation, DHL Supply Chain North America, in a statement. “Integrating the Tesla Semi into our fleet is an important step toward achieving our decarbonization goals and delivering more sustainable solutions for our customers.”

According to Tesla, the Semi can travel up to 500 miles on a single charge, and can recover up to 70 percent of range in 30 minutes. Class 8 trucks typically have a range of less than 250 miles on one charge.

Dan Priestley, director of Semi at Tesla, said the DHL partnership will “help us make the product even better for future global markets.” Tesla says the start of serial production of the Semi remains on schedule for late 2025 with a ramp up to capacity in 2026.

The truck currently travels approximately 100 miles per day in central California, DHL says, and requires charging about once per week. Additionally, it is projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 metric tons annually.

With the Tesla Semi within its fleet, DHL can further accelerate its transition to net zero-emission logistics, a call the logistics giant aims to reach by 2050. On a shorter-term basis, the company is also pushing to reduce absolute carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from 40 million metric tons to 29 million in 2030 to stay aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements.

Tesla is one of multiple companies that DHL has worked with for electric trucking adoption since 2020, with the company teaming up with BYD, Volvo Trucks, Daimler Truck, Scania and now-defunct Nikola on separate deployments. DHL Supply Chain also owns and operates more than 50 Orange EV yard trucks that are deployed at 30 sites across the country to move trailers and shipping containers.

The Livermore facility does not have any other battery-electric trucks other than the Tesla Semi, according to Schablinski.

Beyond the long haul, EVs have been a priority for DHL’s wider last-mile delivery ambitions.

As of October, DHL said it has 39,000 total EVs worldwide in pickup and delivery services, representing more than 41 percent of pickup and delivery vehicles. The company aims to increase this share to 66 percent in 2030.

Decarbonization at the logistics giant also extends to its air cargo operation, which accounts for 68 percent of DHL’s emissions. DHL has already used 188,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) between 2020 and 2024 and will double that figure this year. SAF now makes up 3.5 percent of the company’s total jet fuel mix, with the firm aiming to escalate this number to 30 percent by 2030.

DHL’s sustainability push recently pushed into ocean freight. This month, DHL partnered with ocean carrier CMA CGM to decarbonize container shipping, with the logistics companies committing to use 8,900 metric tons of a lower-carbon biofuel for ocean shipments.

Under that initiative, DHL and CMA CGM expect to slash roughly 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ocean freight shipped through DHL’s GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM’s ACT+ programs.

Those programs are designed to let customers pay a premium price to select more sustainable fuel options for their shipments.

Introduction

Climate change has become one of the largest threats currently facing humanity. As such, much time and effort has been devoted to discovering novel ways to decarbonize our modern society, including aviation . We increasingly rely on aviation to connect with the world, and thus finding a solution to make aviation more sustainable is necessary to meet global climate goals . Fortunately, many strides have already been made in terms of decreasing the energy intensity per passenger-mile of air travel through various improvements in technology, leading to the energy intensity of air travel decreasing by 77% per passenger in two decades. This great improvement cannot fully account for the increasing demand for air travel that we have especially seen in the past decade, as overall emissions from air travel still increased by 30% from 2013 to 2019 alone . This indicates a troubling trend in the commercial aviation industry. While commercial air travel only accounted for 2.5% of global emissions in 2022, this is expected to rise to 11% in the next two decades if significant advances in technology are not made to account for rising demand . It is important to understand that “emissions” encompasses not only the classic CO2, but also other carbon emissions like CO, and nitrous oxides (NOx). NOx emissions can decrease crop yields, cause diseases in humans, and exacerbate the Greenhouse Gas effect by creating ozone, thus perpetuating climate change‘ . Thus, to prevent the environmental and economic disadvantages of rising emissions, it is clear that we must invest more into the discovery and development of novel sustainable aviation technologies.

To support this goal, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is a trade association representing a large portion of air travel, has set a goal for aviation emissions to reach 50% of their 2005 level by 2050 . To achieve this, large investments into every sector of aviation will be required, but one of the most crucial is the fuel being used. While many alternatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen (H2) have been considered and extensively studied, some recent research has begun to focus on ammonia (NH3) as a possible fuel option due to its possible fuel option due to its potentially low carbon emissions . While SAFs and hydrogen have received substantial attention, ammonia is increasingly discussed due to its potential for carbon-free combustion and simpler airplane storage needs than hydrogen due to its higher freezing temperature and narrower flammability range‘ . Furthermore, recent increased interest in ammonia may be explained by its production on an industrial scale for over a century as a fertilizer and refrigerant, making it easily accessible . It also is roughly 17.8% of hydrogen by mass, meaning that many of hydrogen’s benefits could be accessed by utilizing the more convenient-to-store and -produce ammonia instead .

This paper is a systematic review synthesizing data from papers published from 2017 to 2025 to provide a comparative analysis of alternative aviation fuels and evaluate ammonia’s technical viability. The primary limitation of this paper is that no experimental research facilities were accessible, so all findings are based on the experimental work of other researchers. The focus of this article is to review some processes related to fuel combustion (if applicable) and emissions (both carbon dioxide and NOx) with a specific focus on the alternative aviation fuels described previously (SAFs, hydrogen, and all-electric battery). No other paper reviewed by the authors included both an analysis of ammonia as well as analyses of SAFs, hydrogen, and all-electric battery systems, making this paper unique in its method of evaluating the effectiveness of ammonia. The intent of this analysis is to inform policymakers and researchers as to what some of the most promising lines of inquiry are in the field of sustainable aviation. We do not attempt to comprehensively review the entire field of alternative aviation fuel, as this is a continuously evolving area of research. The first section of this paper serves as an overview of ammonia and sustainable aviation goals. The next section outlines the methodology used in the creation of this paper, followed by an extensive comparison of all four considered fuels (SAFs, hydrogen, all-electric battery, and ammonia) concluding with an evaluation of current research prospects in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section presents the conclusions of the paper along with research recommendations.

Methodology

For this research paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to gain a holistic view of the most current work being done in the field of sustainable jet fuels, with the data collection period beginning in June 2025 and ending in September 2025. The general methodology followed is displayed in Figure 1. Search engines like Google Scholar and JSTOR were used to find papers, first using keywords like “sustainable aviation fuels”, “hydrogen as jet fuel”, and“alternative jet fuels” to build a comprehensive view of existing literature in the field. Google Scholar was generally preferred over JSTOR due to having more primary sources related to aviation than JSTOR when the same keywords were used. Then, keywords such as “ammonia as jet fuel” and “ammonia combustion properties” were used to gain a thorough understanding of the ammonia niche. Paper relevancy was assessed first by publishing date, as all papers older than 2023 were prioritized due to being the most up to date information, but some older sources were used when no more recent papers were available or when appropriate for the subject. Then, papers were thoroughly reviewed to ensure their findings were relevant to the topic of this paper by scanning the titles of papers, looking for connections to aviation. Source credibility was assessed by verifying publication integrity, with peer-reviewed academic journals, conference papers, and credible books being preferred above all else whenever possible. Finally, research design of the paper was considered, as experimental research was prioritized, but non-experimental papers were not always excluded. Numerical findings from research papers were extracted through thorough analysis of the papers and digital note-taking, making special note of papers that contained experimental findings about combustion properties.

Ultimately, 29 sources were determined to meet these requirements, most of which were research papers published in academic journals. All sources were evaluated to ensure no duplicates appeared. Any sources not coming from academic journals were instead from other reputable sources, such as government websites, and were largely not used for critical information. Main takeaways were synthesized and numerical findings were compared from differing sources to provide a basis for this paper’s discussion.

Results

Background

In order to fully understand ammonia as an alternative fuel, it is first important to understand other alternative fuel solutions that have been proposed. The aim of this section is to provide an overview of three of the main areas of research other than ammonia (Sustainable Aviation Fuels, hydrogen, and electric) and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in relation to the metrics previously described (emissions, ease of integration, and technological limitations). Since this paper deals with the field of combustion, the following key properties are considered to compare combustion properties: 1) Flame speed, or the speed at which a flame propagates through a fluid. 2) Ignition Delay Time (IDT), or the time interval between the start of fuel injection and combustion. Both of these properties heavily influence engine design, particularly the fuel injection systems and combustor geometry. However, an important distinction between them is that while IDT decreases with temperature, flame speed increases‘ . The typical parameter ranges within which aircraft engines operate is described in Table 1 below. While these conditions may not be the exact same as those later reported in the paper, later reported work still reflects the general trends for combustion of the discussed fuels (if relevant) .

Table 1 | Typical Aircraft Engine Parameter Ranges

Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Sustainable Aviation Fuels encompass a wide range of fuels that are united by their production methods: they are typically made using waste products or other biological products such as leftover cooking oil or animal fats‘ . This pivot away from using petroleum-based fuels leaves ample room for life-cycle carbon emission savings despite similar combustion to conventional jet fuel, with some finding an up to 90% reduction in overall emissions . However, some other cradle to grave analyses, which includes all emissions involved in the transportation, production, and combustion of SAFs, have found emission reductions as low as 27% . Nonetheless, some non-trivial emission reduction is essentially guaranteed for aircraft operating on SAFs. It is also crucial to note that SAFs are entirely drop-in compatible, since they are chemically engineered to have similar combustion properties (including flame speed and IDT) to conventional jet fuels . Since SAFs have such similar combustion properties to conventional jet fuels, while their specific chemical compositions may vary, they will generally follow the general combustion equation of a hydrocarbon (shown above) . However, this does again emphasize that this approach is not free from carbon emissions. This is a substantial advantage, as it means that essentially no engine redesigns are required to begin utilizing SAFs, minimizing downtime of aircraft and costs associated with creating new engines. Thus, SAFs work remarkably well within our current technological limitations.

However, the primary roadblock to widespread SAF adoption currently is high price, as SAFs can cost between 120-700% more than conventional jet fuels .This would make a transition to utilizing SAFs incredibly taxing on commercial airlines financially, and the effect is only worsened by the lack of producer incentives currently in place . Currently, SAF production is operating at only 3.5% of its total potential capacity, largely due to policies around the world not incentivizing growth within the market . Thus, although SAFs offer substantial savings on emissions and work within our technological limitations, the financial cost of integrating them today is simply too high for airlines to cover, and substantial policy reform is needed to encourage growth to meet potentially rising demand.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen is widely renowned for having nearly zero carbon emissions in combustion, as its combustion equation only directly produces water (although some NOx emissions may result as an indirect byproduct of combustion) . It is also roughly 3x as gravimetrically energy dense as conventional jet fuel, meaning that every 1 kg of hydrogen has 3x the energy as 1 kg of jet fuel . Although direct life-cycle evaluations of hydrogen as a jet fuel are lacking, an analysis on the potential saving of hydrogen in automobiles found a potential 15-45% decrease in lifetime emissions .This is not a direct parallel to emission savings that could be seen if implemented in aviation, as automobiles and aircraft operate under very different conditions, but it nonetheless indicates a relatively substantial decrease in emissions that would likely apply to aviation as well.

The fact that hydrogen does not guarantee a 100% decrease in emissions is in large part due to its production process. Although hydrogen can be produced sustainably through water electrolysis, a process in which electricity is used to split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), only 0.1% of hydrogen is currently produced in this manner due to prohibitively high costs, and it relies on availability of green energy on the grid to be fully carbon neutral . Carbon capture technology, which substantially reduces the emissions of production processes, are only being used in 0.6% of hydrogen production . The other 99.3% of hydrogen being produced utilizes either oil or natural gases to fuel methane (CH4) reforming, which also releases methane as a waste product with up to 120x the heating power of CO2‘ . This has led to the production of hydrogen being responsible for roughly 2% of current annual CO2 emissions .

Furthermore, hydrogen poses many challenges in terms of storage and usage on aircraft, since it is only 25% as volumetrically energy dense as conventional jet fuel and requires incredibly cold, high pressure storage tanks . This means that space would have to be made on the aircraft for tanks that are much larger and require much more pressurization and cooling than the tanks currently in use, necessitating a fundamental redesign of the aircraft. Unfortunately, this redesign will also have to reach the engines, as hydrogen has nearly eight times the flame speed of and much lower IDT than conventional jet fuel, meaning that it is not drop-in compatible‘ . Much research has been dedicated to solving for these differences, though, and there are some prototype designs that could theoretically utilize hydrogen .

In sum, in terms of emissions, unsustainable hydrogen production makes hydrogen undesirable. In terms of ease of integration, more work is needed in terms of redesigning all aircraft fundamentally and getting hydrogen to every airport, making hydrogen undesirable. Finally, in terms of technological limitations, the challenges posed by hydrogen storage currently make widespread usage unlikely.

All-Electric

The field of electrically propelled aircraft encompasses not only aircraft relying entirely on electricity for propulsion (all-electric), but also hybrid aircraft that rely both on conventional jet fuel and batteries . This section primarily focuses on all-electric aircraft, since these present the most exciting change in comparison to today’s aircraft. Such an aircraft would have very minimal if any emissions when implemented in the aircraft, with the only life-cycle emissions coming from battery production-related emissions. These emissions are still relatively low, though, as one analysis found that business carriers could see a 93% reduction in emissions if they were made all-electric . This is the most dramatic emission reduction discussed thus far, but unfortunately, all-electric aircraft fall short in other ways.

All-electric aircraft would rely on batteries storing huge amounts of energy to maintain power during the flight, but current battery technology is simply not advanced enough to accommodate this. Even the most efficient batteries today would have to be prohibitively large and heavy in order to store enough energy for a single flight, with weight increasing with the length of the flight . This would cause all-electric aircraft to have slower flight times and shorter ranges than today’s aircraft, hugely hampering their potential to be a full solution as not all routes could be served‘‘ . One analysis found that even in an optimistic case where it would be possible to produce all-electric aircraft capable of traveling up to 500 km per flight, this would only affect 5% of all commercial aircraft energy usage . Thus, 95% of the energy used by commercial aviation would still be contributing to climate change, and the previously stated emission reductions are severely hampered in scale. Furthermore, the colossal size of batteries needed to support commercial aviation would also cause 92% of commercially used aircraft to be unable to take off due to excessive battery weight . All-electric propulsion is also entirely not drop-in compatible, as it would require a fundamental redesign of the aircraft to accommodate the new batteries . This means that no currently used aircraft could continue to be used without substantial modification, incurring extra downtime of aircraft and costs related to heavily modifying and redesigning aircraft.

In all, while having the potential for incredible emission reductions, all-electric propulsion fundamentally fails to make a significant impact due to its cumbersome implementation and need for technology that simply does not exist yet. Until serious advances in battery efficiency are achieved, further research in other fields or in hybrid-electric models is recommended.

Ammonia

The balanced equation for the combustion of ammonia and air (shown above) shares many features with that of hydrogen and air, including a lack of carbon outputs. However, it notably includes some N2 as an output, which sets it apart from hydrogen and introduces new considerations for combustion and emissions which will be further discussed in this section. While still requiring more complex storage than conventional fuel, one of the primary advantages of ammonia is that it has much less stringent storage requirements than hydrogen. Ammonia has a boiling temperature of -33 ℃ at 1 atm, compared to hydrogen’s -253 ℃, meaning that it would require less investment into cryogenic tanks . This makes ammonia a seemingly ideal substitute, as it significantly mitigates one of the primary design challenges associated with use of hydrogen. It is still somewhat more complex to store than conventional jet fuels, though, which are liquid at room temperature and typically have freezing temperatures around -50 ℃, with some fluctuation depending on exact fuel composition .Thus, much recent research in the field of sustainable aviation has focused on the utilization of ammonia as a jet fuel through several different methods. This section discusses and evaluates the use of ammonia as jet fuel (pure ammonia use), using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier (typically through cracking or complex combustion), and the use of ammonia as an additive to other fuel types.

Pure Ammonia Use

Using ammonia on its own may seem like the most simple solution, as it would ideally serve as a direct replacement for jet fuel while circumventing the challenges associated with hydrogen. Unfortunately, ammonia causes many new issues to arise that hydrogen does not suffer from. While hydrogen has a relatively high flame speed and low IDT, ammonia has the opposite problem of having a low flame speed and high IDT‘‘‘ . Table 2 displays the flame speed of several mixtures, notably showing that by replacing just half of a hydrogen mixture with ammonia, the flame speed is decreased almost sevenfold . The flame speed for an ammonia/air mixture, though, was not determined at these exact conditions by any work reviewed for this paper. However, at P = 5 bar, T = 500 K, and Φ = 1, the flame speed of ammonia-air has been experimentally determined to be roughly 0.11 m/s, far below any other flame speed presented despite being at a higher pressure . Clees et al. attempted to validate some of the foremost models for predicting IDT through shock tube experiments and OH* and OH measurements, as the presence of these indicate ignition in the fuel, finding that most models are unable to accurately predict the IDT of ammonia at all temperatures .

Table 2 | Comparison of Flame Speeds at P = 2 bar, T = 600 K, and Φ = 1 .

This essentially means that while hydrogen presents challenges due to being too readily combustible, ammonia is instead too difficult to combust. The primary consequence of this is that pure ammonia mixtures would be incompatible with current aviation engines, as the combustor geometry is simply not suited for efficiently combusting fuels with these properties due to combustion possibly occurring too late . Furthermore, analyses have even found potential for ammonia in current engines not fully combusting before leaving the engine due to these differences in combustion properties, thereby releasing more unburnt ammonia, NOx, and other harmful emissions into the environment . Therefore, due to the massive engine redesign that would be required and potential for harmful emissions, using pure ammonia on its own as a fuel is not recommended.

Alternative Ammonia Combustion

The potential of ammonia due to its previously discussed advantages over hydrogen has spurred further research into novel uses of ammonia. Specifically, some research groups have examined the possibility of using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in order to avoid the downsides of ammonia while still enjoying its benefits. One such approach is called ammonia cracking, which involves the splitting of ammonia into nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen prior to reaching the combustor‘ . This approach has the added benefit of utilizing waste heat from the engine to fuel the cracking process, thereby increasing overall system efficiency . Furthermore, due to the increased presence of stable nitrogen and hydrogen, which are much less likely to form NOx emissions than ammonia on its own, NOx emissions have been predicted to decrease in planes using this approach . Implementation of this design would require the addition of a cracking chamber to each engine, as well as redesigns to accommodate the combustion of hydrogen, but hypothetical models have been made that fit these requirements . The largest barriers this approach faces are the inherent inconvenience of having to entirely redesign all existing engines, the added weight of cracking systems, and the novelty of this idea, as it has never been implemented on a commercial scale before. Thus, significant investment into experimental research is recommended before implementation of this approach.

A second approach being considered is the splitting of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen through two-stage combustion. This means that there will first be a fuel rich zone, with high concentration of ammonia to begin conversion to hydrogen, followed by a fuel lean zone, with a high concentration of air to complete conversion, as seen in Figure 2 .

Again, a main advantage of this approach is a significant decrease in NOx emissions at aircraft engine conditions due to increased N2 presence . However, most previous examples of two-stage ammonia emissions incorporate the use of a pilot or start-up fuel to compensate for ammonia’s unfavorable combustion properties, such as methane‘ . This once again reintroduces carbon into the combustor, although generally additions of CH4 have been shown to reduce emissions on net because of increased combustion efficiency . While this approach would not require the addition of a whole new cracking chamber, it would still require significant combustor redesign and fuel mixing techniques that have yet to be achieved on a practical level in the aviation industry. Furthermore, recently published studies have found that while novel combustion techniques like multi-stage combustion do generally lead to reductions in NOx emissions, the most effective approach to mitigating NOx emissions is to have the equivalence ratio be greater than 1, which has not yet been tested for either cracking or multistage combustion . Thus, this approach is not yet feasible due to a lack of experimental research.

Ammonia as an Additive

While both of the previous techniques are limited by their reliance on unproven engine redesigns, the most promising line of ammonia research in terms of near-term feasibility currently ongoing relies on assuming none of these major changes. Specifically, Alabaş suggests using ammonia as an additive, either to hydrogen, kerosene, or both . The central study pushing forward this alternative was conducted using over 1600 iterations in ANSYS Fluent using the SIMPLE algorithm . Specific model parameters can be seen in Table 3 below. Authors modeled a GTM-120 mini gas turbine engine, which is a typical research tool for studying the behavior of airplane engines . Thus, all results are assuming no or minimal changes to current engine designs.

Table 3 | Model Parameters Used to Evaluate Ammonia as an Additive

Several mixtures were tested with concentrations of ammonia ranging from 5% to 45%, kerosene limited to 50%, and hydrogen making up the difference . It is important to note that while the addition of kerosene generally improved combustion efficiency, it had the significant tradeoff of introducing carbon to the mixture, thus producing carbon emissions . In terms of ammonia, the study found that while NOx emissions peaked at 5% ammonia, they then decreased rather significantly after that point as the concentration of ammonia increased, likely due to decreased flame temperatures . Ultimately, the ideal mixture the study recommends is 50% kerosene, 45% ammonia, and 5% hydrogen because of its lowered NOx emissions and overall burn efficiency . This increase in burn efficiency is reflected in a decrease in CO emissions, which result as a byproduct of incomplete combustion, and the massive difference in this can be seen in Table 4 .

Table 4 | Ammonia Mixture Emissions Comparison .

While this is not an ideal solution due to the inclusion of kerosene, a hydrocarbon, this still provides greatly lowered emissions compared to conventional jet fuel while still preserving drop-in compatibility . Thus, because of the significant technological and logistical barriers that come with implementing all other proposed solutions, using ammonia as an additive is likely the most technologically feasible solution at this time. While notable emissions reductions are still achieved, the largest barrier to decarbonizing aviation is circumvented: difficulties within implementation. However, this study did not take into consideration the storage of the fuel mixture, which is a substantial oversight since (as previously discussed) storing both ammonia and hydrogen comes with unique challenges that could potentially complicate implementation. There is no explanation of how the blend will be kept at a temperature and/or pressure suitable for all involved fuels, which is alarming due to the vastly different storage requirements they have (see section Ammonia). There is also a notable lack of experimental confirmation of the simulation’s findings. Thus, while this approach is by far the most promising discussed thus far, experimental research is strongly recommended to further validate the authors’ claims.

Discussion

As the commercial aviation industry continues to grow across the world, the need to create low-carbon propulsion becomes increasingly apparent. While solutions such as all-electric, hydrogen, pure SAFs, or even pure ammonia may not yet be feasible primarily due to technological limitations, ammonia can still serve as a valuable stepping stone. See Table 5 for an overview of the conclusions drawn regarding all considered power sources. The use of ammonia as an additive to other fuels is an incredibly exciting idea, and while it may not be an entirely carbon-free solution, it will still decrease emissions if implemented. It also benefits from requiring minimal if any engine redesigns, as previously described, making it more simple to implement. This can be used as a transition period from our current lack of adequate solutions for carbon-free fuels like hydrogen. Thus, more research is strongly recommended within this area to experimentally validate the findings of the study discussed and to continue pushing for more sustainable aviation.

Table 5 | Metric Evaluation by Power Source

Experimentalist researchers ought to use the models previously described to guide their experiments in order to validate the findings these previous researchers have presented, directly furthering the line of inquiry into the use of ammonia as an additive. One recommended approach is testing different combinations of kerosene, hydrogen, and ammonia at conditions similar to an airplane engine, as previously described. Both the aviation industry and policymakers are strongly recommended to support the exploration and development of this technology through financial investments and policy support. It is also important to consider that all conclusions drawn and recommendations made in this paper are based on a literature review which, while as thorough as possible, does not preclude the existence of contradicting studies or information. The findings discussed above should be interpreted as a preliminary step toward creating a more sustainable future for aviation, whether or not ammonia is involved.

What began as cautious optimism has evolved into renewed confidence, record demand and long-term strategic investment. Airlines have rebuilt networks, manufacturers have increased output, and sustainability has moved from aspiration to action.

Below is a month-by-month look back at the 12 defining moments that shaped UK aviation and aerospace over the last year.

January – A Confident Start as Passenger Demand Holds Firm

The year opened with UK aviation in a far stronger position than many had anticipated. Passenger volumes through major hubs such as Heathrow Airport remained robust despite the traditional winter slowdown. Long-haul routes, particularly to North America and the Middle East, continued to perform strongly, while leisure demand across Europe showed little sign of weakening.

Airlines entered the year balancing strong bookings against rising costs, but January clearly signalled that passenger confidence had firmly returned.

February – Sustainable Aviation Fuel Moves Up the Agenda

February saw Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) gain further prominence as airlines, airports and manufacturers reiterated its importance in cutting aviation emissions this decade. Industry leaders emphasised that SAF represents the most practical near-term solution for decarbonising flight while new aircraft and propulsion technologies mature.

The focus also turned to the need for domestic SAF production, with calls for policy certainty to unlock investment and prevent reliance on imported fuel.

March – Fleet Modernisation Accelerates

As spring approached, UK airlines stepped up fleet renewal programmes. New-generation aircraft entered service offering improved fuel efficiency, lower noise footprints and enhanced passenger comfort. For operators, these investments were about more than sustainability — they also supported reliability, resilience and long-term cost control.

Older, less efficient aircraft continued to be phased out, reinforcing a shift towards smarter growth rather than simple capacity expansion.

April – Business Aviation Confirms Its Recovery

April highlighted the continued recovery of the business and private aviation sector. Operators reported strong utilisation across domestic and short-haul European routes, driven by demand for flexible, time-efficient travel.

Beyond corporate travel, business aviation continued to support a wide range of activity including medical services, energy operations and government flights, underlining its role within the broader UK aviation ecosystem.

May – UK Aerospace Manufacturing in Focus

Attention turned to the UK’s aerospace manufacturing base as global aircraft production rates increased. British suppliers played a central role in international programmes, particularly in advanced wing manufacture, systems integration and composite technologies.

Despite ongoing challenges around skills and supply chains, the sector demonstrated its strategic importance to global aerospace, supporting thousands of highly skilled jobs across the UK.

June – Preparing for a Demanding Summer

With forecasts pointing to one of the busiest summers on record, June was defined by preparation. Airports and airlines focused on improving operational resilience, investing in staffing, technology and passenger communications.

Lessons learned from previous peak seasons helped shape more coordinated planning, ensuring the industry entered summer better prepared than in recent years.

July – Record Summer Traffic Underlines Recovery

July delivered a clear confirmation of aviation’s resurgence. Passenger numbers surged across the UK, with several airports handling some of the highest volumes in their history. Leisure travel dominated, but business travel also showed steady signs of recovery.

Importantly, performance improved alongside volume, reinforcing public confidence in the sector’s ability to handle peak demand.

August – Airspace Modernisation Returns to Centre Stage

Peak summer operations once again highlighted the constraints of the UK’s complex and outdated airspace structure. August saw renewed calls for progress on airspace modernisation, widely regarded as essential for improving efficiency, reducing delays and cutting emissions.

Industry leaders stressed that modernised airspace is critical national infrastructure, not simply an aviation upgrade.

September – Regional Connectivity Back in the Spotlight

As summer demand eased, attention shifted to regional and domestic connectivity. Airlines, airports and local authorities highlighted the economic and social importance of reliable air links, particularly for remote and island communities.

Public Service Obligation routes and targeted investment were presented as vital tools in maintaining balanced national connectivity.

October – Aerospace and Space Industries Converge

October underlined the growing alignment between the UK’s aerospace and space sectors. Developments in launch capability, uncrewed systems and advanced manufacturing demonstrated how skills, infrastructure and supply chains increasingly overlap.

This convergence reinforced the UK’s ambition to play a significant role in the global space economy while creating new opportunities for traditional aerospace firms.

November – Aircraft Orders Signal Long-Term Confidence

The autumn brought renewed focus on long-term growth as airlines announced major aircraft orders and future commitments. These decisions reflected confidence extending well into the next decade, supported by expectations of sustained leisure and business travel demand.

For manufacturers and suppliers, the announcements provided valuable certainty for workforce planning and investment.

December – Sustainability, Skills and the Road Ahead

As the year closed, industry discussion turned to the future. Sustainability remained a dominant theme, alongside the growing need to attract and retain skilled workers across engineering, flight operations and digital roles.

December served as a reminder that while growth has returned, it must be delivered responsibly, inclusively and with a clear focus on long-term resilience.

Looking Ahead

Taken together, the past 12 months mark a transition from recovery to renewal for UK aviation and aerospace. Strong demand, renewed investment and accelerating sustainability efforts have reshaped the sector’s outlook.

The challenge for the year ahead will be turning ambition into delivery – modernising infrastructure, scaling cleaner fuels and ensuring the workforce is ready for the next phase of growth. If the past year is any guide, UK aviation enters that challenge with confidence.",https://ukaviation.news/wp-content/uploads/DSC03365.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:13:05.802897

Exploring U.S.-based nuclear power as a strategic enabler for advanced fuels, AI-era infrastructure, and tokenized environmental assets

Potential to advance next-generation eSAF pathways by pairing continuous clean electricity with electrolysis, hydrogen production, and low-carbon fuel synthesis

Assessing potential pathways for leveraging American power, American feedstocks, and American infrastructure to strengthen U.S. industrial and energy leadership

Sacramento, California – December 30, 2025 – DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”) production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (“IP3”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) (together “the parties”).

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging “book-and-claim” and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (“MRV”) systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,” said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. “We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

“This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

“This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels,” said Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global. “We believe firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration, if ultimately pursued, is expected to allow us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

Background

India and Brazil are natural partners in the low-carbon bioenergy transition. Brazil has decades of experience in large-scale biofuel deployment, most famously its sugarcane-based ethanol program and a mature flex-fuel vehicle market, while India has moved aggressively in recent years to scale ethanol blending and to develop policy frameworks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The two countries formalized energy and biofuel cooperation through a series of memoranda and joint statements: New Delhi’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and its Brazilian counterparts highlighted SAF and biofuel collaboration in a joint statement on 21 September 2024, and broader bioenergy MOUs and bilateral instruments between India and Brazil date back several years and were reiterated during high-level exchanges in 2024–2025.

The strategic logic is straightforward. India is a fast-growing aviation market with an urgent decarbonization imperative; Brazil is a global leader in feedstock-to-biofuel value chains and has operational experience in producing low-cost, low-GHG ethanol at scale. A partnership that bridges Brazilian feedstock expertise, technology and investment with Indian market scale, refinery infrastructure and regulatory momentum offers a practical route to accelerate SAF availability in both hemispheres.

Functioning

India–Brazil cooperation on biofuels and SAF functions through several complementary channels: government-to-government frameworks, industry memoranda, technical exchanges and participation in multilateral initiatives.

At the government level, joint statements and MOUs create a policy architecture that enables dialogue on feedstock sustainability criteria, certification, testing and standards for SAF. The 2024 joint statement explicitly identified modes of cooperation that include catalysing regional value chains, ramping up SAF production, and harmonizing certification and distribution mechanisms — essential building blocks for cross-border SAF trade and “book-and-claim” schemes.

Technical and research linkages have also been institutionalized: Indian public sector refiners and research bodies have exchanged MOUs with Brazilian research institutions on bioenergy and conversion technologies (for example, cooperation involving Indian Oil Corporation and Brazilian research centers). These arrangements allow technology transfer, joint pilots (EG, waste-to-fuel pathways), and co-development of feedstock sustainability protocols that are sensitive to land-use and biodiversity concerns.

The industry needs to be involved. Brazil’s local SAF trials – such as initial “book-and-claim” pilots led by airlines and fuel companies – and India’s early state of industrialization (public and private refiner sector enthusiasm, university-industry collaboration) are resulting in on-the-ground demonstration projects that local authorities can back with money, purchasing targets, and providing regulation.

The worldwide environment is important as well: Intergovernmental bodies like the Global Biofuel Alliance (established during India’s G20 presidency) are opening up further channels to expand the good practices and draw foreign ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌investment.

Impact

Cooperation between India and Brazil on biofuels and SAF has multiple, interlocking impacts — environmental, economic and geopolitical.

Environmentally, scaling SAF reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from aviation when feedstocks and conversion pathways meet robust sustainability criteria. Brazil’s sugarcane ethanol is one of the lowest-carbon ethanol feedstocks globally, offering a model for low-GHG biofuel pathways; Coupling Brazilian expertise with Indian feedstock diversity (agricultural residues, municipal waste, non-food oilseeds) can expand low-carbon fuel supplies for regional aviation. The joint governmental emphasis on certifications and value chains intends to ensure the environmental integrity of any SAF that is produced or traded.

Economically, cooperation opens investment, trade and rural development pathways. For Brazil, diversified export markets for biofuel intermediates, technology and know-how reduce reliance on a limited set of buyers. For India, SAF and biofuel collaboration can support meeting domestic ethanol-blending targets, foster new industrial clusters (waste-to-fuel, integrated biorefineries), and generate rural employment through feedstock supply chains. Strategic supply partnerships can also mitigate fuel price volatility for airlines by providing alternative, domestically supported supply lines.

Geopolitically, stronger India–Brazil ties in low-carbon fuels help both countries exercise leadership in shaping global biofuel governance and standards. As large developing economies with agricultural footprints, their joint positions in forums such as the G20 and the Global Biofuel Alliance can influence which sustainability metrics and trade rules become mainstream, a non-trivial leverage point as SAF policy architecture and carbon markets evolve.

Performance

Assessing performance requires distinguishing policy intent, demonstration activity and commercial scaling each has progressed unevenly.

On policy intent and diplomatic signaling, performance has been strong: joint statements and MOUs since 2019 (and reiterated in 2024–2025 high-level exchanges) show sustained political will to prioritize bioenergy cooperation and to frame SAF as a shared strategic objective. The public documentation of these commitments is a positive indicator that both capitals treat the issue as part of their energy diplomacy.

On demonstrations and pilots, progress is tangible but still nascent. Brazil has operational experience with SAF pilots and book-and-claim trials (for example, Latin America’s first book-and-claim transaction involving Gol and Vibra in mid-2024), illustrating the commercial mechanics and governance challenges of non-physical SAF accounting. India has begun institutional measures (research partnerships, industry MOUs and university–aircraft maker collaborations) to replicate and adapt these models domestically, but large-scale, continuous SAF production in India remains in early stages.

On commercial scaling, both countries face constraints: feedstock competition with food uses, capital intensity of advanced conversion technologies, and the still-limited global SAF market that keeps offtake uncertain. Technical performance metrics (yields, GHG savings, lifecycle assessments) are promising for certain pathways, but translating pilots into gigalitres of SAF will require stronger policy incentives (mandates, blending targets, procurement commitments), financing instruments and clear international certification that enables trade and “book & claim” mechanisms at scale.

Way Forward

To turn policy momentum into measurable SAF volumes and lasting low-carbon impact, India and Brazil should pursue a pragmatic, multi-track agenda that accelerates supply, reduces risk and ensures sustainability.

Operationalize certification and harmonize sustainability criteria. Establish a joint technical working group to align lifecycle GHG accounting, land-use change methodologies and feedstock eligibility rules so SAF from either country is tradeable with confidence. Harmonized criteria will lower transaction costs for international buyers and support book-and-claim systems.

Scale demonstration projects with co-financing. Leverage public finance (multilateral development banks, green bonds) and blended finance to derisk first-of-a-kind commercial SAF plants in India and Brazil. Bilateral co-investment vehicles or concessional lines could mobilize private capital and ensure demonstrations focus on diverse feedstocks (sugarcane residues, municipal solid waste, used cooking oil, non-food oilseeds).

Create demand-pull via procurement and mandates. Governments and national carriers should issue time-bound procurement commitments and explore progressive blending targets for aviation where feasible. Public procurement and airport-level incentives can provide the guaranteed offtake needed to attract downstream investment. Mechanisms such as book-and-claim should be piloted with rigorous oversight to avoid greenwashing.

Promote technology exchange and skills transfer. Brazil’s operational lessons in feedstock logistics and ethanol economics should be embedded into India’s industrial plans through exchange programs, joint R&D and transfer of best practices in agronomy, processing and refinery co-processing of bio-feedstocks. Collaborative training will ensure local workforces in India can operate advanced biorefineries.

Safeguard sustainability and social inclusion. Biofuel scale-up must be accompanied by land-use safeguards, smallholder inclusion strategies, and transparent benefit-sharing arrangements. Both countries should pilot supply chain traceability and social impact monitoring to prevent adverse outcomes (eg, indirect land-use change or inequitable value capture).

Link to global markets and carbon pricing mechanisms. Position India–Brazil SAF as supply nodes in the global SAF ecosystem by negotiating mutual recognition of certifications and participating in international platforms (eg, Global Biofuel Alliance). Where appropriate, integrate SAF credits with credible carbon markets to channel finance toward the highest-integrity SAF projects.

Conclusion

India and Brazil bring complementary assets to the challenge of decarbonizing aviation: Brazil’s proven feedstock and industrial experience, and India’s growing aviation demand, refinery capabilities and policy momentum. The diplomatic commitments and MOUs of recent years have established a sound platform; the next phase must convert that platform into concrete SAF gallons through harmonized standards, financed demonstrations, demand-pull mechanisms and safeguards that prioritize sustainability and social inclusion. If executed well, India–Brazil cooperation on biofuels and SAF can not only cut aviation emissions regionally but also shape global biofuel governance offering a model of South–South cooperation that pairs technical competence with market scale.

The surge stems from predicted rapid passenger growth combined with the electrification of airport operations and emerging aviation technologies that require far more power, according to a DIA news release Monday. The airport currently uses 45 megawatts of electricity and expects to need more than 400 megawatts by 2045.

DIA handled a record 82.4 million passengers last year and projects traffic to exceed 120 million annually by 2045.

Drivers include transitioning fossil fuel-based equipment to electric to cut emissions and powering new concourses and gates, as well as a new consolidated rental car facility that anticipates rental EV power needs.

“As one of the busiest airports in the world, we are actively planning for an anticipated 120 million plus annual passengers by 2045,” Phil Washington, chief executive officer at Denver International Airport, said in the release. “Significantly more electricity will be required to power our future operations and accommodate changes coming to the aviation industry in the form of electric-powered aircraft and other advancements.”

The request seeks information on integrating clean energy solutions into the airport’s existing distribution network, as well as options for redundancy and energy storage to support peak demand now and in the future.

Washington said the airport has a responsibility to evaluate all potential clean energy sources that could meet that demand. Washington said the airport cannot wait for demand to outpace supply.

“This RFI is about gathering information so DIA can continue to be an innovative thought leader and understand more about new and emerging technologies that could help ensure the airport remains Colorado’s top economic engine for future generations,” Washington said.

The airport held five community meetings between October and December to gather input that helped develop questions included in the request.

Officials sought to examine the feasibility of an on-site small modular nuclear reactor in August but delayed the study after community criticism over a lack of prior consultation. The airport issued a request for proposals on Aug. 6 for the study, but postponed it on Aug. 8 to allow more public engagement.

Washington said the airport is committed to taking community feedback into consideration as it moves forward with efforts to learn more about potential clean energy solutions.

Residents from Montbello and Green Valley Ranch expressed strong concerns at a Dec. 17 meeting about potential health risks and environmental impacts from energy expansion, especially nuclear options. Denver City Councilmember Stacie Gilmore urged excluding nuclear. Washington flatly declined to remove nuclear from consideration, stating the airport would not limit company responses prematurely.

Washington said the airport is committed to becoming the world’s greenest airport. The airport’s current energy portfolio includes 11 solar arrays totaling 50 megawatts, with an upcoming project set to add 18 megawatts. The airport is also exploring renewable natural gas, sustainable aviation fuel, geothermal, hydrogen, wind, and battery backup to support renewables and microgrid resiliency, according to Washington.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/b16692c6700510b785bae1e664af96d0-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:13:09.277369

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.
Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.
When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, ""Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first.
Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.""","HALIFAX — In the year since the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives under Premier Tim Houston won a resounding second mandate, the government's focus has largely been on a topic that didn't get much attention during the 2024 election campaign.

Houston's Tories have lifted a moratorium on fracking and a ban on uranium mining, and opened calls for offshore oil and gas exploration bids. They've introduced measures to streamline both the environmental assessments for energy projects and the permitting processes for mining. And the premier laid out plans for a massive offshore wind energy development.

To top it off, in October, Houston named himself energy minister.

Political science experts say that had Houston given voters details about his energy ideas, the November election campaign — after which the Progressive Conservatives won 43 out of 55 seats — may have looked different.

“If there had been more details about critical minerals, what that means for private property potentially, that would have been the dominant discussion in the election campaign,” Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Tuesday.

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.

Instead, the Progressive Conservative campaign focused on lowering some taxes, raising the minimum wage, and hiring more doctors to support the health system. Much of those promises have been fulfilled. The Department of Health says there are 453 more physicians working in Nova Scotia now than in 2021 when the Progressive Conservatives were first elected. The department was not immediately able to provide the number of new doctors hired since the November 2024 election.

To address affordability, the premier pledged to ""ensure power-rate fairness"" by capping increases to the Canadian average, which has not yet happened. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a question about progress toward implementing the promised cap.

Lori Turnbull, a political scientist with Dalhousie University, said Tuesday that political parties never do exactly what they include in campaign materials, because unpredictable challenges arise once they enter office.

""But I think the question is, did you intentionally not tell us because you knew it would be controversial, and you didn't want the campaign to be taken over by something like this? Because it is an issue that is polarizing,"" Turnbull said, adding that she can't speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.

""If you start talking about the possibility of fracking, possibility of opening up uranium mines, and all of the environmental and health risks that go along with that, that's the type of thing that, even though it might not be anyone's Number 1 issue … these other things can become the split issue in the campaign,"" she said.

On the campaign trail, the premier did not hold a stand-alone press conference to highlight his natural resources plans, as he did with many election promises. The campaign material said, ""the path to future economic prosperity must include a refocusing back to our natural resources."" It made note of critical mineral potential, without specifics, and said efforts will be made to develop sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

When asked why natural resource development was not emphasized as a key issue on the campaign trail, a spokesperson for the premier said Houston made it clear to voters he would be focused on growing the economy.

""Then (U.S.) President Trump launched a tariff war against Canada. That made it even clearer we must be more self-sufficient — at a time when a new prime minister is pushing Canada to be an energy superpower and our deficit remains a reality. So we acted,"" said Catherine Klimek.

There has been criticism over Houston's speedy push for mining and natural resource development, with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs raising concerns in June about government failing to consult with them before the province issued a request for exploration proposals for three sites with known deposits of uranium in. No companies came forward with a bid.

Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, ""Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first. He would never put our province at risk. Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.""

On Dec. 22, the government said it was putting Dalhousie University in charge of a $30-million program that will see a call for onshore natural-gas exploration in the new year. Officials said new natural-gas development will allow the province to cut back on burning coal for electricity generation and help it hit its 2030 emission targets.

However, a former university president who oversaw the report that led to a decade-long ban on fracking in Nova Scotia has questioned the government’s claims that natural gas would lower emissions and energy prices.

USGBC members Collin Watters of the Illinois Corn Marketing Board, Traci Menke of Renewable Fuels Nebraska (RFN) and Ron Lamberty of the American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) joined Council staff for the program along with two Illinois farmers and University of Illinois at Chicago Professor Dr. Steffen Mueller.

“As Japan has established a policy pathway to include 10 percent ethanol in its fuel blending by 2030 and a 20 percent blend by 2040, in addition to examining deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), it’s a critical time to ensure the Japanese industry and public understand the U.S. is a reliable ethanol supplier,” said Tommy Hamamoto, USGBC director in Japan.

“To that end, we were proud to host both the Nikkei Symposium/Advertorial on Bioethanol Expansion in Japan and a separate technical conference on the current and future carbon intensity value of U.S. ethanol to cover a lot of bases in terms of consumer questions about biofuels.”

Nearly 50 industry stakeholders and media members attended the technical conference, where Dr. Mueller showcased the carbon-reduction abilities of biofuels. Watters and attending U.S. farmers then discussed the sustainable production practices that maintain the quality of U.S. corn and its co-products, like ethanol, throughout the value chain.

The conference is expected to raise the understanding of how decarbonization can be measured and the status and future expectations of the CI values including the recent revision of the CI values by CORSIA/ICAO.

The next day, the group attended a biofuel informational meeting held by Nikkei Shimbun, a nationwide business journal. The symposium attracted nearly 100 people and provided explanations on the unique selling points of ethanol. Attendees also visited a gas station selling E7 fuel to further their understanding and trust in ethanol.

Starting in 2027, Brazilian airlines will have to add some portion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to fossil aviation kerosine to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 1% according to legislation passed last year. Petrobras believes it will be able to meet 100% of the national demand for sustainable aviation fuel between 2027 and 2029.

The Brazilian oil company intends to meet the demand for SAF with its products manufactured via the co-processing route. The company stated that it can meet the initial demand from four refineries in southeastern Brazil. After that, the company plans units dedicated to the production of SAF.

Starting in January of 2029, airline operators in Brazil are forced to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2%. Those percentages then grow by one point a year to 10% in 2037. Currently, the company can already produce SAF through co-processing with 1% renewable content in its Reduc refinery in Rio de Janeiro and Revap refinery in Sao Paulo. Starting the second half of 2026, its Regap refinery in Minas Gerais will produce 1% renewable and its Replan refinery in Sao Paulo up to 5%.

After 2029,Petrobras plans to start production of SAF in dedicated units, starting with the RPBC (Sao Paulo) refinery, with 15 thousand barrels per day. Subsequently, the company plans to produce 19 thousand barrels per day at the Boaventura complex (Rio de Janeiro) and 10 thousand per day at Replan.

Petrobras made its first delivery of SAF to the Galeao airport in Rio in early December after becoming the first to produce the fuel entirely in the country. The 3 thousand cubic meters of SAF delivered to the airport was the equivalent of a day of consumption at the airport. The fuel of the first delivery was produced at the Reduc refinery under authorization from the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP).

One of the main feedstocks for SAF is ethanol made from corn or sugarcane through the alcohol-to-jet process. SAF consumption in Brazil is expected to increase demand for locally produced ethanol either from corn or other grains and sugarcane.",,N,,2025-12-30 22:56:32.162850

Director of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, Associate Professor Karine Chenu, says the team is focusing on creating better inputs for processing.

Chenu says most of the research investment in this space has shown that processing plant biomass into aviation biofuels or other bioproducts is technically viable and should be done.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically two or three times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up,” the Associate Professor says.

“We need to make the more environmentally desirable option at a price that’s competitive.

“As processing methods are already in place, one of the Hub’s main focuses is on using new scientific capabilities to improve plant biomass, making it easier to process.”

By understanding and modifying the biosynthesis and composition of plant cell walls, the research team will increase the proportion of carbon that can be converted to a final product, whether that be a fuel or a biomaterial, Chenu adds.

Hub Chief Investigator Emeritus Professor Robert Henry says having a product that is easier to process, cost effective, and sustainable is where future gains could be made.

For example, with sugarcane only 20-25% of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel, Henry says, adding the aim is to increase that to 50%.

“We can see a path to producing sustainable aviation fuel at a price that’s competitive with the fossil product, which would greatly accelerate adoption,” Henry says.

Launched in November, the ARC Research Hub is a collaborative structure in partnership with industry in Australia and internationally is designed to support innovation and deliver practical outcomes.

It has partners across the whole value chain from spatial genomics and technology companies to the farm and potential processors.

(Topsoe) • Topsoe has been selected by ANCAP to deliver technology and services for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel plant at the La Teja Refinery in Montevideo.

The project will use Topsoe’s HydroFlex® technology, proprietary equipment and catalysts enabling the production of 3,000 barrels of SAF and renewable diesel per day.

The plant is expected to reach FID in 2027, with operations due to commence in 2030.

Topsoe, a leading global provider of advanced technology and solutions for the energy transition, has signed an agreement with Administración Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP), Uruguay’s state-owned energy company. Under this agreement, Topsoe will deliver technology and services for ANCAP’s hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) unit located at the La Teja Refinery in Montevideo.

The project will use Topsoe’s HydroFlex® technology, proprietary equipment and catalysts enabling the production of SAF and renewable diesel.

The project is expected to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2027, with commercial operations due to begin in 2030. Once operational, the facility will use rapeseed oil and beef tallow as feedstock to produce approximately 3,000 barrels of SAF and renewable diesel per day.

The project when operational, will avoid over 390,000 tons of CO₂ emissions - the equivalent of removing around 90,000 petrol-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year. [1]

Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:

“This project is an important step forward in advancing Uruguay’s sustainable fuel ambitions and, more importantly, resembles strong momentum for the rollout of renewable fuels across Latin America. This collaboration demonstrates how Topsoe’s proven technologies are contributing to creating progress on a global scale, and we look forward to working with ANCAP to deliver this critical project.”

José Pastorino, Energy Products Manager at ANCAP said:

“The HEFA project is the largest in the portfolio of the refining business for ANCAP. Furthermore, it is the most important project in terms of advancing towards our strategy for a more sustainable future for the energy landscape in Uruguay. We at ANCAP are eager to commence working in the engineering stage and look forward to working in it with Topsoe.”

According to the IEA, aviation accounts for about 2% of CO2 emissions, and aviation emissions are expected to double by 2050 as aviation demand grows[2]. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that in Latin America, air travel is expected to more than triple by 2050 and thereby double today’s aviation emissions in the region[3]. This agreement will help to address the growing demand for SAF in the region.

About HydroFlex

With HydroFlex, customers can convert various fats, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or fully renewable applications.

About ANCAP

Administración Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP) is Uruguay’s state-owned energy company and a key actor in ensuring affordable and accessible energy availability for the population, with a focus on promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.

Since 2021, Brussels Airport has been testing innovative mobility and energy solutions with the potential to make airport operations more sustainable. These innovations are part of the EU-funded STARGATE(opens in new window) project aimed to help create the green airports and aviation of the future. One of the solutions tested at the airport is a fully autonomous, electric shuttle, the “first of its kind in Belgium,” according to a news item(opens in new window) posted on the ‘Aviation Direct’ website. The shuttle is equipped with cameras and sensors, and it was initially tested on the airside – the airport’s restricted zone beyond the security checkpoints – from late 2024 to early 2025. It is now undergoing its second testing phase, running between the airport terminal and an employee parking area. Another innovation is the exploration of new uses for locally generated energy. The news item reports that at the start of 2025, approximately 100 homes from four communities in the vicinity were offered locally generated electricity from the airport’s solar panels for an entire year. During this trial phase, which ends in February 2026, STARGATE will assess whether such community energy projects are feasible and scalable. STARGATE also plans to transform staff and passenger transport at Brussels Airport. “A multimodal travel planner evaluates transport options based on various criteria and assists passengers and staff in planning their journeys,” the news item states. In the summer of 2025, the airport also introduced a new bicycle rental system for its 30 000 or so employees. An estimated 48 bicycles, almost half of which are electric, are available for rent at five stations. As the project enters its final stretch until October 2026, additional solutions will be trialled at the airport, including an autonomous cargo transport vehicle and a mobile fuel blending plant. At the same time, similar STARGATE initiatives are being carried out at different partner airports across Europe. The electrification of airside areas is being tested at Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos, an airport mobility plan is being developed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport and a new navigation app to improve airside vehicle safety has been introduced at Budapest Airport.

DevvStream and Southern may also file other documents with the SEC and Canadian securities regulatory authorities regarding the proposed transaction.","SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”) production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (“IP3”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) (together “the parties”).

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging “book-and-claim” and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (“MRV”) systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,” said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. “We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

“This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

“This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels,” said Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global. “We believe firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration, if ultimately pursued, is expected to allow us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to negotiate definitive collaboration agreements on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific collaboration arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals.

In a typical year, millions of holiday packages flood the logistics network. This surge usually drives up freight volumes (the amount of goods moving) and fuel demand simultaneously. However, the 2025 holiday season produced a rare and confusing anomaly that has left many investors scratching their heads.

While freight volumes remained relatively soft, indicating that consumers and businesses are spending cautiously, the price of diesel fuel surged. This creates a disconnect in the fundamental laws of supply and demand. Usually, weak demand leads to lower fuel prices. Instead, the cost of moving goods is rising even as the volume of goods moving slows.

For general industrial stocks like FedEx NYSE: FDX or retailers like Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN, this is a distinct warning sign. It suggests higher operating costs and lower profit margins heading into the first quarter of 2026. If it costs more to move fewer products, earnings will suffer.

However, for the companies that manufacture the fuel, this dynamic signals a massive profit windfall. Valero Energy NYSE: VLO and Phillips 66 NYSE: PSX are uniquely positioned to benefit from this diesel disconnect. While the broader economy worries about sticky inflation and logistics costs, these refiners are capitalizing on a market that is structurally short on supply.

The December Crack Back and the Diesel Margin Surge

To understand why these stocks are rising, investors must understand the crack spread. This financial metric represents the difference between the purchase price of crude oil and the selling price of refined products like diesel. It is, essentially, the refiner's gross profit margin.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, markets witnessed a phenomenon that traders are calling the December Crack Back. Margins for Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) in the New York Harbor market skyrocketed, hitting approximately $49 per barrel in late December—more than doubling from the low $20s seen just months prior in October.

This price spike is not driven by booming economic demand; it is driven by a supply shock. Three main factors are currently colliding to keep prices high:

Geopolitics: Tightened sanctions on Russian oil companies such as Rosneft and Lukoil in late 2025 effectively removed a significant volume of diesel from the global export market.

Winter Weather: Diesel fuel and home heating oil are chemically very similar. A cold snap in late 2025 increased demand for heating oil, drawing down the same inventories needed for trucking.

Capacity Cuts: Domestic refiners have permanently closed facilities to reduce costs, leaving the market with fewer barrels to go around.

For the general economy, high fuel prices during a freight recession increase the risk of a hard landing in 2026. However, for the refining sector, this supply shortage creates a high profit floor. Even if fewer trucks are on the road, the profit earned on every gallon of diesel sold remains historically high.

Valero Energy: The Operational Powerhouse

If the market is short on diesel, the company with the most functioning capacity stands to win the most.

Valero Energy has emerged as the clear operator's choice in this environment. The stock has outperformed the broader energy sector, gaining approximately 35% year-to-date.

Valero’s strategy is simple: operational excellence. While competitors have struggled with complicated restructurings, Valero has focused on running its machinery as efficiently as possible. In the third quarter of 2025, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.66, beating analyst expectations.

The key to Valero’s success is utilization. Their refineries have been running at near 97% capacity. In a market where margins are $49 per barrel, keeping utilization high translates directly into massive free cash flow.

Furthermore, Valero isn't just relying on old-school oil. The company is a leader in the transition to green energy through Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), its joint venture with Darling Ingredients. The expansion at their Port Arthur facility, completed earlier in 2025, allows them to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This creates a diversified revenue stream that appeals to investors looking for longevity. Valero captures the immediate upside of the diesel shortage while maintaining a foothold in the future of energy.

Phillips 66: The Architect of the Squeeze

While Valero profits from running hard, Phillips 66 is generating value by actively reshaping the market. In fact, Phillips 66 is partially responsible for the current high margins enjoyed by the entire industry.

In October 2025, Phillips 66 officially ceased crude processing at its Los Angeles Refinery (Wilmington/Carson). This move removed approximately 139,000 barrels per day of supply from the West Coast market. By taking this supply offline, Phillips 66 tightened the local market, driving up prices for the fuel produced by its remaining assets.

This aggressive decision-making is primarily driven by pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which has pushed the company to improve performance. In response, Phillips 66 launched the Streamline 66 initiative, a plan designed to cut costs and enhance shareholder returns.

The company has successfully executed this strategy, exceeding its $3 billion asset divestiture goal by late 2025, including the sale of its stake in a Swiss retail business and various pipeline assets.

Investment firm Raymond James maintained an Outperform rating on the stock in late December, citing the success of these self-help measures. For investors, Phillips 66 is a strategic play. It offers value through cost-cutting, share buybacks, and a more efficient portfolio, rather than just raw production volume.

2026 Outlook: How to Position Your Portfolio

The 2025 Christmas Stress Test has clarified the investment landscape for the new year. The global economy is facing a structural shortage of diesel refining capacity. This shortage insulates refiners from the economic headwinds that might hurt other industrial sectors.

Investors looking to trade this disconnect have two clear paths:

The Offensive Play: Valero Energy is the vehicle for immediate exposure to high profit margins. Their high utilization rates and established renewable diesel operations make them the primary beneficiary of the current price environment.

The Strategic Play: Phillips 66 offers a compelling narrative of restructuring. By closing high-cost assets like the LA refinery and satisfying activist demands, they are unlocking value on the balance sheet rather than just the income statement.

As we move into 2026, the data indicates that while the cost of shipping goods may remain a burden for the economy, the companies producing the fuel remain a bright spot for portfolios.

The agreement marks CALC’s fifth commitment with Airbus, bringing its total Airbus backlog to 282 aircraft, including 203 A320neo-family jets.

CALC Chief Executive Mike Poon said the new order reflects both continued customer demand and the lessor’s commitment to fleet modernisation. Airbus EVP Sales Benoît de Saint-Exupéry described CALC as a long-standing and valued partner whose repeat commitments underscore the A320neo’s market strength.

The faithful A320neo remains the world’s most-ordered single-aisle family with more than 19,000 commitments worldwide. Airbus says the type delivers at least 20% lower fuel burn and CO₂ emissions versus the previous-generation A320ceo, while offering one of the widest cabins in the single-aisle segment.

The SCS Global Services certification under the international ISCC CORSIA PLUS protocol is recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Certification includes the ISCC CORSIA PLUS Low-LUC seal.

The certification employs rigorous sustainability standards that verified Brazilian soybeans must meet, based on traceability and other agricultural practices, said Bunge, which noted that it is the first company to certify soybeans under the protocol.

“This certification demonstrates that it is possible to produce soybeans sustainably and with low emissions, meeting the most demanding international criteria,” said Pamela Moreira, sustainability director for South America at Bunge. “Brazil’s vast productive potential and advanced agricultural techniques represent significant potential to contribute to the energy transition. This achievement reinforces that sustainably grown soybeans can be part of the solution for the advancement of agroforestry systems.”

The ISCC CORSIA PLUS certification is part of the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) program, created to encourage the use of renewable fuels in global air transportation.

The Low-LUC recognition guarantees that the certified soybeans, through improved management and productivity practices, present a low risk of indirect land-use change, meaning they are not associated with new agricultural area expansion, Bunge said.

“Beyond detailed technical criteria and rigorous audits, producer management practices play a fundamental role in this certification,” Moreira said. “This reinforces our journey of having an active role in our supply chain, engaging and supporting our producers in this transition, but also connecting them with new opportunities.

“We are aware of the challenges in scaling this certification and, therefore, its result has great weight for the sector, reinforcing the credibility of Brazilian agricultural production. Although this initial certification applies to our Rondonópolis unit, it represents a fundamental step in expanding the availability of soybean raw material for the growing SAF market.”

Modern tallow markets operate within a complex three-tier classification system based on disease risk assessment.
What Policy Changes Are Driving Tallow Trade Disruption?
Tallow trade affected by US policy shifts requires market participants to develop comprehensive regulatory intelligence capabilities, incorporating policy monitoring, compliance cost analysis, and strategic planning for multiple regulatory scenarios.
Trade policy shifts continue reshaping traditional trade relationships and commercial strategies throughout the renewable energy sector.","Understanding Tallow Trade Fundamentals

The global renewable energy transition has fundamentally altered traditional commodity markets, with animal-derived feedstocks emerging as critical components in biofuel production pathways. Tallow, classified as an animal by-product under international trade regulations, represents one of the most significant feedstocks in this transformation, bridging agricultural waste streams with advanced fuel technologies. Furthermore, tallow trade affected by US policy shifts has become a defining characteristic of modern commodity markets.

Modern tallow markets operate within a complex three-tier classification system based on disease risk assessment. Categories 1 and 2 tallow qualify for Tallow Methyl Ester (TME) production and benefit from double-counting mechanisms under specific renewable energy frameworks, while Category 3 tallow serves as the primary input for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) Class III and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

Regional production centers have established distinct competitive advantages based on livestock density and processing infrastructure. Australian facilities benefit from record feedlot capacity of 1.7 million head with slaughter rates increasing nearly 10% year-on-year, while Brazilian operations have historically dominated export markets through integrated supply chains connecting cattle ranching with biodiesel refineries.

The commodity's unique properties create natural price correlations with competing feedstocks, particularly used cooking oil and soybean oil derivatives. These relationships generate complex arbitrage opportunities across geographic markets, with pricing differentials reflecting transportation costs, regulatory compliance requirements, and local mandates for renewable fuel blending.

What Policy Changes Are Driving Tallow Trade Disruption?

US Tariff Implementation Framework

Washington's implementation of a 50% composite tariff on Brazilian tallow imports, effective August 2025, represents the most significant policy intervention reshaping global trade flows. This tariff structure operates alongside the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which creates preferential treatment for North American feedstocks while reducing eligibility for foreign materials.

The tariff's impact became immediately apparent in bilateral trade data, with Brazilian exports to the US dropping sharply from September 2025 onwards. Previously, Brazil supplied 96% of US tallow imports in 2024, according to trade statistics from the US Department of Agriculture, making this policy shift particularly disruptive to established supply chains.

Additional regulatory uncertainty stems from potential modifications to Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits. Reports suggest the US EPA may indefinitely delay proposals to halve RIN credits for biofuels produced from foreign feedstocks, creating ongoing market speculation about future incentive structures.

The 45Z credit mechanism introduces sliding-scale incentives based on carbon intensity scoring, with soybean-based biodiesel eligible for approximately 32¢/USG in 2025, projected to increase to approximately 64¢/USG in 2026 as indirect land-use change penalties are removed from the calculation framework.

Comparative Policy Landscape Analysis

Table: Regional Policy Implementation Timeline and Trade Impact

Region Policy Mechanism Implementation Status Feedstock Treatment United States 50% Brazilian tariffs + 45Z credits Active August 2025 Domestic preference structure European Union RED III transposition January 2026 rollout Category-based restrictions Australia Cleaner Fuels Programme Mid-2026 launch A$1.1 billion stimulus package Netherlands 0.5 multiplication factor 2026 implementation Category 3 limitations France Category 3 caps 2027 scheduled Volume restrictions planned Germany GHG quota exclusions Currently active Category 3 complete exclusion

European Union member states demonstrate significant divergence in RED III transposition approaches, creating regulatory arbitrage opportunities across jurisdictions. Nordic countries, France, Italy, and Spain maintain higher utilisation rates for Category 3 volumes, while Germany excludes Category 3 entirely from greenhouse gas reduction quotas.

This fragmented implementation creates uneven demand signals for 2026, with southern and Nordic markets remaining active buyers while northern European ports face restricted access for specific tallow categories. Consequently, the resulting compliance complexity forces market participants to develop jurisdiction-specific certification pathways and documentation systems.

Australia's A$1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Programme represents a different policy approach, focusing on domestic demand stimulus rather than trade restrictions. Industry participants hope this initiative will precede a federal biofuels mandate, providing long-term investment certainty through guaranteed offtake mechanisms.

How Are Regional Regulatory Frameworks Affecting Market Access?

European Union Compliance Complexity

The EU's animal by-products regulation establishes a sophisticated risk-based categorisation system that directly impacts market access and pricing dynamics. Categories 1 and 2, listed in RED III Annex IX Part B, benefit from double-counting mechanisms in specific member states, enhancing their carbon credit value and market competitiveness.

This regulatory framework creates material compliance costs through mandatory chain of custody certification, carbon intensity calculations, and third-party verification of feedstock origins. The documentation requirements extend throughout the supply chain, from slaughter facilities to end-use refineries, creating barriers to entry for smaller market participants.

Member state discretion in RED III transposition has generated significant regulatory divergence. The Netherlands plans to apply a 0.5 multiplication factor from 2026, effectively reducing the volume of qualifying tallow, while France plans caps on Category 3 tallow from 2027. These restrictions contrast sharply with southern and Nordic markets that maintain more accommodating frameworks.

Regulatory Arbitrage Opportunities

The multiplication factor mechanism creates immediate arbitrage opportunities for exporters capable of navigating multiple jurisdictions. Tallow volumes that face restrictions in Germany or the Netherlands retain full value in France, Italy, or Spain, incentivising sophisticated logistics and certification strategies.

The fragmented EU regulatory approach creates complex compliance requirements for market participants, with divergence between ambitious renewable fuel targets and member state restrictions generating inefficiencies throughout the supply chain.

Carbon intensity scoring methodologies vary significantly across member states, creating additional complexity for international traders. These variations reflect different approaches to lifecycle assessment calculations, transportation emissions accounting, and sustainability criteria verification processes.

The double-counting benefit available for Categories 1 and 2 in certain jurisdictions creates premium pricing opportunities compared to Category 3 materials, despite similar technical specifications. This regulatory distinction drives market segmentation and influences production planning at rendering facilities worldwide.

Where Are Tallow Flows Being Redirected Due to Policy Barriers?

Asian Market Absorption Capacity

Singapore has emerged as the primary destination for redirected tallow flows, receiving 27% of Australian exports in the year to September 2025. This consolidation reflects Singapore's role as a regional hub for renewable fuel production and its favourable regulatory treatment of animal-derived feedstocks.

The Asian market's absorption capacity has been enhanced by substantial growth in Chinese used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) flows. Chinese exports to Singapore reached 180,122 tonnes through October 2025, already exceeding the full-year 2024 total of 173,340 tonnes. This growth pattern indicates robust regional demand for renewable feedstock blending.

Price competitiveness drives much of this regional reallocation, with B30 delivered Singapore values averaging $732.58/tonne between April and December 2025, compared to $792.90/tonne for B30 UCOME delivered to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp over the same period. This $60.32/tonne discount reflects both transportation advantages and reduced regulatory compliance costs in Asian markets.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel production represents an emerging demand driver throughout the region, though pricing competitiveness remains the primary determinant of feedstock selection. In addition, regional SAF mandates and carbon pricing mechanisms are still developing, creating future upside potential for tallow demand growth.

Brazilian Market Rebalancing Strategies

Brazilian domestic absorption has increased dramatically following US market access restrictions, with tallow utilisation by the biodiesel industry rising from 5% in July 2025 to 9.5% in October 2025. This rapid adjustment demonstrates the domestic industry's capacity to absorb volumes previously destined for export markets.

Seasonal demand dynamics continue to influence Brazilian market patterns, with November 2025 experiencing cooling demand due to typical drops in diesel consumption. However, tallow prices remained high compared to Australian alternatives, limiting export competitiveness to alternative markets despite improved domestic absorption.

Soybean oil price correlation creates additional complexity for Brazilian exporters, as tallow pricing tends to track soy oil movements. Industry participants anticipate that projected declines in soybean oil prices could potentially restore export economics viability, particularly for EU-certified material destined for European markets.

Brazilian exporters are strategically positioning for potential early 2026 EU shipments by acquiring necessary sustainability certifications. This preparation reflects expectations that European demand will strengthen as RED III implementation creates tighter supply-demand balances across member states.

What Compliance Challenges Are Emerging for Market Participants?

Certification and Traceability Requirements

Contemporary compliance frameworks require comprehensive documentation systems spanning the entire supply chain. Chain of custody certification must track material flows from origin through processing, while carbon intensity calculations demand sophisticated lifecycle assessment capabilities that many smaller participants struggle to implement cost-effectively.

Third-party verification requirements add another layer of complexity and expense, with accredited auditors necessary to validate sustainability claims. These requirements create material transaction costs that favour larger, vertically integrated operations capable of spreading compliance expenses across substantial volume throughput.

Documentation standards vary significantly across jurisdictions, forcing international traders to maintain multiple certification pathways simultaneously. EU sustainability criteria differ from US EPA requirements, while Asian markets often rely on less stringent documentation, creating operational complexity for global market participants.

Carbon intensity scoring methodologies represent particularly challenging technical requirements, with different calculation approaches determining tax credit eligibility across various markets. These methodologies require specialised expertise and sophisticated data management systems that create barriers to market entry.

Risk Management Framework Development

The evolving regulatory landscape demands sophisticated risk management approaches that traditional commodity trading frameworks cannot adequately address. Policy risk exposure requires hedging strategies that account for potential changes in tariff structures, credit eligibility, and certification requirements.

Basis differential expansion between regions reflects increasing policy divergence and compliance costs. Forward curve volatility during policy transition periods creates additional pricing complexity that requires enhanced analytical capabilities and more sophisticated trading strategies.

Tallow trade affected by US policy shifts requires market participants to develop comprehensive regulatory intelligence capabilities, incorporating policy monitoring, compliance cost analysis, and strategic planning for multiple regulatory scenarios.

How Are Investment Decisions Being Influenced by Policy Uncertainty?

Capital Allocation Impacts

Investment decision frameworks must now incorporate policy risk assessment as a primary variable in project evaluation. The 45Z credit structure's sliding scale approach creates uncertainty about future incentive values, complicating long-term investment planning for domestic US biofuel production facilities.

Australian market participants await clarity on biofuel mandate implementation following the Cleaner Fuels Programme launch. Industry hopes for federal mandate follow-through reflect recognition that guaranteed offtake mechanisms are typically required for final investment decisions in capital-intensive renewable fuel projects.

European renewable fuel obligation variations across member states influence regional processing capacity development decisions. However, investors must evaluate not only current regulatory frameworks but also anticipated harmonisation efforts and potential policy convergence scenarios over project lifecycles.

Transportation infrastructure adaptation requires substantial capital commitment with uncertain policy-dependent returns. Pipeline systems, storage facilities, and port infrastructure investments must account for potential trade flow redirections based on evolving regulatory landscapes.

Strategic Planning Considerations

Vertical integration trends reflect efforts to reduce exposure to regulatory arbitrage and compliance complexity. Domestic feedstock preference driving consolidation creates competitive advantages for integrated operations capable of controlling supply chains from source to end-use.

Geographic diversification strategies must balance market access opportunities against compliance cost variations. Furthermore, companies are developing multi-jurisdictional approaches that maintain flexibility to redirect volumes based on regulatory changes and market conditions.

Technology investment priorities increasingly focus on compliance automation and data management systems. Carbon intensity tracking capabilities and certification workflow management represent essential infrastructure investments for sustained market participation.

What Market Structure Changes Are Policy Shifts Creating?

Vertical Integration Trends

The regulatory complexity is accelerating industry consolidation as smaller participants struggle with compliance costs and documentation requirements. Vertically integrated operations gain competitive advantages through scale economies in certification processes and enhanced supply chain control.

Regional processing capacity development reflects policy incentives favouring domestic production. US tariff impacts benefit facilities through 45Z credit eligibility restrictions on foreign feedstocks, while European plants must navigate member state variations in category restrictions and multiplication factors.

Supply chain diversification imperatives drive investment in multiple geographic sourcing options. Companies are establishing procurement relationships across different regulatory jurisdictions to maintain flexibility as policy landscapes evolve.

Price Discovery Mechanism Evolution

Traditional pricing benchmarks face challenges from regulatory fragmentation and compliance cost variations. Basis differential expansion between regions reflects not only transportation costs but also regulatory compliance expenses and market access restrictions.

Forward curve construction must incorporate policy risk premiums that reflect potential regulatory changes. Commodity market volatility in pricing models becomes essential for accurate valuation in an environment of heightened policy uncertainty.

Transaction cost increases from compliance requirements affect market liquidity and price discovery efficiency. The additional documentation and verification steps create friction that favours larger transactions and longer-term contractual relationships.

Strategic Outlook for 2026-2027

Policy Convergence Scenarios

US RIN credit modifications remain under consideration, with potential implications for foreign feedstock competitiveness. Indefinite delay reports create ongoing uncertainty that affects long-term planning and investment decisions across the industry.

EU member state harmonisation prospects depend on European Commission guidance and political coordination efforts. Tariff trade disruptions in some jurisdictions create temporary arbitrage opportunities while increasing overall market uncertainty.

Asia-Pacific regulatory framework development remains in early stages, with significant potential for future policy intervention as regional governments pursue carbon reduction targets and energy security objectives.

Market Efficiency Implications

The increasing complexity of regulatory compliance creates material efficiency losses through transaction cost increases and regional price divergence. These inefficiencies may persist until policy frameworks achieve greater stability and harmonisation.

Long-term supply security considerations drive strategic stockpiling and diversified sourcing strategies that may not represent optimal economic allocation but provide risk mitigation against policy disruptions.

Carbon pricing mechanism integration across jurisdictions represents a potential pathway toward policy convergence, though implementation timelines and technical specifications remain uncertain across major markets.

In the early days of aviation, pilots relied on mechanical ingenuity and sheer human skill to keep aircraft aloft. The Wright brothers’ 1903 Flyer was a marvel of wood, wire and fabric, controlled by warping wings and a rudimentary elevator. Fast-forward to today, and the cockpit has transformed into a high-tech command center where computers orchestrate everything from takeoff to landing. This shift didn’t happen overnight; it was a gradual infusion of digital technology that fundamentally altered how planes fly and how the industry operates. Drawing from historical accounts and recent innovations, we explore this evolution, crediting insights from sources like the Introduction to Aerospace Flight Vehicles by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which details the progression from basic flight vehicles to sophisticated systems.

Computers first entered aviation in subtle ways, often as tools for calculation rather than direct control. During World War II, analog computers helped with bomb aiming and navigation, but it was the post-war era that saw digital systems take root. By the 1950s, devices like the Bendix Central Air Data Computer used gears and synchros to compute airspeed and altitude, as noted in posts from X users discussing vintage aviation tech. These early systems laid the groundwork for more integrated roles, evolving from passive calculators to active participants in flight management.

The turning point came with the advent of fly-by-wire technology in the 1970s. Instead of mechanical linkages, electronic signals from the pilot’s controls are interpreted by computers, which then adjust flight surfaces. This innovation, pioneered in military jets like the F-16, allowed for unprecedented stability and efficiency. Commercial aviation soon followed, with Airbus introducing fly-by-wire in the A320 in 1988, a move that reduced weight and improved fuel economy.

From Cables to Code: The Rise of Fly-by-Wire Systems

Fly-by-wire systems represent a paradigm shift, where software mediates between pilot intent and aircraft response. Computers process inputs thousands of times per second, making micro-adjustments for smoother flights, as highlighted in a recent X post about modern airliners’ control surfaces. This technology not only enhances safety by preventing stalls but also enables envelope protection, where the system refuses commands that could endanger the plane.

Beyond control, computers revolutionized navigation. The inertial navigation systems of the 1960s gave way to GPS-integrated avionics in the 1990s, allowing precise positioning without ground-based aids. According to Centennial of Flight, these advancements ensured planes could reach destinations safely and on time, transforming global travel logistics.

The impact on the aviation industry extends to design and manufacturing. Computer-aided design (CAD) software has streamlined aircraft development, enabling simulations that test aerodynamics virtually before a single prototype is built. This has accelerated innovation cycles, reducing costs and time-to-market for new models.

Autopilot Evolution: From Gyroscopes to AI-Driven Guidance

Autopilots, once simple gyroscopic devices holding course, now incorporate artificial intelligence for complex tasks. Elmer Sperry’s 1914 invention evolved into systems that can manage entire flights, as described in the same Centennial of Flight resource. Modern autopilots integrate with flight management systems (FMS), optimizing routes for fuel efficiency and weather avoidance.

In recent years, AI has pushed boundaries further. A December 2025 X post recounted an incident where an autonomous system detected a pressurization issue at 23,000 feet, took control, communicated with air traffic control, and safely landed the plane. This level of autonomy hints at a future where pilots oversee rather than actively fly, raising questions about human roles in the cockpit.

The aviation sector has seen operational efficiencies soar thanks to these technologies. Airlines use big data analytics to predict maintenance needs, minimizing downtime. Spartan College outlines how such predictive maintenance has improved safety records, with fewer incidents due to mechanical failures.

Digital Twins and Simulation: Redefining Aircraft Design

One of the most profound changes is the use of digital twins—virtual replicas of physical aircraft that simulate real-world conditions. Engineers can test modifications in software environments, iterating designs rapidly. This approach, detailed in BAA Training’s blog on 2024 trends, has led to lighter, more efficient airframes, contributing to the industry’s push toward sustainability.

However, this reliance on computers isn’t without challenges. Recent IT meltdowns, like the Alaska Airlines grounding in late 2025, underscore vulnerabilities. As reported by NPR, these incidents highlight the need for robust backups and cybersecurity measures in an increasingly digital ecosystem.

On the innovation front, computers have enabled advancements in electric and hybrid propulsion. Simulations optimize battery placements and power distribution, paving the way for greener flights. The Transport & Environment analysis warns that without continued innovation, decarbonization goals could falter, emphasizing the role of computational modeling in breakthroughs.

Safety Enhancements Through Computational Intelligence

Safety has been the biggest beneficiary of computational integration. Systems like the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) use radar and algorithms to prevent mid-air collisions, a technology that has saved countless lives since its 1990s rollout. Enhanced ground proximity warning systems (EGPWS) provide terrain awareness, further reducing accident rates.

In private aviation, emerging standards by 2030 may mandate predictive tech features, as per News Channel 3-12. These include AI-driven diagnostics that foresee failures, shifting from reactive to proactive safety protocols.

The military sector has driven many of these advancements. The U.S. Air Force’s upgrades, discussed in Simple Flying, balance legacy fleets with cutting-edge computing, incorporating AI for threat detection and autonomous operations.

Industry-Wide Transformations: Efficiency and Economics

Economically, computers have reshaped airline operations. Revenue management systems use algorithms to optimize ticket pricing, maximizing profits amid fluctuating demand. This data-driven approach, evolving since the 1980s, has made air travel more accessible while boosting carrier revenues.

Training has also been revolutionized. Flight simulators, powered by advanced graphics and physics engines, allow pilots to practice scenarios without risking lives or equipment. AOPA’s 1992 article on computers in aviation foresaw this trend, which has only intensified with virtual reality integrations.

Moreover, the push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) relies on computational modeling to assess viability. Innovations like those in BAA Training’s list of game-changers include computer-optimized engines that reduce emissions, aligning with global environmental mandates.

Challenges and Future Horizons in Aviation Computing

Despite triumphs, the integration of computers brings hurdles. Cybersecurity threats loom large, with potential hacks disrupting critical systems. Industry insiders note that as planes become more connected, safeguarding digital infrastructure is paramount, echoing concerns from the NPR report on system failures.

Looking ahead, quantum computing could further transform aviation by solving complex optimization problems instantaneously, from route planning to material science for lighter composites. X posts from aviation engineers highlight ongoing developments, such as variable camber wings reprogrammed in flight, a concept Airbus explored in the 1980s.

The Boeing 737 MAX saga illustrates both potential and pitfalls. The MCAS system, introduced to handle engine placement changes, relied on software to maintain stability but led to tragedies when flaws emerged. A 2025 X post from an aircraft maintenance engineer explained how this small change amplified the need for rigorous software validation.

Pioneering Autonomy: Toward Pilotless Skies

Autonomy is the next frontier. Companies like Boeing and Airbus are testing unmanned cargo flights, leveraging AI for decision-making. The Amprius Technologies piece on future safety underscores how technology ensures reliable electric aircraft operations.

In urban air mobility, eVTOL vehicles depend on computers for navigation in crowded skies. These advancements promise to decongest roads and revolutionize short-haul travel, backed by simulations that predict traffic patterns.

Yet, regulatory bodies must keep pace. The FAA and EASA are updating frameworks to certify AI systems, ensuring they meet safety thresholds without stifling innovation.

Global Impacts and Ethical Considerations

On a global scale, computational advancements have democratized aviation in developing regions. Low-cost carriers use data analytics to expand routes, connecting remote areas. However, this raises ethical questions about job displacement, as automation reduces the need for human crews.

Diversity in aviation benefits from tech, with simulators making training more inclusive. Women and underrepresented groups gain access to high-fidelity practice, fostering a broader talent pool.

As we stand on the cusp of 2030, the fusion of computers and aviation continues to evolve. From the modular designs of the 747, analogized in an X post to software architecture, to AI-piloted emergencies, the trajectory is clear: computers aren’t just tools; they’re the very fabric of modern flight.

Sustaining Momentum in Technological Flight

To sustain this momentum, investment in R&D is crucial. Governments and private firms are pouring resources into next-gen computing, like edge AI for real-time decisions without cloud reliance.

Challenges like the stall in aircraft innovation, as per the Transport & Environment study, call for renewed focus on breakthroughs. Hybrid models combining human oversight with machine precision could mitigate risks.

Ultimately, the story of computers in aviation is one of relentless progress, turning what was once daring human endeavor into a symphony of silicon and sky. With each advancement, the industry soars higher, safer and more efficiently, promising a future where the impossible becomes routine.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-5071-1767059067.jpeg,N,,2025-12-30 08:56:53.099481

Additionally, the deadline for the intermediate target of 50% reduced GHG emissions was changed from 2030 to 2035.
Neste's conventional fuel refinery, located in Porvoo, Finland, was supposed to be turned into a renewable refining hub by 2035, and this played an essential part in Neste's climate strategy.
Right now, Neste's SAF production alone reaches up to 1.5 million tons per year, and is expected to grow to 2.2 million tons in just two years from now.
Multiple operators around the world have started to incorporate SAF, either from Neste or other suppliers, into their regular flight operations.","Neste's initial, and by its own words ""ambitious"" climate goal was to achieve full carbon-neutral production by 2035. The revised target looks significantly different, both in terms of time and percentage; Neste is now aiming for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Additionally, the deadline for the intermediate target of 50% reduced GHG emissions was changed from 2030 to 2035.

In short, the main reason for this revised target is the financial cost. Neste's conventional fuel refinery, located in Porvoo, Finland, was supposed to be turned into a renewable refining hub by 2035, and this played an essential part in Neste's climate strategy. Earlier this year, it announced that this transformation had to be delayed, which also triggered the need to reassess the company's climate strategy and set new, more realistic targets.

The Finnish green fuel company has already pumped more than $2 billion into expanding its renewable refinery in Rotterdam. The transformation of the Porvoo facility will also continue, but it will take longer than initially expected.

So far, Neste has reduced GHG emissions in its operations by 24% compared to 2019 levels. This is an important achievement, considering that production of renewable fuels continued to grow exponentially during this time, and it only keeps getting bigger. By 2027, Neste expects to produce 6.8 million tons of renewable fuels per year.

Neste currently has active refineries on three continents, all using waste, residues, and various raw materials as primary resources. The Neste MY SAF is made from residues such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, and is currently certified to be used in blends of up to 50% with conventional jet fuel for commercial use.

Right now, Neste's SAF production alone reaches up to 1.5 million tons per year, and is expected to grow to 2.2 million tons in just two years from now. Multiple operators around the world have started to incorporate SAF, either from Neste or other suppliers, into their regular flight operations. Most recently, Neste announced that its cooperation with Cathay Pacific will expand the use of SAF in three major regions: the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/worlds-top-saf-producer-revises-its-own-climate-goals-263408_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 06:56:36.360534

Grounded in real-world constraints – from financing to reliability – the continent is combining green hydrogen, renewables, natural gas, electrification and targeted investment to lower carbon intensity without slowing development.

Green Hydrogen Gains Momentum

Green hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a practical decarbonization tool, particularly in refining, where it can replace grey hydrogen used in hydrotreating and hydrocracking. This allows operators to reduce emissions while maintaining essential refinery operations. The HySHiFT project led by Sasol demonstrates this application, integrating green hydrogen into Fischer-Tropsch facilities to produce sustainable aviation fuel via a 200 MW electrolyzer at its Secunda plant.

Governments are also laying the groundwork to scale green hydrogen beyond domestic use. In January 2025, ministers from Algeria, Tunisia, Austria, Germany and Italy formalized a declaration advancing the 3,300-km SoutH2 Corridor, positioning Algeria as a key supplier to Europe. Angola is pursuing export-focused green hydrogen as well; Sonangol has confirmed the country’s first green hydrogen project, expected to produce 400,000 tons of hydrogen annually from 2027, supporting the country’s goal of reaching 70% renewable capacity by 2035.

Renewables at the Asset Level

​​Renewable energy is increasingly integrated directly into upstream operations, reducing reliance on diesel and minimizing flaring. Hybrid power systems combining renewables and gas help operators cut Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions while improving reliability. At Uganda’s Tilenga oil field, associated gas separated at the central processing facility is used to generate the electricity needed for processing operations, reducing flaring and external power dependence.

Natural Gas as a Transition Enabler

Natural gas remains a central pillar of Africa’s decarbonization strategy, particularly as a replacement for diesel or oil in power generation. Switching to gas turbines, often combined with renewable power, reduces emissions at compressor stations and production facilities. In Nigeria, a dedicated upstream facility is being developed to supply gas from the Iseni field to the Dangote Fertilizer and Petrochemical Plant – an initiative aligned with the government’s “Decade of Gas” strategy to strengthen domestic industrial energy supply.

Gas is also being deployed at the system level through flare reduction and commercialization programs. In December 2025, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission issued permits to 28 companies under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Program, converting flared gas into a commercial resource. The initiative is expected to cut 6 million tons of emissions per year and create up to 100,000 jobs, turning an environmental liability into an economic opportunity.

Technology Driving Lower-Carbon Operations

Innovative technologies and low-emission design are shaping Africa’s energy transition. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is gaining traction as a way to reduce emissions from large gas developments while maintaining production. In Libya, Eni and the National Oil Corporation are advancing the Structures A&E gas project, including a CCUS facility at the Mellitah Complex, scheduled for completion in December 2027.

Electrification is extending offshore as well. New FPSOs, like the Agogo FPSO in Angola, are designed with fully electric topside and marine systems, reflecting a growing shift toward lower-emissions offshore production.

Financing the Transition

Scaling these pathways requires long-term, blended financing. Multilateral institutions are increasingly bridging gaps. The Climate Investment Funds selected Egypt, Namibia and South Africa to participate in a $1 billion industrial decarbonization program, alongside countries including Brazil, Mexico and Turkey, accelerating low-carbon technologies while prioritizing workforce reskilling and community protections.

In Egypt, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting corporate-level decarbonization. A $25 million facility for Arabian Cement Company will fund a hydrogen injection system to reduce emissions by an estimated 120,000 tons per year, illustrating how targeted investments can deliver substantial reductions while advancing national decarbonization goals. Together, these initiatives show that financing – not technology alone – often determines whether decarbonization moves from pilot to scale.",https://ecpbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/27090934/Decarbonization-initiatives.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 03:56:31.154141

IATA expects fuel to account for 26.4% of airline operating costs in 2025, and it continues to describe fuel as typically 25% to 30% of total expenses, illustrating the importance of efficiency gains for both the bottom line and the environment.

Aviation’s climate impact is also under sharper scrutiny. The International Energy Agency estimates aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, with emissions approaching 950 Mt CO2 as traffic recovered. Against that backdrop, the UN’s net-zero coalition messaging has been blunt that, to keep 1.5°C within reach, emissions need to fall by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Why ramp decisions matter

The industry often frames decarbonisation around sustainable aviation fuel, new aircraft and air traffic modernisation, but operational improvements remain one of the most immediate levers.

ICAO’s environmental reporting describes “operational improvements” as a wedge in its basket of measures that can reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions across aircraft operator and airport activities, including ground operator processes and flight planning.

That is where pre-flight ground operations come into focus, particularly weight discipline and load management. These are not glamorous initiatives, but they are scalable, measurable and can be integrated into standard procedures without waiting for new fuels or airframes. In a region where widebody utilisation is high and turnaround windows are tight, small changes replicated across thousands of sectors can add up to material savings.

Centre of gravity optimisation

Load controllers already operate within strict safety limits, yet the centre of gravity still influences drag and, therefore, fuel burn. Airbus summarises the principle simply in its fuel economy guidance, stating, “For most Airbus aircraft, an aft CG position saves fuel,” linking the benefit to reduced trim drag and the avoidance of excess weight.

The physics becomes especially relevant on longer sectors. A Delft University thesis examining CG shift and trim drag derived that, on a 9,300 km flight, roughly 780 kg of fuel could be saved when the trim drag coefficient decreases by 1%, while also acknowledging the operational limits that constrain how much CG can be shifted through loading.

For operators, the practical takeaway is not to chase an idealised aft CG at all costs, but to build a repeatable loading philosophy that consistently avoids forward-heavy outcomes when alternatives exist. That demands tight coordination between load planning and operational realities such as late bags, cargo constraints, and hold access sequencing.

Weight and consumables

Weight is often discussed as a design issue, but ramp processes determine how much weight is carried unnecessarily on each departure. Potable water is a clear example because uplift practices can drift toward conservatism, especially when multiple flight durations and passenger loads share similar catering patterns.

OpenAirlines, a fuel-efficiency software provider, provides a practical illustration of the cost of excess uplift: “500kg of potable water unused during a flight of 9 hours will cost 150kg of additional fuel to carry to the destination.” Satair, an Airbus services business, describes how some airlines have installed standpipes to cap potable water levels, noting that limiting a tank from 60 gallons to 40 gallons “can save around 33% of the weight.”

These numbers matter because they translate a routine provisioning choice into a fuel and emissions consequence. The most effective programmes treat water uplift like a variable, not a constant, using route history, passenger count, flight time and uplift reliability to set controlled buffers rather than defaulting to full tanks.

Lighter ULDs create savings

Unit Load Devices are another underused lever because they sit at the intersection of safety, handling and weight. Even small reductions per unit scale rapidly when multiplied across a widebody belly operation or a cargo-heavy passenger network.

Swiss WorldCargo quantified the impact of a fleetwide container changeover in 2025, noting that newer containers have a “reduction of the tare weight of 22 kg per AKE type.” IATA’s life cycle assessment guidance for ULDs also notes the trade-offs, but confirms the core benefit that “a lighter composite ULD may reduce fuel burn and, therefore, climate change impacts.”

For Middle East carriers with high utilisation and strong cargo mix, ULD tare reduction can be one of the rare initiatives that improves fuel efficiency without adding process complexity to the aircraft. The work is front-loaded into procurement, repair capability and handling discipline, then quietly delivers on every sector.

Last minute changes and fuel burn

Load and trim accuracy can be eroded by late operational events. Last-minute changes are a normal part of airline operations, but their impact on weight and balance calculations is often reflected in flight plan conservatism.

When late bags, cargo swaps, or passenger changes are not cleanly integrated into the final numbers, the system tends to compensate by increasing fuel carriage, either directly or indirectly, because uncertainty pushes planners toward buffers.

This is where the operational discipline of reissuing accurate figures becomes a fuel strategy rather than just a compliance task. The goal is not to reduce safety margins. It is to prevent avoidable margin stacking, where small unknowns across multiple categories compound into unnecessary uplift.

Removing dead load

The simplest form of weight reduction is not improved loading, but not carrying what is not needed. Many fleets carry deadload items for redundancy or convenience, even when operational practice and station support have evolved. Spare wheels, tyres and non-essential equipment are easy to justify individually, but they become expensive when carried across every flight.

Airbus’s fuel economy guidance is explicit on the principle, stating, “Excess weight costs fuel. Minimise zero fuel weight and embarked fuel.” In practice, deadload reviews require cross-functional agreement among engineering, flight operations, and ground services, because operational risk tolerance varies by network and station capabilities. Still, this is one of the few initiatives that can deliver savings immediately once the policy is updated.

These ground-operation levers do not replace sustainable aviation fuel or new aircraft, but they complement them. Reuters reporting in December 2025 captured the industry’s concern that SAF supply remains far below what targets imply, with IATA projecting that only 0.8% of total jet fuel consumption could be met by SAF availability in 2026. That reality makes operational savings even more valuable because they can be deployed now across the existing fleet.

For airlines, the practical path is to industrialise the basics. Standardise loading targets where feasible, use route-level potable water ratios, procure lighter ULDs at scale, and treat flight plan revision after last-minute changes as a fuel control point, not a paperwork step. For regulators and airport stakeholders, the opportunity is to support consistent processes that reduce ground delays and make accurate weight finalisation easier, because predictability is a fuel strategy in itself.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/30/Untitled-design-2025-12-30T104821.072.png,N,,2025-12-30 03:56:35.517876

2025 saw a number of high profile deployments of UK military forces both close to home and across the globe, including the eight month long voyage of HMS Prince of Wales and its carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific and back, reinforcement of NATO’s Eastern borders amid airspace incursions by Russian drones, and massive multinational exercises involving thousands of personnel. At the same time, British forces have continued long-standing operations in the Middle East battling some of the remaining remnants of ISIS and supporting regional security.

Photographers from the Ministry of Defence, British Army, Royal Air Force, and Royal Navy – trained by the multi-service Defence School of Photography (DSoP) at RAF Cosford – are an almost constant presence wherever British military personnel travel. DSoP additionally offers training courses for other personnel whose role may at times benefit from them having a certain level of photographic knowledge and ability.

Beyond their public and media relations value, the images captured by these photographers are important historical records and, in certain situations, a trained photographers’ skills in operational situations can be invaluable for intelligence gathering purposes – for example, when Royal Navy ships tasked to shadow or surveil foreign military vessels. As the Ministry of Defence’s press release reads: “Behind every image that is captured is an individual who is first and foremost a soldier, sailor, or aviator, and secondarily a skilled photographer. They deploy not only with their cameras but also their rifles.”

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) releases its yearly image selection each December, both showcasing the work of its photographers as well as of the UK Armed Forces as a whole. Sir Rich Knighton, Chief of the Defence Staff, said: “The Best of Defence Imagery 2025 reflects the contribution our armed forces make to society and our presence across the world. These images show our Armed Forces ready for a new era of threat, combining conventional strength with innovation, operating with allies, and putting people at the heart of Defence. They provide an essential visual account of how we are keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad.”

Operation Highmast

The most high-profile mission carried out by the UK’s armed forces this year was undoubtedly Operation Highmast, otherwise known as Carrier Strike Group 25 (CSG 25). We, and other outlets, reported on this eight month deployment extensively throughout its course. Over the 44,000 nautical miles sailed, it saw a record set for the highest number of F-35Bs ever deployed on board a warship, the first ever cross-decking exercise by a British jet onto a Japanese naval vessel, the first overnight visit by a British Prime Minister to a Royal Navy ship in almost 60 years, and the maiden UK carrier deployment of uncrewed aerial systems ahead of plans for a full scale hybrid air wing in the coming years.

Wildcat HMA2 helicopters were kept on 24/7 alert armed with Martlet lightweight multirole missiles as the strike group transited the Red Sea, ready to launch and defend the carrier and its escorts from the threat of attack by aerial or waterborne drones and cruise missiles. The RAF additionally deployed reinforcements of Voyager aerial refueling aircraft to RAF Akrotiri, which would support Akrotiri based Typhoons or F-35Bs from the carrier itself, as well as P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to add to the CSG’s defensive shield.

An extra RC-135 Rivet Joint was also deployed to Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, joining one RAF airframe already on station there. The additional aircraft, based on the timing of the deployment and its return, was likely tasked with gathering intelligence which could be used to ensure the carrier’s security in the region.

Later in the voyage, the CSG undertook joint exercises and defence engagements with a number of nations along the route. This included Exercise Bersama Lima in Southeast Asia, Exercise Talisman Sabre off Australia, Exercise Konkan in the Indian Ocean, and, upon returning to the Mediterranean, Exercise Falcon Strike.

Eastern Sentry

Royal Air Force Typhoons have been a regular presence in Baltic skies for many years as part of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission. As the number of aircraft deployed on these rotations has increased in the previous few years – labelled Enhanced Air Policing – the RAF’s presence has also increased. Simultaneous deployments are now maintained by multiple nations at multiple bases in the region. Alongside the nations covered by the original BAP presence – Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia – Enhanced Air Policing deployments have also been made to Poland and Romania.

On Sept. 12, 2025, NATO commenced Operation Eastern Sentry – intended to bolster the alliance’s capacity to respond to and deter increasing provocations by Russian forces. It resulted from the invocation of NATO’s Article 4 by Poland several days prior in response to a massive breach of its airspace by Russian drones. Article 4 provides for a consultation by member states in response to a situation that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence or security of a NATO member. It had previously been triggered by a number of European nations after Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Shortly after Eastern Sentry kicked off, patrols over Poland by RAF Typhoons launched from UK bases began.

Public Occasions

Throughout the year, the three branches of the UK’s armed forces undertake a variety of public engagements to mark national and local celebrations and commemorations. With June 2025 came the official birthday of King Charles III, which, when weather permits, is marked by a flypast over Buckingham Palace after the traditional Trooping the Colour parades.

The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team (RAFAT), most commonly known as the Red Arrows, are stalwarts of the UK airshow scene along with the RAF’s Typhoon display team. Together they entertained spectators at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) as well as the RAF Cosford Air Show.

For 2025’s RIAT display, the Red Arrows utilised sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, for their jet engines as well as a vegetable oil-based biofuel in their smoke pods. This followed extensive trials with the new fuels, and was the first time SAF had been used for a full Red Arrows display. With many event organisers, even those in charge of Formula One, becoming wary of how flypasts and displays by fuel-hungry high performance jet aircraft could impact their sustainability credentials, this will likely be beneficial in ensuring the display team’s future schedules remain fully booked. In a wider strategic sense, cutting reliance on crude oil products is an important step in reducing dependency on foreign supplies from far overseas that could be cut off by war or diplomatic disputes.

Global Operations

As seen with Operation Highmast, personnel and equipment from the UK’s armed forces frequently travel across the globe and can be seen in a wide range of locations. Images in the collection span from the remote South Georgia and Sandwich Islands in the far reaches of the southern hemisphere, to the chilling conditions in Bardufoss, Norway, the dry deserts of Nevada, USA, and the sun-kissed waters of the Timor Sea.

Bardufoss in northern Norway is used by the UK’s armed forces routinely for cold-weather training. Operation Clockwork, an annual exercise, sees a selection of helicopters deploy to the far north with supporting ground forces to ensure all involved are ready and able to operate in temperatures as low as -30C and amid arctic blizzards, storms, and thick snowfall. Though cold weather and snow can be found in the UK, it is much less predictable and difficult to schedule a regular exercise around.

RAF Typhoons have, since becoming the mainstay of the UK’s combat air fleet, been regular attendees of the U.S. Air Force’s famous Red Flag exercises at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. 2025 was no exception, with the RAF dispatching eight Typhoon FGR4s along with a Voyager refueling tanker across the Atlantic to take part.

Often overshadowed by the Falkland Islands through which it was formerly governed, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands lie just over 800 miles to the east of the Falklands and were, too, involved in the 1982 conflict. Prior to Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands at the beginning of April 1982, Argentinians claiming to be scrap metal merchants landed on South Georgia and laid claim to an abandoned whaling outpost. An Argentinian submarine, the Santa Fe, was disabled by Royal Navy helicopters on Apr. 25 while on a supply run to South Georgia, and the territory was fully surrendered to British forces the following day.

While the territory has no permanent residents, a research station is maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and the surrounding waters are well used for fishing. British military forces stationed on the Falklands or in the South Atlantic pay regular visits to ensure its security, as well as assist civilian agencies with scientific research and environmental monitoring.

International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, is ending the year with its share price trading closer to the upper half of its recent range, but still far from its pre?pandemic cruising altitude. The stock has spent recent sessions oscillating around the mid?single digits in euro terms, reflecting a market that acknowledges genuine operational progress yet remains wary of fuel costs, consumer softness and geopolitics.

Over the past five trading days, the shares have edged higher, mirroring broader European airline peers, as oil prices eased and investors rotated back into cyclicals. On a 90?day view, the trend has been modestly positive: after a choppy autumn marked by macro?driven selloffs, the stock has quietly rebuilt altitude, climbing back from its quarterly lows. The 52?week range tells the broader story. IAG has bounced between a depressed floor and a considerably higher ceiling over the past year, trading well above its lows but still shy of its high watermark for the period. That positioning, combined with recent price action, points to a cautiously bullish sentiment: not euphoria, but a willingness to pay up for an airline group that has repaired its balance sheet and is printing solid profits.

The market mood is still far from complacent. Every flare?up in the Middle East, every jitter in jet fuel markets, every whisper about consumer belt?tightening shows up instantly in the stock’s intraday swings. But for now, the aggregate picture is one of guarded optimism, supported by strong transatlantic demand and corporate travel that has finally come out of its post?pandemic funk.

Latest corporate and investor information from International Airlines Group

One-Year Investment Performance

Investors who backed International Airlines Group a year ago have, on balance, been rewarded, though not with the kind of windfall that makes headlines. Based on closing prices from a year earlier, the stock has delivered a mid?to?high single?digit percentage gain, once currency effects and normal volatility are smoothed out. That translates into a performance that roughly tracks, or modestly outpaces, some European airline peers, but lags the kind of high?beta rally that more speculative travel names enjoyed at the peak of the reopening trade.

In practical terms, an investor who bought €10,000 worth of IAG shares a year ago would now be sitting on a few hundred euros of paper profit, assuming dividends are minimal and not reinvested. It is the kind of return profile that feels solid rather than spectacular: enough to validate the thesis that the group’s multi?brand, multi?hub structure would benefit from the recovery in long?haul and premium traffic, but not enough to erase the memory of the deep drawdowns endured during the pandemic years. The trajectory, though, is what matters. The stock’s path over the year has been a series of sharp climbs on strong quarterly earnings, followed by pullbacks whenever markets began to worry about recession, wars or higher fuel bills.

For long?term shareholders, the message is clear. The period of existential worry for IAG seems firmly in the rearview mirror; the question now is not survival, but whether a leaner cost base and capacity discipline can deliver a structurally higher earnings power that justifies a rerating from today’s still?discounted multiples.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, sentiment toward International Airlines Group was helped by yet another indication that travel demand is proving sticky, even as consumers face higher interest rates and inflation fatigue. Industry data on European passenger volumes showed robust load factors on key routes into and out of London and Madrid, with transatlantic and Latin American corridors particularly strong. For IAG, which leans heavily on its British Airways and Iberia long?haul franchises, that confirmation of demand resilience supports management’s guidance for healthy yields into the new year.

Recently, the group also remained in focus over its long?running effort to acquire Spanish carrier Air Europa. Regulatory processes and remedies continue to shape the narrative. Investors have been watching closely for signals from Brussels about competition concerns on Iberian routes. The strategic logic for IAG is compelling: folding Air Europa into the portfolio would deepen its Madrid hub, build scale on Latin American routes and strengthen its position against low?cost rivals. But the deal’s drawn?out nature has become a source of deal fatigue for some shareholders. Any definitive progress — even in the form of tough but manageable remedies — could act as a meaningful catalyst for the stock.

At the same time, capacity and cost discipline remain under the microscope. In recent commentary, IAG highlighted ongoing efforts to mitigate cost pressures through fleet renewal and productivity improvements. Deliveries of more fuel?efficient aircraft, including Airbus A350s and A320neos, are gradually changing the cost structure, while digital initiatives in operations and distribution continue to promise incremental savings. Markets have started to price in that operational progress, but investors want to see it consistently flow through to margins, particularly in the seasonally weaker winter quarters.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Across the sell?side, the tone on International Airlines Group is more positive than not. Over the past several weeks, a series of analyst notes from major European and U.S. investment banks have broadly reiterated constructive views on the shares. The consensus rating sits in the ""Buy"" to ""Overweight"" bracket, with a minority of firms preferring a more cautious ""Hold"" stance. The core bullish argument is straightforward: IAG trades on earnings and cash?flow multiples that still imply a hefty discount to pre?pandemic norms, even though traffic and profitability are much closer to those earlier baselines.

Recent price target updates from large houses such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and others cluster in a range that implies double?digit percentage upside from current trading levels. While individual numbers differ, the median target effectively assumes that the market will reward the company for continued deleveraging, steady capacity growth in profitable segments, and the successful bedding?in of fleet renewal. Analysts with the highest targets lean on a scenario in which premium travel demand remains structurally stronger than before the pandemic, particularly on North Atlantic routes where BA and Iberia enjoy strong market positions.

The skeptics, reflected in the ""Hold"" cohort, emphasise macro and sector?specific risks. They warn that airlines’ earnings power remains extremely sensitive to oil prices, wage settlements and potential demand shocks. For IAG in particular, exposure to the UK consumer — still wrestling with the aftershocks of higher mortgage costs and fiscal tightening — is a recurring concern. A soft patch in discretionary spending could weigh on short?haul leisure bookings and cabin?mix dynamics, trimming yields even if planes remain relatively full. For now, though, the numerical balance of Wall Street opinion tilts to the upside: upside?skewed price targets and predominantly positive ratings sum to a broadly bullish verdict.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Looking ahead, the investment case for International Airlines Group hinges on three strategic pillars: disciplined capacity management, portfolio diversification and balance sheet repair. On capacity, the group has repeatedly signalled that it will prioritise profitable growth over market share grabs. That is particularly important on short?haul European routes, where hyper?competitive low?cost carriers can pressure fares. IAG’s strategy is to lean into its strengths: premium cabins, corporate contracts and long?haul connectivity from key hubs at London Heathrow and Madrid Barajas.

Its multi?brand portfolio — British Airways and Iberia at the full?service end, Vueling and LEVEL in the low?cost and leisure space, and Aer Lingus straddling both transatlantic value and regional connectivity — offers a natural hedge. When UK corporate travel ebbs, Spanish leisure might surprise to the upside; when Europe softens, transatlantic or Latin American traffic can pick up the slack. That geographic and segment diversification is one reason analysts increasingly view IAG as structurally less volatile than monoline carriers, even if the group retains all the cyclicality inherent in aviation.

The second pillar is fleet and sustainability strategy. Newer, more fuel?efficient aircraft not only lower operating costs but also reduce carbon intensity per passenger kilometre — an increasingly material factor as regulators and customers put airlines under an environmental microscope. IAG has been among the more vocal European groups on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) commitments, placing multi?year offtake agreements and signalling a willingness to co?invest in supply. While the economics of SAF remain challenging, early movers may win regulatory goodwill and brand advantage. For investors, a credible decarbonisation path can reduce the long?term policy and reputational risks that hang over the sector.

Finally, there is the balance sheet. Years of pandemic?era losses left IAG with elevated debt, but improving cash generation is gradually turning that story around. Management has articulated a clear deleveraging trajectory, and free cash flow from strong summer seasons is now flowing toward debt reduction and selective investment rather than simple survival. The moment the market becomes confident that leverage metrics are back within pre?COVID comfort zones, conversations about capital returns — dividends and buybacks — will likely come back onto the table. That, in turn, could act as a powerful rerating catalyst for a stock still widely seen as undervalued relative to its normalised earnings power.

Risks remain impossible to ignore. A spike in oil prices, renewed industrial action at key hubs, or a sharper?than?expected downturn in European consumption could all derail the recovery trajectory. Geopolitical disruptions to airspace or tourism flows, whether in the Middle East, Eastern Europe or elsewhere, could also hit certain parts of IAG’s network disproportionately. Yet for investors willing to stomach volatility, the risk?reward balance looks more balanced than it has in years. International Airlines Group is no longer fighting for survival; it is competing for margin, market share in lucrative segments, and investor confidence.

Whether the next phase of this story is a steady climb or another bout of turbulence will depend on execution as much as on macroeconomics. If management can deliver on its promises of disciplined growth, cost efficiency and a credible path to lower carbon flying, the share price may have more altitude left to gain than the last year’s modest appreciation suggests.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405023_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 00:58:20.839471

The company’s Prime Air unit will no longer pursue a commercial drone delivery service in Italy, where it previously announced plans to launch by late 2024. Reuters reported that the move came as a surprise to Italy’s civil aviation regulator, ENAC.

A Prime Air spokesperson told FLYING that the company remains committed to the U.K.—the other international market it had aimed to enter last year. In 2025, its drones began serving customers in Waco and San Antonio, Texas; Pontiac, Michigan; and other U.S. locations. The company plans to announce new U.S. and international services soon, it said.

“Despite positive engagement and progress with Italian aerospace regulators, the broader business regulatory framework in the country does not, at this time, support our longer-term objectives for this program,” the spokesperson said. “Our drone delivery projects in the U.S. and U.K. continue positively, with test flights and commercial deliveries proving successful and well-received by customers.”

Those operations have not been universally embraced.

In College Station, Texas, residents complained about noise from the company’s MK27-2 drone—which they compared to chain saws, leaf blowers, and hives of bees—and pushed back on a proposed expansion. Prime Air agreed to limit operations in the city to four per hour and told residents it would not renew the lease on its local drone delivery hub. It officially ceased operations in College Station, one of its two initial U.S. launch markets, in August.

“We were happy to have Amazon and its drone service in our community,” said College Station Mayor John Nichols. “While we worked with them to find other business locations in College Station, they have chosen to move on to the next phase of developing their drone delivery service, and we wish them well.”

Since then, Prime Air has launched in Waco, San Antonio, and Pontiac and is preparing for operations near Kansas City, Kansas. Per an amendment to its operational specifications published in August, the company is also targeting Houston, Austin, and El Paso in Texas.

Prime Air is one of a handful of drone operators with Part 135 permissions from the FAA. Its MK30 drone carries up to 5 pounds, cruising at about 73 mph. The tailsitter lifts off using six vertical propellers before transitioning to wing-borne forward light. Packages are stored within its fuselage and dropped from a height of about 13 feet.

Per Amazon, the MK30 is smaller, lighter, and more durable than the MK27-2, with a 7.5-mile service radius and the ability to fly in light rain.

Bumpy Drone Expansion

Prime Air said in October 2023 that it was already working with regulators in the UK and Italy to establish a commercial service by late 2024. It had planned for those markets to be the first to integrate drone delivery with its network of fulfillment centers. Instead, that integration happened in Tolleson, Arizona, in November 2024.

“The future has arrived in Italy,” said Pierluigi Di Palma, president of ENAC, in 2023. “Being chosen by a global player such as Amazon is further confirmation of the strategy pursued by ENAC to push for innovation of advanced air mobility in the aviation industry, creating a national ecosystem favorable to the safe development of new services.”

Prime Air’s international expansion has not been as smooth as Amazon and Di Palma may have anticipated.

In December 2024, the company acknowledged it was about one year behind schedule. It said it successfully completed initial trials with its MK30 drone in Italy, where it “continues to work with Italian authorities to meet all the requirements needed to launch the service next year,” in 2025.

Earlier in 2024, Amazon was one of six operators selected by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to participate in a series of beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone delivery trials. In January, it picked a fulfillment center in Darlington, U.K., as the initial site for those trials. However, The Telegraph reported in November that the CAA had not yet authorized them.

The planned operations have reportedly sparked a dispute between Amazon and a local flying club, which per The Telegraph told the CAA it will “inconvenience Amazon within the boundaries of U.K. law” if the testing impedes model aircraft pilots. Prime Air responded by creating a no-fly zone around the club.

Due to a lack of evidence on the drones’ noise impacts, a local council gave Amazon only temporary permission to build drone facilities. The Telegraph reported that Prime Air subsequently reduced its planned operations from 21 to 10 per hour and will build one launch pad rather than two.

Amazon estimates the MK30 to be about 40 percent quieter than the MK27-2, which could assuage noise concerns. But the company has also faced pushback from the UK Ministry of Defense, which per The Telegraph called the drones a “significant risk to flight safety” and lamented potential airspace restrictions on military aircraft.

In October, two Prime Air drones struck the same crane boom in Arizona. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) has cited the crashes—which occurred minutes apart—as evidence that Amazon’s detect and avoid (DAA) systems are not yet mature enough for expanded operations.

In November, another Prime Air drone clipped an internet cable in Waco as it was lifting off from a customer’s backyard. Amazon said it covered repair costs for the internet service provider and reported no damage or injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board told FLYING it will not investigate the event.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/download-5-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 21:11:39.374684

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and chair of LanzaJet.","LanzaTech Global Inc., a leader in carbon transformation technology, on Dec. 22 announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet Inc., a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) and renewable diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On Dec. 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, using its industry-leading alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

The sustainable aviation fuel industry remains capital-intensive and subject to evolving regulatory and market dynamics. LanzaJet, like many in the sector, is managing operational and financial pressures as it scales.

ATJ technology and strategic partners

The project will employ alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology, considered the second most viable route to produce PBS after the HEFA process. This method allows for greater flexibility in feedstock use and presents a scalable opportunity for the Australian energy industry.

The design and engineering (FEED) phase is already underway thanks to the collaboration between Jet Zero, Technip Energies, Long Energy & Resources and the financial support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which allocated $9 million to the project, whose total cost amounts to $36.81 million.

Environmental and strategic impact

Once completed, the Ulysses Project will have the capacity to generate 113 million liters per year of low-carbon liquid fuels, of which 90% will be PBS and 10% RD. The plant will process more than 180 million liters of bioethanol per year and will reduce CO₂ emissions from aviation by more than 70% compared to traditional fossil fuels.

In addition, the project promises to create 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and more than 100 direct jobs during operation. The project also seeks to:

Increase industrial demand from Townsville’s emerging renewable energy hub.

Ensure security of fuel supply for national defense (ADF).

Supply renewable diesel to sectors such as reef tourism, mining and land transportation.

Demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of the ATJ pathway as a pillar in the energy transition.

A commitment to the future of sustainable aviation

2024-25 mandate movements

Argentina – National Biofuels Expansion (2024)

Argentina’s lower house approved a measure extending the national biofuels program through 2030, confirming ethanol at 12% and biodiesel at 7.5%. The Energy Secretariat also began consultations to raise biodiesel to B15 by 2026 to absorb soybean oil surplus. Provinces including Santa Fe and Córdoba pressed for higher blending levels to support local plants. Industry groups welcomed stability after several years of uncertainty, while refiners requested clearer pricing formulas. The policy aligns with Argentina’s decarbonization roadmap under its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), aiming to reduce transport emissions and stimulate rural employment through expanded feedstock utilization.

Australia (Queensland, New South Wales) – Biofuels Mandate Review (2025)

In early 2025, Australia’s federal review of state biofuel mandates confirmed Queensland’s E4/B0.5 and New South Wales’ E6/B2 obligations would remain until a national low‑carbon fuels framework launches in 2027. The review emphasized renewable diesel and SAF as future compliance pathways rather than higher ethanol percentages. Both states introduced incentives for biogenic CO₂ capture from ethanol plants. Regional councils in Mackay and Albury advocated expanded feedstock zones to include sorghum and tallow waste. The Digest noted that blending levels remain below capacity due to limited retail infrastructure despite strong political support for domestic biofuel production.

Brazil – Nationwide B15 Implementation (2025)

Brazil’s National Energy Policy Council confirmed the biodiesel mandate will rise from B14 to B15 in March 2025, completing a multi‑year transition under RenovaBio. Ethanol blending remains E27 minimum nationwide, with flex‑fuel vehicles dominating sales. The Ministry of Mines and Energy forecasts an additional 1 billion L annual biodiesel demand, mostly soy‑based but increasingly integrating animal fats. States such as Mato Grosso are expanding crush capacity to meet targets. The Digest highlighted RenovaBio credit prices stabilizing after volatility in 2023, underscoring investor confidence in Brazil’s long‑term decarbonization trajectory through mandated low‑carbon fuel expansion.

Canada – Clean Fuel Regulations Rollout (2024)

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations entered full enforcement mid‑2024, requiring annual carbon‑intensity reductions across liquid fuels. Provinces adjusted complementary mandates: British Columbia increased renewable diesel blending toward 6%, while Alberta advanced co‑processing at refineries near Edmonton. Ethanol blending averages 10% nationally; renewable diesel volumes surged with new facilities in Regina and Prince George. The Digest reported that compliance credits traded actively at stable prices, indicating functional markets. Federal authorities emphasized lifecycle emission verification systems using digital reporting tools, ensuring sustainability compliance for imported feedstocks under Canada’s climate plan toward net‑zero by 2050.

China (Heilongjiang & Jilin) – Ethanol Pilot Restart (2024)

After suspending national E10 plans in 2020, China reactivated ethanol blending pilots in northeastern provinces Heilongjiang and Jilin during 2024. State grain reserves released corn stocks for bioethanol producers to stabilize supply chains disrupted by pandemic restrictions. Local governments announced partial E10 rollout covering roughly half of gasoline sales by late 2025, contingent on feedstock availability. The Digest noted that Beijing continues evaluating national scaling depending on food security metrics. Biodiesel initiatives remained voluntary but grew via municipal waste‑oil collection programs in coastal cities such as Shanghai, supporting broader circular‑economy goals.

Colombia – Biodiesel Increase (2024)

Colombia raised its nationwide biodiesel mandate from B12 to B13 in July 2024 following successful regional trials in Antioquia and Meta departments. Ethanol remained E10 across major cities including Bogotá and Cali. The Ministry of Mines and Energy projected demand growth of 150 million L per year for palm‑based biodiesel, strengthening rural economies while lowering particulate emissions from diesel fleets. The Digest observed that Colombia’s vertically integrated palm industry enables reliable compliance despite fluctuating feedstock prices. Plans are under discussion to achieve B15 by 2026 consistent with the country’s green growth strategy and regional decarbonization commitments.

European Union – RED II/III Implementation (2024–25)

Throughout 2024–2025, EU member states transposed Renewable Energy Directive II revisions and prepared for RED III adoption setting a 29% renewable energy share target by 2030 with stricter sustainability criteria. Countries including Germany, France, Spain, and Sweden shifted from fixed blends to GHG‑reduction systems rewarding advanced fuels like HVO and biomethane. The Digest chronicled record renewable diesel production expansions—particularly Neste’s Rotterdam upgrade—and rising imports from Singaporean plants meeting EU certification standards. Consumer gasoline blends stabilized at E10 across most markets while high blends like E85 expanded modestly through tax incentives in France and Scandinavia.

India – E20 Rollout Acceleration (2025)

India advanced its ethanol blending target two years ahead of schedule, declaring nationwide E20 availability by March 2026 under the Ethanol Blending Program (EBP). In 2024 pilots operated across Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi NCR demonstrating vehicle compatibility success. Sugar mills diverted surplus molasses toward dual-feed distilleries supported by concessional loans. Biodiesel development via used cooking oil collection scaled up under the SATAT initiative supplying B5 blends for government fleets. The Digest emphasized India’s growing role as a global ethanol consumer—targeting reduced crude imports worth billions annually while improving air quality metrics.

Indonesia – B35 National Deployment (2024)

Indonesia implemented its long‑planned B35 biodiesel mandate nationwide in August 2023 with full operational compliance reported through 2024. Palm oil–based methyl ester volumes exceeded 13 million kiloliters annually, displacing nearly US$10 billion worth of fossil diesel imports according to government data cited by The Digest. Field trials on higher blends continued across Sumatra and Kalimantan provinces aiming for B40 readiness tests concluding late 2025. Officials stated that maintaining CPO price stability remains critical; hence blend escalation depends on export levy revenues funding subsidies that keep domestic biodiesel competitive amid fluctuating global vegetable oil markets.

Malaysia – B30 Expansion Strategy (2025)

Malaysia reaffirmed plans to achieve nationwide B30 implementation by end‑2025 after delays caused by logistics constraints during COVID years. Trials in Sarawak and Sabah confirmed engine performance improvements using higher palm methyl ester ratios blended with Euro‑5 diesel grades. The Plantation Industries Ministry introduced sustainability certification alignment with EU deforestation regulations to protect export credibility while maintaining domestic blends for local consumption. The Digest highlighted Malaysia’s twin-track approach—ensuring rural employment through palm smallholder participation while positioning renewable diesel investments as future compliance pathways under ASEAN low-carbon transport commitments.

Earlier this year,we reported that the country will test out a 1% sustainable aviation fuel blending mandate for international flights departing from Kuala Lumpur international airport. EcoCeres began producing SAF in October, ensuring domestic supply. The facility has the capacity to produce 350,000 metric tons of SAF annually. Introducing the trial mandate is part of the country´s wider decarbonization plans, including the Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR.

Philippines – Biodiesel Increase Approval (2024)

In December 2024 the Philippines Department of Energy officially approved raising the coco methyl ester content of diesel from B2 to B3 starting mid‑2025 under Republic Act 9367 implementation updates. Ethanol remained mandated at E10 nationwide except where flex-fuel options offered higher levels voluntarily marketed as “E20 Premium.” Coconut farmers welcomed the move as added value stabilization amid export volatility. Refiners in Batangas began upgrading storage tanks accordingly. The Digest noted that the biodiesel increment could save nearly ₱7 billion annually in imported petroleum costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 350,000 tons yearly.

South Africa – Biofuel Framework Relaunch (2025)

After years of delay, South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy relaunched the Biofuels Regulatory Framework in early 2025 with implementation targeted for January 2026. It sets initial voluntary blending levels—E2–E10 ethanol range and B2–B5 biodiesel—pending sufficient certified feedstock supply from sugarcane regions KwaZulu‑Natal and Mpumalanga plus canola pilot projects in Western Cape. Incentive pricing mechanisms mirror earlier drafts from 2019 but updated for inflationary pressures on fuel distributors. The Digest reported strong investor interest from agricultural cooperatives anticipating government guarantees facilitating financing of small- to medium-scale biorefineries.

UK

In 2025, the UK Government’s announced its SAF mandate plans. Sarah Ellerby, CEO of NPT, said: “I am pleased by the UK Government announcement on its SAF mandate plans. A UK domestic SAF market needs government support and legislation, as well as a revenue certainty mechanism to attract investment into technology and SAF plants. The UK focus should be on ‘home-grown’ SAF production and supply over imports, as the mandate of 10% for 2030 approaches.”

United States – Renewable Fuel Standard Set Rule (2023–25 cycle)

EPA finalized Renewable Volume Obligations covering 2023–25 under the Renewable Fuel Standard in June 2023 with enforcement continuing through 2025 reporting periods. Mandated total renewable fuel volumes increase gradually toward ~22 billion gallons equivalent with advanced biofuel categories expanding modestly due to slower cellulosic deployment than expected. Renewable diesel production soared beyond RFS requirements driven by Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits in California and Oregon plus new LCFS programs emerging in Washington state and New York City municipal fleets adopting HVO blends by early 2025—all detailed extensively throughout The Digest’s coverage series.

In California, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) voted to strengthen the LCFS, aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 30% by 2030 and 90% by 2045. This move is seen as a reaffirmation of California’s commitment to combating climate change, especially in light of federal policy shifts. As state Senator Henry Stern stated, “California has a long history of enacting visionary and affordable climate policies that are durable enough to endure major shifts in national politics.”

Opponents, including oil companies and consumer advocates, argue that the changes will burden Californians with higher fuel costs. The board itself acknowledges this possibility, stating in an earlier analysis that the changes “could increase the price of gasoline by 37 cents a gallon, on average, from 2024 through 2030.”

The LCFS, implemented in 2011, requires fuel producers to purchase tradable credits if their products exceed a set carbon emissions baseline. The revised policy aims to increase the production of low-carbon fuels by raising the carbon intensity reduction targets. The policy changes are projected to drive up the price of tradable credits, which had previously fallen to around $70 from over $200 in 2020.

Vietnam

Earlier this year we reported that in a major win for US ethanol industry, the Asian country has decided to mandate 10% ethanol blended fuel at the pump. The move is an effort to close it’s significant trade gap with the US, which could lead to 800,000 cubic meters of ethanol imports to supply what its domestic ethanol production can not for a 10% blend. Currently the country produces about 40% of that would-be demand with 600,000 m3 installed capacity.

Neste made the commitment in 2020 when it signed The Climate Pledge—a coalition of 625 signatories that aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, a decade ahead of the target set by the United Nations’ Paris Agreement. In December, though, the company said its “very ambitious” target “would have required significant investments that are currently not realistic.”

Neste replaced its 2035 carbon-neutral pledge with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its operations by 80 percent by 2040. It also extended its target to reduce operational emissions by 50 percent, from 2030 to 2035. Per CEO Heikki Malinen, the company has slashed its own GHG emissions by 24 percent since 2019.

Neste earlier in 2025 reported delays in the transformation of its Porvoo, Finland, refinery into a SAF production hub, which it cited as a factor in the revised targets.

“Neste’s current financial position does not allow further major capital expenditure beyond the ongoing 2.5 billion euros investment in expansion of our renewables refinery in Rotterdam [Netherlands],” Malinen said. “As investment projects in our industry take years to complete, the timelines of our climate targets have to be delayed under the current circumstances.”

Neste said Porvoo’s transition from refining crude oil to processing renewable raw materials for SAF production “will be determined in line with the actual fuel market demand, legislation development and technological development.”

Ripple Effect

Though its operations are based in Finland, Neste’s revised targets have implications for the global aviation industry.

The U.S. government envisions SAF as a key tool to reduce aviation emissions. Established by a 2021 memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Energy, Transportation, and Agriculture Departments, the SAF Grand Challenge aims to ramp up domestic SAF production to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030—and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050. The effort also involves the private sector, including aerospace companies, universities, and nongovernmental organizations.

China's infamous ""gutter oil"" – waste cooking oil once illegally recycled from sewers and restaurant drains – has transformed from a food safety scandal into a valuable commodity for aviation decarbonization. Prices have quadrupled in two years due to surging global demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Waste oil serves as the primary feedstock for HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids), currently the most commercially mature SAF production method. Chinese companies now have over one million tonnes of annual SAF production capacity, with new facilities like Honeywell's plant converting 500,000 tonnes of waste oil into fuel yearly.

This demand surge stems from aggressive international policies, particularly the EU's mandates requiring 2% SAF use by 2025 and 70% by 2050. SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, though it costs two to five times more – potentially adding $3.6 billion to global airline costs in 2025.

China has no mandatory blending requirements but aims to consume 50,000 tonnes of SAF between 2021-2025. The transformation represents a remarkable shift: what was once a dangerous contaminant in the food supply chain has become a scarce resource in the global energy transition.

Critics warn that bio-based SAF cannot scale fast enough to replace fossil jet fuel and may create competing pressures on food supplies and natural carbon sinks.",,N,,2025-12-29 15:56:44.475655

There is much agonising right now about whether, when and who should replace the prime minister. That is inevitable. But a new Labour leader with the same policies won’t cut it. Replacing Keir with Angela, Andy, Wes or Ed won’t persuade workers to return to the fold if they are just offering more of the same in a different voice.

I have been criticised for holding this Labour government to account. Unite was the only affiliated union that did not endorse the manifesto, as it did not back jobs. We fought back on the winter fuel allowance cut and the self-harm of net zero targets that came without the needed investment in new industries. Trade unions are there to fight for workers not to side with politicians.

The government’s opening promises of “tough times” has certainly been delivered. When I was on picket lines in 2025 more and more Unite workers were asking: “When it comes to balancing the books, why are workers and communities paying the price again?” In the recent budget, Labour opting for stealth taxes on workers instead of a wealth tax on the mega-rich was the wrong choice.

Labour must stop being embarrassed to be the voice of workers. If Labour is to be Labour, we need to call things by their real name. Since winter 2021 energy prices have increased by 42 per cent. Big energy has a licence to print money while pensioners live in fear of the electricity bill. Unite research shows in 2024, the UK’s energy companies made £30 billion in profits. Currently £500 of the average household energy bill goes straight to energy companies’ profits.

As a union leader, my energy is directed to defend workers. Often, we are the last defence. In 2025 thousands of Unite members were prepared to take industrial action and put hundreds of millions into their pay as a result.

• Inside the fight to save icon of northeast from ‘catastrophe’

Workers are fed up with carrying the can. Take the UK’s parlous performance on productivity. It’s not workers who should be blamed ― our productivity failures reflect an investment strike in UK plc. A collective failure to invest in industry, while maximising returns for shareholders.

Britain is near the bottom of the OECD class in industrial investment and it wasn’t workers who put us there. In 2026 Labour must deliver real growth, borrow to invest in Britain to create a sustainable future.

That includes net zero. Workers see Labour’s current policies as a jobless transition. No one is against net zero, but we cannot let go of one rope before we have hold of another. We cannot simply offshore our carbon responsibilities, with workers again paying the price.

The UK desperately needs Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The Grangemouth refinery could have produced it. Instead, the refinery was allowed to close and we are set to import SAF from the US and China. What an act of self-harm.

• James Dyson: Britain is a nation of doers — let’s unlock our potential

Where is the much-promised boost from increased defence spending? That cash could deliver thousands of UK manufacturing jobs, but that means buying British. A seismic shift in defence spending should be delivering increased jobs and living standards for workers in Britain.

With all the challenges facing private companies this year, they must leverage every available tax benefit.

Fortunately, lawmakers have packed the federal tax code with credits and incentives to reward taxpayers for specific activities and investments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made significant revisions to energy credits, imposing new restrictions and phasing out many of the credits early.

Despite the changes, there is still considerable runway for many projects, and both the tax equity financing and credit transfer markets should remain robust over the next several years.

In addition, the OBBBA enhanced existing incentives, offering new opportunities for tax-efficient structuring.

Energy Provisions

The OBBBA has reshaped the energy credit landscape. Several credits were extended or enhanced, while many others are subject to new sourcing and investment requirements or are phasing out early.

The legislation does not affect the ability to transfer or claim refundable payments for specified credits.

Consumer Credits: The OBBBA repeals several energy-related tax credits directed to consumers, each with distinct effective dates:

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30D—Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 45W—Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30C—Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Section 25C—Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 25D—Residential Clean Energy Credit: Repealed for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 45L—New Energy-Efficient Home Credit: Repealed for property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Depreciation: The bill eliminates the five-year depreciable life for qualified energy property, and the Section 179D deduction is repealed for construction beginning after June 30, 2026.

Investment, Production Tax Credits

The OBBBA accelerates the phaseout of the investment tax credit under Section 48E and the production tax credit under Section 45Y.

Projects that begin construction after 2033 will generally no longer qualify for these credits, with solar and wind facilities facing even earlier deadlines. To remain eligible, solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

The legislation also introduces new restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, may not receive material assistance from such entities.

Material assistance is determined based on a cost ratio tied to the sourcing of eligible components. In addition, Section 48E now includes stricter domestic sourcing requirements to obtain the 10% bonus credit, reflecting a broader policy shift toward supply chain security and energy independence.

Importantly, the IRS has tightened the rules for establishing that construction has begun for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline for solar and wind facilities.

Under Notice 2025-43, the 5% safe harbor method is available only if taxpayers can use it to establish that construction began by Sept. 1, 2025.

Starting Sept. 2, the physical work test is the sole method for establishing the beginning of construction for wind and solar projects for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline.

This change applies to the credit phaseouts under the OBBBA, but not to the foreign entity of concern rules.

For FEOC exemption purposes, facilities may still use the 5% safe harbor to establish that construction began by Dec. 31, 2025.

Additionally, low-output solar facilities (≤1.5 MW AC) may continue to use the 5% safe harbor beyond that date. The four-year continuity safe harbor remains in place for projects that meet BOC requirements.

Historically, taxpayers could rely on either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor. Notice 2025-42 now limits this to the physical work test, which requires significant physical work related to the energy property, either on-site or off-site, under a binding contract. Preliminary activities, such as design or site clearing, do not qualify.

To maintain credit eligibility, taxpayers must also meet the continuity requirement, which is satisfied if the facility is placed in service within four years of the BOC year.

Advanced Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing credit under Section 45X has been modified significantly.

While the credit is repealed for wind energy components sold after 2027, it remains available for other eligible components before a phasedown begins in 2031.

Components sold in 2031 will qualify for a 75% credit, decreasing to 50% in 2032 and 25% in 2033.

The credit is fully repealed for sales occurring in 2034 or later. Notably, the scope of the credit has been expanded to include metallurgical coal.

As with other energy provisions, the material assistance restrictions for prohibited foreign entities apply to all qualifying components.

Clean Fuel Production Credit

Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z has been extended through 2031.

The bill also reinstates the small agri-biodiesel credit under Section 40A, which can now be stacked with the 45Z credit.

A new geographic restriction has been added, disallowing the credit unless the feedstock is produced or grown in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.

Additionally, the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions has been revised to exclude indirect land use changes.

Prohibited foreign entity rules have also been extended to apply to clean fuel production facilities.

Planning considerations: Facilities must establish BOC by Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid FEOC restrictions beginning in 2026, and can continue to rely on the 5% safe harbor specifically to meet this deadline through the end of 2025.

Solar and wind projects beginning construction more than 12 months after the OBBBA enactment must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for Section 48E or 45Y credits.

Facilities that establish BOC by the deadline can rely on the four-year continuity safe harbor to place in service and preserve credit eligibility.

Other Energy Provisions

The clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V is repealed for construction beginning after 2027—two years later than previously proposed.

Section 45Q credit rates for carbon capture used as a tertiary injectant or for productive use are increased to match those for permanent geologic storage, subject to new foreign-entity restrictions.

Publicly traded partnership rules now include income from carbon capture; nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy projects, as well as the transport or storage of sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen.

The nuclear production credit under Section 45U is also subject to foreign entity restrictions.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess project timelines and sourcing strategies in light of phaseouts and new restrictions. For Sections 45Y and 48E, construction must begin within eligibility windows—especially for solar and wind projects facing a 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

Supply chain planning is critical to avoid disqualification under foreign entity rules. Manufacturers of wind property eligible for Section 45X should consider accelerating production before the phaseout in 2027.

Clean fuel producers must ensure feedstock sourcing complies with geographic limits and updated emissions rules.

Entities pursuing carbon capture, hydrogen, or nuclear projects should factor in expanded PTP eligibility and foreign entity restrictions when structuring financing and partnerships.

Early action can help preserve credit eligibility and provide long-term benefits.

State Tax Credit Transfers

Following the enactment of the OBBBA, many states have expanded or introduced transferable tax credit programs, particularly in clean energy, affordable housing, and infrastructure.

These programs allow taxpayers to sell unused credits to third parties, creating liquidity and broader access to state-level incentives.

Transfer mechanisms vary by state, with some requiring pre-approval, certification, or registration, while others impose annual caps or limits on transfer volume.

The trend mirrors federal credit transferability under Section 6418 and reflects growing interest in flexible credit monetization strategies.

States are also beginning to adopt market infrastructure—such as broker platforms and insurance products—to support credit transfers and mitigate buyer risk.

As more jurisdictions adopt these frameworks, taxpayers with multistate operations should monitor developments closely to identify new opportunities.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess eligibility and timing for generating transferable credits, especially in states with strict certification or sourcing requirements.

Early coordination with legal and tax advisors is essential to confirm compliance with documentation and reporting rules. Buyers should conduct due diligence on project qualification, transfer terms, and potential recapture risks.

Engaging with credit brokers or marketplaces may help improve pricing and identify reliable counterparties.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider how state credit transfers interact with federal incentives, particularly in structuring financing and partnership arrangements.

Strategic planning now can help enhance credit value and avoid missed opportunities as state programs continue to evolve.

New Markets Tax Credit Program Permanent

The New Markets Tax Credit program supports capital investments in low-income communities by offering tax credit-subsidized loans to eligible businesses for use toward eligible costs (e.g., real estate and furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

These loans often feature interest-only terms, below-market rates, and principal forgiveness after seven years, providing businesses with a permanent cash benefit.

Previously set to expire at the end of 2025, the NMTC program was made permanent by the OBBBA, with a continued annual allocation authority of $5 billion.

Eligible businesses—both for-profit and nonprofit—can apply for NMTC financing for capital expenditure projects in qualifying census tracts.

The program supports a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, renewable energy, and retail, though it excludes farming and residential rental activities.

Each year, certified Community Development Entities apply to the CDFI Fund for NMTC allocations.

If awarded an allocation, CDEs raise equity from tax credit investors and deploy capital to eligible businesses (otherwise known as Qualified Active Low-Income Community Businesses) based on community impact and strategic priorities, which may vary by geography or industry.

Planning considerations: The NMTC program remains highly competitive. Early engagement with CDEs and timely application are critical to securing financing.

Businesses should prepare detailed project plans that demonstrate substantial community impact and align with CDE priorities.

Acting early improves the likelihood of receiving funding and may unlock additional benefits.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit Set to Expire

The OBBBA did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which is now set to expire for any individuals who begin work after Dec. 31, 2025.

The WOTC provides a valuable incentive for employers who often hire workers from specific targeted populations, including veterans, people with disabilities, people on food assistance, certain youth employees, and ex-felons.

Employers who frequently screen for qualified individuals as part of their hiring process should monitor the legislative process for a potential extension of the credit.

Pass-Through Deduction

The OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A and favorably adjusts the phaseout of the deduction for taxpayers who do not meet the wage expense and capital investment requirements or who participate in a “specified service trade or business.”

Planning considerations: The permanence of this provision provides welcome certainty for private companies engaged in qualifying activities.

The deduction is not available for a range of specified service businesses. There may be opportunities to segregate activities and to increase or allow deductions.

The safe harbor for rental activity to qualify as a Section 199A trade or business under Rev. Proc. 2019-38 remains in effect.

R&D Credit Opportunities

The research credit remains one of the most powerful incentives in the tax code, and the IRS continues to receive a high volume of claims, straining examination resources.

To improve administration and reduce improper claims, the IRS recently made several changes to Form 6765, clarifying documentation requirements for claiming the credit.

The revised Form 6765 was partially finalized for tax year 2025, with the IRS making the mandatory reporting of qualified research expenses by business component optional in Section G.

When Section G becomes mandatory for the 2026 tax year, taxpayers will be required to disclose the top 80% of QREs, with controlled group members required to attach detailed entity-level breakdowns.

Section E is currently mandatory and includes new questions related to officer wages, acquisitions, and use of the ASC 730 directive.

These updates reflect the IRS’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and strengthen audit readiness.

In response to ongoing compliance concerns, the IRS has increased scrutiny of research credit filings, including more frequent audits.

However, due to temporary resource constraints, some IRS Exam functions are operating at reduced capacity, which may delay enforcement actions.

Taxpayers should confirm that they are properly documenting claims and exploring state credit opportunities.

State Credit Changes

Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits. These changes reflect a growing trend to incentivize innovation and attract high-tech investment.

These states include:

Arizona: Arizona now permits the use of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) method for computing its credit for increased research activities. This provides greater flexibility and may lead to greater benefits. Refundable credits are available for small businesses with fewer than 150 employees, subject to pre-approval from the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Arkansas: Arkansas expanded its credit options, offering up to 33% for strategic research areas and university partnerships. Credits are nonrefundable but can offset 100% of state tax liability and be carried forward for up to nine years.

Connecticut: Connecticut expanded its R&D and R&E credits under H.B. 7287. Single-member LLCs may now qualify if they meet specific criteria. Refundability increased to 90% for small biotech firms and 65% for other small businesses, capped at $1.5 million per company annually.

Iowa: Iowa enacted Senate File 657, replacing its research activities credit with a targeted R&D tax credit program effective Jan. 1, 2026. Eligibility is limited to sectors such as advanced manufacturing, bioscience, finance, insurance, and technology. Credits are capped at $40 million annually and require CPA-verified QREs and a competitive application process through the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts increased the maximum allowable credit for certain industries and introduced new documentation requirements for software development and AI-related R&D.

Michigan: Effective Jan. 1, 2025, Michigan reintroduced its R&D tax credit. Large businesses may claim 3% of qualifying expenses up to a base amount and 10% above it, capped at $2 million. Small businesses may claim 15% above the base amount, capped at $250,000. An additional 5% credit is available for university collaborations, capped at $200,000. The credit is refundable and subject to an annual cap of $100 million.

Minnesota: Minnesota introduced partial refundability for its R&D credit: 19.2% for 2025, increasing to 25% for 2026–2027.

Oklahoma: Oklahoma revised its R&D credit to align more closely with federal QRE definitions and introduced a new pre-approval application process.

Texas: Texas enhanced its franchise tax R&D credit via SB 2206 and repealed the R&D equipment sales tax exemption effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Planning considerations: Navigating the R&D credit has become more complex amid heightened review, evolving case law, and new compliance measures.

Taxpayers should make sure claims are well-supported and consistent with updated guidance to reduce audit risk and avoid delays.

Taxpayers should carefully assess eligibility for both federal and state research credits, maintain contemporaneous documentation, and prepare to defend claims under examination.

Strategic planning is essential to leveraging available incentives, especially given the complexity and variability of state-level programs.

Using a trusted tax advisor can help taxpayers maintain compliance with IRS and state regulations and effectively substantiate research credit claims.

Rules Changed for Qualified Small Business Stock

The OBBBA significantly enhances a tax-efficient structuring option for private companies. Qualified small business stock under Section 1202 offers tax-free appreciation and has been increasingly used by private equity in recent years.

Enacted in 1993, Section 1202 generally allows a non-corporate taxpayer to exclude a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of QSBS held for more than five years.

The eligible gain exclusion percentage is based on the date the stock is issued.

For stock issued before July 5, 2025, the maximum amount of gain on QSBS that can be excluded for any tax year by each taxpayer with respect to each issuing C corporation is generally limited to the greater of: (i) $10 million, minus the amount of gain excluded by that taxpayer in prior years with respect to the same issuing corporation; or (ii) 10 times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in the QSBS sold during the tax year.

For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the $10 million limit to $15 million and adjusts this limit for inflation beginning in 2027. In addition, the OBBBA creates new 50% and 75% gain exclusion categories for QSBS held for at least three and four years, respectively.

The various QSBS exclusion percentages, exclusion limits, and required holding periods by stock issuance date are set out in the table below.

The OBBBA also increases the limit on aggregate gross assets to satisfy the qualified small business test for purposes of Section 1202. These thresholds are now as follows:

At all times through the date of issuance, the corporation’s aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or $75 million for issuances after July 4, 2025; and

Immediately after the date of issuance (and after considering amounts the corporation received in the issuance), the aggregate gross assets of the corporation must not exceed $50 million or $75 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or after July 4, 2025, respectively. Aggregate gross assets are defined as cash plus the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the corporation’s other assets.

Planning considerations: After an issuance is deemed to be QSBS under Section 1202, the corporation’s gross assets can exceed the applicable threshold (either $50 million or $75 million) at a later date without prohibiting the previously issued stock from receiving Section 1202 treatment.

By increasing the threshold, the OBBBA renews an existing corporation’s ability to issue QSBS if their aggregate gross assets have exceeded $50 million in the past but have never exceeded $75 million.

This higher threshold also expands the potential QSBS benefits for private equity firms when acquiring target businesses with enterprise values of up to $75 million.

Opportunity Zone Extension

The OBBBA made the qualified opportunity zone program permanent, preserving one of the most generous tax incentives ever offered by Congress.

The provision can offer benefits to investors looking for tax-efficient returns, individual private companies investing in specific geographies, or asset managers setting up funds.

The OBBBA not only makes the program permanent, but it also changes the rules in essential ways. Funds and investors should consider the implications for their planning strategies.

The changes could affect the timing of gain transactions and capital contributions, the location of investments, and the compliance burdens for funds.

The current QOZ designations will expire at the end of 2026. New zones will be designated in rolling 10-year designation periods under new criteria that are expected to shrink the number of qualifying zones.

Under the current program, taxpayers can defer capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund.

For investments made after 2026, taxpayers will be required to recognize the deferred gain five years after investing, but will receive a 10% increase in basis for holding the investment for five years. For QOFs operating in a new category of rural opportunity zones, this basis increase is 30%.

Taxpayers who make investments before the end of 2026 must still recognize the deferred gain at the end of 2026.

The more powerful tax benefit may be the tax-free appreciation on the underlying investment itself. Taxpayers will still receive a full basis step-up to fair market value for property held 10 years, but the OBBBA added a rule freezing the basis step-up to the FMV at 30 years after the date of the investment.

The operational rules for QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses are generally unchanged, except for property held in a rural opportunity zone.

The threshold for establishing the substantial improvement of qualifying property in a rural opportunity zone will be 50% of the basis rather than 100%, effective for any determinations after July 4, 2025.

QOFs and QOZBs will both be subject to increased reporting requirements.

Companies looking for new tax-efficient investing opportunities and gain deferral strategies should reassess their investment options, paying particular attention to which geographies are likely to qualify in 2027.

Planning considerations: The timing of capital gains transactions will be important. Delaying a capital gain transaction could allow taxpayers to make a deferral election in 2027 and defer recognizing the gain until well after the current 2026 recognition date.

Conversely, taxpayers planning investments in geographic areas that are unlikely to be redesignated may need to make the investments before the end of 2026.

Existing QOFs and QOZBs should consider their long-term capital needs because it is not clear whether any “grandfathering” relief will allow additional qualified investments in funds operating in QOZs that are not redesignated.

The new reporting rules will apply to both new and existing QOZs and QOZBs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, and those entities will need to collect and report substantial new information that has never before been required.

REIT Structuring, Real Estate Benefits

The real estate investment tax structure remains an effective way to structure certain real estate activities with only one layer of tax.

The OBBBA raises from 20% to 25% the portion of the gross asset value of a REIT that may be attributable to equity and debt securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, effective for tax years beginning after 2025. The change should provide added flexibility.

In addition, the OBBBA allows the completed contract method of accounting for many residential condominium, construction, and sale projects, effective for contracts entered into after July 4, 2025.

For residential developers that meet the average annual gross receipts test under Section 448 ($31 million in 2025), the maximum estimated contract length is increased from two to three years to qualify for the exception from the UNICAP rules under Section 263A.

Planning considerations: This provision provides much-needed tax relief to condo developers who had to report income under the percentage-of-completion method, which often required reporting income before receiving payment.

Allowing the use of the completed contract method of accounting allows better matching of reporting taxable income with the receipt of cash by the developer.

Unfortunately, the relief is provided only prospectively for contracts entered into after the July 4, 2025, enactment date.

Therefore, taxpayers with contracts entered into before the enactment date will continue to be subject to the old rules.

Moreover, reporting income for projects begun in prior years may be bound to the prior method of accounting.",https://www.cbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tax-Analysis_092518.png,N,,2025-12-29 12:57:13.894987

This consolidates Repsol’s position as the most important 100% renewable fuel networks in Europe.

Repsol demonstrates that renewable liquid fuels are a real option to reduce CO₂ emissions from transportation.

100% renewable Nexa Diesel is Repsol's highest-end fuel. It has an exclusive formulation that optimizes performance and extends the lifespan of the engine.

Repsol has reached a new milestone in its strategy to decarbonize transport by surpassing 1,500 service stations – 1,429 in Spain and 71 in Portugal – supplying Nexa Diesel of 100% renewable origin. This step forward reaffirms the company's commitment to renewable fuels and expands the range of technologies made available to support customers’ mobility, thus, meeting the objective outlined in the update of the company’s 2024-2027 strategic plan.

With this achievement, Repsol consolidates its position as the most relevant 100% renewable fuel networks in Europe, reaching more than 210 million liters sold so far this year. Currently, more than 40% of the company’s network of service stations offers renewable fuel, demonstrating that decarbonizing transport with renewable liquid fuels is a viable solution for combustion engine vehicles. These vehicles today represent 97% of the Spanish and European vehicle fleet, and 87% of sales in Spain so far this year.

To meet the climate targets set by Spain and the European Union, it is essential to recognize the role of 100% renewable fuels to reducing CO₂ emissions from combustion engines.

The 100% renewable Nexa Diesel, identified by its pink color, is Repsol's highest-end fuel. It has an exclusive formulation that optimizes performance, extends engine life, and is designed for all diesel engines. It is produced from raw materials of renewable origin and, with current technology, it already reduces the carbon footprint by up to 90% compared to the conventional fuel it replaces, thanks to the lower carbon intensity of the renewable fuel due to its organic origin.

Valero Marín, Executive Managing Director of Repsol’s Client Business, said: ""Reaching 1,500 service stations that supply 100% renewable Nexa Diesel marks a key step forward in our strategy to decarbonize transport. This milestone reaffirms Repsol's commitment to reducing CO₂ emissions and expanding solutions for our customers' mobility. We continue working to offer all the energy alternatives that best suit their needs, thus, contributing to aligning mobility with the energy transition"".

Renewable fuels. To decarbonize mobility, Repsol is committed to a model that combines all solutions that reduce emissions, such as renewable fuels, electrification, AutoGas, and renewable hydrogen, which the company is developing. The company’s vision is that all energy options, including conventional fuels combined with ultra-efficient engines, must be taken into account to guarantee supply, meet the needs of each customer, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible.

Repsol already operates the first plant in the Iberian Peninsula to produce 100% renewable fuels on a large scale, in Cartagena, producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. In 2026, it will add a second plant at its Puertollano industrial complex, with the annual capacity to produce an additional 200,000 tons of 100% renewable fuel for road and maritime transport.

In addition to this, Repsol has also developed 100% renewable gasoline after more than two decades of research. Nexa 95 Gasoline, the company's highest quality 95-octane fuel, incorporates an exclusive formulation designed in the Repsol Technology Lab in Madrid and produced at the Tarragona complex to optimize the performance of the engine and keep it in optimal conditions. This fuel is already available at 30 service stations in the Spanish regions of Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country, and Aragon.

Consequently, the soybean oil premium over palm oil, which peaked at $247/mt in mid-2025, has narrowed significantly to approximately $50/mt as of late December.
Historically, soybean oil prices were tethered to soybean meal—the protein used for animal feed.
In 2025, however, soybean oil has increasingly traded in parallel with crude oil and the ""POGO"" (Palm Oil-Gasoil) spread.","As 2025 draws to a close, the global agricultural markets are witnessing a fundamental restructuring of the relationship between the world’s two most important vegetable oils. For decades, the price spread between soybean oil and palm oil was dictated by harvest cycles and kitchen demand. However, as of December 29, 2025, that historical logic has been largely discarded, replaced by a volatile, policy-driven dynamic fueled by aggressive biofuel mandates in Southeast Asia and a protectionist shift in United States energy policy.

The immediate implications are stark: the ""food vs. fuel"" debate has evolved into a full-scale competition for feedstock dominance. With Indonesia aggressively locking down its palm oil supply for domestic energy and the U.S. implementing strict domestic-only requirements for biofuel tax credits, the global ""fat gap"" is narrowing. This has created a ""wait-and-see"" volatility where prices for Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) and Bunge Global SA (NYSE: BG) are now more sensitive to carbon-intensity scores and legislative ""Regulatory Freezes"" than to actual crop yields.

A Year of Policy Shocks and Narrowing Spreads

The primary catalyst for this market transformation was the implementation of Indonesia’s B40 mandate on January 1, 2025. By requiring a 40% palm-based blend in domestic diesel, Indonesia effectively placed a ""floor"" under palm oil prices, curtailing exports and driving Bursa Malaysia futures to hover between 4,100 and 4,500 ringgit (~$970–$1,050/mt) throughout the year. This aggressive move was further complicated by President Prabowo Subianto’s push for a B50 mandate. While technical hurdles have led the government to consider a B45 interim step for 2026, the signal to the market was clear: palm oil is no longer just a cooking ingredient; it is a strategic energy reserve.

In the United States, the passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (OBBB) in July 2025 sent shockwaves through the soybean complex. The legislation extended the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit but introduced a ""North American-only"" feedstock requirement. This move was designed to boost domestic soybean oil demand but has ironically led to a period of ""crush margin compression."" Refiners, uncertain of the final carbon-intensity (CI) scoring guidance due to a late-year regulatory freeze, have been hesitant to sign long-term contracts. Consequently, the soybean oil premium over palm oil, which peaked at $247/mt in mid-2025, has narrowed significantly to approximately $50/mt as of late December.

Winners and Losers in the New Regulatory Landscape

The divergence in corporate performance this year has been a tale of two strategies: global agility versus domestic concentration. Bunge Global SA (NYSE: BG) has emerged as a relative winner, successfully integrating its $7.3 billion acquisition of Viterra. This massive footprint has allowed Bunge to navigate regional trade bottlenecks and leverage strong South American processing capacity to offset thin margins in North America. Conversely, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) has struggled, significantly slashing its 2025 guidance after reporting a 93% drop in 3Q crushing profits. ADM’s heavy reliance on the U.S. domestic market made it particularly vulnerable to the 45Z policy delays and the resulting margin squeeze.

In the specialized biofuel sector, Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) has positioned itself as a ""clear winner"" of the OBBB Act. By controlling the largest North American network for waste fats, such as used cooking oil (UCO) and tallow, Darling has created a protective moat. Foreign competitors like Neste (HEL: NESTE) have been forced to re-optimize their global flows, moving Singapore-produced shipments away from the U.S. and toward the European Union to meet ReFuelEU aviation mandates. While Neste's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) volumes tripled in 2025, its margins have faced pressure from the loss of U.S. subsidy eligibility for its non-North American feedstocks.

The Energy-Linked Decoupling

The wider significance of these shifts lies in the ""industrial decoupling"" of vegetable oils from the broader agricultural complex. Historically, soybean oil prices were tethered to soybean meal—the protein used for animal feed. In 2025, however, soybean oil has increasingly traded in parallel with crude oil and the ""POGO"" (Palm Oil-Gasoil) spread. This energy-linkage means that agricultural traders now spend as much time analyzing OPEC+ production cuts as they do South American weather patterns.

Furthermore, the ""North American-first"" policy in the U.S. has triggered a global ripple effect. By effectively banning imported Chinese UCO and Brazilian tallow for subsidized fuel production, the U.S. has forced these feedstocks into the European and Asian markets, creating a two-tiered pricing system for ""low-carbon"" fats. This regulatory fragmentation is reshaping global trade routes, with ""green"" fuels flowing toward the highest subsidy regimes rather than the most efficient logistical paths. Historical precedents, such as the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard, pale in comparison to the sheer volume of vegetable oil now being diverted from plates to fuel tanks.

The Road Ahead: B50 and the SAF Frontier

Looking toward 2026, the market is bracing for the next phase of this transition. The short-term focus remains on the U.S. Treasury’s final 45Z guidance, which will determine the exact value of tax credits based on farming practices. If the guidance favors ""climate-smart"" agriculture, we could see a massive influx of investment into low-CI soybean production. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s potential move to B45 or B50 remains the ""X-factor"" for palm oil. A full B50 implementation would require nearly 20 million kiloliters of palm oil annually, a volume that could theoretically eliminate Indonesia’s export surplus and send global vegetable oil prices into a new stratosphere.

The long-term opportunity lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With major carriers like DHL Express signing massive offtake agreements with Neste, and Darling Ingredients scaling its Port Arthur facility to upgrade half of its capacity to SAF, the aviation sector is becoming the new ""must-serve"" customer. For companies like Wilmar International (SGX: F34), the challenge will be maintaining access to the European market under the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) while simultaneously feeding the growing energy hunger of the Southeast Asian domestic market.

Final Thoughts for the 2026 Investor

The era of ""cheap"" vegetable oil appears to be a relic of the past. As we enter 2026, the market has transitioned from being supply-driven to being policy-driven. While record harvests in Brazil might traditionally suggest lower prices, the voracious appetite of the biofuel and SAF sectors is effectively neutralizing any supply surplus. For investors, the key takeaway is that agricultural stocks are now, for all intents and purposes, energy stocks.

Moving forward, the primary indicators to watch are the Palm Oil-Gasoil spread, the finalization of the 45Z carbon scoring, and any shifts in Southeast Asian export levies. The ""fat gap"" is real, and as the world’s transportation sectors look to decarbonize, the humble soybean and oil palm have become the most contested commodities on the planet.

Against the ""high-carbon lock-in""dilemma in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industrialization, which is caused by high costs, insufficient supply, and a lack of policy coordination, this study takes the logic of ""subject behavior coordination-phased management -policy tool adaptation"" as the core and constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model involving the government, airlines, and fuel producers. It systematically examines the initial, development, and maturity stages of SAF industrialization. By establishing dynamic replication equations, solving Jacobian matrices, and conducting numerical simulations, this study clearly reveals the evolutionary paths and equilibrium conditions of the strategic interactions among the three parties at different stages. The results show that in the initial stage, a high-intensity policy combination of ""government subsidies covering more than 60% of airlines' SAF purchase premium + high carbon tax"" must be implemented to break the ""high-carbon lock-in""deadlock during the introduction period of industrialization. In the development stage, to address the bottleneck of ""weak supply-demand coordination"", airlines need to bear no less than 33.3% of fuel producers' R&D costs through investment and provide a profit share of no less than 15%. Moreover, the intensity of the carbon tax should be increased to more than 1.6 times the original level. In addition, a ""dual-drive mechanism integrating push and pull""should be built that relies on ""green finance + offtake agreements + industrial chain equity investment"". In the mature stage, the carbon quota price for airlines should be set such that the selling price is at least 0.75 times the purchase cost. Under this premise, the SAF will gradually gain cost competitiveness and economies of scale.

I et land som Norge, bygget på olje og gass, besitter vi enormt med kunnskap om næringen, men for å klare en energiomstilling kreves det en helt unik kompetanse.

Kompetanse som St1 bringer med seg når de nå setter sitt preg på stasjonene sine over hele Norge. For til tross for å ha vært til stede i Norge i over 10 år allerede, er det først nå de heiser stasjonsflaggene med egen logo.

Stasjonene, som tidligere var under varemerket Shell, kalles derfor nå for St1. Et viktig steg for å klare visjonen.

Og du finner de i alle retninger: sør, nord, øst og vest.

St1 selger fortsatt mest av bensin og diesel, men tilgangen til en bred energimiks gjør at forbrukere kan ta smartere valg ved pumpa.

– Når alle har tilgang til klimabevisst energi, kan de ta et mer bevisst valg på hvilken energi de skal bruke.

Det forteller Erlend Føleide, Head of marketing hos St1.

– Det er viktig for at vi, samfunnet, skal nå klimamålene våre.

Å kunne tilby klimabevisst energi krever at man bruker alle resursene tilgjengelig, og tenker utenfor de tradisjonelle banene.

For St1 betyr det blant annet å ta en ekstra titt på kjøkkenet.

Ikke et typisk energiselskap

St1s synlighet langs norske veier er med andre ord langt mer enn bare et navneskifte.

Energiomstillingen skjer ikke av seg selv. Man må tørre å gå opp nye spor og det blir kun mulig dersom absolutt alle er med på laget.

Også prisene spiller på lag.

– For at bærekraftig energi skal være attraktiv, må prisene være det, sier Føleide.

I tillegg må alle ha tilgang til energi. Derfor produsere St1 energi til både sjø- og luftfart, bygger ut ladenettverket for elbiler i rekordfart og produserer biogass til tungtransport.

Når alle har tilgang til bærekraftig energi, kan alle være med på å ta bærekraftige valg.

Det er en viktig forutsetning for å styrke konkurranseevnen og effektiviteten, men også for å ta eierskap over en energiomstilling.

St1 legger som sagt ikke skjul på at tradisjonell olje –bensin og diesel – fortsatt er en stor del av «energiporteføljen».

– I tillegg til fokuset på energiomstillingen vet vi at kundene er opptatt av prisen i masten.

– Derfor jobber vi hele tiden med å tilby en attraktiv pris for kundene, sier Føleide.

Målet er å gjøre det lettere for mennesker og bedrifter å velge energi med lavere utslipp – uansett om den kommer fra strøm, biogass eller andre drivstoffer med lavt utslipp.

For St1 handler altså omstillingen ikke om å snakke om fremtiden, men om å bidra til å forme den – steg for steg, stasjon for stasjon

Mr Farajallah was previously operations chief at Flybe until 2018.
Leading zero-emission aircraft engine innovator to work with UK’s leading regional airline on bringing zero-emission flight to passengers.","Electric planes are very much part of Loganair's forward planning for services to the islands.

Talking to the London-based Daily Telegraph, Loganair's CEO Luke Farajallah has expanded on an interview which he gave earlier this year to welovestornoway.com

The airline has signed agreements with both Heart Aerospace, which is finalising the design of a plane combining a propeller engine with battery packs, and ZeroAvia, which is bidding to power aircraft with electricity produced from hydrogen fuel cells.

Loganair's status as a modestly-sized regional airline is precisely why it is so suited to the task, according to Mr Farajallah.

The engines being developed by Los Angeles-based Heart and ZeroAvia, which has twin bases in Seattle and Cotswold airport in Gloucestershire, will – initially at least – produce nowhere near enough thrust to get a full-sized airliner off the runway, he said.

But if they work as advertised, they will be sufficient to power the fleet of propeller planes that Loganair uses on its routes to Scottish islands and cities across the UK.

Loganair is encouraging travellers to get ahead with their 2026 staycation plans as it launches its Tartan Sale, offering 17% off flights across its network.

Running from today (Monday, 29 December) until Thursday, 8 January 2026, this gives customers the chance to secure reduced fares for travel from Monday, 2 February 2026, ideal for early spring breaks, short escapes and planned visits across the UK and island communities. The discount is available by using the promo code WINTER17 at the time of booking. Bookings must be made via loganair.co.uk, the Loganair app or by calling Loganair’s Customer Help Centre. The discount applies to the net fare only and is subject to availability. Exclusions apply.

Those routes include the world’s shortest scheduled flight at just 90 seconds between Papa Westray and Westray in Orkney; and the only scheduled beach landing, on Barra. Mr Farajallah said a “conversation” had begun with Transport Scotland about fitting the engine into one of two Twin Otter planes that operate to Campbeltown,Tiree and Barra under Public Service Obligation contracts.

Mr Farajallah told the Daily Telegraph that Loganair's unique network, with flights averaging 35 minutes, makes the foray into electric propulsion a hard-nosed business decision.

“If you’re going to use less fuel and have a lower carbon footprint while lowering your costs, and the components in the engine are going to be less complicated and need changing less, then it’s a compelling proposition.""

However, Mr Farajallah questioned the speed at which both Scotland and the UK are running down the oil and gas industry, to which the fortunes of Loganair have been closely tied through its services to Aberdeen and Shetland.

He said: “Offshore oil is critically important to our business, our industry and to Scotland and it’s my view that the levers that are being pulled within Government are a bit too extreme.

“There is an assumption that everyone who is working in oil and gas will transition across to renewables, and that isn’t the case. There’s a whole range of skills that are not immediately transferable. It’s different technology, research, universities, background and experience.”

Mr Farajallah was also critical of the extent to which switching to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mostly derived from used cooking oil, has come to dominate thinking around decarbonising aviation, both within the industry and across governments.

With SAF costing four to five times as much as kerosene, a UK requirement to use a 10pc blend of the propellant by 2030 will push costs dangerously high for a regional airline sector where established players are already collapsing under the weight of high taxation, he said.

Mr Farajallah was previously operations chief at Flybe until 2018. He also worked at Wizz Air, easyJet, British Airways and Bond Helicopters, which transported crews to North Sea oil rigs.

Loganair was named Sustainable Airline of the Year for 2024 by the European Regional Airline Association (ERA for its concrete steps towards reducing its environmental footprint.

Judges highlighted Loganair’s collaboration with Cranfield Aerospace Solutions to convert its Britten Norman Islander aircraft, which operates inter-island routes in Orkney, to hydrogen cell power. They also praised Loganair’s first all-electric turnaround of an aircraft at Stornoway Airport, where the airline is in the process of replacing over 100 pieces of ground service equipment (GSE) to reduce emissions further.

What master planning involves Master planning is defined as a decision-making framework for complex assets.
In KBR’s master planning process, the company carries out structured data collection and reviews the existing infrastructure, which involves on-site inspections and desktop analysis.
Strategic master planning does not eliminate uncertainty, but it does create the space to act, to prepare, and to respond with intent.","Europe’s refineries are under increasing pressure. Demand for petrol and diesel is falling, environmental regulations are tightening, and the region’s refineries, many of which were built in the 1970s or earlier, are operating well beyond their original design life. As a result, operators are having to make stark choices about whether to reinvest, repurpose, or plan a phased exit. This is where master planning can offer Europe’s refineries a strategic reset.

There are still around 73 operational refineries around Europe (excluding Russia), with a combined capacity of roughly 14 million bpd.1 However, since 2009, around 30 refineries in the region have either closed or been converted with many more looking economically unviable.2 This is due to a combination of falling margins, policy pressure, and ageing infrastructure.

At the same time, ownership is shifting. As oil majors divest from legacy assets, a new wave of operators have entered the market.3 These new owners are typically smaller, equity-focused businesses, who do not always have the same depth of in-house refining expertise or legacy system knowledge, and who are struggling to train and retain suitably experienced personnel. Instead, they typically rely on external support to manage complex assets.

This is where strategic master planning can help. The approach is designed to help operators assess their options using a structured, cross-disciplinary process that connects asset condition, market dynamics, operational risk, and workforce capability into a single roadmap. For refinery owners looking for their next steps it offers a strategic reset.

It is used to extend life, improve performance, or transition an asset to a new purpose or, in some cases, to exit in a managed way that preserves value. The process integrates technical assessments, commercial modelling, regulatory compliance, and capability planning.

At its core, master planning addresses five common ‘burning points’ that directly affect refinery profitability:

Feedstock optimisation: where selecting and configuring feed can maximise margin.

Fixed and operating cost control: which focuses on improving efficiency and reducing overheads.

Better application of technology: to ensure investment is targeted where it delivers real value.

Revenue improvement: whether through yield optimisation or changes to the product mix.

Regulatory readiness: to make sure the asset remains compliant now and in the future.

The process begins by clarifying the strategic direction. Is the asset intended to operate for another 10 or 20 years? Is there a transition plan in place to convert it into a fuel import terminal, hydrogen hub, or biofuels site? Does the site need to prepare for decommissioning in the near-term? The answers to these questions will determine the focus of the master plan. At this stage, it is also important to identify the investment appetite, operational constraints, and stakeholder priorities that will determine what is possible.

The next step involves a deep dive into the asset itself. In KBR’s master planning process, the company carries out structured data collection and reviews the existing infrastructure, which involves on-site inspections and desktop analysis. This process aims to get a clear picture of the full, current state of the facility, including the process unit condition, equipment criticality, maintenance effectiveness, backlog and spares strategy, yield and loss performance, utility systems, and regulatory compliance. During the process, documentation and technical reviews are carried out, along with condition grading and risk-based evaluation of failure.

Once this information is collated, it is possible to compare this detailed assessment against the business goals, carrying out margin and market analysis to identify what can be optimised and where capital investment is justified. A configuration review assesses whether the asset’s current layout and process capability is aligned with future product needs and policy requirements. Technology screening is used to identify areas where reliability, emissions, or product flexibility can be improved. Finally, a regulatory compliance review is carried out to make sure the site’s permits, environmental obligations, and reporting frameworks meet its future needs.

From here, the master plan can be developed and would include a series of recommendations for short-term improvement actions and long-term transformation options, which are sequenced around the asset’s maintenance and turnaround cycles. KBR typically facilitates a series of interactive workshops at this point with client stakeholders to prioritise actions, evaluate trade-offs, and develop a realistic, risk-managed roadmap.

The cost of inaction

Many refinery decisions are tied to the turnaround cycle, which typically takes place every four to six years. This is the window where major upgrades, decommissioning, or reconfiguration can be carried out. If operators miss that window, the next opportunity might not come until the end of the decade.

More than 400 000 bpd of refining capacity is now confirmed to shut in 2025. This includes Petroineos’ Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, Shell’s Wesseling site in Germany, part of BP’s Gelsenkirchen complex, and the Prax Lindsey Oil Refinery in England, which is now in formal wind-down after entering administration in June 2025 and failing to secure a buyer.

This is why, when facing uncertainty about the long-term future of an asset, any delays can be costly. A full-site turnaround can result in significant direct and indirect costs. Lost production alone can equate to over US$3 million per day in foregone margin, regardless of whether the shutdown is for maintenance or unplanned.

Over time, the performance gap between average and top-performing refineries can reach US$20 - 50 million in margin annually. In environments that are sensitive to these margins, these figures can determine whether a site remains viable at all. However, making even small operational improvements – in areas such as scheduling, asset care, or spares strategy – can unlock marginal gains.

Master planning in practice

KBR engaged with a European refinery which was struggling to remain competitive and to carry out sustainable operations. It was suffering from the ‘perfect storm’: a changing crude slate, government-imposed carbon taxes, and rising energy costs with a rapidly evolving product demand profile. Added to this, its parent oil major company had divested the asset to a consortium of smaller traders, starving it of access to leading-edge standards/procedures and a dearth of technical support.

A market study found a mismatch between product slate and demand, identifying the opportunity to revise fuel specifications and to embrace bi-directional trading of intermediates with other refiners and petrochemical facilities in the region. Similarly, a new crude pipeline from a nearby marine terminal facilitated added flexibility to process alternative imported crude oils.

KBR simulated the existing refinery configuration in HYSYS and specified modifications including changes to crude distillation unit (CDU) cut-points with minor debottlenecking throughout the refinery. The changes were implemented with an accelerated schedule to take advantage of the next turnaround and ended up costing approximately US$86 million while achieving an increase in revenue of approximately US$72 million. Greater operational flexibility was achieved with new trading partners creating a more sustainable and long-term horizon.

Work is continuing to address the availability of suitably qualified technical staff and to review and update the internal management system with a view to achieving improved availability, lower maintenance, and general operating costs.

It is a similar case across Europe, where many refineries are evaluating their future role and whether they can pivot toward producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), integrate hydrogen infrastructure, or act as anchor sites for carbon capture. These changes require more than just technical upgrades: they require a phased approach to investment, permitting, off-take agreements, and workforce transition, all of which must be considered in the master plan.

Planning for more than equipment

It is important to remember that master planning is not just about the physical asset. It also looks at the wider systems, tools, and teams needed to operate reliably and competitively.

For example, digital tools play a key role, including computerised maintenance management system (CMMS) integration, predictive maintenance, and asset analytics. KBR’s use of Maximo and other platforms helps clients optimise maintenance scheduling, manage spares, and reduce downtime without major capital spend.

Just as important is capability development. As refineries adapt, whether into energy hubs, import terminals, or cleaner fuel producers, their organisational needs change too. KBR’s planning approach includes team structure design, role profiles, training pathways, and knowledge transfer.

This includes workforce capability mapping, organisational design, and succession planning for ageing subject matter experts. In many cases, master planning reveals not just what assets need to change, but what people, skills, and decision-making processes must evolve alongside them.

A new kind of readiness

Clarity is hard to come by in today’s refining market, but waiting for certainty is not an option. Strategic master planning does not eliminate uncertainty, but it does create the space to act, to prepare, and to respond with intent. For some sites, that might mean extending life through targeted reinvestment. For others, it could mean preparing for phased shutdown, conversion, or repurposing. What matters is that there is a strategic plan in place. For any operator looking to understand their options and take control of what comes next, that may be the most valuable investment they can make.

Uganda Airlines, the country's revived national carrier, has in recent months been plagued by setbacks that mirror the wider struggles of African aviation.

Just this month, passengers traveling to Dubai and other destinations were stranded for days following technical faults that left aircraft grounded in Lagos and London. Reports of poor communication, lack of accommodation, and even police intervention in Dubai to secure meals for affected travelers sparked public outrage.

The airline, already hemorrhaging losses--nearly shs300 billion (about USD 80 million) in 2024 alone--faces accusations of mismanagement, including concerns over leadership qualifications and executive remuneration that reportedly far exceeds that of counterparts at profitable airlines such as Ethiopian Airlines.

These incidents are not isolated. They reflect a continent-wide aviation crisis in which national carriers struggle under operational constraints, rising costs, weak governance, and fierce competition from well-capitalized global airlines.

Africa's aviation sector, despite leading global growth in passenger numbers in the post-pandemic period, remains structurally constrained. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects African airlines will generate only USD 0.2 billion in profits in 2025, translating into a razor-thin 1.1 percent net margin, far below the global average.

Fragmented markets and restrictive policies continue to hinder seamless operations. High fuel costs, excessive taxes, airport charges, and blocked funds--where governments restrict the repatriation of airline revenues--further erode viability. Safety concerns persist, with Africa recording an accident rate of 1.1 per million flights in 2025, pointing to infrastructure gaps and regulatory weaknesses.

Geopolitical tensions compound these challenges. Conflicts force costly rerouting of flights, while security risks in volatile regions raise insurance and operational costs. Meanwhile, intra-African connectivity remains limited: only 20 percent of air travel within Africa is intra-continental, compelling passengers to make expensive detours through Europe or the Middle East.

Uganda Airlines' struggles echo those of other African carriers, including Kenya Airways, which has grappled with heavy debt and repeated government bailouts despite strategic partnerships with KLM. Across the continent, airlines face common operational constraints, fleet underutilization, and the harsh reality of competing against entrenched global and regional giants.

While governance reforms and private-sector partnerships offer part of the solution, national fixes alone are insufficient. Africa needs a bolder, collective vision.

Africa's aviation future lies in a joint Pan-African airline, owned by continental shareholders and aligned with the African Union's integration agenda. Such a carrier--an ""Air Africa"" for the modern era--could pool resources, spread risk, and harness collective strength.

Equity could be distributed among member states based on population size, GDP, or aviation needs. With economies of scale, a joint airline would be better positioned to negotiate favorable fuel contracts, aircraft leases, insurance, and maintenance agreements--costs that currently cripple smaller national operators.

Shared fleets would improve aircraft utilization and operational resilience, addressing issues such as limited wide-body availability that contributed to Uganda Airlines' recent disruptions. By prioritizing underserved routes, the airline could significantly boost intra-African connectivity and support trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Tourism would benefit immensely from affordable, direct flights between cities such as Lagos and Johannesburg or Nairobi and Dakar--unlocking billions of dollars in potential GDP growth.

The benefits extend beyond balance sheets. A Pan-African airline would symbolize unity and shared purpose, echoing the vision of the now-defunct Air Afrique, which connected West African nations from the 1960s until the early 2000s. Its failure offers lessons: the need for transparent governance, professional management, and insulation from political interference.

With a multinational board combining public oversight and private-sector expertise, accountability could be strengthened. Sustainability would also gain momentum. Collective bargaining for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could help overcome current barriers such as high costs and regulatory gaps, positioning Africa as a future leader in green aviation.

Critics may argue that Africa's fragmentation makes such a venture unrealistic, citing past alliance failures. Yet recent developments--including Kenya Airways' evolving partnerships and the ongoing implementation of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM)--suggest growing momentum toward liberalization and cooperation.

National pride alone cannot sustain loss-making airlines. Smart, continent-wide partnerships can.

By uniting as shareholders, African nations can transform aviation from a perennial loss-maker into a powerful engine of integration, trade, and shared prosperity. For Uganda Airlines and its peers, the future may not lie in isolated revival, but in rebirth through solidarity.

Next time you get on a long haul flight and find your seat, here's some food for thought. The plane may well be powered in part by old cooking oil. From eateries in Beijing to street food stalls in Malaysia, The global aviation industry has promised to hit net 0 emissions by 2050 and is banking on one crucial ingredient to get there. Safe or sustainable aviation fuel. Fuel made from waste like. Used cooking oil in agricultural leftovers instead of crude oil. SAF can cut life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to around 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and process. And it is already in the tanks of some of the world's biggest airlines like Australia's national airline Qantas. Safe is going to be a massive part of aviations decarbonization pathway. It is absolutely critical to be able to decarbonise. Long haul airlines like Qantas. Fiona MSN is chief sustainability officer for Qantas. She says the airline has set a target to cut its overall emissions by 25% by 20-30 with staff as a key strategy. Messent hopes to establish Sydney Airport as a major staff hub and refueling point in the region. The key challenge that will need to be unlocked is how do you get to the scale of supply necessary at the right cost. All airlines? So where will all that extra fuel come from? A 2025 IR to report says staff output currently only covers an estimated .7% of airlines fuel needs globally. For airlines to meet their targets, new staff suppliers are crucial in Malaysia and new plant is giving a glimpse of what a waste only future could look like. Here in the southern region of Johor, Hong Kong based biofuels company Echo Series has built this state-of-the-art biorefinery using only waste or residue oil. Echo Series picks up waste oil or feedstock from food factories, palm oil mills and restaurants across the region. Like this noodle restaurant kitchen in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, Feedstock. In this case, used cooking oil is collected, weighed. And transported to collection hubs where it's filtered and stored in silos before being transported to the biorefinery. Inside the Johor plant, old chip fat meets serious chemistry. First, the feedstock is cleaned up. Water, food particles and impurities are stripped out. Then, through a series of processes including hydro treatment and isomerization, the molecules in the oil are reengineered into hydrocarbons that have the right freezing point and structure for flying at cruising altitude, ready to be pumped directly into a plane. Echo Sirius says at maximum capacity, the plant will produce up to 420,000 tons of fuel per year, including large volumes of SAF for partner airlines. Like Cathay Pacific, Qantas and British Airways, the person driving this push, the company CEO, known as the godfather of staff, he has dedicated his career to decarbonizing travel. Well, these airlines speak Easter risk. They say that it's the climate change so. I think that we fit perfectly because we have a solution, technology solution to decarbonize. He argues that the real innovation here is not just the chemistry, but the system. Echo series wants a highly local model, short transport, distances from kitchen to plant, steady predictable supply and crucially, detailed records of where every leader of waste oil comes from. Malaysia could be the first country in the world. Who have really their shergar economy. So we are taking, you know, the feedstock those use cooking oil, some power palm waste, food waste. We bring it, you know our plant, we turn it to SF and then the KL and other big airports. In in Malaysia, but also Singapore. If that model works here, I could Series wants to replicate it in other markets. Echo Series is actively expanding its presence across Southeast Asia and already has a refinery and strong feedstock network in China. Today we have 350,000 restaurant in China which supplying to us and we know exactly which restaurant what date. The the waste is waste. All this coming. Echo Series is Malaysia plant is part of a growing network of renewable fuel projects globally, all racing to supply airlines under mounting pressure to cut emissions quickly. Industry heavyweight Nest, which has a facility across the border in Singapore, has signed agreements with Singapore Airlines and Scoot, while in the States staff production is expected to grow by 20% in 2026 thanks to many more facilities coming online. According to the US Energy Information Administration, even with the right supply, Levine says staff costs are three to five times more than conventional jet fuel. So who's paying the difference? And the feedstock is much, much more expensive than the crude oil. So the biggest thing to tackle for the future to get the cost down, it's how we could get much more feedstock that there what what we what we actually need. We've been really strategic about the way that we're picking up stuff. So we don't currently pass that cost on to our customers. We're also focused on those ports where we can get government support to be able to pick it up at a lower price. Missent says Qantas already refuels with staff at Heathrow and. LAX airports making up 1% of its fuel. Their target is to grow that to 10% by the end of the decade and 60% by 2050 if supply can keep up. We need a lot of things to go right in order to get there. It will be really difficult given the cost, but that's exactly why we're so focused on partnering with the right partners like Eco Series that brings that credibility to the supply chain, but also that has the access in the region to a significant amount of staff supply we're really focused on building. About the industry here. A circular idea and action if the model can scale. Locally sourced, fully traceable, affordable staff. Today's dirty frying oil Cleaning up, tomorrow's flying. New fuel sources, reimagining how hydrogen is used, and harnessing the sun's power. Several reasons to picture tomorrow that can be truly transformed.

Metanol hijau merupakan jembatan vital untuk mendekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang sulit dijangkau oleh elektrifikasi langsung seperti sektor maritim dan sektor penerbangan.","Catatan: Artikel ini merupakan opini pribadi penulis dan tidak mencerminkan pandangan Redaksi CNBCIndonesia.com

Metanol merupakan salah satu komponen penting dalam pengembangan energi terbarukan di Indonesia. Metanol juga menjadi salah satu bahan baku dalam pembuatan biodiesel. Saat ini, metanol yang digunakan di dalam proses pembuatan biodiesel berasal dari gas alam. Alternatif lain yang bisa digunakan adalah metanol dari gas karbondioksida atau yang disebut metanol hijau/green methanol menghadirkan alternatif dalam upaya global untuk mengatasi krisis iklim.

Dalam proses produksi metanol hijau, menggunakan bahan baku gas CO2 dan hidrogen hijau/green hydrogen yang diproduksi dari proses elektrolisis air. Di tengah urgensi dekarbonisasi sektor industri, pendekatan inovatif ini muncul sebagai solusi yang menjanjikan, yaitu dengan menggunakan gas CO2 sebagai bahan baku dalam produksi bahan bakar cair (metanol) yang serbaguna dan ramah lingkungan.

Potensi yang besar dari pembuatan metanol dari gas karbondioksida masih menghadapai tantangan ekonomi terkait biaya capital expenditure (CAPEX) dan operational expenditure (OPEX) yang besar, kesiapan infrastruktur untuk proses penangkapan gas CO2 dari industri serta masih terbatasnya lisensor teknologi untuk produksi metanol dari CO2.

Sebuah Terobosan Berkelanjutan

Metanol konvensional yang biasanya berasal dari proses reforming gas alam atau gasifikasi batu bara, merupakan komoditas bahan kimia strategis yang digunakan dalam produksi formaldehida, plastik, tekstil, bahan bakar dan juga sebagai campuran bahan bakar fosil.

Proses produksi metanol hijau melibatkan siklus yang hampir netral karbon, di mana CO2 ditangkap dari sumber industri atau langsung dari udara. Gas CO2 kemudian dihidrogenasi menggunakan hidrogen yang dihasilkan dari elektrolisis air bertenaga energi terbarukan (seperti matahari, geotermal dan angin).

Siklus ini secara efektif akan mendaur ulang gas CO2. Ketika metanol hijau digunakan sebagai bahan bakar, akan dihasilkan CO2 yang sebelumnya sebagai bahan baku. Gas CO2 hasil dari penggunaan metanol sebagai bahan bakar dapat digunakan lagi sebagai bahan baku untuk pembuatan metanol hijau. Hal ini menjadikan metanol hijau sebagai alternatif bahan bakar fosil yang efisien dan berpotensi rendah emisi. Metanol hijau menawarkan alternatif jalur dekarbonisasi yang siap pakai.

Penggunaan metanol sebagai bahan bakar kapal laut semakin banyak dibahas dan diimplementasikan di seluruh dunia karena kemudahan penanganan, penyimpanan, dan pengangkutannya. Selain itu metanol juga dapat digunakan sebagai salah satu alternatif bahan baku pembuatan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Tantangan Ekonomi dan Skalabilitas

Metanol hijau memiliki keunggulan terkait dengan daur ulang CO2 dan produksi dalam skala besar, seperti yang dilakukan oleh Carbon Recycling International (CRI) di Islandia. Rintangan utama pengembangan metanol hijau saat ini datang dari aspek ekonomi. Produksi metanol hijau saat ini masih jauh lebih mahal dibandingkan metanol konvensional yang berasal dari bahan bakar fosil.

Proses produksi metanol hijau yang mahal disebabkan karena biaya listrik tinggi yang berasal dari energi terbarukan (untuk pembuatan hidrogen hijau), investasi modal yang besar untuk alat elektrolisis air menjadi hidrogen dan fasilitas penangkapan gas CO2.

Menurut laporan dari International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), biaya produksi metanol terbarukan saat ini bisa lebih dari dua kali lipat harga metanol konvensional berbasis gas alam atau batubara. Untuk membuat teknologi ini menjadi kompetitif, diperlukan dukungan kebijakan fiskal yang kuat. Contohnya seperti yang terlihat dalam program RePowerEU di Eropa dan Inflation Reduction Act di Amerika Serikat, yang memberikan insentif finansial untuk energi bersih.

Dari aspek teknis, penurunan biaya teknologi elektrolisis hidrogen hijau dan penggunaan katalis untuk produksi metanol dengan konversi tinggi adalah kunci untuk mendapatkan harga produksi metanol hijau yang kompetitif. Ke depannya, harga metanol hijau yang kompetitif diharapkan dapat bersaing dengan metanol dari gas alam atau batubara.

Inovasi Katalis dan Efisiensi Proses

Perkembangan dalam teknologi katalis untuk metanol hijau, seperti penggunaan katalis berbasis alloy tembaga yang memiliki komposisi tembaga, seng oksida, dan indium oksida (atau aluminum oksida), berperan dalam meningkatkan konversi reaksi hidrogenasi CO2 menjadi metanol. Selain konversi yang tinggi, faktor kunci lain yang harus diperhatikan adalah kondisi operasi katalis pada suhu dan tekanan yang lebih rendah, yang berdampak pada turunnya biaya produksi metanol hijau.

CRI selain membangun industri metanol hijau di Islandia yang menggunakan gas CO2 dan listrik dari pembangkit listrik tenaga panas bumi juga membangun pabrik serupa dengan kapasitas lebih besar di Norwegia.

Pabrik CRI di Islandia memiliki kapasitas 5.000 ton/tahun sedangkan CRI di Norwegia berencana berproduksi dengan kapasitas 300.000 ton/tahun. Untuk CRI di Norwegia akan menggunakan energi listrik dari pembangkit listrik tenaga air dan gas CO2 berasal dari industri pengolahan logam.

Kesimpulan: Sebuah Keniscayaan Strategis

Metanol hijau memiliki peluang besar sebagai komponen penting dalam bauran energi masa depan. Metanol hijau merupakan jembatan vital untuk mendekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang sulit dijangkau oleh elektrifikasi langsung seperti sektor maritim dan sektor penerbangan.

Jalan menuju adopsi teknologi metanol hijau memerlukan kolaborasi erat antara industri, pemerintah, dan akademisi. Penggunaan CO2 dari gas emisi menjadi bahan baku industri bernilai tinggi adalah demonstrasi nyata dari ekonomi sirkular yang berkelanjutan.

Fokus yang diperlukan saat ini adalah pada produksi metanol hijau dalam skala besar, penurunan biaya melalui inovasi (desain katalis dan desain alat elektrolis air menjadi hidrogen), kebijakan suportif dari pemerintah, dan membangun infrastruktur yang diperlukan untuk memastikan metanol hijau menjadi pilar utama dalam lanskap energi bersih global.

Analysis of government data for PA Media has revealed regional airports are among those facing the steepest increases in business rates of any sector in the UK amid an overhaul of property valuations underpinning the tax.

While London’s Heathrow and Gatwick are also being hit with huge increases in their business rates bills, the figures show that the most extreme cases are focused outside London, with regional airports poised to suffer.

Global tax firm Ryan’s calculation of Valuation Office Agency data found that the rateable values have jumped more than sixfold in some cases in the latest property revaluation, sending tax bills soaring higher.

Even with transitional relief, which limits increases to 30% next year, regional airports will still endure some of the largest cash increases in the country.

And most airports face their bills more than doubling over the next three years.

Manchester airport is among the worst affected, with its business rates bill likely to increase by £4.2m to £18.1m next year, according to Ryan’s data.

Bristol airport will receive a £1.2m increase to £5.2m, while Birmingham International airport faces a £1.8m rise to £7.6m.

Newcastle International airport is in line for a £244,755 rise to £1.1m.

Alex Probyn, the practice leader for Europe and Asia-Pacific property tax at Ryan, told PA Media: “With an unprecedented 295% sector-wide uplift, regional airports simply cannot absorb a cost shock of this magnitude.

“These increases will inevitably flow through the system: first into airport charges, then into airline costs, and ultimately into ticket prices.”

Airport operators have said the tax blow may also hold back investment in the sector.

A Manchester Airports Group spokesperson said: “Airports were already some of the highest rates-payers in the country and were prepared to pay significantly more.

“But increases of more than 100% mean we have to look again at our plans to invest more than £2bn in our airports across the UK over the next five years.

“It is inevitable air travel will become more expensive as the industry absorbs these costs. That impacts hard-working people throughout the country and makes global trade harder for businesses.”

AirportsUK – the trade group representing the sector – is working on a response to the Treasury’s consultation on the business rates plan, which closes in February.

It said the plans were “shortsighted” and would “have a knock-on effect for the businesses that depend on airport connectivity in all areas of England”.

This risks “negatively impacting local economies that depend on the supply chains, tourists and connections their airports provide”, according to the group.

“That is why the long-term review into how airport business rates are calculated, also announced by government, is so important and we will engage with Treasury to ensure this delivers the positive outcome airports need to drive investment and economic growth.”

Other regional airports heading for large bill increases include Liverpool airport with a £233,100 rise to £1m, East Midlands International airport with a £437,895 increase to £1.9m, and Bournemouth airport with a £102,398 increase to £443,723.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f5f7e68bffc435a94d547447aa39746aeae3d68/561_0_2250_1800/master/2250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b88f88f73db334e39b9fc0fbf0c8fb07",N,,2025-12-29 03:57:24.546667

However, data covering aviation fuel supply up to October 2025 shows SAF currently makes up just 1.6% of fuel used on UK flights falling nearly 20% short of the goal.
Future SAF Targets and Industry Challenges The UK government’s policy on SAF mandates has set clear long-term targets, including the ambitious 10% SAF usage by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Conclusion The UK is clearly committed to reducing its aviation sector’s carbon emissions through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels.","A new update from the UK government has revealed a potential setback in the journey to cleaner skies. According to provisional figures from the Department for Transport (DfT), the UK is on track to miss its first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) target for 2025 raising fresh concerns about how quickly the aviation industry can decarbonise.

The policy, introduced earlier this year, requires airlines to blend a minimum amount of SAF with traditional jet fuel as part of the country’s wider climate commitments. For 2025, the target was set at 2%. However, data covering aviation fuel supply up to October 2025 shows SAF currently makes up just 1.6% of fuel used on UK flights falling nearly 20% short of the goal.

While the shortfall may seem modest on paper, it highlights the real-world challenges facing the industry, from limited SAF availability to higher costs and supply chain constraints. It also serves as an early warning, especially as targets become far more ambitious in the years ahead.

Under the government’s long-term plan, SAF usage is expected to rise sharply reaching 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. Hitting those milestones will require faster investment, stronger supply chains, and closer collaboration between government, fuel producers, and airlines.

For now, the latest figures underline a simple reality: the transition to greener aviation is underway, but it’s proving more complex and slower than hoped.

Current SAF Usage and Sources

The figures published by the Department for Transport indicate that by early October 2025, just over 160 million litres of SAF had been used across UK aviation, which is a small fraction of the total jet fuel consumed – approximately 10 billion litres. All of the SAF used in the UK so far has been derived from recycled cooking oil, primarily sourced from Asia, predominantly from China.

While the SAF being used in UK aviation does emit similar carbon dioxide levels as conventional jet fuel during flight, it is considered lower-carbon overall due to the method of production, which involves recycling waste materials rather than extracting fossil fuels. This has led to SAF being regarded as a key solution for reducing emissions in the aviation sector, especially for long-haul flights where electrification or other forms of decarbonisation remain more challenging.

Despite the early shortfall in meeting the SAF mandate, the Department for Transport (DfT) emphasized that these figures are provisional and subject to verification. The final data for the year will not be available until November 2026. Moreover, the DfT pointed out that SAF volumes are continuing to rise, and not all fuel suppliers have yet reported their SAF deliveries.

Future SAF Targets and Industry Challenges

The UK government’s policy on SAF mandates has set clear long-term targets, including the ambitious 10% SAF usage by 2030 and 22% by 2040. These targets will eventually include second-generation SAF, which is produced using more sustainable feedstocks such as agricultural waste and algae. However, second-generation SAF is not yet produced at scale, making it difficult to meet the projected targets.

Industry experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of meeting these ambitious targets, particularly with the high costs associated with second-generation SAF and the limited production capacity. The lack of infrastructure and investment in SAF production plants has also been identified as a significant barrier to scaling up production to meet future demand.

Furthermore, there are concerns over the availability of SAF supplies at airports outside of major hubs. Heathrow Airport has introduced incentives to encourage airlines to use cleaner fuels, including a reduction in landing charges for airlines that adopt SAF. Despite this, airlines operating from smaller airports, such as Gatwick and Luton, have indicated that SAF supplies remain limited, which could hinder the wider adoption of SAF across the UK.

Global Comparison and Industry Support

On the global stage, the UK remains ahead of many countries in terms of SAF uptake. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF accounted for only 0.6% of worldwide jet fuel consumption in 2025, with projections suggesting a slight increase to 0.8% in 2026. This places the UK in a relatively strong position in the global push for aviation decarbonisation. However, IATA’s director general has expressed concerns about the effectiveness of current mandates, suggesting that governments need to implement stronger incentives to stimulate SAF production and make the fuel more widely available.

The UK government has expressed continued support for the aviation sector’s decarbonisation, despite the current challenges. The aviation minister, Keir Mather, emphasized that decarbonisation efforts, including SAF adoption, would be central to the sector’s growth strategy, helping to reduce emissions while supporting future expansion. A SAF bill, currently passing through the House of Lords, is expected to guarantee prices for SAF, reducing investment risk for producers and potentially accelerating the growth of the industry.

Conclusion

The UK is clearly committed to reducing its aviation sector’s carbon emissions through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels. However, the provisional data indicating that the first mandate target is unlikely to be met raises significant questions about the pace of this transition. With SAF being seen as one of the most viable options for decarbonising long-haul aviation, it is clear that increased investment in SAF production and infrastructure will be necessary to meet the government’s ambitious future targets. As the UK continues its push for cleaner aviation, the coming years will likely see further developments in the SAF market, with industry stakeholders and government authorities working together to overcome the current challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_um1c40um1c40um1c.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 03:57:37.292538
