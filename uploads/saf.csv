Cathay and Airbus have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline placed its first order for Airbus aircraft.","The Cathay Group and Airbus have announced a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million (HK$545 million) to accelerate the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in Asia and globally.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Cathay’s Alex McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonization goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organizations.”

Airbus’s Anand Stanley said: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyze production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Last month, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs. Complementing this, the Cathay–Airbus partnership announced today will target more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability.

Cathay and Airbus have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline placed its first order for Airbus aircraft.

""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled,"" the report states, encouragingly.
Direct employment would nearly triple to approximately 2 million jobs by 2035, with liquid and gaseous biofuels accounting for two-thirds of this growth.","If you are looking for a temperature check in the world of energy, then assessments do not get much more authoritative than those dealt out by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

This week, the world's largest governing body for all things energy published a report that analyses the state of play for sustainable fuels globally. The IEA's analysis projects that use of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels will quadruple by 2035, should existing and recently announced policies be fully implemented.

The report, which was prepared to support COP30, looks at the pathways the world must take in order to accelerate the rollout and production of biofuels, biogas and all hydrogen-based fuels across sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

The current landscape and the projected trajectory

Currently, sustainable fuels represent just 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels making up nearly 80% of that amount.

In 2024, these fuels helped to reduce global oil demand by around 2.5 million barrels a day, while lowering the dependence that some countries have on imported transport fuels by between 5-15%.

""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled,"" the report states, encouragingly. Nevertheless, prevailing trends suggest that we are likelier to see gradual progress, rather than the level of acceleration that will be needed to meet global climate targets.

Policy implementation as catalyst

The IEA's accelerated case scenario assumes that any policies that are currently 'planned' will become fully legislated, while it also assumes that market barriers will be removed and production capacity expanded in order to meet new demand.

Should these things fall into place, the IEA forecasts that sustainable fuel use will nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and reach 28 exajoules by 2035.

Transport would remain the primary driver here, accounting for 50% of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035, with fuels covering 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping.

The report also identifies six priority actions for governments, including the establishment of clear roadmaps, increasing the predictability of demand and developing transparent carbon accounting methodologies.

""Accelerating the deployment of sustainable fuels requires a mix of ambitious, stable and enforceable policies, such as mandates and performance standards, along with proactive public procurement,"" according to the analysis.

Those in the private sector also understand the need for state support. ""We need policy on our side,"" says Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, a small UK-based business that helps to grow biofuel feedstock.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing, and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality,"" she adds.

Investment and employment implications

Cumulative investments between 2024 and 2035 could reach US$1.5 trillion across all sustainable fuel types in the accelerated scenario.

Direct employment would nearly triple to approximately 2 million jobs by 2035, with liquid and gaseous biofuels accounting for two-thirds of this growth.

Investments in sustainable fuels grew 20% between 2023 and 2024, driven by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels, and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversity and regional variation

The portfolio of sustainable fuels is expected to evolve significantly, with liquid and gaseous biofuels maintaining a two-thirds share in 2035 whilst low-emissions hydrogen and derivatives expand from 1% currently to one-third of total use.

That shift is reflected in the IEA's analysis, wherein it is predicting that funding for hydrogen-based solutions will skyrocket.

""With $1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035, and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping, chemicals and beyond,"" says Antonio Villaluenga, VP of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 11:56:30.106978

Hydrogen could play a key role in this process, and scientific research is being conducted on this topic at the University of Pécs Hydrogen Center.

As they wrote, the problem is that the vast majority of hydrogen used today is so-called gray hydrogen, that is produced from natural gas with significant carbon dioxide emissions. A more sustainable solution is green hydrogen, obtained by splitting water using renewable energy sources. However, in Europe, the proportion of green hydrogen is currently still below 5 percent, they pointed out.

As reported by The Tech Journal, the Royal Aeronautical Society’s recent People in Aerospace conference revealed that the aerospace/aviation sector struggles to attract the next generation of talent. Despite many technological advances underway, generating high demand for skills and specialisations, many young people perceive the industry as outdated, opaque, and insufficiently aligned with their climate-action mindset.

Speakers at the conference reported that many schoolchildren simply don’t see aerospace as a viable pathway, many teachers and parents lack awareness, industry outreach is fragmented, and employer-school coordination is weak.

“We need lots of people with varied skill sets… proficiency levels will increase around AI, data analytics, and robotics,” says John Watton, Technical Capability Director at GKN Aerospace and Chair of the People & Skills Working Group at the Aerospace Growth Partnership. “But it’s clear we do not have a pipeline to meet our national objectives,”

Many job opportunities in aviation are invisible to younger generations

Many young people associate aviation with careers as pilots or engineers, and may assume they aren’t suited for these career paths, while other opportunities in aviation in the sciences and technology may fall below the radar.

There are too few narratives linking aviation careers with solving big global challenges, such as climate change, clean tech, and sustainable mobility. As a result, students may gravitate towards sectors that are seen as more future-facing, such as software, renewables, and electric vehicles.

Of course, aviation has many opportunities in those fields, including software engineering and AI applications, research and development of alternative fuel sources, including sustainable aviation fuel, and electric or hybrid propulsion systems.

Speakers at the People in Aerospace conference describe the aerospace sector as having legacy training frameworks, male-dominated traditions, and hidden barriers (like swimming requirements for pilots, and cultural isolation in specific populations) that further reduce its appeal to a diverse young talent base.

These are the issues that aviation must tackle to attract the workforce it will need in future.

Aviation is where climate innovation is accelerating

Despite the perception problem, the aviation sector is undergoing a profound transformation in sustainability. From the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, mandating a 2% SAF blend in 2025 rising to 70% by 2050, to the UK’s own SAF Mandate targeting 10 % by 2030, airlines and fuel producers are building an entirely new clean-energy ecosystem.

At the same time, Europe’s Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU) is funding hybrid-electric and hydrogen demonstrators with the goal of zero-emission regional aircraft by 2035.

Digitalisation is another sustainability lever. The International Energy Agency estimates AI-driven air-traffic management and predictive maintenance could cut sector-wide emissions by 10–15 % even before new propulsion systems mature.

Aviation is not standing still. It’s engineering a revolution in fuels, propulsion and data—the climate-tech innovation many young people say they want to work on.

Aviation careers narrative needs an urgent turnaround

Speakers at the Royal Aeronautical Society’s conference pointed to an urgent need to change the narrative around aviation careers to avoid a critical shortage of a skilled workforce.

Janine Hornsby, Chief Executive of the Air League, warned: “This is not a new problem. We’ve been talking about it for 20 years. If we don’t act now, the industry won’t be here.”

Royal Aeronautical Society Chief Executive David Edwards recalled: “Back in 1999, the Society published a paper predicting exactly the skills crisis we face today. It said this wasn’t a government problem to fix but a sector problem to resolve—and that’s still true.”

“This isn’t just a UK problem—every country is facing it. We need collaboration on a global scale to share best practices and ideas,” Jones said.

The UK’s Generation Aviation gains interest but key initiatives are still unrecognised

The UK Department for Transport’s Generation Aviation review warned of a gap between schools and industry, particularly among underrepresented groups.

69% of respondents to the surveys conducted on Generation Aviation in 2023 and 2024 thought that the aviation industry is entirely or primarily responsible for ensuring that future aviation skills are met.

The 2024 survey found that awareness of the various initiatives to interest youth in career opportunities in the sector has improved over the last year. In March 2024, 71% of participants had heard of Generation Aviation (versus 57% in February 2023) and almost half (46%) knew what it was (versus 27% in February 2023).

Generation Aviation has increased the overall visibility of the aviation sector through industry events.

“Some participants were aware of certain elements of the programme through being part of the programme in some way, for example, knowing an Aviation Ambassador, contributing to specific research, sitting on the board at associations, or attending launch events,” the report’s authors state.

Awareness of specific schemes varies; recruitment events, educational partnerships, and future aviation skills research are still low. It was suggested that the programme be promoted in new spaces, such as government departments and local authorities.​

The aviation industry is advancing climate innovation, including sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, electrification and AI-driven efficiency. If the industry can communicate its transformation convincingly, the same generation that sees it as part of the problem could become the one that solves it.

Walsh said countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are well-positioned to develop feedstocks that can be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector.
""All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels.
""When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there,"" Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.
The report estimates that around 1,580 million tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.","KUALA LUMPUR: Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, has the opportunity to become a key player in the global shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

This is by leveraging the region's vast feedstock potential, said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh.

Walsh said countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are well-positioned to develop feedstocks that can be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector.

""All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels. It's not just for air transport, it's also for road transport.""

""When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there,"" Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.

""So, there's an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil, and create a positive outcome for the environment as well,"" he added.

According to IATA's Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production – Outlook to 2050 report, the world could produce up to 400 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, a major increase from the estimated two million tonnes in 2025 but still short of the 500 million tonnes required for the industry to reach net zero carbon emissions.

The report highlights Southeast Asia as one of the most promising regions for feedstock availability due to its agricultural residues, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and municipal solid waste that can be processed into SAF.

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia together with China could supply about 240 million tonnes which is 15 per cent of the world's total biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.

Biomass feedstock potential is projected to exceed 12,000 million tonnes by 2050 globally, but less than 35 per cent of that will realistically be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing needs in other industries.

The report estimates that around 1,580 million tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.

Walsh said Asia would play a world leading role in the transition to net zero by 2050.

""So, it's important that we have the opportunity to stay in touch with airlines in this region and the leaders in this region to understand what's happening here,"" he said.

He added that Cathay Pacific is a world leader in sustainability given their commitment to ensure the industry can transition to net zero.

IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that Asia would most likely generate the solutions needed for airline decarbonisation over the coming decades.

""We think that this region is the main generator of the solutions we need for airlines' decarbonisation over the coming decades and that's good.

""We also look forward to the growth in demand for air transport services in this region, which we also think is going to be the predominant growth generator in our industry going forward,"" she said.

She added that while optimism remains high, the industry must take a clear-eyed view of where it stands today.

""We unfortunately have only 0.7 per cent of airlines' total fuel demand satisfied by SAF, and we are well short of these carbon credits that airlines need to buy under Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.""

""We sort of know what needs to be done. We know what the path should look like going forward. But we're really struggling getting world leaders to want it as much as we do,"" Thomsen said.",https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/42C2C545F2F0B130812A10D6376A7469_low.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:25.626678

From 2028, international airlines would also need to use SAF-blended fuel for at least 90% of their annual refuelling at South Korean airports, Greenair News wrote.
Jointly developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), the new policies were part of the country’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Blending Mandate Roadmap.
Beyond the initial 1% SAF mandate for international flights, the government said the blending ratio would increase to 3%-5% in 2030 and 7%-10% in 2035.
The South Korean decree for international flights built on a 1% blending ratio deployed by nine domestic airlines which used locally-produced SAF on selected short-haul routes.","The South Korean government has announced compulsory use of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for international flights departing from its airports from 2027, Greenair News reported.

The blending mandate would start at 1%, rising to 10% by 2035, the 6 October report said.

From 2028, international airlines would also need to use SAF-blended fuel for at least 90% of their annual refuelling at South Korean airports, Greenair News wrote.

Jointly developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), the new policies were part of the country’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Blending Mandate Roadmap.

A SAF Alliance was also set up to unite representatives of the aviation and refining sectors with related agencies to promote SAF supply and use.

The ministries proposed offering rewards to airlines using more than the mandated SAF minimum blend, and for passengers making specific contributions towards the cost of the fuel while also warning of steep penalties for non-compliance.

South Korea’s new package of SAF initiatives followed the government’s announcement in August 2024 of its SAF Expansion Strategy, which outlined a mid-to-long term vision to promote use of the fuel in line with global efforts to help decarbonise air transport.

The initiative also broadened plans to develop and deploy SAF within the greater Asia-Pacific region, the world’s largest collective air transport market, where a range of strategies had been announced or deployed in countries including Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Indonesia, China and Australia, the report said.

Beyond the initial 1% SAF mandate for international flights, the government said the blending ratio would increase to 3%-5% in 2030 and 7%-10% in 2035.

Specific ratios would be set in 2026 and 2029 based on the government’s assessment of domestic SAF production capacity, international obligations and global market conditions, Greenair News wrote.

Fuel suppliers, particularly refining companies and petrol exporters and importers, would need to meet blending obligations from 2027, with compliance determined by the proportion of SAF supplied each year for use in jet fuel for international flights from South Korea.

However, the requirement for airlines to ensure that SAF-blended fuel comprises 90% of their annual volumes for departing flights would not take effect until 2028, following the introduction of a refuelling obligation management system in 2026/27 and pilot operations in the first half of 2028.

The South Korean decree for international flights built on a 1% blending ratio deployed by nine domestic airlines which used locally-produced SAF on selected short-haul routes.

Korean Air had expanded the use of domestically-produced SAF on routes to Kobe and Osaka in Japan, following a year-long trial on its Incheon-Haneda route, the report said.

Airbus and Cathay invest US$70 million to accelerate SAV growth

Airbus and the Cathay Group (Cathay) have announced a joint investment of up to US$70 million. The goal is to speed up the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across Asia and beyond. This marks another strong step towards cleaner, lower-carbon air travel.

The agreement was unveiled in Hong Kong during the IATA World Sustainability Symposium. The event was hosted by Cathay’s Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer, Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia-Pacific, Anand Stanley.

Under the new partnership, both companies will work together to identify and invest in key SAF projects. Each project will be reviewed for its commercial potential, technical readiness, and long-term production prospects. The aim is to scale up supply towards 2030 and beyond.

Expanding SAF production, however, demands close cooperation across the aviation chain. Policymakers, investors, producers, and airlines must all play a part. This co-investment reflects that shared commitment, with Airbus and Cathay uniting to accelerate capacity and create wider environmental impact.

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference,” said Anand Stanley, President Asia Pacific, Airbus. “The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The collaboration will also focus on policy advocacy. Both companies aim to support measures that encourage SAF production and use across Asia. The region’s strong feedstock base, growing expertise, and busy aviation market make it ideal for progress.

Energy company Vibra recently announced plans to supply SAF on the domestic market, although imported from European suppliers.
Mr. Alvo said the airline is also closely monitoring Brazil’s airport infrastructure.
“The outlook for Brazil’s domestic market is positive.
I’m optimistic about the Brazilian market next year,” Mr. Alvo said.","The industry’s main bet to cut emissions is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Global production is projected to reach 1.9 billion liters in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)—three times more than in 2023 but still only 0.53% of total fuel demand.

“We have to look seriously at SAF. There isn’t a single drop being produced today in the [Latin American] region,” Mr. Alvo told Valor during the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA) conference in Lima. Globally, the sector has pledged to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Brazil is seen as a potential leader in the field, given its expertise with ethanol. Some companies are studying the technology domestically, but none have yet begun production. Among the major players exploring the market is Petrobras, which is expected soon to offer a jet fuel partially derived from vegetable oils—a process that reduces emissions in a similar way to ethanol blending in automotive gasoline.

Energy company Vibra recently announced plans to supply SAF on the domestic market, although imported from European suppliers.

The issue is a strategic priority for Latam, which in mid-2022 pledged that 5% of its total fuel consumption will come from SAF by 2030.

Mr. Alvo said the airline is also closely monitoring Brazil’s airport infrastructure. One key concern is congestion at São Paulo’s Congonhas Airport, where renovation work next year is expected to worsen crowding.

Regarding the Brazilian market, the CEO said the outlook remains highly positive. Latam recently raised its 2025 capacity forecast to growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, up from 7% to 9% previously.

According to IATA, domestic air-travel demand in Brazil grew 12.7% in August from a year earlier—the highest monthly increase among all markets tracked by the association.

“The outlook for Brazil’s domestic market is positive. We are very pleased with the investment in Embraer aircraft, which will allow us to connect new cities where smaller jets perform better. I’m optimistic about the Brazilian market next year,” Mr. Alvo said.

Latam has placed an order for up to 74 E195-E2 jets from Embraer, including 24 firm orders worth $2.1 billion at list prices. The airline expects to define within six months the routes that will be served by the new aircraft, with São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Fortaleza, and Porto Alegre among the key hubs under consideration.

The arrival of the E2 model is expected to open up as many as 35 new destinations across Latam’s network, most of them within Brazil.

The group reported a second-quarter net profit of $242 million, up 66% from a year earlier, driven by a 7.6% increase in passenger numbers to 20.6 million during the period.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/SWw2rAX_mQ1MzSJAwZo9xZ3GMjY=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/C/J/kyVmIBSjmyUFoUWmdMcQ/21emp-100-latam-b5-img01.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:43.838653

This joint investment aims to accelerate the development of SAF production in Asia and beyond.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong during a ceremony hosted by Cathay chief operations and service delivery officer Alex McGowan, and Anand Stanley, Airbus’ president in the Asia-Pacific.

McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Stanley added: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia.

With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

What the partnership entails

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond.

Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers.

This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Prior to this most recent joint investment, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Bill Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, just last month.

That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Complementing this, the Cathay–Airbus partnership will target more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability.

“At its core, Avflight exists to serve its communities worldwide,” explains Joe Meszaros, the company’s vice president of operations.
The transition to electric ground support equipment has delivered tangible benefits beyond carbon reduction.
“Our ramps are quieter, which improves our team’s working environment while reducing noise exposure for the surrounding community,” Meszaros notes.
Roadmap for growth Looking ahead, Avflight plans to expand its charging network, and increase electric ground equipment adoption where electrical grids support it.","The aviation industry’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 isn’t just talk for Avflight Corporation. The operator of 26 full-service FBOs across North America and Europe has already electrified significant portions of its ground support equipment and installed eVTOL charging stations at multiple locations.

“At its core, Avflight exists to serve its communities worldwide,” explains Joe Meszaros, the company’s vice president of operations. “That service extends to community stewardship in the form of sustainability.”

Avflight’s sustainability journey began with straightforward efficiency improvements – LED lighting, high-efficiency heating systems, and recycling programs. But as new technologies emerged, the company accelerated its commitment through infrastructure development and strategic partnerships.

The transition to electric ground support equipment has delivered tangible benefits beyond carbon reduction. “Our ramps are quieter, which improves our team’s working environment while reducing noise exposure for the surrounding community,” Meszaros notes. Operators also appreciate the smoother torque of electric tugs, which enables more precise aircraft movements.

However, the conversion isn’t without challenges. Each airport presents electrical capacity constraints, permitting requirements and installation timelines. “The transition has required carefully planned charger placements to avoid interference with ramp safety or day-to-day operations,” Meszaros explains.

Future-proofing

The company’s partnership with Beta Technologies exemplifies its forward-thinking approach. Charging stations are now operational at six Avflight locations, with more planned. These multi-modal units, built around the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard, can support both electric aircraft and ground vehicles using the same infrastructure.

“This flexibility is critical because it maximizes the utility of each installation and simplifies ramp planning,” Meszaros says. “By future-proofing in this way, we can serve a wide variety of electric assets as adoption grows.”

Beyond electrification, Avflight leverages its relationship with sister company Avfuel to promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption. Through the AvfuelZero program, operators can access physical SAF molecules where available, or use a book-and-claim model where physical supply isn’t yet feasible.

“The first step is always education,” Meszaros explains regarding customer engagement with SAF. “For those who are interested, we explain what SAF is and how it fits into their operation without disrupting performance.”

“From there, we can help facilitate a book and claim transaction for SAF or even carbon offsets to help reduce their net carbon emissions. We do so by leveraging the AvfuelZero program, which streamlines sustainability logistics, and provides both proper certification and transparent reporting for sustainable products.”

According to Meszaros the core challenges of SAF adoption isn’t technical at the FBO level. “The primary hurdles are less about technical feasibility and more about supply chain logistics. Does sufficient demand exist at your airport? Can supply be efficiently brought into your location?

“Because SAF is a drop-in replacement for jet fuel, meeting ASTM D1655 certification for jet fuel, it actually does not require separate storage or unique handling procedures,” he explains.

According to Meszaros, customer response to Avflight’s sustainability initiatives has been overwhelmingly positive.

“They appreciate the quieter ramps, carbon offsets, and the assurance that their FBO partner is investing ahead of industry demand,” he says. “For many operators, our commitment helps them meet internal goals and provides evidence they can share with their own stakeholders to demonstrate progress.”

Meszaros believes that sustainability is slowly, but steadily, becoming a factor in FBO choice. “That influence comes from a number of places, it could be passengers’ personal convictions, corporate goals, company stakeholder values or community principles.

“In any case, environmentally conscious aviation operations want to know their partners are serious about providing sustainable solutions that work, whether that’s physical SAF supply, book-and-claim or electric vehicle charging capabilities. Our proactive work in sustainability strengthens our competitive position,” he says.

Meszaros says that the company tracks environmental impact through measurable outcomes. “This includes creating a carbon emissions benchmark that is now tracked annually. For each location, we look at the use of utilities, like gas and electric, as well as fuel use, like diesel and Mogas. When adopting electric GSE, we expect to see fuel use decline and some uptick in our electric utilities, but the net benefit would be positive,” he says.

Roadmap for growth

Looking ahead, Avflight plans to expand its charging network, and increase electric ground equipment adoption where electrical grids support it.

“We will continue to use energy efficient building designs and materials for new hangar and terminal developments,” he says. “We also plan to work closely with Avfuel to connect more customers to SAF solutions, making physical supply available where feasible and expanding book-and-claim options everywhere else.

“We intend to support innovation by engaging with technology partners who are developing the next generation of lower-carbon power solutions. Our role is to bridge that innovation to the operators we serve.”

For FBO operators beginning their sustainability journey, Meszaros recommends starting with baseline assessments of operational impact and local energy infrastructure.

“That foundation gives you the clarity to set realistic goals and track improvements over time,” he says.

“Once you have that picture, begin with practical, high-value measures, for example, piloting electric ground support equipment in one or two high-utilization roles, upgrading lighting or HVAC systems to more efficient options, and implementing transparent emissions accounting so customers can trust your reporting from the start. As your program develops, look toward progressive enhancements that align with your growth and resources.”

He emphasizes the need to treat sustainability as a continuous journey rather than a fixed destination.

“Build in regular reviews to raise your level of ambition, and prioritize partnerships early. Collaboration accelerates progress and builds credibility, enabling us as an industry to deliver meaningful change together.”

Meszaros believes it is possible for aviation companies to grow while still being environmentally responsible. “Growth and responsibility go hand-in-hand, because today’s customers expect both,” Meszaros says.

“Communities demand it, and the technology, from scalable charging to next-generation fuels, is advancing rapidly.

“I believe the companies that integrate sustainability into their operations now will be the ones best positioned to thrive in the future.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Joe-Meszaros-2025-1024x683.png,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:50.503458

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Cathay’s Alex McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Airbus’s Anand Stanley said: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Last month, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Key issues highlighted in the study include: Unfair Access: The concentration of SAF at major hubs means regional airports are under-served, preventing carriers from claiming necessary SAF credits.
Cost Distortions: Smaller airlines with less purchasing power face inflated costs due to opaque surcharges and bundled pricing.
Compliance Traps: Complex and inconsistent reporting rules disproportionately affect regional carriers who have fewer resources to manage them.
ERA Director General Montserrat Barriga said the situation could soon put some regional operators out of business.","The European Regions Airline Association (ERA) has issued a stark warning that the current implementation of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is creating structural disadvantages for smaller regional carriers, potentially isolating remote communities and endangering vital air links.

An ERA meeting in Copenhagen earlier this year saw delegates challenge Eddy Liegeois, EU Head of Aviation Policy, over EU Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates. And as members gather this week in Estoril, Portugal, for the Association’s General Assembly, the issue is likely to be high on the agenda.

The Association’s new study – titled “Cutting emissions without cutting connections: How to make ReFuelEU work for all of Europe’s airlines” – reveals that the supply of SAF is heavily concentrated at major aviation hubs, leaving many smaller, regional airports without access. This exposes Europe’s most remote communities to rising costs, complex compliance burdens, and the risk of reduced connectivity.

The ERA says that while the airline sector is fully committed to the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, the fragmented rollout of ReFuelEU risks penalising regional airlines and the communities that rely on their services.

Under the Destination 2050 roadmap, SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of aviation’s emission reductions, with ReFuelEU requiring suppliers to blend increasing shares of the fuel, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.

However, ERA members report that the early implementation is fragmented and unfair, forcing airlines to reconsider and redesign their network viability.

Key issues highlighted in the study include:

Unfair Access: The concentration of SAF at major hubs means regional airports are under-served, preventing carriers from claiming necessary SAF credits.

Cost Distortions: Smaller airlines with less purchasing power face inflated costs due to opaque surcharges and bundled pricing.

Compliance Traps: Complex and inconsistent reporting rules disproportionately affect regional carriers who have fewer resources to manage them.

Operational Risks: The Article 5 “anti-tankering rule,” intended to stop airlines from carrying extra fuel to avoid refuelling at higher-cost destinations, is creating unintended safety and cost issues on essential lifeline routes, particularly for smaller aircraft, without providing clear environmental benefits.

ERA Director General Montserrat Barriga said the situation could soon put some regional operators out of business.

“Europe’s green transition cannot come at the cost of territorial regional cohesion,” she added. “If ReFuelEU continues on its current path, Europe risks seeing airlines go bankrupt and losing vital air connectivity.”

The ERA is now calling on EU policymakers to urgently revise the ReFuelEU Regulation. They urge the commission to ensure that SAF is scaled up fairly and efficiently across all regions and to align the regulation’s implementation with the funding priorities of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

A revised framework, the association argues, would accelerate SAF deployment, strengthen competition, deliver genuine emissions reductions, and protect Europe’s essential air connectivity.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1098_COL_MONTSERRAT_HR-1024x697.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 06:56:35.407402

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference,” said Anand Stanley, President Asia Pacific, Airbus. “The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The joint commitment also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Airbus and Cathay aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Running across IATA’s website and social media platforms, the campaign offers seven simple rules for handling these items safely when flying. Airlines, airports, and travel partners can also access white-label materials for use across their own channels.

Recent IATA passenger survey results show that travellers are increasingly carrying multiple electronic devices – 83 per cent bring a phone, 60 per cent a laptop, and 44 per cent a power bank. Yet, despite 93 per cent claiming to know the rules, many misunderstand key regulations. Half incorrectly believe small lithium-powered devices can be checked in, while 45 per cent think power banks can go in checked luggage. A third are unaware of power limits for batteries or spares.

To address this, the campaign highlights seven key guidelines: carry all battery-powered items in hand luggage, never pack them in checked bags, protect loose batteries, check airline rules and battery watt-hours, and immediately alert crew if a device is hot or damaged.

The multilingual campaign will be rolled out industry-wide, with airlines and airports encouraged to share its digital assets. A short animated video has also been produced to communicate the rules in a clear and engaging format.

Common items powered by lithium batteries include mobile phones, laptops, tablets, cameras, e-readers, smartwatches, headphones, portable speakers, grooming tools, e-cigarettes, hearing aids, and small power tools.

“Lithium-powered devices are safe when handled properly, but they can pose a risk if damaged or packed incorrectly.

The pellet industry utilizes residuals from the lumber industry and woody biomass located in the Southeast region’s plentiful pine forests.
They don’t burn coal anymore, and a large portion of the U.K. is running on wood pellets.
“That would not make financial sense, to turn the forest into pellets.” Smith explained that responsible forest management requires the thinning of forests to keep them healthy by allowing light to reach the forest floor, preserving animal habitats and reducing wildfire risk.
“Wood pellet production is carbon neutral and compatible with advanced conversion pathways.”","As airlines pursue decarbonization, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most viable option. Airlines including Delta, United and American have set goals to replace their conventional, fossil-based jet fuel with SAF. Meeting lofty goals will require a diverse array of feedstocks, and wood fiber and pellets are promising candidates.

At the 2025 North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference, two panelists shared their perspectives on this new market for forest residues. The panel, titled “Decentralized SAF Innovation with Forest and Regional Resources,” featured panelists including Darrell Smith, executive director of the U.S. Industrial Pellet Association, and Eric Schenck, executive director of the Forest Resources Council in Minnesota.

Forests at Risk

One theme shared by both presenters was the crucial need for more industries that will utilize wood waste. Smith explained that the lion’s share of the U.S. industrial pellet industry is located in the Southeast, with 33 mills spread across 11 states, supplying 5,000 jobs across the U.S. The pellet industry utilizes residuals from the lumber industry and woody biomass located in the Southeast region’s plentiful pine forests. The paper industry was historically major employer in the Southeast, also known as the “Paper Basket” due to how quickly trees grow in the warm climate. In recent years, however, the paper industry has shrunk, depriving many communities of a keystone employer.

Smith explained that the declining number of paper plants could indirectly cause deforestation. About 86% of forests in the area are owned privately, so if the owners cannot find someone to use their wood or a way to make money off of the land they own, they may consider selling it to a developer to build a strip mall or housing development. “These aren’t old growth forests, these aren’t national parks; this is land that is meant to grow pine trees to be used as an agricultural product, and [it’s] been doing it for a very long time,” Smith said.

All U.S.-manufactured industrial pellets are exported for heat and power generation around the world—primarily to Europe and Japan—meaning that currently, none of them are currently used in the U.S. “We’re dispatchable energy in Europe,” he said. “The U.K., for instance, is totally off coal. They don’t burn coal anymore, and a large portion of the U.K. is running on wood pellets. My employee who lives in York, England—his house would go dark without wood pellets.”

Shipped by the boatload, the industry pelletizes tons of waste wood material that the lumber industry cannot use, including mill residues, treetops, limbs, thinnings and lower-quality wood. “We’re not going out into a forest and clear cutting them,” he said. “That would not make financial sense, to turn the forest into pellets.” Smith explained that responsible forest management requires the thinning of forests to keep them healthy by allowing light to reach the forest floor, preserving animal habitats and reducing wildfire risk. The biomass is pelletized for transportation because it makes the material more energy dense.

Smith explained that USIPA met with the Trump administration twice in the two weeks before the conference to ensure that industrial pellets are included in the $750 billion worth of energy that the European Union had committed to buying. “We want to keep sending these pellets overseas, because it’s a very valuable market for us,” he said. However, USIPA would like to find a domestic market for industrial pellets as well. Industrial pellet production has increased fivefold since 2012 and intends to keep growing, according to Smith. “Every time I talk to a state forestry [organization] since I’ve had this job for six months, the first thing out of their mouth is, ‘We need to build more pellet mills because we really need more [of them], it’s one of the only solutions to this declining paper market,’” he said.

Although it may seem counterintuitive, creating markets for woody biomass is crucial to reducing deforestation. Because 43% more wood is grown than removed each year, woody biomass in pellet form has great potential for SAF production, Smith said.

The U.S. can sustainably produce an additional 63 million dry tons per year of woody biomass, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Smith added that the DOE also estimates that approximately 2 billion to 5 billion gallons per year of SAF production could be possible from woody biomass. “Forestry residues are one of only a few sustainable scalable feedstocks that can contribute millions of gallons,” he said. “Wood pellet production is carbon neutral and compatible with advanced conversion pathways.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/i_Stock_1816525962_8df5296650.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 04:00:57.812660

The company revealed Cascade LF to customers last month and is quoting it now incorporating the Linear NRU. The Linear NRU enables Cascade LF to achieve even higher methane recovery performance at a lower cost. These improvements are made possible when this new intellectual property is combined with the improvements achieved through the company’s other patent applications filed within the last twelve months. As such, the Linear NRU builds upon the previously announced Cascade LF innovations, reinforcing the company’s technology leadership in the production of biomethane or renewable natural gas (RNG). Higher performance and lower cost systems enable RNG project developers and owners to enhance revenue generating RNG output from their assets while minimizing upfront investment, making RNG projects more accessible and scalable.

“This patent filing marks another important milestone in our commitment to customer-focused innovation and relentless pursuit of improving the state-of-the-art of technology in our industry,” said Brad Douville, CEO of Greenlane. “We took direct input from our customers to make a great product even better—pushing the boundaries of methane recovery while driving costs down further. Our goal continues to be to make meaningful technology enhancements that will set our customers up for success by giving them the tools they need to extract maximum value from their waste resources. We are now quoting our Cascade LF products incorporating the Linear NRU, targeting the first system delivery before the end of 2026.”

Greenlane’s Linear NRU technology is based on equilibrium pressure swing adsorption (PSA) principles. Conventional equilibrium PSA NRUs use multiple adsorption beds and internal recycling of recompressed gas. Greenlane’s innovation, incorporated into its Linear NRU, is a step-wise gas enrichment process that eliminates wasteful internal gas recycling while also using fewer and smaller adsorption beds. The result is lower operating and capital costs and higher methane recovery. For landfill gas containing increasingly higher levels of nitrogen, Greenlane’s modular product design employs additional adsorption beds plus compression in a staged configuration that preserves the linear approach and high methane recovery over the range. The best results are achieved when Cascade LF is paired with landfill wellfield monitoring and controls to maximize methane collection and minimize fugitive methane emissions and nitrogen levels in the landfill gas.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Greenlane_Logo_New_374f9ed6e2.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 04:01:01.498061

********************************************

Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium today (October 21):

Mr Walsh (Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Mr Willie Walsh), Patrick (Chair of Cathay Group, Mr Patrick Healy), Ronald (Chief Executive Officer of Cathay Group, Mr Ronald Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

A warm welcome and good morning to you all. For friends from afar, welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great honour to address this esteemed gathering this morning at the World Sustainability Symposium. I stand before you today with a deep sense of purpose, as we come together to chart a path toward a more sustainable future for the aviation industry globally and for Hong Kong.

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to IATA and the Cathay Group for inviting me to speak at this prestigious occasion, which is one of IATA's signature events of the year. It is a fitting choice for you to host the third edition of the symposium here in Hong Kong - a city that we all love and has emerged as a leading player in sustainable aviation in the region. I have heard that this year's edition has brought together nearly 500 participants from all over the world, including senior executives, professional experts, and thought leaders in the field of green aviation. I warmly welcome all of you to Hong Kong and sincerely hope you take some time to explore and enjoy the vibrancy and warmth in Hong Kong. This hotel is well-situated, where you can have a good perspective of our harbour.

My bureau oversees not only aviation but also land transport, maritime and logistics. Not only are we charting a path towards green aviation, we have also promulgated a series of action plans and blueprints to promote green transport and green shipping.

Our presence here today underscores a shared commitment to achieving a sustainable future for aviation. With so many distinguished experts in the room, I need not reiterate the critical importance of sustainability and decarbonisation in the aviation sector. This symposium provides a unique platform for leaders from around the world to exchange perspectives and provide solutions on green aviation. As we embark on this dialogue, I would like to begin by sharing Hong Kong's achievements and our forward-looking blueprint for building a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

When we speak of sustainability in aviation, our recent focus must be on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. This is indeed a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands co-operation and collaboration amongst a wide array of stakeholders, including governments, airlines, fuel suppliers, industry partners, and the traveling public. In Hong Kong, we are taking decisive steps to develop a SAF industry and promote the use of it at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). In our view, it is of utmost importance that we join hands to scale up the production of SAF, as we all know that it is currently the only practical means for international aviation to decarbonise.

The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to fostering a robust SAF supply and its supply chain in collaboration with Mainland authorities and local enterprises, from upstream raw material collection to the establishment of production plants and large-scale production and supply. Given Hong Kong's close proximity to the Chinese Mainland, which has the largest supply of used cooking oil, we are leveraging this advantage to create a significant SAF supply for Hong Kong. Moreover, as 100 per cent neat SAF cannot be uplifted to aircraft at this moment, we are actively exploring the construction of a SAF blending facility right here in Hong Kong. This facility aims to support the provision of competitively priced SAF-blended jet fuel in the long run, hence raising the competitiveness of Hong Kong's SAF industry. By doing so, we also aim to strengthen the bargaining power of airlines operating from HKIA, ultimately fostering HKIA's competitiveness as an international aviation hub.

On this floor, I know that Cathay Pacific Group has been leading and is very dedicated in pushing forward the use of SAF. Of course, we would work closely with Cathay as our close partner. We are also mindful of the pragmatic and practical considerations faced by different airlines in Hong Kong. In a way, we hope to create a critical mass and to achieve and secure a reasonably priced SAF supply and production to enable us to create a robust supply chain for SAF in Hong Kong. With the above measures in place and subject to regional SAF industry development, we adopt a vision to achieve a SAF consumption ratio of 1 per cent to 2 per cent for flights departing from HKIA by 2030 as a starting point to drive momentum.

""The Chief Executive's Policy Address"" announced just last month includes quite some paragraphs on how we would strive ourselves to achieve the SAF consumption target. We, in a recent briefing for our legislature, disclosed the target that I mentioned just now. I received a lot of feedback asking whether Hong Kong could set a more aggressive target. Replying to the stakeholders and the legislative councillors was that we want to be pragmatic and realistic. We want to put it into action. So, we set a target which we hope to achieve. That is a starting point, and this should not preclude or hinder us from setting an even more aggressive target along the way.

Apart from the industry and aviation partners, I think public education is also very important. As we take people along from places to places, the travelling public need to raise their awareness for green aviation. It helps build a collective understanding of the role SAF plays in reducing aviation's carbon footprint. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will, for instance, launch targeted publicity and promotional campaigns to raise awareness among the public and corporations about the importance of SAF, and the need for everyone to do their part. By engaging communities and businesses, we aim to create a culture of sustainability that supports long-term environmental goals. I think this culture of sustainability is the basic, core element and spirit that IATA has also been promoting around the globe.

Speaking of AAHK, I am proud to highlight their unwavering commitment to sustainability. Apart from SAF that I spoke of a lot, together with key aviation-related business partners, AAHK is dedicated to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050, a bold step making HKIA the world's greenest airport. Their efforts to embed sustainability into new developments at HKIA, integrate environmental best interests and practices, and address climate change and resilience given the airport's coastal location have all gained significant momentum. Initiatives such as trialing renewable diesel, expanding the use of electric and autonomous vehicles on the Airport Island, as well as continuously upgrading its equipment by incorporating more energy-efficient installation and technologies reflect a holistic approach to sustainable development at HKIA.

We are all acutely aware that the journey to a sustainable future in the aviation sector is not a solo mission. It is a global challenge and mission that requires collaboration across borders, industries, and sectors. The HKSAR Government is committed to playing a pivotal role by leading, offering policy support, driving innovation and technology, and most importantly, cultivating an enabling environment for sustainable aviation. Our door is always open. We will maintain close communication with international organisations, airlines, the airport community, fuel suppliers and industry stakeholders to tackle pressing challenges and difficulties. As Dr Thomsen (Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist of IATA, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen) just mentioned, it is not just saying when there is a will, there is a way. We have to create ways so as to make our will works. It is the time not for words, but for action.

Last but not least, international collaboration is paramount in this endeavor. No single city, country, or organisation can achieve net zero alone. We must share knowledge, pool resources and align our strategies to create a unified global response to the climate crisis. We have been facing very frequent super typhoons over the past weeks and months in Hong Kong, which is quite unprecedented. Our airport and aviation community have been making our best efforts to respond, recover and resurrect, but nothing is more important than tackling this issue at the heart of the problem and do it with passion and determination. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why gatherings like this symposium are vital for fostering such partnerships.

I truly look forward to the rich discussions and innovative insights that will emerge from this symposium, sparking actionable outcomes. And with the talent and the dedication I see in this room, I am more than confident that we can turn the vision of net zero by 2050 into a reality. It's a goal championed by IATA, but it's a future we will build together.

Lastly, I wish you all productive, inspiring and impactful sessions ahead. Thank you very much.

The Reno facility was converted to SAF production in October 2024.
During the initial phase of production ramp-up, New Rise Reno operated at approximately 50% of nameplate capacity.
XCF said the New Rise Reno team has been reviewing the catalyst processing for SAF to meet nameplate capacity.
“We currently expect to resume SAF production as early as the first quarter of 2026, although we cannot assure you when SAF production will resume, and when it does resume, when or whether the Reno production facility will be able to produce SAF at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report.","XCF Global Inc.’s biorefinery located near Reno, Nevada, could resume sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production as early as the first quarter of 2026, according a second quarter financial report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 16.

The biorefinery, currently known as New Rise Reno, was developed as a 50 MMgy renewable diesel plant, which began operations in 2022. Development of the facility was supported by loan guarantee awarded through the USDA’s 9003, Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biodiesel Production Manufacturing Assistance Program, according to Greater Commercial Lending, which helped assemble the loan package that made the project possible. According to a 2017 USDA announcement, the facility at that time was being developed under the name Ryze Renewables Reno LLC.

The Reno facility was converted to SAF production in October 2024. XCF Global acquired the facility in February 2025 and later that month announced the plant had commenced production of neat SAF and renewable naphtha. Initial deliveries of both fuels began in March 2025. During the initial phase of production ramp-up, New Rise Reno operated at approximately 50% of nameplate capacity. XCF said the New Rise Reno team has been reviewing the catalyst processing for SAF to meet nameplate capacity.

According to the second quarter report, until SAF production reaches nameplate capacity, New Rise Reno is not deemed to be an operating facility and classifies as under construction until final project acceptance under New Rise’s license agreement with Axens North America under the original intention of the SAF conversion. Such final project acceptance has not yet been completed.

“Due to the conversion to SAF and associated testing of the facility, we have observed variable operating performance which has impacted the ability of the plant to operate at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report.

While ramp-up processes are being undertaken and until final plant acceptable, XCF said it has made the determination to temporarily produce and sell renewable diesel, a byproduct of SAF production, which can be achieved at approximately 2,000 barrels per day, which is approximately 20% below nameplate capacity, and without any additional modifications to the facility. “Management regards the production of renewable diesel as an interim derivative during the ramp up process of the ongoing SAF conversion process,” the company said.

New Rise Reno in May 2025 began selling renewable diesel under a supply and offtake agreement with Phillipps 66. According to the second quarter report, New Rise Reno produced, in aggregate, approximately 1.9 million gallons of neat SAF, renewable diesel and renewable naphtha during the three months ended June 30.

“We currently expect to resume SAF production as early as the first quarter of 2026, although we cannot assure you when SAF production will resume, and when it does resume, when or whether the Reno production facility will be able to produce SAF at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report. “Any delay beyond the first quarter of 2026 in our ability to resume SAF or renewable diesel production and/or any delay in our ability to operate the Reno production facility at full nameplate capacity for SAF production will adversely affect our revenues and profitability.”

By filing its second quarter report with the SEC, XCF has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of all required periodic financial reports with the SEC.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/XCF_Logo_XCF_Global_Vertical_29092024_eac06fc7f9.png,N,,2025-10-20 20:00:07.463700

How we'll build on what we learned The North American SAF Conference allowed us to peek behind the curtain to hear what the industry decision-makers are saying.
FMR will continue to advocate for clean water, soil health, habitat and pollinators in state and federal SAF conversations.
By ensuring that our guiding principles form the backbone of SAF policy going forward, we will help deliver a SAF industry that is more than just low-carbon, but one that is on a flight path toward true sustainability.","Hundreds of people from around the globe traveled to the Twin Cities last month for the North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference and Expo(link is external). There, attendees discussed the future of SAF technology and policy. This conversation was driven primarily by industry experts, corporate decisionmakers, agribusiness representatives and biofuels researchers.

Also there? Friends of the Mississippi River.

Two members of FMR’s Water Program, myself and Trevor Russell, attended the conference. Our goal — when mingling with fellow attendees or participating in panels and presentations — was to share FMR’s perspective: That the industry needs to take a broad view of what it means to be “sustainable,” and account for the impact any new fuel might have on our air, land and water.

We were there, in short, to be the voice for the river.

Here are three things we discovered from our time at the conference.

1) Water and biodiversity aren’t currently top of mind

Throughout the conference, we heard scant mention of clean water, healthy soil or biodiversity. When we spoke with other conference attendees about FMR’s perspective on SAF, multiple people admitted they had never really considered how it could affect water quality.

That might seem surprising, but there’s a practical reason for this. The legal definition of SAF — the criteria the fuel needs to meet in order to qualify for tax credits (more on these below) — only references greenhouse gas emissions. If the fuel has less than half the carbon emissions of traditional jet fuel, then it qualifies as ""sustainable aviation fuel.""

But in our view, just being lower carbon is not the same thing as being sustainable. That’s why it’s important for advocates like FMR to keep pushing for broad definitions of sustainability in SAF, while also urging investments in the most environmentally friendly fuel sources we have, such as winter-hardy oilseeds.

2) Minnesota is likely to be a national hub of SAF activity

Over and over, we heard how Minnesota is expected to be a national leader in this new industry.

The state has the input materials (meaning, what the fuel is made out of) in its agricultural crops and forest products, a major airport with MSP, and a highly trained and educated workforce. Critically, there is also a state tax credit for producers of SAF. (In fact, the Star Tribune recently highlighted SAF(link is external) as one of the ""Midwestern ideas shaping the future.)

Under current conditions, however, SAF is still much more expensive than traditional jet fuel. In order for early adoption of SAF to make economic sense for airlines, they need both a federal boost and a state boost.

A federal credit does exist, though as we mentioned earlier, they’re based only on greenhouse gas emissions. That makes state policy a powerful lever for establishing stronger sustainability parameters.

Even if the federal government rolls back environmental protections, SAF companies are going to have to meet the more stringent state laws if they want to benefit from all the available incentives.

3) Now is the time to shape SAF's future

Right now, there are only a handful of SAF production facilities throughout the country, and the number of SAF-powered flights that have happened in the U.S. is quite small. (The Delta flight powered in part by winter camelina is one example.) Even the experts can’t agree on what they think the next five or 10 years will look like, because there are still so many unknowns.

SAF companies are waiting for more stability in state and federal policy before committing billions of dollars to building new production facilities. Policy is shaping the way this new industry rolls out, and how truly sustainable it will end up being.

How we'll build on what we learned

The North American SAF Conference allowed us to peek behind the curtain to hear what the industry decision-makers are saying. It’s clear they see Minnesota as an emerging leader in the SAF space, and that state policy will be influential in shaping what happens next.

Importantly, we also shared our message of clean water and healthy rivers directly with decisionmakers, researchers and leaders. We were really encouraged by the thoughtful questions and positive response from attendees.

But concrete public policy decisions and industry commitments are where the rubber meets the runway.

FMR will continue to advocate for clean water, soil health, habitat and pollinators in state and federal SAF conversations. By ensuring that our guiding principles form the backbone of SAF policy going forward, we will help deliver a SAF industry that is more than just low-carbon, but one that is on a flight path toward true sustainability.",https://fmr.org/files/2510-saf_conference-meghan_and_trevor-chloe_piekkola__danielle_piekarski__bbi_international.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 19:00:41.615573

Around a third of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the refining and petrochemicals sector, with over 100 companies on Jurong Island.
“By scaling innovative low-carbon solutions in Singapore, companies can meet sustainability standards, tap regional demand and export new technologies globally,” said JTC and EDB.
The 2022 Energy Sector Manpower Survey by the Energy Market Authority showed that Singapore’s clean energy workforce is projected to increase by 80 per cent by 2032, reaching around 2,700 workers.","SINGAPORE – On Jurong Island, gas and chemicals storage provider Advario Asia-Pacific has been expanding beyond its fossil fuel focus towards greener pastures, by investing in infrastructure to store cleaner fuels.

The company has set aside tank space equivalent to 34 Olympic-size swimming pools to store and blend sustainable aviation fuel –

a less pollutive alternative to jet fuel.

The Dutch company is one of several companies in the emissions-intensive energy and chemicals hub of Jurong Island that are starting to make the green shift.

Around a third of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the refining and petrochemicals sector, with over 100 companies on Jurong Island.

Despite the geopolitical headwinds confronting climate action in some countries, recent developments have also pointed to the inevitable transformation of this pollutive sector, which companies like Advario are taking notice of.

“Globally, tightening climate regulations and rising demand for sustainable products are accelerating decarbonisation,” said Singapore’s industrial developer, JTC Corporation (JTC), and the Economic Development Board (EDB) in response to queries from The Straits Times.

For example,

Singapore’s carbon tax levied on large emitters

here is on the upward trajectory, and could go up from the current $25 per tonne to between $50 and $80 per tonne by 2030.

The European Union is also implementing a regulation that makes companies importing certain emissions-intensive goods into Europe pay for the carbon emissions created from producing these products.

Several multinational companies with a Singapore presence have started to feel the implications of these trends.

In 2024, oil giant Shell sold its energy and chemicals park on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island, as part of measures to boost its overall profitability and lower its carbon footprint worldwide.

As crude prices tumbled in 2025 , some global oil companies including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil have announced thousands of job cuts. On Oct 1, ExxonMobil announced that it plans to reduce 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its workforce in Singapore by the end of 2027.

The energy and chemicals sector is a global industry, and Singapore is an open economy with leading positions in refining, trading and chemical production, said EDB’s vice-president of chemicals and materials, Ms Kelly Lai.

“Due to the global petrochemical downcycle, companies are reviewing their footprints globally, and we are not sheltered from these global developments,” she said.

“With any mature industry, we would expect to see some churn, and naturally then reinvestment and rejuvenation.”

As the energy and chemicals sector transforms, it will need to reimagine its business models, innovate processes, and adopt low-carbon technologies, JTC and EDB added.

Decarbonisation is a key part of Singapore’s growth strategy for the energy and chemicals sector – it enables companies to stay competitive and capture new markets, said EDB and JTC.

Companies on the island are combining immediate measures, such as improving the energy efficiency of industrial processes and deploying solar panels , with those that will take a longer time to scale and commercialise.

Advario is attempting to do this by diversifying its business model beyond fossil fuels to include low-carbon options, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Its director of business development, Mr Kevin Jen, said: “With increasing societal awareness and stakeholder pressure, demand for traditional hydrocarbons is expected to decline gradually, driven in part by the wider adoption of electric vehicles, as well as transitional fuels in both the maritime and aviation sectors.”

Fossil fuels include naturally occurring compounds of hydrocarbons. While greener fuels are not yet commercially mature, the Dutch company, being family-owned, is able to take a longer-term perspective – one that balances sustainability with commercial discipline, Mr Jen added.

Power generation companies Keppel, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya are also studying ways of capturing planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants, to identify the specific infrastructure needed to make carbon capture and storage a reality in Singapore.

EDB’s Ms Lai also pointed out that, despite the recent cutbacks, Shell and ExxonMobil still continue to maintain a significant presence in Singapore.

Singapore is home to ExxonMobil’s largest manufacturing site and the company has just started up new production facilities, she said.

Shell and ExxonMobil have since 2024 also been leading a consortium to study the feasibility of capturing CO2 in Singapore for storage in other countries. The aim is to develop a carbon capture project that can permanently store 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030.

“By scaling innovative low-carbon solutions in Singapore, companies can meet sustainability standards, tap regional demand and export new technologies globally,” said JTC and EDB.

On a broader level, Singapore had seen the writing on the wall for the oil and gas sector, and began to move on this front a few years ago.

In 2021, it launched a plan to transform Jurong Island into a sustainable energy and chemicals hub, with 2030 targets to raise the production of sustainable goods, ensure that local refineries and crackers are highly energy efficient, and realise carbon capture.

The authorities will be providing updates on this , including additional announcements, at the upcoming Singapore International Energy Week on Oct 27.

Ms Ni kki Kemp, director of the Singapore Green Finance Centre at the Singapore Management University, noted that while the Republic may not suffer widespread job losses due to changes in the sector , it faces a “skills transition challenge”.

Those affected will need reskilling for alternative occupations, leading to additional transition costs, she said.

For example , job functions in electricity transmission and distribution, low-carbon alternatives, solar energy and smart grids are expected to experience significant growth, added Ms Kemp.

She cited a 2024 study which found that, globally, the petrochemical sector’s demand growth is set to weaken over the next 10 years. Roles focused on oil and gas refining and traditional petrochemical production are likely to be restructured and reduced.

“New job opportunities may not emerge in the same location or timeframe as those that have been lost. Therefore, effective employment planning is crucial as part of the transition,” she added.

The 2022 Energy Sector Manpower Survey by the Energy Market Authority showed that Singapore’s clean energy workforce is projected to increase by 80 per cent by 2032, reaching around 2,700 workers. The power sector is also expected to expand by 800 workers during the same period .

Ms Kemp observed that Jurong Island’s transformation is under way with significant technical and governance hurdles.

She noted that carbon capture is a highly technical solution that is currently being tested, but not on a big enough scale. The commercial viability of hydrogen as a clean fuel remains questionable, she added.

She said: “A credible energy transition in Singapore includes a commitment to decarbonise Jurong Island industries, ensuring decarbonisation is permanent, rather than moving operations elsewhere.”

This requires transparency in having a company’s green achievements verified, having public dashboards to track how firms are progressing with their climate goals, and company disclosure about their investment in clean technology, she added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/09e3a76f9b8f32f425287762a3ba3df8d3628b22a580e99d0988ccea119fd5a9,N,,2025-10-20 18:00:03.328600

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Net interest income was $29.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $27.3 million for the second quarter of 2025. The $1.9 million increase was due to a $3.2 million increase in interest income, offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was due mainly to a $2.4 million increase in interest and fees on loans. The increase in interest expense was due mainly to a $1.0 million increase in interest on deposits.

The net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.98% for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 6 basis points from 2.92% for the second quarter of 2025. The NIM expansion included a 6 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 2 basis point decrease in the overall cost of funds. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.85% for the third quarter of 2025 from 5.79% for the second quarter of 2025 driven by a 9 basis point increase in the yield on average loans to 6.12%. Average loans represented 83.3% of average interest-earning assets in the third quarter of 2025, as compared to 84.5% in the second quarter of 2025.

The average cost of funds decreased to 3.12% for the third quarter of 2025 from 3.14% for the second quarter of 2025, due to a 3 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, and a 9 basis point decrease in the average cost of total borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased to 3.63% for the third quarter of 2025 from 3.66% for the second quarter of 2025. The overall funding mix for the third quarter of 2025 remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025 with average total interest-bearing deposits representing 89.4% of average interest-bearing liabilities and average noninterest-bearing deposits representing 16.6% of average total deposits. The spot rate for total deposits was 2.97% at September 30, 2025.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $625,000 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2025. The third quarter of 2025 provision for credit losses reflected a provision for loan loss of $750,000 due mainly to net loan growth, and a decrease in provision for unfunded commitments of $125,000 due to lower volume of unfunded commitments. The third quarter provision also took into consideration factors such as changes in the outlook for economic conditions and market interest rates, and changes in credit quality metrics, including changes in loans 30-89 days past due, nonperforming loans, special mention and substandard loans during the period. Net charge-offs totaled $6.9 million in the third quarter and related almost entirely to a commercial construction loan, of which $6.6 million of this credit loss was reserved in prior periods, and the borrower filed for bankruptcy this quarter. Net charge-offs on an annualized basis represented 0.84% of average loans for the third quarter of 2025 compared to 0.42% for the second quarter of 2025.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease was mostly due to the second quarter of 2025 including other income of $5.2 million for the receipt of ERC funds from the IRS. There were no such ERC amounts received or associated advisory costs recognized during the third quarter of 2025. In addition, other income increased $148,000 due to higher equity investment income of $498,000, offset by lower recoveries on fully charged-off acquired loans of $350,000.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $18.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from $20.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease was mainly due to lower legal and professional expenses of $1.5 million, including $1.2 million of ERC advisory costs incurred in the second quarter of 2025. Salaries and employee benefits also decreased by $480,000, of which $330,000 related to executive management transitions recognized in the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio was 57.36% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 57.22% for the second quarter of 2025.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 23.5% for the third quarter of 2025 and 27.8% for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was due mostly to a change in California tax law (Senate Bill 132), which changes the way banks and financial institutions apportion income for California tax purposes. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is estimated to be in the range of 26% to 27%.

Balance Sheet

At September 30, 2025, total assets were $4.2 billion, a $118.4 million, or 2.9%, increase compared to June 30, 2025, and a $218.0 million, or 5.5%, increase compared to September 30, 2024.

Loan and Securities Portfolio

Loans held for investment (""HFI"") totaled $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $67.9 million, or 8.3% annualized, compared to June 30, 2025, and an increase of $210.7 million, or 6.8%, compared to September 30, 2024. The third quarter of 2025 net loan growth included $187.8 million in originations with an average yield of 6.70%. The net increase from June 30, 2025 was largely due to net increases of $47.9 million in single-family residential (""SFR"") mortgage loans, $13.2 million in commercial real estate (""CRE"") loans, and $8.4 million in commercial and industrial (""C&I"") loans. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.1% at September 30, 2025, compared to 101.5% at June 30, 2025 and 100.0% at September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, available for sale securities (""AFS"") totaled $410.6 million, a decrease of $2.5 million from June 30, 2025, primarily related to maturities and paydowns of $62.3 million, offset by purchases of $58.3 million during the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2025, net unrealized losses totaled $20.5 million, a $2.6 million decrease when compared to net unrealized losses of $23.1 million as of June 30, 2025.

Deposits

Total deposits were $3.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $178.3 million, or 22.2% annualized, compared to June 30, 2025 and an increase of $274.3 million, or 8.9%, compared to September 30, 2024. The increase during the third quarter of 2025 was due to a $171.7 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $6.6 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included increases in wholesale time deposits of $84.3 million, retail time deposits of $57.4 million, and interest-bearing non-maturity deposits of $30.0 million. Wholesale time deposits were raised to repay $50.0 million in maturing FHLB advances. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $550.5 million, or 16.4% of total deposits at September 30, 2025 compared to $543.9 million, or 17.1% of total deposits at June 30, 2025.

Credit Quality

Nonperforming assets totaled $54.3 million, or 1.29% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, down from $61.0 million, or 1.49% of total assets, at June 30, 2025. Nonperforming assets included $8.8 million other real estate owned (“OREO”) (included in “accrued interest and other assets”) at September 30, 2025 and $4.2 million at June 30, 2025. The increase in OREO in the third quarter related to the foreclosure of 2 SBA loans with $3.7 million guaranteed. Accordingly, including the SBA guarantees, OREO exposure totaled $5.1 million at September 30, 2025.

Nonperforming loans totaled $45.4 million at September 30, 2025, down from $56.8 million at June 30, 2025. The $11.3 million decrease in nonperforming loans during the third quarter of 2025 was due to $6.9 million in net charge-offs, $5.0 million of loans migrating back to accrual status, $1.2 million in payoffs and paydowns, and $970,000 moving to OREO. These decreases were partially offset by additions to nonaccrual loans of $2.8 million.

Special mention loans, also referred to as criticized loans, totaled $49.3 million, or 1.49% of total loans, at September 30, 2025, down from $91.3 million, or 2.82% of total loans, at June 30, 2025. The $42.0 million decrease was primarily due to the upgrade of one $44.4 million completed construction loan, downgrades to substandard-rated loans totaling $8.4 million, and payoffs and paydowns totaling $2.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the downgrade of loans to special mention totaling $10.8 million and $2.8 million in balance increases. As of September 30, 2025, all special mention loans were paying current.

Substandard loans, also referred to as classified loans, totaled $76.9 million at September 30, 2025, down from $91.0 million at June 30, 2025. The $14.1 million decrease in substandard loans during the third quarter was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of $16.6 million, net charge-offs of $6.9 million, upgrades to pass-rated loans of $5.0 million, and transfers to OREO of $970,000. These decreases were partially offset by downgrades of loans to substandard of $15.4 million. Of the total substandard loans at September 30, 2025, there were $31.4 million on accrual status.

30-89 day delinquent loans, excluding nonperforming loans, totaled $6.5 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2025, down from $18.0 million, or 0.56% of total loans, at June 30, 2025. The $11.5 million decrease was mainly due to $13.0 million in loans returning to current status and $2.4 million in loans migrating to nonaccrual status, offset by $4.0 million in new delinquent loans.

As of September 30, 2025, the allowance for credit losses totaled $45.4 million and was comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $44.9 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $504,000 (included in “accrued interest and other liabilities”). This compares to the allowance for credit losses of $51.6 million, comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $51.0 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $629,000 at June 30, 2025. The $6.2 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses for the third quarter of 2025 was due to net charge-offs of $6.9 million, offset by a $625,000 provision for credit losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans HFI decreased to 1.36% at September 30, 2025, compared to 1.58% at June 30, 2025, due mainly to net charge-offs which were specific reserves at June 30, 2025. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans HFI was 98.70% at September 30, 2025, up from 89.79% at June 30, 2025.

Shareholders' Equity

At September 30, 2025, total shareholders' equity was $514.3 million, a $3.3 million decrease compared to June 30, 2025, and a $4.6 million increase compared to September 30, 2024. The decrease in shareholders' equity for the third quarter of 2025 was due mostly to common stock repurchases totaling $12.5 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $2.8 million, offset by net income of $10.1 million and lower net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $1.6 million.

The increase in shareholders' equity for the last twelve months was due to net income of $26.2 million, lower net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $1.6 million, and equity compensation activity of $2.2 million, offset by common stock repurchases totaling $14.0 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $11.4 million. Book value per share and tangible book value per share (1) increased to $30.18 and $25.89 at September 30, 2025, up from $29.25 and $25.11 at June 30, 2025 and up from $28.81 and $24.64 at September 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations

Tangible Book Value Reconciliations

Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP disclosure. Management measures tangible book value per share to assess the Company’s capital strength and business performance and believes this is helpful to investors as additional tools for further understanding our performance. The following is a reconciliation of tangible book value to the Company shareholders’ equity computed in accordance with GAAP, as well as a calculation of tangible book value per share as of as of the dates indicated.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity

Management measures return on average tangible common equity (“ROATCE”) to assess the Company’s capital strength and business performance and believes this is helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding our performance. Tangible equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) and is reviewed by banking and financial institution regulators when assessing a financial institution’s capital adequacy. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table reconciles ROATCE to its most comparable GAAP measure:

NORWELL, Mass., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DIH Holding US, Inc. (“DIH” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:DHAI), a global provider of advanced robotic devices used in physical rehabilitation, which incorporate visual stimulation in an interactive manner to enable clinical research and intensive functional rehabilitation and training in patients with walking impairments, reduced balance and/or impaired arm and hand functions, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.

Recent Highlights

Revenue of $62.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, representing a decrease of 2.5% over the prior year

Device revenue of $49.7 million and service revenue of $12.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, representing a decrease of 2.8% and an increase of 8.4%, respectively over the prior year

Negative operating cash flow of $4.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2025

“DIH remains committed to driving innovation and delivering value for patients and healthcare providers,” said Jason Chen, Chairman and CEO of DIH. “During this year, we made meaningful progress across our key strategic initiatives while maintaining our focus on operational discipline. As we look forward to the results of the NASDAQ hearing panel regarding our listing status held on October 16, 2025, our team is committed to positioning DIH for long-term success.”

Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2025

The overall decrease in revenue was primarily due to a change in product mix, where many customers purchased a similar number of devices but with a lower average sales price than the prior year mix. This change in mix was offset by a price increase implemented during fiscal year 2024, and effective for devices sold in fiscal year 2025. Services revenues increased slightly during the year, as the Company continues to focus on expanding its service department in established regions. Overall, as the product mix shifted to smaller and lower priced products, the revenues decreased slightly, year over year.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2025, resulting in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. This was mainly driven by fluctuations in Euro valuations throughout the period.

Gross profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, was $32.2 million, an increase of 8.2% compared to the prior period. The increase was driven by a cost of goods decrease of $4.1 million, of which $5.3 million was due to the change in product mix, as the devices produced for delivery to customers had a lesser cost basis, and the impact of a lesser inventory reserve recorded in the current fiscal year, as compared to the prior year. The decreased reserve in the current year is the result of a stabilized current inventory on hand, with significantly less identified materials where excess inventory was identified. The decrease in devices costs was offset by an increase cost of services for providing routine and on demand service requests of $1.2 million between periods.

Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by $4.2 million, or 16.3%, to $30.0 million. The increase was driven by a $1.9 million increase in personnel expenses related to compensation including an increase in performance-based compensation, merit increases to salaries, and additions in headcount as well as a $0.5 million increase in stock compensation. In addition, there was a $1.1 million in impairment of related party receivable in the year ended March 31, 2025 due to a settlement of related party balances. The provision for credit losses reflected a $0.3 million release in fiscal 2025 compared to a $1.0 million release in fiscal 2024, resulting in a $0.7 million increase in total expense in the year ended March 31, 2025.

Research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by $0.5 million, or 7.4%, to $7.1 million primarily due to increase in software costs.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we discontinued the development and commercialization of the SafeGait product, resulting in an impairment loss of $0.6 million. We also ceased further development of capitalized software related to the HocoNet platform, resulting in an additional impairment loss of $1.5 million. There were no such impairments recognized during fiscal year 2024

Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2025 totaled $1.9 million.

Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended March 31, 2025

Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $12.6 million, a decrease of 34.7% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in devices revenue was primarily driven by lower sales volume in EMEA. In EMEA, we sell our equipment through a distributor network across Europe. One of our largest sales partners, which primarily operates in Eastern Europe, has been impacted by wartime import restrictions resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minor unfavorable impact on our net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulting in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $6.0 million, a 30.4% decrease compared to the prior period which directly correlated to the product mix changes.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to $1.4 million of transaction costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 in connection with the business combination that did not recur, as well as $0.7 million of cost reductions from efficiency initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase due to the impairment on related party receivables and a $0.5 million increase in performance-based compensation, merit increases to salaries, and additions in headcount.

Research and development expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, consistent with $1.9 million in the prior-year period. The slight decrease was due to lower personnel expenses related to salary and benefit partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we discontinued the development and commercialization of the SafeGait product, resulting in an impairment loss of $0.6 million. We also ceased further development of capitalized software related to the HocoNet platform, resulting in an additional impairment loss of $1.5 million.

Subsequent Events

After March 31, 2025, the Company paid the April 2025 scheduled redemption of the Original Debentures. On May 29, 2025, the Company and Five Narrow Lane amended the Securities Purchase Agreement. Under the amendment, the deferred May 1, 2025 redemption was settled through the issuance of 1,540,277 shares of Class A common stock, and the June 2025 redemption was settled in shares as provided in the Original Debentures. The amendment permits future monthly redemptions and interest to be settled in cash or in shares, and the holder waived the default related to the deferred May payment. Separately, the Company made a partial redemption in July 2025 and deferred later scheduled redemptions while finalizing its Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On August 7, 2025, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued, in a private placement, senior secured convertible debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $2.2 million on an original-issue-discount basis, resulting in expected net proceeds of $1.9 million after estimated offering expenses. The debentures were structured to be funded in four tranches of gross proceeds. As of the date of these financial statements, $1.4 million has been funded under the first three tranches, and the remaining $0.5 million is expected to fund upon (a) the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (b) delivery of a substantially complete draft Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and (c) appointment of one additional independent director.

The debentures mature on September 21, 2026. No interest accrues during the first year; beginning the first day of the month after the first anniversary, interest is 8% per annum, payable monthly. The Company may extend the maturity by six months if specified conditions are met and six months of interest is prepaid and credited against future interest. The debentures are initially convertible at $0.25 per share, subject to adjustment and a 9.99% beneficial-ownership cap. Beginning October 1, 2025, monthly redemptions of $171 thousand are required; each monthly redemption may be satisfied in cash or, if conditions are met, in shares priced at the lesser of the then-current conversion price and 90% of the average of the five lowest VWAPs for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the applicable monthly redemption date. The debentures are secured under the Company’s existing June 6, 2024 security arrangements. In connection with the financing, the Company issued warrants to purchase 8,888,888 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.25 per share, exercisable beginning February 1, 2026 and expiring February 1, 2030.

The agreements include a resale registration undertaking with filing and effectiveness timelines and liquidated damages if missed; a 90-day limitation on new issuances or registration filings after the resale registration becomes effective; a prohibition on variable-rate transactions while the debentures remain outstanding; an obligation to seek shareholder approval under Nasdaq rules to permit additional share issuances in connection with the debentures and warrants; and a commitment to include in the proxy proposals authorizing a reverse stock split to support listing compliance and amending certain June 6, 2024 and March 20, 2025 debentures to align their minimum base conversion price with the new debentures.

A 1-for-25 reverse stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock was approved by stockholders at a Special Meeting held on September 25, 2025. The final ratio was determined by the Board on September 26, 2025. The Company legally effected by filing a certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 2025. The Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Stock Market at market open on October 20, 2025. As a result, every twenty-five shares of Common Stock were converted into one share, decreasing issued and outstanding shares from approximately 52.3 million to 2.1 million as of the effective date. The par value and authorized shares remained unchanged.

On October 15, 2025 the Company entered into an equity line of credit agreement with Five Narrow Lane, L.P.

Want to Capitalise on Green Premium Investment Opportunities?","Understanding Green Premium Fundamentals

Green premiums represent the additional financial burden that sustainable alternatives impose compared to conventional options in today's marketplace. This cost differential reflects the economic reality where environmentally responsible technologies require higher capital investments, specialised manufacturing processes, and developing supply networks that haven't achieved large-scale efficiencies.

The concept extends beyond simple price comparisons to encompass the true economic cost of environmental responsibility. Furthermore, modern markets increasingly recognise these premiums as essential components of the transition toward sustainable industrial practices, with trading platforms now establishing standardised metrics for green product classification.

Critical Characteristics of Green Premium Markets:

Price gaps between sustainable and traditional alternatives

Reflection of genuine environmental compliance costs

Significant variation across sectors and applications

Direct correlation with technology advancement stages

The London Metal Exchange's recent establishment of Commodity Pricing and Analysis Ltd in Dubai demonstrates institutional recognition of green premiums as permanent market features. This initiative leverages responsible sourcing criteria and digital trading platform data to create standardised premium calculations, starting with nickel markets where carbon footprint thresholds below 20 metric tons per ton of metal define green classification.

Recent market activity shows substantial trading volumes in sustainable metals. In addition, digital platform Metalshub processed over $220 million worth of Class I refined nickel transactions in 2023, with 488 tons of environmentally certified nickel traded since March 2024, establishing concrete benchmarks for premium calculations.

How Are Green Premiums Calculated Across Different Industries?

Premium calculation methodologies vary significantly depending on sector-specific requirements and measurement standards. The fundamental approach compares sustainable option pricing against conventional alternatives, though implementation details differ based on industry characteristics and regulatory frameworks.

Standard Mathematical Framework:

Green Premium Percentage = (Sustainable Product Cost – Conventional Product Cost) / Conventional Product Cost × 100

Metal markets have pioneered structured approaches to premium assessment. Consequently, the LME's new pricing administrator employs expert judgment mechanisms when sufficient trading data remains unavailable, assuming green premiums always exist within sustainable metal markets.

Industry-Specific Premium Calculations:

Sector Premium Methodology Key Variables Metals Processing Carbon footprint per ton Energy source, smelting technology Transportation Fuels Lifecycle emission analysis Feedstock origin, production method Industrial Materials Sustainability certification Raw material sourcing, manufacturing process Energy Generation Grid integration costs Storage requirements, transmission infrastructure

The nickel market's carbon footprint threshold of 20 metric tons per ton provides a concrete example of quantifiable green standards. This benchmark enables precise premium calculations based on measurable environmental impacts rather than subjective sustainability claims.

Why Do Green Premiums Exist in Today's Markets?

Multiple interconnected market forces sustain green premium structures across various industries. These fundamental drivers explain persistent price differentials despite increasing environmental consciousness and technological advancement.

Technology Development Investment Requirements

Research and development costs for clean technologies impose significant upfront expenses that manufacturers must recover through premium pricing. Patent licensing fees for innovative processes add additional cost burdens, while new facility construction requires higher capital expenditures compared to conventional alternatives.

Supply Chain Constraint Factors

Limited availability of sustainable raw materials creates scarcity-driven pricing pressure. Processing infrastructure for environmentally certified products remains underdeveloped, while specialised transportation requirements for green alternatives increase logistics costs.

Production Scale Economics

Sustainable alternatives typically operate at lower production volumes than established conventional options, preventing economies of scale realisation. Higher per-unit fixed costs across smaller manufacturing operations contribute to premium persistence, while inability to leverage mass production efficiencies maintains cost differentials.

Current copper price outlook dynamics illustrate these principles clearly. Chilean producer Codelco increased its 2026 European delivery premium to $325 per ton, rising from $234 in 2025, while German producer Aurubis implemented similar increases to $315 per ton. These premium adjustments reflect supply chain redistribution challenges and compliance cost pressures.

Which Sectors Show the Highest Green Premiums?

Certain industries face particularly severe green premium challenges due to technical complexity, regulatory requirements, or fundamental production limitations. Understanding these high-premium sectors provides insight into where sustainable alternatives face the greatest economic barriers.

Critical Materials and Specialty Metals

The germanium market exemplifies extreme premium conditions where sustainable sourcing faces geopolitical constraints. Industry specialists report material shortages at any price point, with germanium prices reaching 25-year highs following Chinese export restrictions. Some manufacturers struggle to secure supplies regardless of premium willingness.

Transportation Fuel Alternatives

Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of the most challenging green premium environments, with costs reaching multiple times conventional jet fuel prices. Limited production capacity and complex certification requirements sustain these extreme differentials, while infrastructure constraints prevent rapid scaling.

Base Metal Processing

Aluminium smelting operations with verified low carbon footprints command substantial premiums as manufacturers address scope 3 emission requirements. Industry analysts project aluminium prices above $3,000 per ton, potentially reaching $4,000, compared to current levels around $2,765 per ton, driven partly by sustainable production capacity constraints.

Rare Earth Elements

China's addition of holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium to restricted export lists creates extreme premium conditions for these specialty materials. Most metal traders lack familiarity with these elements, yet they increasingly influence global market dynamics and sustainable technology development.

How Do Government Policies Influence Green Premium Levels?

Policy interventions significantly shape green premium dynamics through various mechanisms that can either amplify or reduce cost differentials between sustainable and conventional alternatives. Government actions create both direct financial impacts and indirect market incentives affecting premium structures.

Strategic Infrastructure Investment Programmes

The Australian government's commitment of A$135 million ($87.4 million) to maintain Trafigura's smelter operations demonstrates direct policy intervention in sustainable metals processing. This investment addresses critical processing capacity shortfalls while supporting domestic sustainable material production capabilities, highlighting Aussie green metals leadership in the sector.

Export Control and Trade Policy Mechanisms

China's germanium export restrictions illustrate how trade policies create artificial scarcity conditions that amplify green premiums. Beijing's expansion of restricted export lists to include additional rare earth elements directly impacts global sustainable technology supply chains and pricing structures.

Processing Capacity Strategic Priorities

Industry leaders emphasise that processing infrastructure matters more than raw material availability for sustainable supply chain security. Trade house executives argue that Western nations need base metal smelting capacity to produce critical materials and break Chinese processing dominance over exotic metals like gallium and germanium.

Carbon Pricing and Regulatory Frameworks

Direct carbon taxation increases conventional product costs

Emissions cap systems create financial advantages for clean alternatives

International border adjustment mechanisms equalise competitive conditions

Procurement mandates establish guaranteed market demand

The collapse in copper smelting fees, with spot treatment terms turning negative, prompted joint governmental responses from Japan, Spain, and South Korea expressing concerns over raw materials market sustainability.

What Role Do Green Premiums Play in Metal Markets?

Metal markets serve as laboratories for green premium development, with sophisticated trading mechanisms and precise measurement standards enabling detailed premium analysis. These markets demonstrate how sustainability requirements integrate with traditional commodity trading structures.

Copper Market Premium Dynamics

European copper premiums for 2026 deliveries show significant increases reflecting sustainability and supply chain pressures. Codelco's premium rise to $325 per ton and Aurubis's increase to $315 per ton demonstrate how tariff policies and supply redistribution create premium pressure across traditional metal markets.

The copper premium increases signal broader market transformation where tariff-driven inventory movements to the United States force other regions to pay higher premiums for supply security. This redistribution creates artificial scarcity conditions that amplify green premium effects.

Sustainable Nickel Trading Infrastructure

Digital trading platform Metalshub established concrete frameworks for green nickel transactions, processing over $220 million in Class I refined nickel during 2023. The platform's definition of green nickel as metal with carbon footprints below 20 metric tons per ton creates measurable sustainability standards.

Since March 2024, Metalshub facilitated 488 tons of certified green nickel trades, providing sufficient transaction data to support systematic premium calculations. This trading volume demonstrates market appetite for sustainable metal alternatives despite premium costs.

Aluminium Market Transformation Indicators

Aluminium market sentiment shifted dramatically toward bullish outlooks as supply dynamics change fundamentally. China's maintained smelter capacity restrictions combined with growing demand concerns create conditions where sustainable production commands increasing premiums.

Consultancy projections for aluminium prices exceeding $3,000 per ton, potentially reaching $4,000, reflect supply constraint recognition and sustainable production capacity limitations. These price projections incorporate premium expectations for environmentally certified aluminium production.

Critical Materials Supply Chain Disruption

Rare earth export controls demonstrate how geopolitical factors amplify green premiums for critical materials. China's dominance over exotic metal processing creates vulnerability points where export restrictions generate extreme premium conditions for energy transition minerals.

How Are Companies Reducing Green Premiums Through Innovation?

Organisations implement various strategies to narrow green premium gaps through technological advancement, operational efficiency improvements, and strategic collaboration arrangements. These approaches address fundamental cost drivers while maintaining environmental performance standards.

Processing Technology Optimisation

Companies develop more efficient production methods that reduce energy consumption and waste generation.

Industry collaboration through consortiums enables shared infrastructure investments that distribute premium reduction costs across multiple participants. Long-term supply agreements provide volume certainty that supports larger-scale sustainable production facilities.

Market Structure Innovation

Traditional benchmark pricing systems face challenges as smelters explore bilateral agreements and tolling contracts with miners and traders. These alternative arrangements may provide more flexible approaches to managing green premium costs whilst maintaining supply security.

Japan, Spain, and South Korea's joint statement regarding copper processing fees reflects industry recognition that current market structures may require fundamental changes to accommodate sustainable processing requirements.

Technology Breakthrough Development

Advanced catalyst technologies for cleaner processing methods

Alternative feedstock development reducing raw material constraints

Energy storage and conversion efficiency improvements

Circular economy integration reducing waste costs

The collapse in copper smelting margins, with spot treatment terms turning negative, forces structural innovation in processing arrangements. Companies explore new commercial models that better align sustainable processing costs with market pricing mechanisms.

What Are the Long-Term Projections for Green Premium Evolution?

Market forecasting indicates significant green premium reduction potential over the next decade as technologies mature and production capacity expands. However, timeline projections vary considerably across different sectors and material categories.

Copper Market Demand Surge Projections

Wood Mackenzie forecasts 24% global copper demand growth by 2035, with disruptive sectors like data centres potentially amplifying demand and price volatility beyond current expectations. This demand growth may initially sustain green premiums before production scaling reduces cost differentials.

Aluminium Supply-Demand Rebalancing Timeline

Industry analysts express growing concerns about aluminium supply adequacy for the first time in decades. China's maintained smelter capacity restrictions combined with accelerating demand create conditions where sustainable production premiums may persist longer than previously anticipated.

Critical Materials Geopolitical Evolution

Rare earth market dynamics suggest premium persistence through continued Chinese processing dominance. Where germanium experiences extreme premiums today, gallium and other critical minerals may follow similar patterns, sustaining elevated costs for sustainable technology inputs.

Market Sentiment and Investment Flow Implications

Copper markets show strong bullish sentiment with funds reallocating toward hard assets amid dysfunctional raw materials markets. Low inventory levels resulting from global redistribution to the United States support arguments for sustained premium conditions.

Projected Premium Reduction Scenarios:

Timeline Expected Premium Changes Primary Drivers 2025-2027 15-25% reduction Technology scaling, policy support 2028-2030 35-50% reduction Infrastructure development, market maturity 2031-2035 60-75% reduction Full-scale production, regulatory integration

Note: These projections represent general market expectations and may vary significantly based on technological breakthroughs, policy changes, and geopolitical developments.

How Do Green Premiums Impact Investment Decisions?

Investment professionals increasingly incorporate green premium analysis into portfolio construction and risk management processes. These premiums represent both opportunity identification mechanisms and risk assessment factors across various asset classes and sectors.

Market Psychology and Sentiment Analysis

Copper markets demonstrate strong bullish sentiment with the metal consistently topping LME seminar polls for price upside potential. Even traditionally contrarian analysts acknowledge robust long-term demand growth combined with supply challenges, indicating widespread recognition of premium sustainability.

Fund Allocation Strategy Shifts

Investment funds increasingly reallocate capital toward hard assets amid recognition of dysfunctional raw materials markets. This reallocation reflects understanding that green premiums represent structural market features rather than temporary pricing anomalies.

Risk Assessment Framework Evolution

Premium volatility affects project economic modelling

Regulatory changes rapidly alter cost structure assumptions

Technology disruption may eliminate entire premium categories

Geopolitical factors create supply chain vulnerability points

Opportunity Recognition Mechanisms

Companies successfully reducing green premiums gain competitive advantages that translate into investment performance. First-mover advantages in emerging green markets provide portfolio differentiation opportunities, while supportive policy frameworks create favourable investment environments.

Sector-Specific Investment Implications

The aluminium market's bullish sentiment reversal demonstrates how supply constraint recognition affects investment positioning. Analysts worry about supply growth adequacy for the first time in decades, creating investment opportunities in sustainable aluminium production capacity.

What Strategies Help Businesses Navigate Green Premium Challenges?

Organisations can implement comprehensive approaches to manage green premium impacts whilst advancing sustainability objectives and maintaining competitive market positioning. These strategies address both cost management and strategic advantage development.

Supply Chain Security and Diversification

Securing long-term green supply agreements provides cost predictability whilst ensuring sustainable material availability. Alternative supplier relationship development reduces dependency on single sources, while vertical integration opportunities offer direct control over sustainable production processes.

Customer Education and Market Positioning

Educating markets about the green premium helps justify costs through broader value proposition communication. Highlighting non-financial benefits of sustainable choices, including regulatory compliance and brand value enhancement, supports premium product positioning strategies.

Processing Infrastructure Development

The Western world's recognition that processing capacity matters more than raw material reserves suggests sustained investment in sustainable smelting and refining facilities. Australia's A$135 million commitment to Trafigura's operations exemplifies governmental recognition of processing infrastructure strategic importance.

Market Structure Transformation Indicators

Traditional commodity pricing mechanisms face fundamental challenges as negative copper treatment terms force structural innovation. The evolution toward bilateral agreements and tolling contracts may create more flexible premium management approaches whilst supporting sustainable processing development.

Geopolitical Factor Integration

China's continued expansion of restricted export lists affects global sustainable technology supply chains. Future premium elimination depends partly on Western nations developing alternative processing capabilities for critical materials currently dominated by Chinese production.

Investment Flow and Market Maturity

Strong bullish sentiment across copper and aluminium markets reflects recognition of structural supply constraints and demand growth. These conditions may sustain green premiums longer than technology advancement alone would suggest, particularly for materials requiring significant infrastructure investment.

The ultimate elimination of green premiums represents a critical milestone in achieving widespread sustainability adoption. Success requires coordinated efforts across technology development, policy implementation, and market transformation initiatives, with timelines varying significantly based on sector-specific challenges and advancement opportunities.

New Zealand’s action plan for aviation In September, the newly established Interim Aviation Council released an aviation action plan.
Global goal for net-zero flying The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has a goal of net-zero international aviation emissions by 2050.
States have committed to mapping out plans to cut aviation emissions and submit them to ICAO.
It appears Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa has not achieved its core purpose to “provide advice and coordination to accelerate the decarbonisation” of New Zealand’s aviation sector.","Following a brief dip during the COVID pandemic, aviation is back in a growth phase.

Globally, passenger traffic is projected to grow by 3.8% annually over the next 20 years. In New Zealand, this optimism is reflected in Jetstar’s expansion plans for its domestic and trans-Tasman services and Auckland Airport’s airfield extension.

The government has welcomed the trend and sees the aviation and tourism industries as key drivers of economic growth.

But climate impacts of flying are rarely mentioned, even though the government is currently considering whether or not to include emissions from international aviation and shipping in New Zealand’s net zero 2050 target, as recommended by the Climate Change Commission.

Emissions from New Zealand’s international aviation and shipping are equivalent to about 9% of the country’s net domestic emissions. Without action to reduce emissions from these sectors, they could grow to a third of domestic net emissions by 2050, according to the commission.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts is expected to announce a decision next month.

New Zealand’s action plan for aviation

In September, the newly established Interim Aviation Council released an aviation action plan. It covers regulation, innovation, economic growth and emissions.

The plan’s ambition is that New Zealand will be:

reducing the use of fossil fuels and transitioning to clean energy, in line with New Zealand’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In a new report, we have analysed the plan in the context of New Zealand’s international commitments.

First, let’s backtrack to 2021 and New Zealand’s first emissions reduction plan. That also included work to decarbonise aviation by setting specific targets, implementing a sustainable aviation fuel mandate and establishing a public-private leadership body.

That body, Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa (SAA), was set up in 2022. But there is no word yet on the targets or mandate. The SAA has never published any minutes, work plans, calls for evidence or advice.

Its initial balance of public and private membership became skewed in favour of industry, with more airlines and oil companies (Airbus, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum, Z Energy, and Channel Infrastructure) joining the group than organisations representing the environment.

Of 49 members, only three (one from the Climate Change Commission and two from the Ministry for the Environment) have an environmental focus.

New Zealand’s second emissions reduction plan, published last year, mentions aviation emissions only briefly, commenting that:

the government’s role is to facilitate industry discussions through existing forums, consider regulatory barriers and ensure New Zealand’s interests are represented on the international stage.

That statement is incorrect. The government’s role, as specified in the Climate Change Response Act, is to prepare sector-specific policies to reduce emissions. But the Climate Change Commission has reviewed these policies and found them to be inadequate – it found virtually all policy-driven goals to cut emissions were at risk of not being achieved.

Global goal for net-zero flying

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has a goal of net-zero international aviation emissions by 2050. A key task for New Zealand, one of 193 member nations, is to determine how we should implement this.

International aviation is currently a large, unregulated source of emissions. In 2024, just the first outgoing legs of flights from New Zealand emitted 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 12% of all domestic emissions from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) combined.

States have committed to mapping out plans to cut aviation emissions and submit them to ICAO. New Zealand’s plan was already overdue in 2022. Although it appears the SAA has done some work on this, no plan has been submitted yet.

Plans from other countries, including the United Kingdom, give some idea of the challenge. They describe a mixture of low-carbon fuels, efficiency gains and offsetting – but add these won’t get us all the way.

Additional measures such as carbon removal and demand management will be required. The UK’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate began this year and will strengthen every year, with airlines facing penalties of about NZ$11 per litre for missing targets.

As the UK’s action plan notes:

Most options for aviation decarbonisation rely on new technology, the development and uptake of which is extremely uncertain, owing to the uncertain nature of technology readiness and cost of technology over time.

This is not the government’s task alone

Aviation is part of a wider system. Passengers, tourism operators, airports, airlines, fuel companies and the government all share responsibility for the sector’s requirement to cut emissions.

Failure to deliver can lead to a loss of trust and impede progress. The tourism industry is crucial for New Zealand, and it is notable that the Tourism Industry Association supports the entry of international aviation into emission targets.

It appears Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa has not achieved its core purpose to “provide advice and coordination to accelerate the decarbonisation” of New Zealand’s aviation sector.

The Interim Aviation Council may be heading the same way. It has no environmental representation and assigns no actions to the Ministry for the Environment. Nor does it mention the regulation of emissions, which is the only way to simultaneously achieve environmental goals and lower uncertainty for investors.

As the permanent council is formed, it should operate openly and balance state, industry and public interests.

AEO Secretary-General Jamal Al-Loughani told KUNA that the study examines the entire process, from sources of used cooking oil and its collection and transportation to production centers, to refining and processing steps necessary to produce high-quality, impurity-free biofuel.

According to the study, approximately 14 billion liters of used cooking oil were collected worldwide in 2022, with expectations this volume could exceed 30 billion liters by 2030. Al-Loughani also noted that global trade in used cooking oil is projected to grow from 3.7 billion gallons in 2022 to between 5 and 10 billion gallons annually by 2030, depending on efforts to stimulate its conversion into sustainable fuels.

The report details recent global advancements in producing biodiesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil. Al-Loughani highlighted projects underway in Arab countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and pointed to growing regional interest in sustainable aviation fuels, driven by goals to reduce carbon emissions, diversify economies, and conserve natural resources.

He cited Qatar Airways’ 2023 test flight using sustainable jet fuel derived from used cooking oil imported from Finland as an example of regional momentum, with more initiatives expected as airlines pursue net-zero emission targets.

Al-Loughani emphasized that investing in converting used cooking oil into biofuel maximizes resource efficiency while serving as a strategic environmental solution to lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. The process also supports national economies by creating new jobs.

The airline: Croatia Airlines

Route Frankfurt to Split, flight OU417

Frequency Two to four times daily

Aircraft Dash 8-Q400

Class Economy; seat 10D, aisle

Flight time 1 hour + 45 minutes (lands 18 minutes late)

Checking in

Ten years ago, when I last flew Croatia Airlines, I had an argument with a frosty check-in attendant and swore off the airline for good. A decade has passed and I had forgotten all about the experience (and the boycott) until a few days before this flight. This time, the check-in interaction is all smiles and no complaints.

Advertisement

I stay at an airport hotel inside Terminal 1 of Frankfurt Airport the night before my flight, so I don’t have far to walk to the check-in counters. The airline instructs passengers to arrive three hours before their scheduled departure, but check-in doesn’t open until two hours prior. I’m the first in line.

Baggage

Baggage allowance varies by fare class. The lowest fare class, FlyEasy, does not include checked luggage. My FlyFlexi economy ticket includes one handbag or personal item up to eight kilograms, and one checked bag up to 23 kilograms. The aforementioned argument was about excess baggage, and I’m feeling nervous when my bag is weighed. To my surprise and relief, it’s exactly 23 kilograms.

The overhead bins are too small and narrow on this Dash 8-Q400 turboprop aircraft to accommodate roller bags. Several passengers are told by the flight attendant that their cabin bags must go in the hold.

Loyalty scheme

Advertisement

Miles & More, the loyalty program shared by several Star Alliance airlines and partners. Airlines that use Miles & More as their primary frequent flyer program include Lufthansa and Swiss. Points can also be earned and redeemed on flights with participating Star Alliance airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand.

The seat

The seats are in a 2-2 layout, 78 seats in total. I’m in aisle seat 10B. Don’t bother splurging on business class: on this plane, economy and business seats are the same width (17 inches/43 centimetres) and pitch (31 inches/79 centimetres – though the more spacious exit row seats are categorised as business). I’m short, but the legroom feels tight. A tall man sitting behind me politely asks if I’d refrain from reclining as his knees are already touching the back of my seat.

Entertainment + tech

Advertisement

Wi-Fi isn’t available on Croatia Airlines’ older, propeller-driven planes, and there are no seat-back screens or charging ports. I flick through the in-flight magazine, CROATIA. Published four times a year, it has news and guides to destinations the airline flies to, plus a selection of items for sale, including model planes and locally made jewellery.

Service

Warm, efficient and relaxed service on the ground and in the sky. Even the passengers who complain when they are separated from their cabin bags get a smile. Uniforms look professional and stylish in the classic colour combination of navy and white with a pop of red.

Food

Advertisement

On this short-haul flight, a snack of herb crackers is served, along with a choice of still or sparkling water. Food and drinks are for sale at sky-high prices: $9 for a 330ml can of Coke, $14 for a small can of Heineken beer, $9 for 40 grams of Pringles.

Sustainability

The airline is increasing its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), expanding its fleet to include more fuel-efficient planes and focusing on better fuel management to decrease carbon emissions.*

One more thing

Advertisement

Expect to see newer planes in the fleet in the coming months and years, as the airline takes delivery of several new Airbus A220s. With visitor numbers to Croatia steadily increasing, there are plans for additional routes within Europe to be added.

The price

From €211 return from Frankfurt for economy.**

The verdict

The service is much better than what I remember from 10 years ago, but the plane is old, the seats are not comfortable and there’s no Wi-Fi.

The scope of the study will cover technical and economic evaluation of waste gasification as well as the subsequent purification of syngas for methanol production, according to the service provider.

If built, Maire said the plant could enable methanol production complying with FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, respectively, to displace fossil-based marine fuels and for use in methanol-to-jet (MtJ) production pathways aligned with emerging sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, helping support the broader decarbonization strategies of both the shipping and aviation industries.

In addition to converting about 550,000 tpy of residual, non-circular waste into 270,000 tpy of low-carbon methanol, Mana and NG Nordic said the proposed Mongstad project would also be equipped to capture and permanently store 400,000 tpy of carbon dioxide (CO2).

The partnership’s plan for using a waste-reducing feedstock to produce green fuels together with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in a single, integrated project comes as an important step in Norway’s journey to a zero-emission society, according to Mana.

""To succeed with innovation and green transition, we must build strong alliances,"" said Jon Bergan, Mana’s chief executive officer.

""The partnership with Equinor is a milestone for Mana. Together, we are taking a new step to support the development of a circular economy and industrial decarbonization in Norway,"" Bergan added.

While a precise timeline for anticipated startup of the proposed plant has yet to be revealed, Mana and ND Nordic confirmed the project’s feasibility study is targeted for completion during spring 2026.

Powered by FlyORO’s modular AlphaLite technology, it provides on-demand fuel blending and can be scaled or replicated at other airports across Australia and the Asia-Pacific.
When blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF can deliver up to 80% lifecycle carbon emissions savings compared with fossil-based fuels.
FlyORO Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Yeo said the modular design of the AlphaLite system allows greater flexibility, transparency, and scalability for fuel blending.","Wagner Sustainable Fuels has begun operations at Australia’s first dedicated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending terminal, developed in partnership with Boeing and technology company FlyORO. The facility, located at Wellcamp Airport in Toowoomba, Queensland, marks a significant milestone for the country’s aviation decarbonisation efforts.

The terminal is the world’s first co-located airport SAF blending facility and the first to operate under Australia’s Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certification. Powered by FlyORO’s modular AlphaLite technology, it provides on-demand fuel blending and can be scaled or replicated at other airports across Australia and the Asia-Pacific.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels Chief Executive Officer Matt Doyle said the new facility forms part of the company’s broader strategy to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and heavy transport. He noted that flexible, efficient blending solutions are essential to meet future decarbonisation goals and help the aviation sector transition toward renewable fuels.

SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil feedstocks, including municipal solid waste, animal fats, vegetable oils, and agricultural residues. When blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF can deliver up to 80% lifecycle carbon emissions savings compared with fossil-based fuels. The current certification permits airlines to use blends of up to 50% SAF, with higher levels possible as new production pathways are approved.

According to the Boeing–CSIRO SAF Roadmap, jet fuel demand in Australia could rise by 75% by 2050, underscoring the need for scalable SAF infrastructure. Boeing’s regional partnerships aim to integrate SAF into commercial, general aviation, and defence operations. Dr. Kimberly Carnahan, Boeing Asia-Pacific sustainability director, said the company is focused on supporting local SAF production and commercialisation to help meet the aviation sector’s net-zero targets.

FlyORO Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Yeo said the modular design of the AlphaLite system allows greater flexibility, transparency, and scalability for fuel blending. The company plans to replicate the model at other airports and develop standalone facilities similar to those in Singapore.

The establishment of the Wellcamp blending terminal represents a key step in building a sustainable aviation ecosystem in Australia, expanding regional employment and enabling new export opportunities for renewable fuels.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-20 21:01:54.688189

What began as a strategy for connectivity has evolved into a foundation for diversification, technology and sustainable growth.

A sector that doubled its economic reach

The white paper shows just how dramatically aviation’s contribution has expanded in under a decade. Between 2016 and 2023, nearly every indicator of economic impact increased by double digits, and in most cases, by triple.

These figures reveal a remarkable story of economic elasticity as aviation has nearly doubled its contribution to GDP while maintaining a lean workforce. Direct employment in the sector rose by less than 5%, even as total value creation grew by more than 90%.

This means the industry is producing far greater value per employee, thanks to the region’s rapid adoption of automation, digitalisation and infrastructure efficiency. Maintenance, repair, cargo and airport operations now function as advanced industrial ecosystems, rather than labour-heavy services.

Equally striking is the scale of the indirect and induced impact, the economic ripple effect through tourism, trade, retail and logistics. These broader effects surged by 136%, showing that every new flight and every airport expansion is fuelling wider sectors of the economy.

According to the white paper, every $1 generated directly by aviation now produces $3.60 in the wider economy. That multiplier effect underscores aviation’s role not merely as a transport system but as a macroeconomic catalyst, stimulating industries far beyond its immediate reach.

National strategies and varied pathways

While the regional trend is clear, the national stories behind it vary in scale and focus. The UAE remains the benchmark, with aviation contributing 18.2% of national GDP, the highest proportion anywhere in the world. Emirates and Etihad have become global brands synonymous with connectivity and service, supporting more than 770,000 jobs and generating around $47 billion in economic output. Dubai International Airport alone is estimated to contribute roughly a quarter of Dubai’s GDP, a rare case where a single industry defines an entire city’s economy.

In Saudi Arabia, aviation is at the heart of Vision 2030. Backed by $100 billion in aviation investment and $800 billion in tourism infrastructure, the kingdom plans to handle 330 million passengers annually, reach 250 destinations, and move 4.5 million tonnes of cargo. Aviation already supports 8.6% of Saudi GDP, illustrating its growing weight in the non-oil economy and its potential to create hundreds of thousands of new skilled jobs.

Qatar has taken a more targeted approach, using aviation to project influence and facilitate re-export logistics. The sector contributes roughly 11% of GDP, led by Qatar Airways and Hamad International Airport’s efficiency-driven model. The country expects re-export activity alone to reach QAR 25 billion by 2030, cementing aviation’s role as a trade multiplier.

Further west, Egypt provides perhaps the most vivid example of aviation’s catalytic power. Since 2016, aviation’s GDP impact there has increased by 266%, driven largely by tourism and airport modernisation. The expansion of international routes has spurred rapid growth in hospitality, real estate and local transport, sectors that depend heavily on air connectivity.

Across the region, one common thread emerges: aviation is being used as industrial policy. It is a deliberate, government-backed instrument for diversification and development, rather than simply a mode of transport.

A region outperforming the world

Globally, aviation contributes around 3.5% of total GDP. The Middle East’s 4.3% share puts it nearly a quarter above the world average, a remarkable feat for a region that, just a few decades ago, had limited air transport infrastructure.

The region’s geographic advantage remains its natural strength: within an eight-hour flight of 80% of the world’s population, it has become the primary bridge between Europe, Africa and Asia. More than half of all long-haul passengers now transit through Gulf airports, making the Middle East the nexus of global aviation flow.

Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi have effectively become city-economies built on air connectivity, transforming location into long-term economic leverage. Unlike mature Western markets, where aviation’s share of GDP has plateaued, the Middle East’s growth remains exponential. Youthful populations, strong investment appetite and cohesive government strategy all combine to maintain momentum.

Technology, tourism and sustainability

The reasons behind this growth are as strategic as they are structural. The region’s central geography is the starting point, but it is the policy choices that have turned potential into dominance.

Governments have embedded aviation at the heart of their national visions. Saudi Vision 2030, the UAE Tourism Strategy 2031, Qatar Vision 2030 and Egypt Vision 2030 all treat the sector as a platform for diversification and employment. Collectively, these initiatives represent hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in airports, fleets and manufacturing zones.

Tourism integration is another powerful driver. About 59% of all visitors to the Middle East arrive by air, the highest ratio globally. Flagship projects, from NEOM and the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia to Dubai’s perpetual reinvention as a global tourism magnet, depend entirely on aviation as their circulatory system.

Technological transformation is also reshaping the industry’s economics. The region is adopting AI-driven maintenance systems, digital twins and data-led operations, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. The maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) market is forecast to reach $12.8 billion by 2030, driven by new facilities from Emirates Engineering, Saudia Technic and GE Aerospace’s regional bases.

Perhaps most significantly, the Middle East is emerging as a leader in sustainable aviation. Projects such as Saudi APSCO’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative and the UAE’s SAF Roadmap demonstrate a determination to move from consumer to producer in the green aviation economy. For a region often defined by hydrocarbons, this pivot signals a profound strategic shift.

Outlook to 2043

Looking forward, the white paper forecasts aviation’s contribution to the regional economy to soar from $290 billion to $730 billion by 2043, an increase of 151%. The number of jobs supported by the sector is expected to more than double to over eight million, reflecting the depth of its supply chains in tourism, logistics and advanced manufacturing.

The region’s share of global aviation GDP will rise from 7.6% to 8.6%, while its portion of global aviation employment will approach 7%. Passenger volumes are projected to exceed 530 million per year, driven by network expansion, tourism diversification and new carriers like Riyadh Air.

This is not merely growth, it is transformation. Aviation is becoming the industrial base of the future Middle Eastern economy, uniting logistics, technology, and sustainability. Airports are evolving into self-contained economic zones, while national carriers are turning into engines of export and employment.

One of the most telling insights from the report is that aviation contributes a greater share of GDP to the UAE (18.2%) than oil does to the entire economy of the United States. Few facts illustrate more vividly how profoundly the region’s economic centre of gravity has shifted from below the ground to the skies above it.

As governments continue to invest in sustainability, technology and workforce development, aviation is set to define a new era of prosperity, one powered not by hydrocarbons, but by human mobility and global reach.

A new economic horizon

The findings of Lifting Economies confirm what the industry has long sensed: aviation is no longer a supporting market in the Middle East’s economic story but the main character. With 4.3% of GDP and 5% of employment tied to the sector, the region leads the world in aviation dependence and benefit alike.

Each terminal expansion, fleet order and training centre feeds into a wider ambition, to use connectivity as a national growth strategy. The success of this model lies in the region’s ability to treat aviation not just as infrastructure but as a driver of trade, technology, and diversification.

As the region’s runways continue to expand, so too does its economic altitude. The whitepaper reinforces with data the idea that the future wealth of the Middle East will not just be mined or built, but it will be flown.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/17/FAPF9733-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:16:41.359584

Dans ce domaine, l'Union européenne joue un rôle clé. Conformément au Traité sur le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne (TFUE), l'UE partage avec les États membres la compétence en matière de transports. En d'autres termes, elle intervient lorsque les enjeux dépassent le cadre national et nécessitent une approche commune.

La politique européenne des transports a d'abord visé à construire le marché intérieur, en facilitant la libre circulation des biens et des personnes à travers les frontières. Mais ses objectifs se sont progressivement élargis : la protection de l'environnement est désormais au cœur des décisions européennes. Grâce à ses stratégies de mobilité durable et à ses mesures de réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre, l'Union agit pour rendre les transports plus verts, notamment dans le domaine de l'aviation.

C'est dans ce contexte qu'a été adopté en 2023 le règlement RefuelEU Aviation, qui impose progressivement aux compagnies aériennes d'incorporer des carburants durables. Depuis le 1ᵉʳ janvier 2025, ce règlement demande aux fournisseurs d’intégrer au minimum 2 % de SAF dans le carburant mis à disposition des aéroports européens.

La proportion de SAF devra ensuite augmenter progressivement pour atteindre 6 % en 2030, puis 70 % en 2050. À partir de 2030, une part croissante de e-kérosène sera également imposée : 1,2 % en 2030, puis 35 % à l’horizon 2050. L'objectif global est clair : réduire les émissions nettes du secteur aérien de 55 % d’ici 2030, et de 65 à 70 % d’ici 2050, par rapport à un scénario où aucune mesure ne serait prise.

Des carburants alternatifs vraiment verts ?

Les carburants d'aviation durable, ou SAF (""sustainable aviation fuel""), sont conçus pour remplacer le kérosène classique dans les avions sans modification technique. Ils peuvent être directement mélangés au carburant fossile, jusqu’à hauteur de 50 %, et utilisés dans les moteurs actuels.

Deux grandes voies de production existent aujourd’hui. La première, déjà utilisée, consiste à fabriquer des biocarburants à partir de résidus agricoles (colza, tournesol, betteraves, canne à sucre), d'huiles de cuisson ou de graisses animales. La seconde, encore marginale, repose sur le e-kérosène, produit grâce à de l'électricité renouvelable et du dioxyde de carbone capté. Ce dernier apparaît comme le plus prometteur, à condition d'utiliser exclusivement de l'électricité d’origine renouvelable pour sa fabrication. Mais il reste pour l'heure trop coûteux et encore loin d'une production industrielle.

Selon une étude de Transport & Environment (T&E) parue en janvier 2024, 45 projets de production d’e-kérosène ont été recensés dans l'Espace économique européen (EEE). Dans le détail, l'organisation a dénombré 25 projets industriels et 20 projets pilotes plus modestes dédiés à la production d’e-kérosène pour l’aviation. Les 25 projets industriels recensés visent à produire 1,7 million de tonnes de ce carburant d’ici 2030, soit bien plus que les 600 000 tonnes exigées par la réglementation européenne ReFuelEU. Une telle production permettrait d’alimenter environ 70 000 vols Paris–New York et d’éviter 4,6 millions de tonnes de CO₂. Mais pour l'heure, aucun projet n'a encore franchi l'étape décisive de l'investissement et du lancement des travaux.

L'organisation européenne pour la sécurité de la navigation aérienne (Eurocontrol) estime également que les SAF constituent une réelle opportunité pour l'avenir. Elle affirme que ces carburants permettent de réduire jusqu’à 80 % les émissions de CO₂ par rapport au kérosène fossile. Dans les faits, leur impact dépend fortement de leur origine, de leur mode de fabrication et des ressources utilisées. Les biocarburants issus d'huiles usagées sont parmi les plus vertueux, tandis que ceux produits à partir de cultures comme le maïs ou l’huile de palme soulèvent des inquiétudes environnementales.

Des objectifs encore lointains, une Union ambitieuse

Si l'UE entend réduire les émissions nettes du secteur aérien de 55 % d’ici 2030, l'écart entre l'ambition affichée et la réalité reste considérable. En 2024, la production mondiale de SAF ne représentait que 0,53 % de la consommation de carburants d'aviation, contre 0,2 % en 2023 selon l’Agence européenne de la sécurité aérienne (AESA).

Pour atteindre l’objectif de 2030, il faudrait que la production actuelle soit multipliée par dix en seulement cinq ans. Selon certains spécialistes de la transition énergétique, la montée en puissance de la production de SAF est lente notamment à cause des tensions sur les ressources énergétiques. Concrètement, la production entre en concurrence avec d'autres besoins, tels que la demande pour l’électricité et les carburants pour les véhicules électriques, ce qui limite les capacités à se concentrer uniquement sur l'aviation.

Malgré ces difficultés, le projet européen se distingue par son caractère pionnier : à ce jour, aucune autre région du monde n’impose au secteur des quotas de carburants durables aussi exigeants.

Une équation économique difficile à résoudre

Le coût et la disponibilité du SAF sont au cœur des préoccupations des compagnies aériennes. D'après des données publiées par l'Association internationale du transport aérien (IATA), le SAF coûte entre deux à cinq fois plus cher que le kérosène fossile. Une différence de prix que les transporteurs ne peuvent absorber seuls, surtout dans un secteur très concurrentiel aux marges souvent réduites. Beaucoup de compagnies redoutent une hausse inévitable du prix des billets, qui pourrait être directement répercutée sur les voyageurs.

Selon les analyses de l'ONG Transport and Environment, les compagnies aériennes européennes affichent des écarts importants concernant l'intégration des SAF dans leur modèle de développement. Certaines, comme Air France – KLM, British Airways (International Airlines Group) ou la compagnie nationale allemande Lufthansa, sont en avance en passant régulièrement des commandes de SAF et en établissant des partenariats durables avec les producteurs. Air France est même le leader mondial selon le classement établi. À l'inverse, des compagnies telles que Ryanair ou Wizz Air misent d’abord sur l’acquisition d’avions plus économes en carburant fossile, tout en amorçant progressivement des efforts dans l'approvisionnement en carburants durables, témoignant ainsi d'une démarche plus graduelle vers la décarbonation.

Même pour les compagnies les plus volontaristes, un obstacle majeur demeure : la structure même du marché. Les compagnies aériennes fonctionnent généralement avec des contrats d’approvisionnement d'une durée limitée, souvent annuelle. Dans un marché encore naissant, il leur paraît risqué de s’engager sur plusieurs années avec un fournisseur peu connu, à un prix fixe, alors que la concurrence pourrait contribuer à réduire les coûts dans quelques années. Cette incertitude explique pourquoi certaines préfèrent temporiser avant de s'engager réellement.

Le 16 juillet 2025, le chef de l'Association du transport aérien international (IATA) a appelé l'UE à ""réévaluer"" ses objectifs de décarbonation dans le secteur aérien. ""Je pense que l'UE en particulier doit réévaluer les objectifs qu'elle a définis"", a déclaré Willie Walsh.

Selon lui, l’UE aurait d'abord dû évaluer la production actuelle et future de carburant vert avant de fixer ""un objectif pertinent par rapport à la production"". Certaines compagnies aériennes d'Europe achètent du carburant durable en dehors de l’UE pour se conformer aux seuils fixés. Une situation qu'il juge peu sensée en raison de l’empreinte carbone générée par le transport du carburant.

Contribuant à près de 3 % des émissions mondiales de dioxyde de carbone, le secteur de l'aviation est parmi les plus difficiles à décarboner.

Les mesures européennes ReFuelEU Aviation imposent des quotas de SAF dès 2025 à tous les opérateurs d’aéronefs qui effectuent des vols commerciaux au départ des aéroports situés dans l’Union européenne, indépendamment de leur nationalité. Ainsi, les compagnies aériennes non européennes sont également tenues de respecter ces quotas lorsqu’elles opèrent des vols depuis l’UE. La réglementation vise précisément à garantir l’équité en imposant un cadre harmonisé à l’ensemble des acteurs du secteur aérien opérant dans l’Union. Elle entend ainsi éviter tout risque de distorsion concurrentielle et limiter les pratiques telles que le ""tankering"" (chargement excessif de carburant hors UE pour échapper aux règles locales).

Mais la responsabilité de la transition ne repose pas uniquement sur les compagnies. Les fournisseurs de carburants sont eux aussi tenus d’incorporer un pourcentage croissant de SAF dans leur production à partir de 2025. Des mécanismes de contrôle existent et des sanctions peuvent être appliquées en cas de non-respect. Ainsi, l'analyse ne se limite pas à la demande : l'offre joue également un rôle central dans la dynamique du marché.

Une pièce centrale mais insuffisante du défi climatique

Pour la Commission européenne, les carburants d'aviation durable constituent aujourd'hui la solution la plus avancée et immédiatement disponible pour réduire les émissions, notamment sur les vols moyen et long-courriers où l’électrique et l’hydrogène ne sont pas encore viables à grande échelle. Mais ils ne suffiront pas à décarboner complètement le secteur, d'autant que la croissance attendue du trafic risque d’effacer une partie des progrès accomplis.

C'est pourquoi de nombreux experts – à l'image du scénario ""Destination 2050"" élaboré par les acteurs du secteur – insistent sur la nécessité d'activer d’autres leviers : améliorer l'efficacité énergétique des avions, instaurer une fiscalité plus équitable des carburants, renforcer le recours au train à grande vitesse ou encore limiter les trajets les plus polluants, comme les courts-courriers et les jets privés.

La décarbonation de l’aviation européenne reposera donc à la fois sur des innovations technologiques, des investissements massifs et des choix collectifs dans nos modes de transport. Les carburants durables en sont une pièce maîtresse, mais certainement pas l'unique solution.",https://www.touteleurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-durable.png,N,,2025-10-20 17:00:24.000521

In the long term (beyond 5 years), waste-based biofeedstocks are poised to become a cornerstone of the global energy transition.","London's financial district is increasingly turning its gaze towards an unconventional yet immensely promising commodity: waste-based biofeedstocks. These discarded materials, ranging from used cooking oil to municipal solid waste, are rapidly emerging as a new frontier in the global pursuit of renewable fuel production. Driven by stringent environmental mandates, the compelling economics of waste valorization, and a strategic pivot towards sustainable investments, London investors are pouring significant capital into this nascent sector, signaling a profound shift in the renewable energy landscape with far-reaching implications.

This surge in investment is not merely a fleeting trend but a calculated response to the urgent need for decarbonization and enhanced energy security. By transforming waste into valuable biofuels, the industry addresses critical environmental challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating landfill pressures, while simultaneously unlocking substantial economic opportunities. The immediate consequence of this concentrated financial backing is an accelerated pace of innovation, the rapid scaling of waste-to-fuel technologies, and the solidification of a circular economy model where waste is no longer a liability but a strategic asset in the energy transition.

The Rise of Waste as a Commodity: A Detailed Look at London's Green Bet

The burgeoning interest from London investors in waste-based biofeedstocks marks a pivotal moment in the renewable energy sector. This isn't just about sustainability; it's about smart economics meeting pressing environmental needs. The core of this movement lies in the ability to convert diverse organic wastes—such as used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and even wastewater sludge—into advanced biofuels like renewable diesel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and biogas. These fuels offer a significantly lower carbon footprint than their fossil counterparts, with some pathways even achieving negative emissions through efficient waste management.

The timeline leading up to this moment has been shaped by evolving global energy policies and a growing awareness of climate change. Over the past decade, international agreements like the Paris Agreement, coupled with national mandates such as the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), have created a robust regulatory framework incentivizing renewable fuel production. The RTFO, for instance, sets ambitious targets for fuel suppliers to incorporate increasing percentages of renewable fuel, aiming for nearly 19.5% by 2030. This policy certainty, combined with the increasing financial pressure on companies to meet Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, has made waste-based biofuels particularly attractive. The period between 2020 and 2025 has seen a notable acceleration in investment, as technological advancements in processes like anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) have made waste-to-fuel conversion more efficient and scalable.

Key players and stakeholders involved in this emerging market include specialized waste management and bioenergy companies, major oil and gas firms diversifying their portfolios, and, crucially, a growing cohort of private equity and institutional investors based in London. Companies like Alkagesta, for instance, are at the forefront, combining trade execution, risk management, and investment structuring to transform UCO and other biofeedstocks into traceable and compliant commodities. Large energy companies such as BP (LSE: BP) and Shell (LSE: SHEL) are also actively investing in advanced biofuels, recognizing the strategic importance of diversifying their energy mix. Initial market reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with increased valuations for companies demonstrating viable waste-to-fuel technologies and a heightened interest in green bonds and sustainable finance instruments directed towards this sector. The market perceives waste-based biofeedstocks as a more resilient and less volatile commodity compared to traditional agricultural feedstocks, which can be subject to food-versus-fuel debates and price fluctuations due to crop yields.

The immediate implications are clear: a rapid expansion of waste collection and processing infrastructure, a surge in research and development for new conversion technologies, and the creation of new localized supply chains. This trend reinforces the shift towards a circular economy, where waste is viewed not as a disposal problem but as a valuable resource, impacting everything from urban waste management practices to industrial production cycles. The integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology with Energy-from-Waste (EfW) facilities is further boosting investor confidence, positioning the UK as a leader in carbon reduction and creating new green jobs, thereby accelerating the push towards negative emissions targets.

Corporate Fortunes Shift: Winners and Losers in the Biofeedstock Boom

The escalating investment in waste-based biofeedstocks is poised to redraw the competitive landscape across several industries, creating significant opportunities for agile companies while posing substantial challenges for those slow to adapt. This paradigm shift, driven by environmental imperatives and economic incentives, will profoundly impact the operations, market positions, and financial performance of public and private entities alike.

Companies Poised to Win

The most significant beneficiaries are renewable fuel producers specializing in waste feedstocks, along with forward-thinking waste management companies and traditional energy majors diversifying their portfolios.

Renewable Fuel Producers: Companies like Neste (XHEL: NESTE, OTC: NTOIY) are leading the charge. As the world's largest producer of renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Neste's reliance on waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats for over 95% of its feedstock by 2025 positions it for massive growth. Its proprietary NEXBTL technology ensures low carbon intensity, maximizing value in credit markets. Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR), through its 50/50 joint venture with Valero, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), leverages its global organic waste processing capabilities to create one of the world's largest renewable diesel operations, benefiting from a vertically integrated, low-cost feedstock supply. Aemetis (NASDAQ: AMTX) is expanding its dairy digester network for negative-carbon-intensity Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and developing a large SAF and renewable diesel plant using waste wood and carbon capture. Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO), while also using renewable carbohydrates, is a key player in SAF and operates significant dairy-based RNG facilities, enhancing profitability through high-value co-products.

Waste Management Companies: Traditional waste management giants are increasingly integrating into biofuel production. Waste Management (NYSE: WM), for example, is heavily investing in RNG infrastructure, capturing landfill gas to fuel its own fleet and supply others. This strategic move transforms a liability (landfill gas emissions) into a valuable, revenue-generating asset, strengthening its market position in sustainable waste solutions.

RNG Specialists: Pure-play Renewable Natural Gas companies are also set for significant expansion. Clean Energy Fuels Corp (NASDAQ: CLNE), the largest provider of RNG in the U.S., benefits from its extensive network and strategic partnerships with major energy players. Montauk Renewables (NASDAQ: MNTK), which converts landfill and agricultural waste into pipeline-quality RNG, is well-positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for low-carbon gas. OPAL Fuels (NASDAQ: OPAL) specializes in converting biogas from landfills and dairies into RNG for heavy- and medium-duty trucking fleets, expanding its capacity through joint ventures.

Oil and Gas Majors Diversifying: Even traditional energy giants are making substantial pivots. BP (NYSE: BP) acquired Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion to significantly boost its RNG output and invested in WasteFuel for bio-methanol production from waste. TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) has invested in Clean Energy Fuels' RNG business, while Chevron (NYSE: CVX) expanded its biofuels through the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group and a joint venture with Brightmark. Repsol, a Spanish energy company, is pioneering large-scale production of 100% renewable fuels from organic waste at its Cartagena complex, aligning with its net-zero ambitions. These companies are enhancing their market positions by diversifying their energy portfolios and hedging against future fossil fuel demand decline.

Companies Facing Challenges

Conversely, businesses that remain heavily invested in traditional fossil fuels without significant biofuel diversification, or those in waste management slow to adopt advanced conversion technologies, may face headwinds.

Traditional Fossil Fuel Producers (without diversification): Companies solely focused on crude oil and natural gas extraction and refining, without substantial investments in renewable fuels, risk long-term erosion of demand. As sectors like aviation and heavy transport increasingly mandate biofuels, these firms could see shrinking market shares and reduced profitability due to shifting demand and rising regulatory costs associated with carbon emissions.

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Incineration Plants (without diversification): While WtE incineration plants reduce landfill volume and generate electricity, they often have high capital and operational costs and may offer lower energy conversion efficiencies compared to advanced biofuel production. If the market prioritizes waste conversion into higher-value transportation fuels over electricity generation, these facilities might struggle to compete and miss out on lucrative environmental credit markets.

Companies Reliant on Food-Based Biofuels: The persistent ""food vs. fuel"" debate and increasing governmental reluctance to support biofuels derived from food crops (e.g., corn, soy) pose a threat. Companies dependent on these feedstocks may face regulatory hurdles, reduced subsidies, and public scrutiny as waste-based alternatives gain preference, potentially impacting their market position and financial viability.

In essence, the biofeedstock boom is accelerating a fundamental transformation. Companies embracing waste as a resource are poised for operational efficiencies, market expansion, and robust financial growth, fueled by both product sales and environmental credits. Those resistant to this shift, however, risk obsolescence in an increasingly decarbonized and circular global economy.

Broader Implications: A Catalyst for Circularity and Decarbonization

The pronounced backing of waste-based biofeedstocks by London's financial sector is far more than a localized investment trend; it represents a significant accelerant for global decarbonization efforts and a fundamental shift towards a circular economy. This influx of capital into waste valorization is redefining how industries perceive and manage waste, transforming it from a liability into a critical resource for a sustainable future.

Fitting into Broader Industry Trends

This investment wave is a cornerstone of the burgeoning circular economy. By converting organic waste into valuable fuels, the process drastically reduces landfill dependence, conserves natural resources, and mitigates environmental pollution. It champions the principle of ""waste-to-wealth,"" where discarded materials re-enter the economic cycle as high-value products. London-based firms like Alkagesta are instrumental in this, structuring investments that turn biofeedstocks such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO) into investable, traceable commodities, thereby facilitating this global circular transition.

Furthermore, it is a crucial pillar of global decarbonization strategies, particularly for ""hard-to-abate"" sectors like aviation, heavy transport, and marine industries, where electrification remains challenging. Waste-based biofuels offer substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—up to 90% for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) from UCO compared to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a more than 20% increase in global demand for advanced biofuels by 2030, with waste-derived fuels driving the majority of this expansion. Major oil and gas companies are strategically increasing their investments in this sector to meet their own decarbonization targets and respond to the growing demand for sustainable fuel sources.

Ripple Effects on Competitors and Partners

The intensified focus on waste-based biofeedstocks will create significant ripple effects. Competitors in the advanced biofuels sector will likely face increased pressure to innovate and improve efficiency, potentially leading to a more competitive market for technologies and feedstock sourcing. This could also spur the development of new global trade routes specifically for waste streams, making materials like UCO a highly prized commodity. Domestically, certain first-generation bioethanol industries, often reliant on food crops, might face challenges from cheaper, more environmentally favorable waste-derived imports.

Partners across the supply chain, from waste generators (e.g., restaurants, food manufacturers) to waste collection, sorting, and processing companies, will see increased demand for their services. This fosters greater integration into vertically aligned business models within the renewable fuel supply chain. However, it also introduces potential challenges such as supply chain disruptions and increased operating costs for biofuel producers due to feedstock scarcity and price volatility, necessitating robust long-term sourcing strategies.

Regulatory and Policy Implications

Regulatory frameworks are not just influencing but actively driving this investment. In the United Kingdom, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) mandates increasing proportions of low-carbon biofuels, with waste-derived feedstocks receiving ""double credits,"" providing a powerful economic incentive. The upcoming UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) obligation, supported by revenue-certainty mechanisms, is projected to add billions to the economy and create thousands of jobs. The European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED II and RED III) explicitly favors waste and residue feedstocks, setting blending targets and restricting food crop-based biofuels. Upcoming regulations like ""ReFuel EU Aviation"" and ""FuelEU Maritime,"" commencing in 2025, will further differentiate feedstock categories and mandate increased biofuel use in these critical sectors. Globally, government policies, including blending mandates and tax credits (e.g., the U.S. Clean Fuel Production Credit), are crucial for driving investment, though policy volatility remains a risk factor.

Historical Precedents and Comparisons

The current trend echoes past shifts in energy and infrastructure. The consistent outperformance of renewable power investments over fossil fuels in the last decade, often with lower volatility, provides a historical precedent for the financial viability of green energy solutions. There has been a clear shift from food-based to waste-based biofuels, learning from the ""food vs. fuel"" debate and indirect land-use change concerns associated with first-generation biofuels. This has paved the way for second-generation, waste-derived biofuels as more sustainable. Furthermore, the viewing of waste management companies, especially those involved in waste-to-energy conversion, as vital infrastructure assets mirrors how renewable energy was initially recognized as an investable infrastructure class. Early innovators like London-based Bio-bean, converting waste coffee grounds into biodiesel since 2014, demonstrated the feasibility of pure waste streams for biofuel production, setting the stage for today's expansive investment. These historical lessons underscore the structural, long-term nature of this transition.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the New Commodity Frontier

The trajectory for waste-based biofeedstocks is set for dynamic growth, driven by an urgent global imperative for decarbonization and the economic logic of the circular economy. London's strategic investments are not merely reacting to current trends but are actively shaping the future of sustainable energy and waste management.

Short-Term and Long-Term Possibilities

In the short term (1-5 years), we anticipate an accelerated adoption of waste-derived inputs like used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats, particularly for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Global biofuel demand is projected to increase by nearly 30% by 2028, with waste and residues accounting for a growing share. The expansion of efficient Waste-to-Energy (WtE) facilities, driven by population growth and increased solid waste generation, will continue, with the market expected to grow by 6.3% annually to reach around $78.3 billion by 2032. Focus will remain on high-priority organic waste streams like agricultural residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and food waste, with the waste-derived biogas market alone projected to reach $126.2 billion by 2030. Continuous technological advancements in gasification, pyrolysis, and anaerobic digestion will improve efficiency and expand the range of treatable waste types.

In the long term (beyond 5 years), waste-based biofeedstocks are poised to become a cornerstone of the global energy transition. By 2050, waste-based biofuels could supply an additional 20 million barrels per day of liquid biofuel, potentially satisfying a quarter of all future liquid fuel demand. This will involve the development of advanced biorefineries capable of converting solid wastes into liquid fuels through sophisticated pre-treatment and thermal cracking processes, yielding biofuel versions of crude oil-based products. Beyond fuels, there's significant potential for producing high-value biochemicals and bioproducts from waste streams, offering attractive economic opportunities. Integration with carbon capture technologies in WtE facilities will also become standard, further enhancing environmental performance and profitability.

Strategic Pivots and Adaptations

To fully harness this potential, several strategic pivots are essential. Significant infrastructure investment will be needed for processing plants, logistics hubs, and carbon-efficient trading systems to build robust supply chains. Governments must provide consistent policy and regulatory support, including carbon tax credits and stricter carbon regulations, to level the playing field with fossil fuels. Continued technological innovation and R&D are crucial to overcome challenges related to energy efficiency, high production costs, and the variability of waste streams. Supply chain optimization, favoring localized ""hub-and-spoke"" models for waste collection and initial conversion, will be key to managing transport costs. Crucially, traceability and certification will become paramount, ensuring feedstocks meet international sustainability criteria and attract ESG-focused investors. Public acceptance and education will also be vital to foster support for WtE projects.

Market Opportunities and Challenges

The market opportunities are vast, driven by the surging global demand for sustainable fuels, particularly in hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation. Waste-to-energy solutions offer an innovative answer to growing waste management challenges, simultaneously providing economic benefits through reduced disposal costs and local job creation. The diversification of energy supply through localized waste-based biofuels also enhances energy security. However, significant challenges persist. Feedstock supply limitations and variability are a major concern, as rapid growth in demand may outpace the supply of commonly used waste oils and fats, leading to price volatility. High production costs and the competitive economics of securing waste feedstocks remain barriers. Contaminants and impurities in waste streams necessitate advanced pre-treatment. Lastly, regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure gaps, particularly for cross-border traceability, pose ongoing hurdles.

One-time infusion of anzu-cel (anzutresgene autoleucel, IMA203) PRAME cell therapy in 16 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in the ongoing Phase 1b trial continues to show strong clinical benefit with more mature data: cORR of 67%, mDOR of 11.0 months, mPFS of 8.5 months and mOS not reached at 14.3 months mFU

Anzu-cel maintains a favorable tolerability profile in metastatic uveal melanoma

Anti-tumor activity observed across metastases throughout the body, including liver lesions, and in patients who received prior treatment with TCR-based therapies

Given the promising clinical activity of anzu-cel and high PRAME prevalence in uveal melanoma, a Phase 2 cohort has been initiated in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma

Houston , Texas and Tuebingen, Germany, October 20, 2025 – Immatics N.V. (NASDAQ: IMTX, “Immatics” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and the global leader in precision targeting of PRAME, today announced the presentation of updated data from 16 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma treated with anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy.

The uveal melanoma data from the ongoing Phase 1b trial will be presented today at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025 during the Presidential Symposium III by Sapna Patel, M.D., Professor of Medicine, University of Colorado Cancer Center. The slides are accessible in the ‘ Events & Presentations ’ section of the Investors & Media section of the Company’s website.

“Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma face a poor prognosis and represent a population in need of better outcomes, given the limited options currently available,” said Sapna Patel, M.D. “I believe the results with anzu-cel presented today signal a much-needed breakthrough for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. These findings highlight the potential of anzu-cel to redefine the treatment paradigm for uveal melanoma and bring new hope to patients who urgently need more effective options.”

“Our goal is to leverage every opportunity to bring innovative PRAME therapies to patients with limited treatment options,” said Cedrik Britten, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Immatics. “The continued strong clinical data presented today reinforce our conviction in maximizing the potential of our PRAME cell therapy, anzu-cel, and expanding its development into metastatic uveal melanoma, a rare cancer with very high unmet medical need. We are excited to further execute on our PRAME franchise and bring meaningful progress to patients in need.”

Presidential Symposium III Presentation Summary – Anzu-cel Phase 1b Trial

Patient Population: D ifficult-to-treat patient population with metastatic uveal melanoma

As of September 24, 2025, 16 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma were administered a one-time infusion of anzu-cel at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1 to 10 billion total TCR T cells) as part of the anzu-cel Phase 1b dose expansion. Patients received a median infused TCR T-cell dose of ~4 billion (range 1.62 - 8.43 billion TCR T cells) and had a median of 2 lines of prior systemic treatments. Patients had a median target lesion sum of a diameter of 103 mm (ranging from 31 to 210 mm), and 81% of patients had liver and extrahepatic metastasis.

Anti-tumor Activity and Durability: Continued strong anti-tumor activity and durability of anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy

Updated data of a one-time infusion of anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy demonstrated promising benefit in a difficult-to-treat population with limited effective treatment options:

Confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 67% (10/15 1 )

Disease control rate (DCR) of 88% (14/16)

Median duration of response (mDOR) of 11 months (min 4.4, max 31.6 months)

Median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 8.5 months (min 1.4, max 32.9) at a mFU of 10.4 months. The PFS rate was 69% at six months and 39% at 12 months

Median overall survival (mOS) not reached (min 4.3+, max 34.2+ months) at a mFU of 14.3 months. The OS rate was 71% at 12 months

Anti-tumor activity was observed in liver and extrahepatic metastases, including lung, lymph node, abdomen/peritoneum and others. 14/16 patients had target lesions in the liver and treatment with anzu-cel led to a median shrinkage in liver target lesion size of 49.6%.

Notably, 11 out of the 16 patients received a TCR bispecific (ten gp-100-targeting, one PRAME-targeting) as prior systemic treatment line, and thereof, six achieved a confirmed partial response, one a partial response and three stable disease. These results demonstrate anti-tumor activity of anzu-cel in patients who received prior TCR-based therapies.

a Patient out of study at data cut off (withdrew consent); BL, baseline; (c)PR, (confirmed) partial response; PD, progressive disease; SD, stable disease.

a Maximum change of target lesions and RECIST1.1 response at different timepoints. b Patient off study at data cutoff date (withdrew consent). 14/16 patients had liver target lesions with median best change of longest diameter of liver target lesions (range) of -49.6% (-100, 10). BOR, best overall response; cPR , (confirmed) partial response; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease .

Safety: Favorable tolerability in uveal melanoma, generally consistent with full anzu-cel tolerability profile

The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAs) were anticipated cytopenias associated with lymphodepletion. Expected and manageable cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mostly Grade 1 or 2, which is consistent with the mechanism of action (Grade 1: 37.5%, Grade 2: 43.8%, Grade 3: 18.8%, Grade 4: 0%). No patients experienced long-term CRS, and most CRS was resolved by day 14. No anzu-cel-related Grade 5 events were observed.

Tolerability in the uveal melanoma subset was generally consistent with the full anzu-cel tolerability profile in the Phase 1b.

Development Path for Anzu-cel in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma

Based on the promising clinical data in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, Immatics has initiated a Phase 2 cohort with approximately 30 uveal melanoma patients planned. The cohort is being conducted at select centers in the U.S. and Germany with deep expertise in uveal melanoma. Given the high prevalence of PRAME expression in uveal melanoma, prospective PRAME testing is no longer required for inclusion in the clinical trial.

The consistent tolerability, anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetic profile of anzu-cel across both uveal and cutaneous melanoma provide a strong rationale for pursuing a parallel late-stage development strategy to serve both patient populations.

About PRAME

NEWTOWN, Pa., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT) released the following letter from the Executive Chairman:

We are excited to enter the next phase of our lifecycle with a strong capital base and expanded accessibility for investors.

This week will be remembered as a foundational moment for Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT). We have made the deliberate choice to move forward with our scheduled registration for resale of the shares purchased by investors in the recent private placement rather than delay it. Whereas some of our peers have decided to postpone it at the first sign of market volatility, we want to explain why we made this decision and why we feel it positions us for long-term success.

Transparency in Volatile Markets

Markets can be volatile, and digital asset treasury companies will continue to experience volatility with the broader macro market.

In this next phase, with the resale registration statement effective, HSDT will be one of the largest effective market cap Solana DATs and therefore a strong investible option for institutional investors looking for exposure to Solana. Since we have launched the Solana treasury, we have opened up a new menu of capital providers and capital raise opportunities. That’s why we believe it’s appropriate to reach market equilibrium now rather than postpone the inevitable. The pressure on our stock price that comes with the effectiveness of the resale registration statement will likely shake out weak hands, but we believe this will also establish a remaining foundation of committed long-term shareholders. We're delivering for our investors by registering their shares on time and leaving the choice in the hands of our investors, where it belongs. That's what good stewardship looks like.

If HSDT trades below its net asset value in the coming days or weeks, understand what that means: investors can buy one dollar of Solana for less than a dollar. HSDT is committed to doing the right thing to maximize shareholder value.

Our Conviction

This strategy demonstrates the conviction in Solana that we share with our shareholders. We plan to continue to demonstrate how HSDT can be an active accumulation vehicle that acquires more SOL per share than investors can achieve on their own. We believe we can generate 7%+ yield through sophisticated institutional-grade staking not accessible to individual investors. We also intend to leverage the capital markets to acquire additional Solana. Most importantly, we expect to deploy capital strategically during market dislocations.

This is precisely where our vehicle will differentiate itself. We believe we have the right team of leaders and advisors. When the non-believers are flushed out, HSDT can continue to accrete Solana per share. We can buy aggressively when others are fearful. We believe we can compound Solana per share holdings through disciplined capital allocation.

Looking Ahead

This week may test your conviction. However, we are confident that disciplined investors who understand our strategy will one day look back on this period as an inflection point. We’re attempting to build the Berkshire Hathaway of the Solana ecosystem – a vehicle that compounds shareholder value and trades at a premium, with a strong balance sheet, a clear strategy, and the expertise of a team that is experienced with DATs and is shareholder-aligned with meaningful ownership. Our success is intertwined with Solana's success, which is why we're committed to actively contributing to ecosystem growth.

We're playing the long game, and we're inviting you to join us. We're playing offense, not defense. Thank you for your trust and partnership.

– Joseph Chee, Executive Chairman

Qatar, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Spain’s Iberia are at the forefront, implementing policies and programs to accelerate the adoption of SAF in their aviation sectors.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel derived from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and other biomass. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a crucial component in the aviation industry’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Where Are These SAF Initiatives Being Implemented?

Qatar

Qatar Airways has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is actively working with industry stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of SAF. In 2022, Qatar Airways signed a deal with Shell to source 3,000 metric tonnes of neat SAF at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, marking a significant step in its SAF procurement efforts. Additionally, Qatar Airways is the first carrier in the Middle East to join the International Civil Aviation Organization‘s (ICAO) Global Coalition for Sustainable Aviation, reaffirming its commitment to sustainable aviation practices.

Australia

Australia is investing in the development of a domestic SAF industry through a $30 million funding initiative announced by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in July 2023. This initiative aims to reduce emissions in the aviation sector by supporting the production of SAF from agricultural feedstocks. The Australian government recognizes aviation as a “hard-to-abate” industry and is leveraging its bioenergy sector to unlock market opportunities for SAF production.

Indonesia

Indonesia plans to introduce a 1% SAF blend for international flights by 2026, with a gradual increase to 5% by 2035. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation is currently drafting regulations to implement this SAF adoption timeline. This initiative aligns with Indonesia’s broader strategy to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector and promote the use of renewable fuels.

Singapore

Singapore is implementing a flight levy to boost the use of SAF, effective from 2026. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that all international flights departing from Singapore will be mandated to use SAF starting in 2026. The levy aims to provide an incentive for airlines to invest in SAF production facilities and accelerate the transition to greener aviation fuels.

Spain (Iberia)

Iberia Airlines has launched the “SAF Circle” initiative, a program designed to help companies reduce the environmental impact of their air travel by supporting the use of SAF. Companies participating in the program can purchase SAF for their flights, helping them offset the carbon footprint of their business travel. The SAF used in the program is produced at Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tonnes of SAF per year.

When Will These SAF Initiatives Take Effect?

Each of these initiatives has a clear timeline for implementation. Spain’s Iberia SAF Circle program has already launched, and businesses can begin purchasing SAF for their flights as of October 2023. Singapore’s flight levy was introduced in 2023 and is set to expand as more airlines adopt SAF in the coming years. Indonesia’s SAF blend for international flights is scheduled to roll out by 2026, marking a major milestone in the country’s commitment to sustainable aviation.

These policies are designed not only to help airlines meet their sustainability goals but also to provide the necessary infrastructure and financial incentives to make SAF more accessible and affordable for both airlines and passengers.

Why Is Green Aviation Important?

The push for sustainable aviation is essential for addressing the environmental impact of the aviation industry. Air travel accounts for a significant portion of global carbon emissions, and without substantial changes, the sector will struggle to meet international climate goals. SAF is one of the most promising solutions, as it can significantly reduce emissions while maintaining the performance and safety standards of conventional jet fuel.

In addition to its environmental benefits, SAF represents a new frontier in energy production and biofuel technology. The growing demand for SAF will drive innovation and investment in biofuel production, creating new opportunities for businesses and communities in renewable energy sectors.

How Are Other Countries Responding?

Alongside Spain, Singapore, and Indonesia, other countries are also taking significant steps to promote SAF use. The United States, for example, has been working to ramp up SAF production through government incentives and partnerships with private sector stakeholders. The European Union is investing heavily in SAF research and development, with a goal to ensure SAF accounts for at least 5% of aviation fuel consumption by 2030.

In addition, Australia, Japan, and South Korea are also making strides in integrating SAF into their aviation industries. These countries have recognized the potential of SAF as a key component of their environmental strategies, aligning with international commitments to reduce carbon emissions across all sectors.

Conclusion

As countries like Spain, Singapore, and Indonesia lead the charge in integrating sustainable aviation fuels into their air travel systems, the push for greener skies is gaining momentum globally. With the aviation industry responsible for a significant share of carbon emissions, the adoption of SAF is crucial for meeting global climate goals and reducing the sector’s environmental footprint. By working together, governments, airlines, and energy producers can create a more sustainable future for air travel, one where emissions are minimized, and cleaner fuels power the skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/make-a-beautiuful-image-on-sustainable-a_LGsr-NFfQUaccIb1QMIAvA_6bhp1HBMQvW3gej8SDo-zg.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:56:44.177336

Delays in the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline keep reshaping plans across the Midwest. The project includes investment from Oklahoma City energy leader Harold Hamm. His involvement keeps Oklahoma tied to every major turn in this carbon capture story.

This week, Gevo Inc. moved a headline project out of South Dakota. The company will now build sustainable aviation fuel at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota. That site already captures carbon. It also sits inside a friendlier permitting climate.

Why Gevo moved

Local resistance and permitting fights slowed Summit’s route in South Dakota and Iowa.

Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber finally lost patience. “South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business. Everything is oppositional,” he told South Dakota Searchlight. “North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”

Three years ago, Gevo broke ground on a $2.6 billion jet-fuel plant in Lake Preston. Leaders billed it as the state’s largest development project. However, the plan depended on carbon capture and pipeline access. The delays undermined that path. Therefore, Gevo shifted the project.

What it means for Summit and Oklahoma

The Richardton plant fits Summit’s model. Carbon capture sits at the center of sustainable aviation fuel economics. In 2022, Continental Resources, founded by Hamm, committed $250 million to Summit. The pipeline’s cost has since ballooned. Yet the core logic remains the same: connect ethanol plants to secure storage and cut lifecycle emissions.

North Dakota approved early carbon storage work. As a result, projects can tie in sooner. South Dakota still faces lawsuits and ballot fights. Iowa approved Summit with conditions, including permits in both Dakotas.

For Oklahoma, the story is simple. Hamm’s investment keeps the state connected to the front edge of carbon capture, ethanol decarbonization, and jet-fuel innovation. The next move in the Dakotas will shape returns for Summit’s backers—and set the pace for aviation fuel growth in the Plains.

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Kementerian Perhubungan memperkuat kebijakan untuk mempercepat penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF) guna menerapkan dekarbonisasi industri aviasi nasional.

Direktur Kelaikudaraan dan Pengoperasian Pesawat Udara Ditjen Perhubungan Udara Kemenhub Sokhib Al Rokhman dalam keterangan diterima di Jakarta, Senin, mengatakan langkah percepatan kebijakan penggunaan SAF dilakukan melalui penguatan peta jalan, mekanisme pemantauan dan pelaporan emisi, serta penerapan skema Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) yang sesuai standar Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO).

“Roadmap SAF, mekanisme MRV oleh operator, serta regulasi penerapan skema CORSIA telah disiapkan. Dengan sertifikasi sesuai ketentuan Ditjen Migas dan ICAO CORSIA, serta insentif yang proporsional, adopsi SAF di dalam negeri dapat dipercepat,” kata Sokhib.

Sokhib mengatakan Kemenhub berkomitmen memastikan seluruh kebijakan dekarbonisasi sektor penerbangan nasional berjalan sejalan dengan target penurunan emisi nasional dan standar global. Penggunaan SAF, kata dia, menjadi langkah strategis untuk menekan emisi karbon tanpa mengganggu operasional penerbangan yang sudah ada.

Hal itu disampaikan Sokhib dalam diskusi pada Pertamina Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Forum 2025 dengan tema “Sustainability: Indonesia’s Emission Reduction Ambition and the Benefits of SAF” yang menghadirkan pembicara lintas sektor dari maskapai, industri pesawat, lembaga sertifikasi dan pemerintah.

Dari sisi industri penerbangan, Country Manager Indonesia Cathay Pacific Airways Tony Sham menyebut potensi besar Indonesia sebagai pemasok SAF berbasis minyak jelantah di kawasan Asia, jika tantangan harga dan ketersediaan bahan baku dapat diatasi.

“Cathay Pacific menargetkan 10 persen pemakaian SAF pada 2030. Kolaborasi lintas pelaku menjadi kunci untuk mempercepat transisi ini,” ujarnya.

Sementara itu, Senior Managing Director Boeing Malcom An menilai kawasan Asia Tenggara memiliki sumber daya memadai untuk memenuhi kebutuhan bahan bakar berkelanjutan secara mandiri.

“Minat untuk mengubah minyak jelantah dan limbah pertanian menjadi SAF terus meningkat. Kawasan ini bahkan berpotensi memproduksi lebih untuk diekspor,” katanya.

Dari sisi standar mutu, CEO Qualitas Sertifikasi Indonesia Ryanza Prasetya menjelaskan pentingnya penerapan International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) CORSIA guna memastikan integritas rantai pasok SAF.

Sertifikasi tersebut, ujarnya, menjamin asal bahan baku, perhitungan emisi, dan ketelusuran produksi sesuai standar global.

Direktur Utama Pertamina Patra Niaga Mars Ega Legowo Putra mengatakan, melalui penyelenggaraan forum ini, Pertamina memperkuat peran sebagai penggerak utama pengembangan energi bersih untuk industri penerbangan.

Pertamina Group diketahui telah memanfaatkan minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF melalui ekosistem terintegrasi mulai dari pengumpulan, pengolahan, hingga distribusi.

Langkah tersebut diharapkan dapat menekan emisi karbon sekaligus menciptakan nilai ekonomi sirkular bagi masyarakat.

The company, via its business unit MyRechemical, has been awarded a contract by Altalto Ltd. to develop an engineering study for the construction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The facility is expected to become operational by 2030 and will produce 30 million liters of SAF per year—equivalent to approximately 23,000 tons of low-carbon fuel.

This initiative aligns with the UK’s SAF Mandate, part of the national strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by at least 50% by 2050. The plant will convert residual municipal solid waste (MSW) and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste into high-quality synthetic fuel, turning non-recyclable waste into a valuable energy resource.

According to project estimates, the annual fuel output will be sufficient to power over 500 transatlantic flights between London and New York, reducing net CO₂ emissions by more than 100,000 tons per year. This substantial climate impact will be further enhanced by the integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, designed to capture and reuse CO₂ released during production.

Advanced Waste-to-Fuel Technologies

At the core of the Immingham project are NextChem’s proprietary NX Circular and NX CPO technologies. The NX Circular process converts waste into synthesis gas (syngas), which is then transformed into SynCrude through Velocys’s Fischer-Tropsch technology. This intermediate product is subsequently refined into high-quality sustainable fuels suitable for aviation. The NX CPO system, based on a controlled partial oxidation process, further optimizes carbon efficiency and maximizes yield while minimizing environmental impact.

Through MyRechemical, NextChem will act as the technology provider and coordinator among the industrial partners involved in the project. The NX Engineering District in Catania, together with other Maire Group companies, will provide technical and operational support during both the design and implementation phases.

Maire’s technological approach underlines the increasing role of waste-to-chemical processes in the circular economy. By transforming waste streams into energy products, these solutions can significantly reduce landfill use, cut methane emissions, and support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Globally, SAF is expected to represent up to 10% of total aviation fuel consumption by 2030, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with production expected to rise from the current 0.5 billion liters to over 30 billion liters annually.

Economic and Employment Impact

Beyond its environmental benefits, the Immingham project is expected to have major economic and social impacts. Supported by the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund, the initiative will generate around 1,000 direct and 300 indirect jobs during the construction phase, while creating approximately 100 permanent positions once operational. The investment will also contribute to strengthening the UK’s energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels and stimulating the local industrial supply chain.

According to Altalto, the project will attract new private capital and foster long-term innovation partnerships within the British bioenergy and waste management sectors. Moreover, by producing low-carbon fuel domestically, the UK could save up to £50 million per year in import costs while cutting lifecycle emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

For Fabio Fritelli, Managing Director of NextChem, “this recognition confirms the validity and flexibility of our technological proposal, which meets the needs of mobility sector players, particularly in aviation where decarbonization is of fundamental importance.” His statement wants to underscore the strategic vision driving Maire’s international expansion and its role as a leading developer of circular and low-carbon solutions.

Only two airlines, Air France and British Airways, operated the original Concorde commercially, starting in 1976.
Due to the loud sonic booms created by breaking the sound barrier, its flights were restricted to transatlantic routes over the ocean.
Described as 'quiet', the aircraft's special design means it will make a thump noise instead of a loud sonic boom.","More than 20 years since the Concorde made its final journey, industry insiders have confirmed that the next generation of supersonic jets could enter service in the next few years.

The announcement follows the signing of new US legislation this June, removing bans on supersonic travel over land.

This has been made possible by modern noise-reduction technologies that suppress the loud sonic booms, which was a criticism of the original Concorde.

The new aircraft unofficially dubbed 'Concorde 2.0' is being led by Fly‑Concorde Ltd, a company backed by international engineers and aviation innovators, according to Euro Weekly News.

The updated version of the Concorde will feature a host of new design elements and cutting-edge technology.

The aircraft will be powered by sustainable aviation fuel, weigh approximately 50 per cent less than its predecessor and fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet.

Reports suggest that the first commercial services are being timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Concorde's maiden transatlantic crossing in 1976.

Journey times on routes such as London to New York, or Los Angeles to Washington, could be reduced to just two hours - a drop from the current six to seven hours.

Ticket prices are expected to be high initially, appealing to business travellers and premium fliers.

However, manufacturers hope that operating costs will eventually come down, allowing broader public access to ultra-fast travel.

Though not a direct relaunch of the original Concorde, which was decommissioned in 2003, this new chapter in aviation honours its legacy while embracing 21st-century environmental and technological standards.

The Concorde was the first turbojet-powered supersonic airliner to enter service flying passengers across the Atlantic at twice the speed of sound.

Only two airlines, Air France and British Airways, operated the original Concorde commercially, starting in 1976.

Due to the loud sonic booms created by breaking the sound barrier, its flights were restricted to transatlantic routes over the ocean.

Concorde's famous passengers included royalty, musicians, actors, and politicians, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and Joan Collins.

Concorde made its last-ever flight on November 26, 2003, departing Heathrow Airport and landing in Bristol, greeted by a cheering crowd gathered behind fences near the runway

It comes as NASA's X-59, a supersonic research aircraft, could fly from the capital of the UK to New York in around three hours and 44 minutes.

Described as 'quiet', the aircraft's special design means it will make a thump noise instead of a loud sonic boom.

The $247.5 million jet has been dubbed the 'Son of Concorde'.

For the Airbus A320neo family, for instance, the company supplies the high bypass geared turbofan engines collectively called GTF.

The breed has been around for decades now, and it didn't seem in need of an upgrade, but Pratt & Whitney thinks differently, and that's why over the past few years it has been busy developing something called the GTF Advantage, an updated version of the current PW1100G powerplant.

The main reason why the company opted to revise the engine was to give A320neo operators enhanced payload and range, but also a more durable configuration that could double the engine's time on wing. As a bonus, more thrust (4 percent more at sea level and 8 percent more at high-altitude airports) is also thrown into the mix.

The engine got the type certification for the Airbus A320neo family from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier this year, but now Pratt & Whitney announced the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) cleared it as well – and this opens the door for the GTF Advantage to take off for the first time commercially in 2026.

Hailed as a game-changer for operators, the powerplant will be offered on new A320neo aircraft, but the ones that use the current GTF could make use of it as well, as the two versions are intermixable and interchangeable. In the not-so-distant future, Pratt & Whitney plans to make the Advantage the new production standard.

There are a few key upgrades that should make the Advantage a better choice than the current variant, including the lowest fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft, increased airflow in the core that results in lower operating temperatures, and a new airfoil design in the high-pressure turbine.

As a bonus, the engine will probably be fully compatible with future versions of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and it will likely be able to operate entirely on this kind of source of energy.

The engine maker does not say who will be the first customer to use the new engine but says it already has 11,000 orders for the extended GF family. And that's saying something, seeing how there are only 2,200 GTF-powered aircraft flying in the sky today, serving the needs of no less than 80 operators.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/new-pratt-whitney-engine-for-the-airbus-a320neo-cleared-to-fly-in-2026-259512_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:56:25.768930

Together, they paint a compelling picture — one where Ethiopia could become a continental leader in bioethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

From Cassava to Sustainable Jet Fuel

Ethiopia’s biofuel journey began with a simple ambition: to reduce fuel imports and create rural jobs through domestic ethanol production.

The RSB Biofuel Strategy reaffirmed this goal, setting out a policy roadmap built on three pillars:

Feedstock expansion – large-scale cassava and sugarcane development with smallholder out-growers.

National blending mandates – progressive ethanol blending targets of E10 → E20, backed by fuel security objectives.

Private-sector participation – incentives for investors through public-private partnerships, concessional finance, and tax reliefs.

Today, Ethiopia already produces ethanol from molasses for both E5 fuel blending and clean cooking, but supply remains far below potential. With the sugar sector under reform, the government aims to revive underutilised estates like Finchaa, Metehara, and Kessem — creating a platform for industrial biofuel expansion.

The Alcohol-to-Jet Advantage

The World Bank’s 2024 SAF report identifies Ethiopia as one of Africa’s most promising locations for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.Its techno-economic modelling found that the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway is the optimal technology for Ethiopia — both technically and economically.

“An investment of $376 million in an alcohol-to-jet facility could meet 6 percent of Ethiopia’s jet-fuel demand,”

notes the World Bank, highlighting sugarcane and molasses as the most viable feedstocks.

Unlike other SAF pathways such as Fischer-Tropsch or hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), ATJ leverages Ethiopia’s existing ethanol infrastructure.By converting fermented ethanol into jet fuel through dehydration, oligomerisation and hydrogenation, the country can extend the value chain of its bioethanol industry into aviation fuels — a strategic advantage few African nations possess.

Market Potential Across Transport, Cooking and Aviation

The RSB Biofuel Strategy forecasts a combined national bioethanol demand exceeding 250–350 million litres per year by 2030:

This multi-sector demand base offers investors a diversified revenue model: domestic blending, clean-cooking distribution, and exportable SAF via book-and-claim systems under ICAO CORSIA or EU ReFuelEU frameworks.

Policy Tailwinds: Ethiopia’s Biofuel Transformation

Both the RSB and World Bank highlight clear policy imperatives driving the sector:

Energy security – Biofuels reduce dependency on imported petroleum, saving scarce foreign exchange.

Climate alignment – SAF from sugarcane or molasses can cut lifecycle emissions by >60 percent, meeting international certification thresholds.

Investment readiness – Reforms to open Ethiopia’s fuel import market and attract private capital mark a decisive shift toward liberalisation.

Social inclusion – Out-grower programmes ensure rural communities share in value creation from feedstock production.

The Road Ahead

Ethiopia’s next decade will be defined by its ability to turn feedstock abundance into refined fuels.

With ATJ technology as its backbone, the country can establish a vertically integrated renewable-fuel value chain — from sugarcane farms to SAF-ready airports.

But success will hinge on coordinated action:

government policy enforcement,

concessional financing from development banks,

and strategic partnerships with global fuel offtakers.

As the World Bank concludes, “Ethiopia’s heavy reliance on imported jet fuel makes local SAF production a strategic priority for enhancing energy security and reducing operational costs for its aviation sector.”

In Summary

Ethiopia stands on the threshold of a renewable-fuel revolution. With the RSB setting the policy vision and the World Bank validating the economics, the country has all the ingredients — feedstock, demand, and intent — to become Africa’s first integrated bioethanol-to-SAF hub.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e95502_8a6eaa7b1cf64a11a228fc036c0f20a8~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1536,h_1024,al_c/e95502_8a6eaa7b1cf64a11a228fc036c0f20a8~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-20 12:01:20.615806

Sovereign wealth fund Danantara said Monday that it was still reviewing the feasibility of the government-backed projects worth over $38 billion projects in the country’s downstream industries before deciding to make some investments.

Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia had drawn up a list of 18 projects worth $38.63 billion that Indonesia wishes to work on with Danantara’s help. The projects spans various resources, all aimed at getting Indonesia to move up the value chain by producing higher-valued goods. Bahlil, who leads the downstream development task force, had handed over these projects’ pre-feasibility documents to Danantara in late July. The ball remains in Danantara’s court, as the fund -- which now controls all state-owned enterprises -- intends to only finance projects that they deem “investment-ready”. According to Danantara’s chief executive officer Rosan Roeslani, the reviews are still ongoing, while admitting that some projects required “fine-tuning”.

""We will keep in touch with the Energy Ministry,"" Rosan told the press in Jakarta.

“There are some projects that need some adjustments, including on the projections,” he said.

Rosan did not disclose the timeframe of when the reviews would likely finish, nor the details of the projects that still needed some improvements. Bahlil’s aide Ahmad Erani Yustika not long ago told reporters that the review would likely finish by the end of the year, saying that Indonesia would like to actually execute the plan “as soon as possible”.

A few days ago, Bahlil told the 18 projects could directly create “almost 300,000 jobs” within the targeted industries. It is expected to generate a million jobs in indirect employment, thus possibly spurring a more equitable growth in regions outside Java.

Past media reports showed that some of the projects included coal gasification, palm oil-based oleofood, and sustainable aviation fuel based on cooking oil. When Danantara received the pre-feasibility study documents, Rosan said at the time that the fund was open to partnering with both state-run and private-owned firms in financially backing the projects.

According to government’s estimates, the resource-rich Indonesia needs up to $618 billion investments to develop the downstream industries of its minerals, oil, forestry, fishery, marine, and plantation commodities, by 2040. Indonesia needs $498.4 billion in investments to turn its raw minerals and coal into higher valued goods. Indonesia began this budget-heavy industrialization with nickel -- a key ingredient in electric vehicle battery production. The Southeast Asian country had stopped exporting unprocessed nickel in 2020, only wanting to sell half-finished or finished goods made from the silvery white metal. The policy has ruffled Europe’s feathers, but became a major economic driver. Indonesia’s nickel derivative exports only reached $3.3 billion in 2017, but soared to $33.9 billion last year.

has won many awards including Best Global Aviation Registry (in 2019 and 2020) in the World Commerce Review Awards.","At first glance, the Isle of Man might seem small; a dot between Britain and Ireland, better known for its winding TT course than for global commerce. But look a little closer, and you'll see a powerhouse of international activity, especially in the maritime and aviation sectors.

As of May 2025, over 291 merchant ships, 349 yachts, and 285 aircraft are registered here, representing billions of pounds in assets managed, financed, and operated across the world.

These aren't just numbers, they're a testament to how the Isle of Man has earned the trust of global asset owners through regulation, reputation, and results.

Let's look closer at the numbers that tell a story.

For a jurisdiction of just over 80,000 people, the scale and sophistication of the Isle of Man's maritime and aviation registries are extraordinary. The Island's brand has quietly become synonymous with quality, and global asset owners have increasingly taken notice.

The Isle of Man Ship Registry

Consistently ranks among the top registries in the world for quality, safety, and performance, the Isle of Man Ship Registry's fleet sails under a flag synonymous with reliability and one that exceeds international standards and holds a ""low-risk"" status under the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding. It:

is ISO-certified (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001), indicating strong quality controls and environmental systems.

operates on a cost-neutral basis, meaning it is not profit-driven, allowing for competitive fee structures.

delivers 24/7 responsiveness, backed by a global network of surveyors in key locations.

supports multiple regimes (for yachts): pleasure yachts, commercial yachts, and new schemes like Yachts Engaged in Trade (YETs).

supports title registration for merchant ships and allows mortgages to be registered against vessels.

has a simpler Part II register for 'small ships' (less than 24m) which offers a lighter-touch regime with fewer requirements (though without mortgage capability).

has fairly broad ownership eligibility including individuals, body corporates, and limited partnerships, subject to criteria (residency, place of incorporation, etc.).

supports flexibility in structuring for example, appointment of a local 'representative person' when required (for non-Isle of Man owners of vessels over 24 m).

is a British register, which means Isle of Man-flagged vessels enjoy the right to fly the Red Ensign and benefit from access to British diplomatic and naval support globally.

is careful to position itself not as a 'flag of convenience', emphasising its quality, compliance, and professional oversight.

These features give owners both flexibility and peace of mind.

The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry

Meanwhile, the Isle of Man has long been a jurisdiction of choice for private and corporate jet ownership and registration. The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry's client base includes some of the most prominent global operators and high-net-worth individuals who value efficient service, regulatory confidence, and international recognition. It:

has registered over 1,000 aircraft (to date) and is ranked among the top dedicated private/corporate registers globally. Total aircraft currently on register is 285 (194 business jets, 37 helicopters, 29 turboprop, 9 light aircraft and 16 transactional aircraft) – as at 28 May 2025.

has the motto 'Safety with Service', balancing high regulatory standards with client-centric responsiveness.

uses an online platform, ARDIS, enabling digital services like registration searches, reservation of out-of-sequence registration marks, mortgage searches, and invoice payments.

accepts corporate/private jets, twin turbine helicopters, and in some cases smaller turbine aircraft (or light aircraft owned by Island residents).

has the nationality mark ""M-"" followed by four characters (for example, M-YJET, M-ANDY). The neutrality of that prefix is an advantage in some jurisdictions or regions.

allows personalised registration marks are permitted, and the prefix may be recycled across different airframes.

offers flexibility in acceptance of airworthiness, crew licences, and maintenance programmes, so long as they comply with major recognised standards (FAA, EASA, JAA etc.).

is aligned with the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Isle of Man, and oversight is anchored in compliance with ICAO standards and recommended practices.

is trusted by financiers, with a published aircraft mortgage register, enhancing lender comfort.

has won many awards including Best Global Aviation Registry (in 2019 and 2020) in the World Commerce Review Awards.

These combined features make the Isle of Man particularly attractive to owners of corporate jets and high-end aviation assets.

Why Choose the Isle of Man?

Add the Island's renowned corporate structuring capabilities to the above, and the message is clear: this is a jurisdiction that moves assets that move the world.

So, what makes the Isle of Man such a trusted home for global assets?

At the core lies stability; politically, economically, and reputationally. The Island operates under its own government, legal system, and regulatory frameworks, offering a balance of autonomy and alignment with the UK and international standards.

Its regulatory environment is robust but pragmatic, ensuring compliance without unnecessary complexity. Both the Ship and Aircraft Registries are known for their responsiveness, technical expertise, and most importantly, client-centric approach; rare qualities in a global landscape often dominated by bureaucracy.

Beyond policy, there's credibility, built over decades. The Isle of Man has invested in professionalism, transparency, and innovation to ensure that its registries and corporate service providers aren't just keeping pace with global change but helping to shape it.

The global asset landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Owners are increasingly influenced by ESG considerations, digital transformation, and shifting geopolitics.

We're seeing a growing preference for jurisdictions that demonstrate environmental and ethical accountability, qualities the Isle of Man has embraced through its Blue Carbon initiatives, zero-emission maritime goals, and commitment to sustainable regulation.

Digitalisation is also reshaping compliance and administration, with e-registration, blockchain verification, and AI-assisted governance becoming part of the new norm. The Island's forward-thinking approach positions it well to adapt, and even lead, in this changing world.

As international regulation tightens and perceptions around transparency evolve, the Isle of Man remains steady, trusted, and agile, and these are qualities that global asset owners value now more than ever.

So, whether it's a superyacht cruising the Mediterranean or a jet crossing the Atlantic, its roots may well trace back to a small island in the Irish Sea.

A travel expert has shed light on what the resurgence of supersonic air travel could mean for future passengers. Nearly two decades after the grounding of the iconic Concorde, it appears the legendary aircraft may soon grace our skies once more.

Tech firms are suggesting that by 2026, passengers could be experiencing supersonic journeys again, with flight durations significantly shorter than those currently offered by commercial airlines. One might question why it's taken so long for supersonic flight to stage a comeback - but a pivotal development has now paved the way. In June 2025, the United States enacted a key piece of legislation that lifted the longstanding ban on supersonic travel over land.

As reported by Euro Weekly News, this significant policy shift opens up the potential for new routes across North America and beyond. The original Concorde was criticised for its noise levels, but updated models aim to address this issue with contemporary noise-reduction technology, reports the Express.

The revival is being spearheaded by FlyConcorde Ltd, a firm supported by international engineers and aviation innovators. Their revamped version of the Concorde will boast a range of new design features and state-of-the-art technology.

The aircraft will run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), weigh roughly 50% less than its 20th-century predecessor, and fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet. Nicholas Smith, Holidays Digital Director at Thomas Cook and eSky online travel agency, told Express.co.uk: ""While it's thrilling to imagine this aviation icon back in the skies, it's unlikely to appeal to the average holidaymaker from the UK jetting off to Benidorm for a week in the sun.

""We see the future of mainstream air travel heading towards larger, more efficient aircraft designed to carry more people, not fewer. That said, a modern relaunch focused on sustainability, digital innovation, and safety could carve out a niche for high-end, short-haul luxury routes - such as London to New York in under four hours.

""It's not a mass-market solution, but for time-sensitive premium travellers, it could once again become the pinnacle of prestige flying.""

Reports indicate that the inaugural commercial flights are planned to mark the 50th anniversary of Concorde's first transatlantic voyage in 1976.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.
It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 176-member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced that its member states have voted to delay the adoption of the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” a global agreement aimed at implementing measures to reduce the climate impact of ocean shipping.

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.
The combination of a flight levy, centralized fuel procurement, and regional collaboration offers a replicable model for sustainable air transport.","The global aviation sector is entering a new era of environmental accountability, and Singapore is taking a decisive step forward. In a landmark move, the nation has passed a parliamentary bill that imposes a fixed flight levy aimed at curbing carbon emissions and fostering the widespread use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This initiative places Singapore at the forefront of green aviation in Asia, setting a precedent for other nations seeking to balance air travel growth with environmental sustainability. The levy will be collected by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), which will utilize the funds to procure and manage SAF across airlines operating from the city-state.

With air travel rebounding strongly after the pandemic and climate change remaining a global concern, Singapore’s decision reflects a forward-thinking approach that blends economic resilience with ecological responsibility. The nation aims to increase SAF usage to more than 1% by 2026, with an ambitious plan to expand that figure to 3–5% by 2030. The initiative not only supports environmental goals but also reassures travelers that sustainable flying can remain affordable and accessible.

Singapore’s Flight Levy: A Step Toward Sustainable Air Travel

Under the newly approved policy, every departing flight from Singapore will include a fixed levy collected by CAAS. The funds will directly support the procurement and management of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ensuring that airlines contribute to emission reduction efforts. According to Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling, this centralized approach will enable the government to manage resources efficiently and negotiate better terms with global suppliers of SAF.

This model marks a shift from the traditional airline-by-airline procurement of fuel toward a unified, government-led strategy. The goal is to aggregate SAF demand across carriers, which would help achieve economies of scale and stabilize prices in a market where sustainable fuel production remains limited and costly.

By ensuring consistent SAF availability, Singapore is also positioning itself as a strategic hub for green aviation in the Asia-Pacific region — a move that complements its reputation as a global air transport center and tourism gateway.

The Cost Impact: Shared Responsibility for a Greener Future

Concerns often arise when new environmental levies are introduced, particularly regarding potential fare hikes. However, Singaporean authorities have clarified that the new levy will not cause a significant increase in airfares. The additional cost will be modest — approximately S$3 (US$2.30) per passenger for an economy-class direct flight, depending on the travel distance.

Rather than placing the entire burden on airlines or passengers, the initiative distributes the cost evenly across all air transport users. This balanced model reflects a principle of shared responsibility, encouraging travelers, operators, and policymakers to work collectively toward achieving a carbon-neutral aviation sector.

The modest increase is a small price to pay for a cleaner sky and a more sustainable future. For eco-conscious travelers, it also offers an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation each time they fly.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel could deliver up to 65% of the emissions reductions needed for the global aviation industry to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global aviation fuel use, leaving a long road ahead for scaling up production and adoption.

SAF is typically produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other bio-based materials. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF significantly lowers lifecycle carbon emissions — in some cases by up to 80%. It can also be blended seamlessly with existing jet fuel, allowing airlines to use it without modifying their aircraft engines.

By driving demand through policy, Singapore is creating market confidence that could stimulate global investment in SAF production. This move aligns with the broader sustainable tourism movement, as travelers increasingly prefer airlines and destinations that demonstrate environmental responsibility.

Regional Momentum: Thailand Joins the Sustainable Push

Singapore’s leadership is already inspiring regional action. In neighboring Thailand, the Department of Energy Business has announced that the country’s first national standard for SAF specifications will be released within this month. The new standard will come into effect on January 1 next year, marking a significant milestone in Southeast Asia’s collective effort to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

By developing standardized fuel criteria, Thailand is ensuring that locally produced and imported SAF meets international quality and safety benchmarks. This alignment will facilitate easier trade and cooperation across borders, allowing airlines to adopt eco-friendly fuel options with greater confidence.

Together, Singapore and Thailand are creating a blueprint for sustainable aviation in Asia, setting the stage for other countries to follow suit.

Tourism and the Future of Green Aviation in Asia

For the tourism sector, these developments could not come at a better time. Post-pandemic travel demand continues to soar, but so do concerns about the environmental consequences of flying. By integrating sustainability into aviation policy, Singapore and Thailand are sending a clear message that growth and responsibility can coexist.

Eco-conscious tourists are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize environmental ethics, and the rise of SAF-backed flights offers them tangible ways to make greener travel choices. Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.

Travelers arriving at Changi Airport or exploring the natural wonders of Thailand can now be part of a global sustainability journey — one that connects leisure, business, and climate action.

Global Context: Aligning With Long-Term Climate Goals

Singapore’s levy aligns closely with the global aviation industry’s broader sustainability roadmap. As countries pledge to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, initiatives like this help bridge the gap between ambition and action.

By leveraging its role as an international aviation hub, Singapore demonstrates how small island nations can exert outsized influence on global environmental policy. Its proactive stance could encourage more nations to introduce green levies or adopt centralized SAF procurement systems.

The ripple effect could accelerate investment in SAF production facilities, stimulate technological innovation, and ultimately lower costs for airlines and passengers worldwide.

A Greener Horizon for Global Air Travel

The road to decarbonizing aviation is long and complex, but Singapore’s initiative proves that pragmatic, well-planned policies can make a difference.

Replacing windows with cameras and a 4K resolution feed also improves both the aerodynamics and fuel efficiency enough to make chartering private more affordable than business class.

Otto Aerospace has tentatively earmarked 2027 for the Phantom 3500’s maiden flight.

In an industry that prides itself on providing more, Otto Aerospace has found a path forward by stripping something away (sort of).

As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Texas-based aviation company’s Phantom 3500 business jet will soon be carrying nine passengers at a time across the skies… without traditional single windows.

Instead, the cabin is wrapped in towering six-foot-wide digital panes, each powered by high-resolution exterior cameras, offering fliers enhanced 4K renders of the horizon in colour-saturated clarity (something Otto Aerospace CEO Paul Touw dubbed “supernatural vision”).

“You could sit in our seat and look at the entire world around you… It is surreal,” Touw told The Wall Street Journal.

But this isn’t just another vanity project to benefit one-percenters.

Without the structural weight of windows, Otto Aerospace’s teardrop-shaped private jet promises a 60% cut in fuel burn compared with peers – a radical efficiency that could, in theory, make chartering private cheaper than flying business class on commercial carriers.

The concept has already seduced the likes of Flexjet, one of America’s biggest names in private aviation, inking a contract valued at an estimated US$5.85 billion for 300 Phantom 3500s – deliveries are slated for the early 2030s.

Flexjet – valued north of US$4 billion and recently buoyed by an US$800 million injection from LVMH-affiliated private equity firm L Catterton, is betting that its clientele (CEOs, ultra-high-net-worth families, younger generation of tech-native flyers) will embrace the Instagrammable novelty and Trojan gamechanger.

For context, the company already curates rarefied perks like Napa Valley tastings and philanthropic galas. A futuristic, windowless cabin feels like the natural extension of its brand.

And as for Otto Aerospace, the Phantom 3500 is just the beginning.

Backed by US$250 million in private investment and an additional US$515 million state government incentive package, the start-up has built its first full-scale mockup and is already eyeing larger regional aircraft once Phantom jet takes hold; with the US$43 billion annual market for business aviation at stake – far more lucrative than the frontier fantasies of space tourism, claims Paul Touw.

“Everybody’s running around excited about Firefly and SpaceX. But the market for moving wealthy people around the world every day is actually much bigger than the market for moving stuff into space,” said the chief executive.

The cherry on top of this exceedingly ambitious sundae?

Otto Aerospace is also targeting zero-emission flight by 2030 for the Phantom 3500 (and the rest of its coming lineup), by combining full laminar-flow fuselage design with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The company believes emissions can fall by up to 90% once SAF is applied.

Este foro ha servido como espacio de reflexión y diálogo sobre cómo avanzar hacia una aviación sostenible y el papel del combustible de aviación sostenible (SAF del inglés Sustainable Aviation Fuel) para conseguirlo.

Rocío Blanco, consejera de Empleo, Empresa y Trabajo Autónomo de la Junta de Andalucía, inauguró el evento destacando el crecimiento histórico del sector, que superó los 15.000 trabajadores el año pasado, gracias a la colaboración público-privada.

La descarbonización es el principal desafío del sector aéreo, el cual es responsable de casi el 3 % de las emisiones globales de CO2 en Europa. En este contexto, el Combustible Sostenible de Aviación (SAF) se perfila como la solución tecnológica más rápida y eficiente para alcanzar el objetivo de cero emisiones netas en 2050. La regulación europea ReFuel Aviation ya obliga a un suministro mínimo de SAF, comenzando con el 2 % en 2025, el 6 % en 2030 y escalando hasta el 70 % en 2050.

Álvaro Macarro, director de Aviación Sostenible de Moeve, enfatizó que, si bien el primer año del mandato ReFuelEU Aviation activó el mercado con un aumento de la demanda y la concienciación, el principal reto para España es de tipo regulatorio y de inversión, no tecnológico.

El director de Moeve señaló que los Estados miembros deben complementar el impulso generado por el mercado con políticas nacionales que faciliten tanto la producción como el acceso al combustible sostenible.

A pesar de los desafíos de implementación, la producción de SAF presenta un gran potencial económico para España. Se estima que este desarrollo podría generar hasta 56.000 millones de euros de impacto en el Producto Interior Bruto (PIB) en el año 2050, según un informe elaborado por Moeve, Iberia, Vueling, BIOCIRC y PwC.

Andalucía se posiciona como una región estratégica en este desarrollo industrial. Moeve está construyendo en el Parque Energético La Rábida, en Huelva, el mayor complejo de biocombustibles de segunda generación del sur de Europa. Esta instalación tendrá una capacidad de producción anual superior al millón de toneladas de diésel HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) 100 % renovable y SAF.

Macarro afirmó que Moeve está apostando firmemente por Andalucía como eje estratégico de su actividad, con proyectos que combinan innovación, sostenibilidad y colaboración público-privada.

Nyt fuusioteknologia on Pohjoismaissa askeleen lähempänä toteutumista.

Novatron Fusion Group (NFG) - ainoa yksityinen fuusioenergiayhtiö Pohjoismaissa - kehittää magneettiseen peiliin perustuvaa fuusioreaktorikonseptia, jonka tavoitteena on luoda kaupallisesti kannattava ja kustannustehokas puhtaan energian lähde. Päätöksenteon tueksi NFG tilasi VTT:ltä selvityksen mahdollisista pilottifuusioreaktorin sijoituspaikoista neljässä Pohjoismaassa.

Raportin tutkimustulokset esitellään tänään Espoossa järjestettävässä Nordic Fusion Forum -tapahtumassa. Tilaisuudessa puhuva Suomen ympäristö- ja ilmastoministeri Sari Multala korostaa, että fuusioteknologian läpimurrot ovat käymässä toteen:

""Läpimurrot fuusioteknologiassa eivät ole enää pelkkää teoriaa. Digitalisaation ja tekoälyn hyödyntäminen on varmasti auttanut, mutta ennen kaikkea olemme päässeet näin pitkälle tutkijoiden ja insinöörien kovan työn ja päättäväisyyden ansiosta”, Multala sanoo.

VTT:n analyysissa tarkasteltiin sääntelyyn, ympäristökysymyksiin sekä operatiivisiin ja yhteiskunnallisiin tekijöihin liittyviä haasteita ja mahdollisuuksia kussakin maassa.

”VTT on tehnyt erinomaista työtä toimittamalla perusteellisen raportin, jossa on selkeä ja käytännönläheinen tiekartta konseptista rakentamiseen.

Parhaat mahdollisuudet löytyvät olemassa olevilta teollisuusalueilta lähellä tutkimuskeskittymiä

VTT:n tutkimusryhmän johtaja Markus Airila kertoo, että lupaavimmat sijainnit fuusioreaktorille löytyvät jo olemassa olevilta teollisuusalueilta, joissa on hyvät liikenneyhteydet.

”Satamien ja tutkimuskeskittymien läheisyys sekä raskaan liikenteen maayhteydet ovat sopivimpien paikkojen tärkeimpiä ominaisuuksia”, Airila sanoo.

Tutkimuksen mukaan lupaavimmat alueet pilottifuusioreaktorille ovat:

Suomessa pääkaupunkiseutu noin 50 kilometrin säteellä Helsingistä

Ruotsissa Tukholman ja Nyköpingin välinen alue

Kööpenhaminan ja Malmön metropolialue Tanskan ja Ruotsin rajalla

Lisäksi tutkimuksessa tunnistettiin noin kymmenen toissijaista sijoituspaikkaa, jotka jakautuvat kaikkien neljän maan kesken.

Sääntelyvalmius vaihtelee Pohjoismaissa

Fuusioenergialla on vielä selvitettävänään tiettyjä sääntelyn esteitä. Maiden sääntely-ympäristöjä vertailleessa tutkimuksessa todetaan, että Suomen lainsäädäntö on tässä suhteessa kehittyneintä ja Ruotsi seuraa tiiviisti perässä.

Suomi uudistaa parhaillaan ydinenergialakiaan, mikä yksinkertaistaa lupaprosessia ja vähentää esteitä pilottifuusiokohteille. Muutosten odotetaan astuvan voimaan vuonna 2027.

”Samankaltaista lähestymistapaa noudattamalla muut Pohjoismaat vahvistaisivat asemaansa kansainvälisellä fuusiosektorilla”, VTT:n Markus Airila sanoo.

Maat, joilla on oma fuusiostrategia ja erillinen lainsäädäntö fuusiolle ja fissiolle, ovat laitosten kehittäjille houkuttelevampia, sillä ne vähentävät ei-teknisiä riskejä.

Ruotsilla on vakiintunut ydinenergialainsäädäntö, jota sovelletaan nimenomaisesti myös fuusioreaktoreihin. Sääntely on kuitenkin edelleen laajasti fissioon keskittyvää. Tanskassa ja Norjassa taas toimitaan vanhemman sääntelyn mukaan, jossa fuusioenergiaa ei mainita erikseen. Tämä luo epävarmuutta menettelytapojen ja poliittisen päätöksenteon suhteen.

Fuusio voi olla lähempänä kuin uskotaan

Airilan mukaan tutkimuksen havainnot osoittavat, että Pohjoismaat ovat valmiita johtamaan fuusioenergian kehitystä eteenpäin.

”Kansallisten viranomaisten, teollisuuden ja paikallisten yhteisöjen tiiviillä yhteistyöllä ensimmäiset fuusioprojektit voivat toteutua nopeammin kuin moni odottaa”, Markus Airila sanoo.

”Vaikka kilpailukykyisen energiantuotannon saavuttaminen on edelleen suuri haaste, fuusiolaitos tuo ympärilleen paljon yhteiskunnallista hyötyä kuten asiantuntijoiden työpaikkoja ja kysyntää vaativalle teknologialle, jota voidaan siirtää muihinkin sovelluksiin. Jos fuusioteollisuuden kasvu maailmalla jatkuu ennustetusti, tästä syntyy erittäin merkittäviä vientimahdollisuuksia.”

Projektin seuraavassa vaiheessa tuotetaan yksityiskohtaiset ja paikkakohtaiset selvitykset laitoksesta kiinnostuneiden pohjoismaisten sidosryhmien ja teollisuuskumppanien kanssa. Tuolloin mahdollisia sijoituskohteita tarkennetaan maanomistuksen, paikallisen halukkuuden ja teknisen toteutettavuuden perusteella.

Energiayhtiö St1 ilmoitti keväällä 2025 sijoittaneensa 13 miljoonaa euroa Novatron Fusion Groupiin tukeakseen energiasiirtymää Pohjoismaissa.

”Novatron Fusion Group vauhdittaa puhtaan energian läpimurtoa, ja olemme ylpeitä voidessamme tukea tätä kehitystä pitkäjänteisesti. Tämän raportin havainnot nostavat esiin Pohjoismaiden konkreettiset mahdollisuudet globaalissa fuusiokehityksen kilpailussa.

Elektrobränslet – en fossilfri metanol som kan ersätta fossila bränslen i bland annat sjöfart och flyg – produceras genom att biogen koldioxid fångas in från kraftvärmeverkens rökgaser, som uppstår vid förbränning av skogsrester. Koldioxiden reagerar sedan med vätgas med hjälp av en katalysator och omvandlas till elektrobränsle.

Supported by Amadeus, BBVA, Repsol, and Telefónica, the program allows businesses to link part of their Scope 3 emissions to the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reports INSPENET.

The initiative was created to encourage companies to take an active role in reducing emissions in the aviation sector. Through SAF Circle, corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia can use SAF certified under the European Renewable Energy Directive. Companies participating in the program receive certification for their use of SAF, which can help improve their performance on environmental and sustainability measures.

Companies are grouped into tiers, which come with rewards in Iberia’s loyalty program and access to better services. The program is designed to combine environmental responsibility with business benefits, giving companies an incentive to adopt cleaner fuels.

Some of the fuel used in the program comes from Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tons of SAF per year. This supports Spain’s clean energy industry and positions SAF as a practical alternative to traditional kerosene.

SAF can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, without requiring any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. SAF Circle offers an immediate solution for companies looking to reduce indirect emissions from business travel and cargo transport.

Un progetto che consolida la leadership tecnologica italiana nel settore del Waste-to-Chemical e apre la strada al primo grande polo nordico dedicato al metanolo circolare.

Il cuore dell’iniziativa è la tecnologia NX Circular, sviluppata da MyRechemical, che consente di trasformare i rifiuti urbani e industriali in gas di sintesi di grado chimico, poi convertito in metanolo a ridotta impronta carbonica. Il processo si inserisce pienamente negli obiettivi europei di decarbonizzazione e nel quadro della Direttiva sulle Energie Rinnovabili (RED III), garantendo la produzione di un carburante conforme ai requisiti ambientali più stringenti.

Il metanolo prodotto potrà essere inizialmente utilizzato come combustibile marino, in linea con il regolamento FuelEU Maritime, consentendo agli operatori navali di ridurre drasticamente le emissioni ed evitare l’acquisto di crediti ETS o il pagamento di penali. A lungo termine, lo stesso metanolo circolare potrà diventare una materia prima strategica per la produzione di Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), in coerenza con il regolamento FuelEU Aviation, rafforzando così il contributo alla mobilità sostenibile del futuro.

In qualità di integratore tecnologico e fornitore di servizi, NextChem fornirà a Mana Group ed Equinor un’analisi dettagliata di fattibilità tecnica ed economica, che includerà la valutazione dei processi di gassificazione dei rifiuti e la purificazione del gas di sintesi necessario alla produzione di metanolo di alta qualità.

“Siamo orgogliosi di supportare questa partnership strategica, funzionale al potenziale sviluppo del primo grande progetto nordico di produzione di metanolo da rifiuti presso Mongstad, in Norvegia”, ha dichiarato Fabio Fritelli (nella foto), Managing Director di NextChem. “Il Nord Europa rappresenta un contesto ideale per progetti industriali replicabili e scalabili, con benefici ambientali e industriali tangibili”.

KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi.
“Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.","INDRAMAYU – PT KIlang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) memastikan kualitas produk bahan bakar minyak (BBM) yang diproduksi sudah diuji secara ketat agar memenuhi spesifikasi standar. Uji kualitas produk BBM dilakukan di semua kilang yang dimiliki KPI dengan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Alat pengujian di seluruh kilang yang ada di dunia menggunakan CFR. Ini single brand yang dari Amerika Serikat. Seluruh kilang Pertamina memiliki alat ini sehingga produk yang telah lolos pengujian dipastikan telah memenuhi standar internasional. Semua produk BBM kami sebelum dipasarkan sudah melewati proses pengujian ini dan telah tersertifikasi,” tutur Yulianto Triwibowo, General Manager Pertamina RU VI Balongan, di Indramayu, pekan lalu.

Yulianto menambahkan selain memenuhi standar kualitas BBM, operasional Kilang Cilacap sudah menerapkan standar keselamatan dan keamanan yang sangat tinggi. Apalagi, kata dia, kilang-kilang Pertamina ini usianya sudah cukup tua. “Kami di Pertamina terus melakukan berbagai improvement untuk menjaga keandalan kilang. Semua itu kami lakukan agar Pertamina tetap menjadi kebanggaan Indonesia. Walaupun banyak tantangan, kami tetap bekerja dengan tenang dan fokus,” kata dia.

Manager Engineering & Development Kilang Balongan Hadi Siswanto menjelaskan Kilang Balongan memiliki kapasitas 150 ribu barel per hari (bph), atau sekitar 14,2% dari kapasitas total kilang milik Pertamina. Produk utama Kilang Cilacap adalah Bahan Bakar Khusus (BBK) seperti Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Avtur Pertadex sebanyak 52%, BBM (Premium dan Solar) 26%, Propylene dan LPG masing-masing 6%, produk aviation sebanyak 1%, dan sisanya produk lain-lain (HMOC, Decant Oil, LCO Mix, dan GO Foam) sebesar 9%.

“Sebanyak 82% produk Kilang Cilacap memenuhi kebutuhan di DKI dan Jawa Barat, 12% wilayah lain, dan sebanyak 6% di ekspor ke Singapura berupa Decant Oil,” kata Hadi.

Sementara itu, General Manager RU IV Kilang Cilacap Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo mengatakan Kilang Cilacap memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang berbahan minyak jelantah. Wahyu menjelaskan, sebelum dilempar ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. “Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM. Pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR,” katanya.

Dia menjelaskan mesin CFR bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu, akhir pekan.

Menurut Wahyu, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar. Misalnya, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. “Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan. “Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Adapun produk yang diuji di LEMIGAS diantaranya BBM jenis Pertalite, Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Pertadex, Biosolar dan Avtur atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang. “Hasil pengujian ini membuktikan kalau proses pengolahan di KPI tetap optimal dan menghasilkan produk energi yang sesuai dengan standar nasional,” kata dia.

Kilang Cilacap memiliki total kapasitas pengolahan 348 ribu bph yang terdiri dari dua Crude Distillation Unit (CDU). CDU-1 sudah beroperasi sejak 1976 berkapasitas 100 ribu bph dan CDU-2 beroperasi pada 1984 dengan kapasitas 200 ribu bph.

Pada tahun 1997, Kilang Cilacap melakukan revamping atau pengembangan, menambah kapasitas CDU-1 menjdi 118 ribu bph, dan CDU-2 menjadi 230 ribu bph. Dengan begitu, total kapasitas Kilang Cilacap menjadi 348 ribu bph. “Saat ini merupakan kilang terbesar milik Pertamina. Nanti, mungkin kedua setelah Proyek RDMP Balikpapan selesai dan diintegrasikan dengan kilang eksisting dengan kapasitas 360 ribu bph,” ungkapnya.

Selain itu, Kilang Cilacap memiliki Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) mulai 2015 dengan kapasitas 62 ribu bph. Unit ini didesain untuk mengolah residu menjadi produk dengan nilai ekonomi tinggi seperti LPG, Propylene, Polygasoline (mogas dengan RON 98), Naptha (RON 92), Light Sycle Oil (LCO) danDecant Oil (DCO).

Sementara produk bahan bakar hijau (biofuel) diproduksi melalui Unit Treated Distillate Hydro Treating (TDHT). Pengolahan dilakukan secara co-processing antara Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO), Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil (RBDPKO), maupun minyak jelantah (UCO). “Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.

Kurangi Kandungan Sulfur

KPI menargetkan pengurangan kandungan sulfur pada produksi BBM. VP Process & Facility KPI, Edy Januari Utama, mengatakan peta jalan pengembangan kilang akan dilakukan dengan beberapa kategori. Pertama yakni memenuhi batasan spesifikasi, salah satunya kandungan sulfur. Dia mencontohkan, kadar sulfur pada produk Diesel awalnya sebesar 3.500 part per million (ppm), kemudian dikurangi menjadi 2.500 dan 2.000 ppm pada produk Biosolar. “Kadar sulfurnya selalu dikurangi menjadi lebih baik lagi,” katanya.

KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi. “Untuk itu aka nada beberapa proyek yang sudah disiapkan,” tuturnya.

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans.
On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines.

Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.","…excessive taxes, charges make travel expensive

The Chief Executive Officer of Airlines Association of Southern Africa (AASA), Aaron Munetsi, said airlines, airports, air navigation services, regulators and equipment suppliers all had a part to play in rewriting Africa’s aviation negative narrative and demonstrating that African carriers can hold their own globally.

This is coming as he lamented that Africa’s carriers face more than $220 million in additional supply chain-related costs this year alone, with a call that if governments genuinely want to democratise air transport, they should remove excessive statutory charges and taxes that have driven up costs, made ticket prices higher and pushed air transport beyond the reach of most Africans.

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans. He further noted that Africa is home to 1.4 billion people, the world’s youngest population and a growing middle class, but with just 2.2 per cent of the global air transport market share, “we are still idling on the run- way”.

The group called for a bold, collective effort to democratise and liberate the continent’s aviation sector through a series of interventions, including harmonising regulations, opening markets to competition, stabilising the industry supply chain, financial discipline, governance as well as fixing critical aviation infrastructure and related services.

Restoring confidence in Africa’s Skies, Munetsi out- lined AASA’s multi-pronged strategy for boosting Africa’s air transport sector, such as safety and standards, adding that Africa must harmonise oversight and recognise mutual licensing and certification — as the EU did in the 1990s — to support SAATM implementation and improve efficiency.

On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines. Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.

For financial sustainability, he called on state-owned airlines to be run with accountability, cost discipline, innovation and partnerships to drive better financial performance.

Munetsi stated that despite Africa’s small 2% share of global aviation emissions, governments should be facilitating investments in locally produced sustainable aviation fuel while their aviation infrastructure services should be improving operational procedures to help airlines reduce fuel burn and carbon emissions.

To him, empowering Africa’s youth, women, and innovators is key and requires investments in training, mentorship and inclusion, reiterating that in tandem, archaic protectionist practices and processes that restrict growth had to be stopped with governments rolling back excessive taxes and charges on air transport.

Munetsi raised concerns about operational inefficiencies and safety failures in South Africa, citing the on- going suspension of over 200 instrument flight procedures by Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS), which continues to disrupt airline operations and cost airlines millions of dollars in additional fuel, engine wear and maintenance, crew flight duty, flight operations sup- port, customer compensation and reputational damage.

AASA is worried that the glacial pace at which air- space management failures are being addressed meant the scale of the economic impact is not fully grasped. “The failure to design, manage and maintain air- space cannot be dismissed as an ‘inconvenience’.

It needs to be seen for what it is; an economic disaster which demands a commensurate emergency disaster response. The lack of urgency is reflected in the glacial pace at which approval renewals were being processed,” he emphasised.

AASA also called on governments to invest in digital border and customs systems and to relax restrictive visa regimes that deter travel. It also wants to see Mozambique and other governments with foreign reserves release airlines’ blocked funds and let local airlines access foreign currency to purchase aircraft spare parts and cover other dollar-priced costs.

“African aviation’s success depends on collaboration and shared responsibility. It’s time to stop talking and start improving. Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BUSINESS-NEWS.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:23:01.042313

Wahyu menyampaikan, pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Mesin ini bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu.

Ia menambahkan, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar.

Wahyu mencontohkan, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai.

“Jadi RON serendah-rendahnya adalah 90 sesuai standar, tidak boleh kurang tapi bisa di atasnya. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI.

Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan.

“Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Sebelumnya, praktisi industri migas memandang batalnya pembelian BBM dasaran atau base fuel oleh PT Vivo Energy Indonesia hingga PT Aneka Petroindo Raya (BP-AKR) dari PT Pertamina (Persero) mencerminkan tingginya standar kualitas bensin milik operator SPBU swasta.

Direktur Utama PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana (PJUC) Hadi Ismoyo berpendapat kandungan etanol sebesar 3,5% yang ditemukan di dalam BBM dasaran atau base fuel yang ditawarkan Pertamina memang masih jauh di bawah ambang batas Ditjen Migas Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) di level 20%.

Akan tetapi, operator SPBU swasta dinilai memiliki kebutuhan BBM dengan spesifikasi tinggi, sehingga adanya campuran etanol dalam base fuel berpotensi mengganggu formula bensin milik badan usaha (BU) hilir migas swasta.

“Kasus ini menjadi makin jelas, bahwa spek base fuel walau secara umum tidak masalah, tetapi karena demi standar sebuah brand yang sudah demikian kuat, base fuel pun meminta spesifikasi yang excellent,” kata Hadi melalui pesan singkat, Kamis (2/10/2025).

Dalam perkembangannya, PT Pertamina Patra Niaga (PPN) angkat bicara soal polemik yang belakangan muncul terkait dengan campuran etanol dalam base fuel di tengah masyarakat.

Pj. Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga Roberth MV Dumatubun mengatakan campuran etanol itu hal yang biasa dalam bisnis BBM dan lumrah digunakan di sejumlah negara seperti Amerika Serikat (AS), Brasil hingga Thailand.

“Penggunaan BBM dengan campuran etanol hingga 10% telah menjadi best practice di banyak negara seperti di Amerika, Brasil, bahkan negara tetangga seperti Thailand,” kata Roberth seperti dikutip dari siaran pers, Kamis (2/10/2025).

Selain itu, Roberth menambahkan, campuran etanol itu juga belakangan diadopsi sebagian negara untuk mendukung program pengurangan emisi karbon.

“Bagian dari upaya mendorong energi yang lebih ramah lingkungan sekaligus mendukung pengurangan emisi karbon,” kata Roberth.

Di sisi lain, Roberth menekankan pentingnya ruang negosiasi yang saling menghormati terkait dengan pengadaan base fuel tersebut dengan operator jaringan SPBU swasta.

“Kami memastikan seluruh produk BBM yang disalurkan sesuai dengan spesifikasi resmi pemerintah serta mekanisme pengadaan yang berlaku,” tuturnya.

Adapun, dua kargo BBM dasaran yang diimpor Pertamina mulanya ditujukan untuk dijual ke operator SPBU swasta. Kargo pertama tiba pada Rabu (24/9/2025), sedangkan yang kedua pada Kamis (2/10/2025).

Akan tetapi, kargo BBM dasaran dengan volume masing-masing 100.000 barel tersebut tidak laku terjual ke BU hilir migas swasta karena berbagai alasan. Vivo sebelumnya membatalkan pesanan 40.000 barel base fuel karena isu kandungan etanol 3,5%, sedangkan BP-AKR menyoal ketiadaan certificate of origin.",https://images.bloombergtechnoz.com/data/2025/03/image-20250329122420.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 06:57:31.862810

The project is part of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's broader push towards clean energy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035.

In an investor presentation post announcement of its second quarter earnings, Reliance said project development across the 5,50,000-acre site in Kutch is progressing well, with engineering and feasibility studies completed, and the site is currently in various stages of land development.

""Expected to start commissioning solar generation during the first half of the next year for captive requirements plus green fuels production,"" it said.

Four years ago, Reliance Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani announced a USD 10 billion investment in a 'new energy' business. That was seen as a notable change of tide, given the conglomerate's mega-scale petroleum refining operation that Ambani spearheaded back in the 1990s.

With that, Reliance began work on a new integrated renewable energy manufacturing hub named after the group's founder - the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex.

At the company's annual shareholder meeting this year, Anant Ambani - the chairman's youngest son - gave a glimpse into its scale. A build area four times the size of Tesla's gigafactory, a steel order large enough to build 100 Eiffel Towers and a stretch of cables enough to 'reach the moon and back'.

The gigafactories at Jamnagar - home to the company's refining and petrochemical complex - will produce gears used in generating electricity from sunlight and the battery value chain. Alongside, in Kutch, it is developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land - three times the size of Singapore.

Reliance's clean energy plans span solar PV, battery storage, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

The firm is on track to set up 20GWp of solar PV manufacturing capacity and 100GWh of battery giga-factory. Reliance has also pledged to produce 3 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen by 2032, while manufacturing equipment like electrolysers, battery storage and solar panels in-house.

In the investor presentation, the company said it continues to gradually expand its solar photovoltaic giga-factory. ""Already commissioned 4 PV module lines, and the first cell line is expected to be commissioned soon,"" Reliance said, adding that it is on track to achieve its targeted capacity and further expand in a modular fashion.

The PV solar manufacturing chain includes production of polysilicon - high-purity silicon produced from metallurgical grade silicon (sand). This is followed by ingot and wafer creation - polysilicon being melted and cooled to form ingots (either monocrystalline cylinders or multicrystalline blocks). These ingots are then sliced into thin wafers, which form the base of the solar cell.

Then comes the cell manufacturing - silicon wafers are processed through various steps, including doping, cleaning, and coating. Laser scribing is used to pattern the cells, and copper ribbons are applied for electrical connections.

Multiple cells are connected together and laminated between sheets of glass and encapsulant to create a waterproof module, or panel. These modules are then assembled into arrays with racking systems, which are support structures for mounting them on areas receiving sunlight.

With sunlight being available only during daytime, Reliance is also setting up gigafactories for the battery value chain to provide round-the-clock power.

General Manager Kilang Cilacap, Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo, mengatakan kilang ini memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur, dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau avtur berbahan minyak jelantah (Use Cooking Oil/UCO).

Wahyu menjelaskan, sebelum disalurkan ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM.

""Semua kilang yang ada di KPI punya standar yang sama. Kualitas produk yang diberikan ke masyarakat tidak pernah lebih rendah daripada spek migas yang ditentukan, karena kita tidak ingin pelayanan ke masyarakat itu tidak sesuai dengan yang kita janjikan,"" ungkapnya kepada awak media di Kilang Cilacap, Sabtu (18/10).

Pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Mesin ini bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” jelas Wahyu

Wahyu menambahkan, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar. Ia mencontohkan, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2.

Namun, jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai.

“Jadi RON serendah-rendahnya adalah 90 sesuai standar, tidak boleh kurang tapi bisa di atasnya. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan.

“Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji di laboratorium eksternal, salah satunya di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM).

BUMN energi ini mampu menjaga ketersediaan energi dalam negeri di tengah dinamika geopolitik yang mengancam pasokan energi global.

Direktur Utama PT Pertamina (Persero), Simon Aloysius Mantiri menegaskan komitmen Pertamina untuk terus berkontribusi dalam mendukung misi Asta Cita Pemerintahan Prabowo – Gibran, dengan mendorong kemandirian bangsa melalui swasembada energi.

Menurut Simon, kontribusi Pertamina dalam menjamin pasokan energi tercermin pada kinerja operasional yang terus menunjukkan tren positif, terutama di sektor hulu Migas yang menjadi tulang punggung ketahanan energi nasional.

“Saat ini, Pertamina mengelola 24 persen wilayah kerja operator migas di Indonesia. Kami terus menjalankan amanah Pemerintah dengan berperan sebagai pemain kunci dalam upaya menjaga ketahanan energi di tengah meningkatnya kebutuhan energi nasional,” ujar Simon.

Simon mengungkapkan, pembuktian kontribusi atas ketahanan energi ditandai dengan produksi migas Pertamina terus meningkat yang kini mencapai 1,04 juta barel setara minyak per hari (MMBOEPD), yang terdiri dari produksi minyak 557 ribu barel per hari (MBOPD) dan produksi gas 2,8 miliar standar kaki kubik per hari (BSCFD) per semester 1 tahun 2025.

Tidak hanya produksi, Pertamina juga mendorong anak usaha sektor hulu untuk agresif memperkuat cadangan untuk mendapat sumberdaya energi baru, baik melalui kegiatan Survei Seismik 3D maupun pengeboran sumur eksplorasi.

Hasilnya, Pertamina mendapat tambahan sumberdaya 2C (contingent resources) dengan realisasi 2C Validation sebesar 804 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE) dan menambah cadangan migas terbukti (P1) sebesar 63 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE).

Produksi dan cadangan migas Indonesia akan semakin kuat dengan tuntasnya proyek strategis Pertamina antara lain pengembangan Stasiun Pengumpul Akasia Bagus (SP ABG) EP, Proyek Sisi Nubi, Proyek CEOR lapangan minas di Area A Stage-1 dan proyek Lapangan OO-OX.

“Capaian tersebut semakin menguatkan posisi Pertamina sebagai kontributor utama produksi migas nasional, untuk minyak 69 persen dan gas 37 persen, sehingga dapat lebih optimal memasok kebutuhan energi nasional,” tambahnya.

Secara simultan lanjutnya, Pertamina juga berupaya mewujudkan swasembada energi dengan mengembangkan energi baru terbarukan.

Selama satu tahun pemerintahan Prabowo – Gibran, Pertamina berhasil melakukan inovasi teknologi untuk pengembangan produk bahan bakar rendah karbon.

Hal ini telah dibuktikan dengan keberhasilan kilang Pertamina dalam memproduksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel berbasis Minyak Jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO) dan implementasi Biodiesel 40 persen (B40).

Dukungan Pertamina dalam ketahanan energi juga semakin terlihat, dengan komitmen Pertamina sebagai pemimpin dalam transisi energi. Sejalan Asta Cita Presiden Prabowo Subianto, yang mendorong optimalisasi pemanfaatan energi terbarukan, termasuk panas bumi.

Pertamina melalui anak usaha dari Subholding Pertamina New and Renewable Energy, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk (PGE) saat ini mengelola kapasitas terpasang sebesar 727 MW dari enam wilayah operasi.

PGE fokus dalam mewujudkan target 1 GW dalam 2–3 tahun ke depan dan 1,7 GW pada 2034.

Beyond electricity, PGE meluncurkan Pilot Project Green Hydrogen (Hidrogen Hijau) Ulubelu. Pertamina membangun ekosistem green hydrogen secara end-to-end, mulai dari produksi, distribusi, hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung transisi menuju industri rendah karbon.

“Capaian tersebut semakin menunjukkan komitmen Pertamina dalam menyediakan energi bersih dan menambah pasokan secara berkelanjutan di masa depan,”ujarnya.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seluruh upaya tersebut sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.***",https://garuda.tv/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=135809&type=frame-og&hash=102581b277acc8c5f4fa6721e2c86bd4,N,,2025-10-19 02:56:21.344614

Upaya ini merupakan bagian dari Refinery Development Masterplan Program (RDMP) dan pembangunan kilang baru atau Grass Root Refinery (GRR) yang mulai dijalankan sejak 2014.

Vice President Corporate Communication PT Pertamina (Persero), Fadjar Djoko Santoso, menjelaskan bahwa saat ini Pertamina melalui PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) mengoperasikan enam kilang yang tersebar di berbagai daerah, yaitu Kilang Dumai di Riau, Kilang Plaju di Sumatra Selatan, Kilang Balongan di Jawa Barat, Kilang Cilacap di Jawa Tengah, Kilang Balikpapan di Kalimantan Timur, dan Kilang Kasim di Papua Barat Daya.

“Keenam kilang yang beroperasi saat ini mampu mengolah minyak mentah hingga 1 juta barel per hari, dan menghasilkan berbagai jenis produk, BBM, LPG, Avtur, dan Petrokimia,” ujar Fadjar.

Revitalisasi dan Pengembangan Kilang

Untuk meningkatkan kapasitas pengolahan, Pertamina menjalankan proyek RDMP di Kilang Balongan dan Kilang Balikpapan. Sementara pengembangan di Kilang Cilacap dan Dumai diarahkan menjadi kilang hijau yang memproduksi bahan bakar ramah lingkungan seperti Pertamina Renewable Diesel (RD), Pertamax Green, dan Pertamina Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Melalui Kilang Plaju dan Kasim, Pertamina juga mendukung program pemerintah dalam produksi Biosolar B40.

Pada 2019, Pertamina menyelesaikan proyek Pertamina Langit Biru Cilacap yang bertujuan meningkatkan kualitas bahan bakar menjadi lebih ramah lingkungan. Sementara itu, proyek RDMP Balongan yang rampung pada 2022 berhasil meningkatkan kapasitas pengolahan dari 125 ribu barel menjadi 150 ribu barel per hari.

“Dengan kemampuan kilang eksisting, saat ini Pertamina tidak lagi mengimpor Solar dan Avtur,” ujar Fadjar.

Leia abaixo os principais trechos da entrevista.

O que é a Itaipu Binacional hoje?

A Itaipu é uma revolução tecnológica. Imagine há 51 anos construir uma usina daquele tamanho, uma usina hidrelétrica. A maior usina hidrelétrica do mundo à época. Uma época que não existia software, não tinha computador, não tinha máquina científica. Os cálculos estruturais eram feitos na régua e à mão. É por isso até que Itaipu é mais resistente do que as outras, porque, na dúvida, colocavam um pouco mais [de cimento]. E ela é gigante. Chegou a representar 25% da produção de energia do Brasil. Itaipu é uma empresa pública que tem 50% do capital governo brasileiro e os outros 50% do governo do Paraguai.

Quais os planos da empresa para diversificar a geração de energia?

Nós temos investido muito em atualização tecnológica. São mais de R$ 5 bilhões de reais de investimento para atualizar todo o sistema de gestão de Itaipu e a maneira com que ela produz energia. Concomitante a isso, já há 20 anos, a Itaipu vem investindo em alternativas. Primeiro, em geração distribuída. Nós começamos a a produzir energia através do gás metano, no oeste do Paraná, onde há uma grande produção de suínos. Desenvolvemos essas alternativas a partir da geração distribuída. As leis brasileiras que tratam da geração distribuída surgiram a partir das experiências de Itaipu há 20 anos. Há uns 15 anos, nós começamos com as experiências do hidrogênio verde. O hidrogênio verde está num estágio muito avançado de pesquisa. Apresentaremos na COP30 um barco desenvolvido no nosso parque tecnológico, movido a hidrogênio verde. A partir da nossa experiência do biogás, a partir do nosso conhecimento de hidrogênio verde e com a geração de energia da hidroelétrica, nós estamos avançando muito agora no petróleo sintético para produção do SAF [[Sustainable Aviation Fuel, em inglês, o combustível sustentável de aviação que substitui o querosene fóssil].

E há investimentos em energia fotovoltaica?

Nós estamos agora fazendo uma experiência de placas solares sobre um pedaço do reservatório de Itaipu. E, com isso, nós vamos utilizar essa energia produzida para o consumo da usina, sobrando mais energia da usina para entregar à sociedade brasileira e à paraguaia.

Por que no Brasil há oferta abundante de energia e preços altos?

É um paradoxo. A produção de energia no Brasil mudou. A energia hidráulica, em 2010, representava 91% da geração no Brasil e, hoje, é só 60% do total. A geração térmica representava 9% em 2010 e, hoje, 6%. A eólica representava 4% e, atualmente, 7%. E a solar, que era zero, hoje, é quase 10%. A inovação tecnológica proporcionou o aumento de oferta de energia limpa, barata e de qualidade. Entretanto, essas fontes são intermitentes. Com a atualização tecnológica, ficou mais barato instalar as placas solares e mais pessoas têm comprado essa energia. Por outro lado, há demanda para energia firme nos horários de pico, ocasionando um fato novo. Há excesso de energia ofertada na rede em alguns horários e falta de energia em outro. Quando você tem um excesso de energia ofertada nas redes, por exemplo, entre 12h e 14h, você cria um congestionamento. Pense a rede de transmissão como uma avenida. Se você colocar muito carro, você vai criar um congestionamento. É isso que está acontecendo hoje. Com menos gente comprando energia das distribuidoras, o preço da energia para o restante da população aumenta.

Quais os planos e projetos que Itaipu apresentará na COP-30?

Até 2003, Itaipu só produzia energia. A partir de 2005, Itaipu passou a ter como missão gerar energia, preservar o meio ambiente e contribuir para o desenvolvimento sustentável do Brasil e do Paraguai. Itaipu começou a desenvolver políticas socioeconômicas que tornaram-se modelo no mundo. A empresa é premiada pela ONU, é reconhecida por outros países. Nós recebemos, frequentemente, visitas de representantes do governo de outros países para conhecer as nossas experiências socioambientais, que são muito bem sucedidas na preservação da nossa matéria-prima, que é a água, da contribuição ao desenvolvimento regional, e, principalmente na construção de parcerias, tanto na área rural como urbana. A nossa participação na COP está muito baseada nisso, em levar toda essa tecnologia acumulada nesses anos, nesses últimos 20 anos, para socializar isso com o resto do mundo.",https://midias.em.com.br/_midias/jpg/2025/10/19/1000x1000/1_dsc05081-990x557-60040995.jpg?20251019003153?20251019003153,N,,2025-10-19 02:56:39.090113

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.
In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.
“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

And a Queensland company at the vanguard of production is establishing a biofuels facility – one of three being built in the race to cut emissions from challenging industries.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.

“Waste products will be the new oil,” he says.

“We, as a country, have a lot of waste products so we can be a major player in sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, and low-carbon liquid fuels in general.”

His prediction follows a $1.1 billion federal government investment in biofuel production and the launch of a public consultation into a national strategy for the burgeoning industry.

While momentum is growing, climate experts say biofuels remain difficult and costly to produce, and their widespread acceptance will require governments around the world to mandate their use.

Biofuels, also known as low-carbon liquid fuels, are made from renewable resources such as agricultural waste and can be used to reduce emissions from industries in which there are few other options.

In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.

Domestic airlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia are already pursuing biofuel opportunities, Doyle says, as alternative technologies are not ready to go the distance.

“There have been a lot of studies done on electric planes, which are good for very short-haul [flights], but they can’t do any longer,” he says.

“Then there’s hydrogen in 2035 or 2040, but that will only be medium-haul. For long-haul, there’s no other solution other than sustainable aviation fuels out to 2050.”

The Toowoomba-based company is developing a sustainable aviation fuel production facility in Brisbane, co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which is expected to produce 114 megalitres of fuel annually.

But the firm’s latest fuel-blending facility at Wellcamp Airport is using imported synthetic fuel to mix with standard jet fuel while waiting for domestic supplies to become available, Doyle says.

“We’re hoping our facility can be a beacon for the federal government to look at and say everything works.

“Then we can get on with making good policy that will grow the industry and benefit Australia.”

Support for biofuels is growing in Australia, with the government announcing a $1.1 billion, 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program in September to boost its production.

Consultation also opened this month for the development of a National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy to ensure Australia is producing materials needed to create renewable fuel.

After years “wasted in the climate wars”, the announcements are being welcomed by producers and potential users alike, says Bioenergy Australia chief executive Shahana McKenzie.

Despite the industry’s slow start, she says, Australia’s advantages, such as its strong farming sector, make it a natural biofuels leader in the Asia Pacific region.

“Australia is being looked at by all the other players in our region as the most likely contributor, either from a feedstock perspective or from an export perspective,” she says.

“It’s incredibly important that decarbonisation is actively taking place across all [nearby] jurisdictions.”

Australia already has three biodiesel and two ethanol refineries in operation, with three projects in development: Wagner’s Brisbane base, Ampol’s proposed renewable fuels facility in outer Brisbane, and Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses in Townsville.

Other projects are “progressing behind the scenes”, McKenzie says, to help the nation catch up to its potential.

“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

“In terms of the flow of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel in country, we are predicting the first project will deliver fuel in 2028.”

But Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley says there will be more challenges to adopting biofuel than just producing it.

Renewable fuels are significantly more expensive to produce than conventional varieties, he says, and will have to be mandated in some industries to ensure emission cuts.

“The cost of biofuels is between 50 and 500 per cent the cost of their fossil fuel equivalents, and that’s a huge impediment to their uptake,” he says.

“A lot of biofuels will go into the maritime and aviation industries, but that will only come about if you get mandates.”",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5755%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_no_age_social_wm/655bde7f12ad1d18d87a6a94582a3026bf47d67d,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:11.098081

Dalam rancangan kebijakan tersebut, campuran SAF akan dimulai dari kadar 1%, dan secara bertahap ditingkatkan hingga 5% pada 2035. Langkah ini merupakan bagian dari komitmen Indonesia untuk menekan emisi karbon di sektor penerbangan dan mendukung agenda net zero emission (NZE).

🔹 Maskapai Siap Operasional, Tantangan Ada di Biaya

Sekretaris Jenderal Indonesia National Air Carrier Association (INACA), Bayu Sutanto, mengatakan secara teknis maskapai nasional sudah siap mengoperasikan pesawat dengan bahan bakar campuran SAF. Namun, dari sisi finansial, penerapan aturan ini masih menjadi tantangan besar.

“Secara operasional maskapai sudah siap, tapi secara finansial belum. Kenaikan biaya operasional akibat penggunaan avtur campuran SAF cukup signifikan, sementara harga tiket belum pernah disesuaikan sejak 2019,” ujar Bayu, Jumat (17/10/2025).

Bayu menegaskan, harga avtur SAF lebih mahal dibandingkan avtur konvensional, sehingga tanpa penyesuaian terhadap batas harga tiket, kebijakan ini bisa menekan profitabilitas maskapai.

🔹 Bahan Baku SAF dari Minyak Jelantah

Menurut Bayu, bahan baku SAF yang paling realistis di Indonesia saat ini adalah minyak jelantah (used cooking oil). Meski potensinya besar, tantangan utama justru terletak pada proses pengumpulan bahan baku, ketersediaan kilang pengolahan (refinery), serta distribusi SAF yang belum merata ke seluruh bandara.

“Kendala lain adalah harga avtur dan biaya operasional yang akan meningkat, sehingga berpotensi mendorong kenaikan harga tiket, terutama untuk rute-rute internasional menuju negara yang sudah mewajibkan penggunaan SAF,” tambahnya.

🔹 Usulan INACA: Implementasi Bertahap dan Sukarela

Untuk mengantisipasi lonjakan biaya, INACA mengusulkan agar implementasi SAF dilakukan secara bertahap dan sukarela (voluntary) pada tahap awal.

“Misalnya mulai dengan campuran 0,5%–1% dulu, dan hanya untuk penerbangan internasional dari dan ke Bandara Soekarno-Hatta (CGK) dan Ngurah Rai (DPS),” ujar Bayu.

INACA juga mendorong adanya regulasi pendukung seperti mekanisme carbon credit, carbon tax, serta insentif fiskal untuk membantu industri penerbangan bertransisi ke energi bersih tanpa membebani konsumen.

This was the submission of the Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, John Pearson in an interaction with Festus Akanbi on the sidelines of a media event- Global Trade Shifts- Spotlights Africa, and launch of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week

Figeria sits on a rare confluence of promise — a young, restless population, vast entrepreneurial energy, a swelling workforce, and a strategic position at the heart of Africa. Yet, in the view of John Pearson, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, the country’s demographic blessing will only translate into prosperity if the right policies, partnerships, and infrastructure align to unlock its immense potential.

Speaking in Johannesburg at the unveiling of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker, Pearson told THISDAY that Nigeria’s future will depend on how it converts its people into productivity.

“You have over 200 million people, that’s not a challenge, it’s a superpower,” he declared. “But for that power to work, the systems, from education to logistics and regulation, have to move in the same direction.”

Human Capital: The Real Goldmine

At the centre of Pearson’s argument lies Nigeria’s human capital. With over 200 million citizens, half of them under 30, the country stands on a demographic goldmine. Pearson explained that DHL’s experience in Nigeria has shown the quality and competitiveness of local talent.

“We’ve been able to attract, retain, and grow fantastic Nigerian professionals,” adding that “Some of them have gone on to lead teams in other African countries. That tells you the calibre of people you have here.”

He pointed to DHL’s Certified International Specialist (CIS) programme, a leadership and training model applied consistently across all its global operations. “In Nigeria, our people go through the same training and development as their colleagues in Germany or India. It’s not watered down. That’s how we build global competence locally.”

However, Pearson noted that the wider Nigerian economy has yet to connect education to market realities. He emphasised that reforms must bridge the gap between academic training and industrial demand.

“The world of logistics, trade, and digital commerce is changing so fast. Nigeria’s universities and vocational institutions need to reflect that,” he said, pointing out that “We need to revive technical and apprenticeship programmes, bring industries into classrooms, and ensure graduates have practical skills, not just certificates.”

The DHL boss also underscored the importance of retention. “The continuous brain drain is a symptom, saying people leave when they can’t find stability or predictability at home. Salaries matter, but so do security, infrastructure, and a clear sense of direction.

Trade, Borders, and Bottlenecks

Few companies understand the pulse of trade like DHL. Pearson’s perspective on cross-border efficiency is blunt: Nigeria’s logistics arteries are clogged, and it’s costing the nation dearly.

“As a logistics company, our goal is to make the movement of goods seamless,” he said. “We work closely with customs; in some cases, officials even operate from our premises to speed up clearance. But many of the deeper challenges are systemic. No private company can fix them alone,” he said.

From congested ports to crumbling roads, Nigeria’s trade routes continue to be a source of frustration. Clearing goods from Apapa or Tin Can Island can take days, sometimes weeks, adding heavy costs that erode competitiveness. Pearson believes a “national logistics overhaul” is overdue.

“What Nigeria needs is simplicity and consistency,” he explained. “Simplify customs procedures, harmonise agency roles, digitise documentation, and you’ll see trade volumes and investor confidence rise almost immediately.”

He advocates the full activation of inland dry ports to relieve Lagos of its overwhelming cargo burden, as well as the creation of logistics hubs and cold-chain networks nationwide.

“Improving rail and road connectivity to neighbouring countries will also let Nigeria take real advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area,” he added.

E-Commerce: The New Frontier

In Pearson’s view, the digital revolution is redefining logistics as much as it is redefining business. “The click-and-ship culture is exploding,” he said. “We’re helping Nigerian merchants go global, optimising their websites, setting transparent pricing, and ensuring reliable delivery timelines.”

DHL, he explained, is building the infrastructure and advisory systems that enable local businesses to plug directly into global markets. Yet, the e-commerce ecosystem remains underdeveloped.

“Too many small businesses are still manual,” he observed. “No digital tracking, no online payment integration. And with poor internet, unreliable electricity, and chaotic address systems, last-mile delivery becomes a nightmare.”

For Nigeria to truly benefit, Pearson believes, the government must make broadband access and digital literacy national priorities. “Once small businesses can operate confidently online, their market stops being their neighbourhood; it becomes the world.”

Sustainability: Delivering the Future Responsibly

Pearson’s passion for sustainability is unmistakable. DHL, he said, has made global commitments to reducing its carbon footprint, investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel and electric vehicles.

“In Nigeria, we’re already deploying solar-powered facilities and carbon-neutral warehouses,” he noted. “Our global goal is zero emissions by 2050, and that includes every market where we operate.”

However, Pearson acknowledged that Nigeria’s broader ecosystem remains far behind. “You can’t scale electric vehicles without reliable power or charging infrastructure,” he said. “Government incentives, like tax breaks for clean energy and partnerships for renewable grids, would accelerate adoption.”

DHL’s efforts, he argued, can serve as a template for others. “Sustainability shouldn’t be an afterthought. It’s part of competitiveness now. Customers want to know that their logistics partners care about the planet.”

Infrastructure: The Missing Link

Without physical infrastructure, even the best talent and technology falter. Pearson described infrastructure as the “circulatory system” of any modern economy, and Nigeria’s, he said, is weak.

“Ports are congested, roads are deteriorating, rail is underutilised, and warehouses are often outdated,” he said. “You can’t talk about efficient logistics without reliable arteries.”

He called for a National Logistics Master Plan, one that integrates roads, rail, ports, and production zones into a single coordinated framework. “Every delay on the road, every broken bridge, adds cost,” he said. “Fixing these things doesn’t just make trade faster; it makes businesses more competitive.”

Regulatory Consistency and Predictability

One of Pearson’s most persistent themes is predictability. “Investors can handle high costs,” he said, “but what they can’t handle is unpredictability.”

Frequent policy shifts, overlapping regulations, and opaque bureaucracy, he warned, remain Nigeria’s biggest deterrents to foreign investment. “If a business can’t predict clearance times, tariff levels, or regulatory changes, it can’t plan,” he said. “Predictability is the real investment incentive.”

Still, Pearson acknowledged positive examples. “Our collaboration with customs shows that private-public cooperation is possible,” he said. “It just needs to happen more often, with transparency, professionalism, and mutual trust.”

Empowering the SMEs

Beyond the large corporates, Pearson sees small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as the heart of Nigeria’s growth story. DHL’s GoTrade Initiative, he explained, was designed to help small exporters understand international standards, packaging, and logistics.

“We’re helping Nigerian SMEs connect directly to global buyers,” he said. “When small producers can access export finance, proper packaging, and reliable delivery, the entire economy benefits.”

He suggested that banks and government agencies complement such initiatives with affordable trade finance and insurance products. “Clusters of small producers can share logistics costs,” he said. “Incubators and mentorship programmes can also improve business management and export readiness.”

Digitalisation and Data: The Game Changer

To tie all these threads together, Pearson believes in data transparency. “Data is the new oil,” he said. “When you can measure port dwell times, clearance durations, and delivery success rates, you can fix inefficiencies.”

DHL’s use of route optimisation, scanner tracking, and real-time courier communication has significantly improved delivery performance. Nigeria, he argued, should adopt a similar culture of measurement and accountability.

“With reliable data, decisions become smarter, waste is reduced, and customers are happier,” he said.

The Path Forward

Pearson’s insights return to one central truth: predictability fuels prosperity. Investors, entrepreneurs, and workers all thrive when systems are stable and transparent. “Uncertainty kills momentum,” he said. “Predictability builds confidence and confidence drives growth.”

As Nigeria stands at the crossroads of potential and performance, the building blocks are visible: a youthful population, a vast market, creative entrepreneurs, and growing global attention. DHL’s experience, Pearson believes, is proof that progress is possible, with the right reforms.

“Education, infrastructure, digitalisation, sustainability, and regulatory stability, those are the five pillars,” he summarised. “If Nigeria focuses on these, it will move from a story of potential to one of performance.”

He paused, then added with a smile: “At DHL, we don’t just move parcels; we move economies. Nigeria can do the same, not just move goods, but move the entire continent forward.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/John-Pearson.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:17.329765

by Adekunle Agbetiloye (Business Insider Africa) Kenya Airways Plc is taking a bold step to show that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be made and used right in Africa.

Kenya Airways is conducting flights using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends to test local production feasibility.

The first SAF-blend flight operated from Nairobi to Paris, using biofuel made from drought-resistant plants.

SAF production challenges include higher costs and the lack of local supply infrastructure.

Kenya Airways aims to gradually increase SAF usage to 10% across its fleet by 2030.

Kenya Airways Plc is taking a bold step to show that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be made and used right in Africa.

The Nairobi-based airline will operate four return flights between October 14 and 21, each running partly on a SAF blend, as it tests the feasibility of producing the green fuel locally, according to Bloomberg.

The first of these flights took off on Tuesday from Nairobi to Paris, where new European rules require at least 2% SAF on all departing flights. For this journey, the airline used a mix of conventional jet fuel and a locally produced biofuel made from drought-resistant plants such as croton.

Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight in 2023, using biofuel supplied by Italy’s Eni SpA.

But importing SAF is expensive. The green fuel can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and up to five times more for African airlines due to logistics and lack of local supply, according to CEO Allan Kilavuka.

Passengers in Africa are not yet willing to pay extra for lower-carbon flights, Kilavuka said. “so we need to find a way to reduce SAF production costs and hopefully get subsidies from organizations or governments.”

Attracting green capital

Kenya Airways will also operate SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. At European airports, it will refuel with SAF, but the Cape Town return flight will use conventional fuel. The carrier aims to begin with 2% SAF across its fleet and gradually increase to 10% by 2030.

Delta already uses the older Blended Winglets on its 737, 757, and 767 fleets. The new Split Scimitar design features both an upward and downward fin, creating weaker wingtip vortices and delivering up to 2% fuel savings. The upgrade is part of Delta’s wider push to cut emissions and reach net-zero by 2050.

Fuel accounts for one of the airline’s largest costs, and even small improvements can save millions of gallons per year. The carrier has also pledged to expand use of sustainable aviation fuel, modernize its fleet, and invest in new green technologies.

Passengers may not notice the change in design, but the impact on Delta’s carbon footprint could be huge.

Since its inaugural service in 2000, Emirates has flown 2.8 million passengers across fifteen thousand nine hundred flights, connecting Ugandans to more than onevhundred forty-five destinations worldwide through its hub at Dubai International Airport (DXB). The airline commemorated the occasion with a special four-class Boeing 777 flight, showcasing its fully refurbished cabins, including Premium Economy, which made its debut in Uganda. ​

A Milestone in Aviation and Tourism Development

Emirates’ twenty-five-year journey with Uganda exemplifies the airline’s role in driving connectivity and tourism growth across Africa. When Emirates launched its Uganda service in March 2000, flights operated thrice weekly via Nairobi using Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Now, the carrier operates daily direct flights using the larger Boeing 777-300ER, the only aircraft connecting Uganda internationally with a First Class cabin.

The airline’s steady expansion reflects its commitment to understanding market potential. In 2007, the route became fully direct, solidifying Entebbe’s position as one of Emirates’ most important African destinations. The airline later upgraded its service in 2015 to the 777-200LR before transitioning to the flagship 777-300ER that serves the route today, delivering increased capacity and improved passenger comfort. ​

Strengthening Uganda’s Global Tourism Profile

Emirates’ partnership with the Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) has been integral to boosting inbound tourism over the past two years. Through joint campaigns highlighting Uganda’s world-class natural attractions, such as Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Murchison Falls, and the Rwenzori Mountains, the collaboration has promoted the country as a premier eco- and adventure tourism destination.

Since January 2025, passenger traffic on the Dubai–Entebbe route has grown by sixteen percent, with the majority of visitors connecting from key global markets including the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. Uganda’s accessibility to international audiences through Dubai’s global hub has also supported its positioning as a safari and conference destination for Middle Eastern, European, and Asian travellers. ​

Investing in Uganda’s Future

Beyond connecting destinations, Emirates has played an active role in corporate social responsibility initiatives within Uganda. In 2024, the airline’s “Dubai 7s for Good” programme raised UGX 587 million (USD one hundred fifty-five thousand) to improve educational and sports facilities at North Road Primary School in Mbale. The project included building a new rugby pitch, installing sixteen solar-powered water stations, donating sports gear, and supporting environmental sustainability through community engagement.

These projects highlight the airline’s commitment to local development and its role as a corporate citizen in Uganda, simultaneously strengthening goodwill and building long-term partnerships with local stakeholders. ​

Showcasing Emirates’ Four-Class Boeing 777

Celebrating this milestone, Emirates operated a one-off flight to Entebbe on its four-class refurbished Boeing 777-300ER, part of the airline’s USD five billion cabin retrofit programme. The aircraft features Emirates’ new First Class Suites, Business Class, Premium Economy, and Economy Class, offering passengers in Uganda the latest innovations in in-flight luxury and design.

The static tour at Entebbe International Airport allowed VIP guests, including Uganda’s Minister of Works and Transport, General Edward Katumba Wamala, and Fred Bamwesigye, Director General of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority, to explore the aircraft’s updated interiors. From fine-dining settings in Premium Economy to the exquisite lie-flat comfort of First Class, the unveiling signified a preview of the next generation of Emirates services that will gradually expand across global destinations, Uganda included. ​

Collaboration Driving Connectivity

As of October 2025, the Dubai-Entebbe corridor is served by three airlines, Emirates, flydubai, and Uganda Airlines, offering a combined total of twenty weekly flights. Emirates remains the only carrier offering premium First Class cabins, while flydubai provides supplementary frequencies via Dubai Al-Maktoum International Airport. Together, these carriers have strengthened Uganda’s air links with the Middle East, facilitating tourism, trade, and diaspora travel.

The route’s growing performance also supports the broader vision of Emirates to enhance regional connectivity between Africa and Asia, leveraging Dubai’s global status as an aviation nexus. The airline continues to invest in Africa, expanding routes and capacity to meet the continent’s rapidly growing demand for air travel and positioning itself as a key enabler of economic exchange. ​

Sustainability and Future Footprint

Emirates’ long-term vision for Uganda extends beyond capacity growth. The airline is investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships, renewable energy projects, and eco-friendly flight operations. As part of a dollar two hundred million investment commitment, Emirates is advancing research into sustainable propulsion and refining technologies, aligning with the UAE’s “Year of Sustainability” initiative. These efforts underscore the carrier’s pledge to balance environmental accountability with progress in global aviation.

With continuing fleet renewal and upgrades, Uganda will soon join other destinations served by Emirates’ next-generation aircraft and enhanced service offerings, ensuring that Entebbe remains an integral part of the airline’s international portfolio. ​",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emirates-4.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:30.089728

Interisland air travel produces more than 50% of Hawaiʻi’s transportation emissions, and there is no existing technology to cut that to zero.
In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions.
But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

The teens had objected to a draft plan to use the fuel – the airplane equivalent of bio-diesel – as a tool for implementing the settlement, which requires the state to eliminate all carbon emissions related to transportation in Hawaiʻi by 2045.

The settlement involves all forms of transportation, but aviation is the biggest problem. Interisland air travel produces more than 50% of Hawaiʻi’s transportation emissions, and there is no existing technology to cut that to zero.

The state’s plan follows litigation that started in 2022 when a dozen teenagers represented by Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust sued the state, citing their right to a clean and healthful environment.

The suit also called for the department to do a better job working to meet the 2045 deadline, which was previously adopted by the Legislature and mandated by statute.

Gov. Josh Green settled with the teens to fanfare in June 2024.

The settlement called for the Department of Transportation to create a plan to meet the 2045 deadline. In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions. The teen plaintiffs objected, saying the bio-jet fuel wasn’t 100% carbon-free and carried other negative environmental impacts. Instead, they said the state should focus on electric airplanes.

But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The industry says SAF produces 50%-80% less carbon than regular jet fuel.

Last week, the Department of Transportation issued a final plan citing the use of SAF as its main strategy for aviation. The plan — which is part of an ongoing deliberative process that a panel of young residents will be able to participate in — cites a collaboration of the U.S. departments of transportation, energy and agriculture to produce enough SAF by 2050 to replace all traditional jet fuel used in the U.S. The department also said it will support a tax credit for SAF production in Hawaiʻi.

While the department’s final plan calls for numerous airport and air ground service changes to reduce emissions, such as buying more electric service vehicles and buses, the plan tacitly rejects the teens’ push for electric planes. The plan for electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft is limited to a “high-level market study.”

Ultimately, the study says, the goal of “zero emissions” from transportation by 2045 may be unattainable. It points to aviation, large cargo vessels and trucks as the biggest challenges.

While the plan says the department’s goal is to achieve “absolute zero emissions” as soon as possible, it also says, “There are some sectors of the transportation system that will be harder to decarbonize than others, and thus there is a need for interim solutions that are designed to reduce emissions while zero-emission solutions continue to be innovated and developed.”",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2024/08/17124332/240816-dc-Aircraft-6909.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:02:08.745032

Singapur führt grüne Ticketsteuer ein – nur eine Gruppe Reisender muss nicht zahlen

Fliegen ist nicht die sauberste Art zu reisen, das dürfte allen klar sein. Um die Flugemissionen einzudämmen, greift in Singapur, einem der Drehkreuze des internationalen Flugverkehrs, bald eine neue Ticketsteuer.

So unterschiedlich können die Entwicklungen sein: Nachdem vor wenigen Monaten Ryanair Schlagzeilen machte, weil die Airline heimlich die Buchungsoption auf Emissionsausgleich gestrichen hatte – niemand habe sie genutzt, so die Begründung –, geht es in Singapur in die andere Richtung.

Am 14. Oktober hat das Parlament des Stadtstaates der Schaffung einer neuen Ticketsteuer zugestimmt, die ab 2026 viele Reisende betreffen wird. Die Einnahmen aus der neuen Steuer sollen direkt in einen Fonds fließen, aus dem der zentrale Einkauf von nachhaltigem Kerosin – Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – finanziert werden soll.

Durch dieses umweltfreundlichere Kerosin, das aus erneuerbaren Rohstoffen wie Pflanzenölen oder Abfallstoffen hergestellt wird, sollen die CO2-Emissionen im Flugverkehr drastisch gesenkt werden. Singapur will damit nicht nur seine Klimaziele erreichen, sondern auch zu einem Vorreiter in der Luftfahrtbranche werden.

Im kommenden Jahr wird die neue Steuer in Kraft treten. Fluglinien werden dann verpflichtet sein, mindestens ein Prozent SAF zu tanken. Bis 2030 soll der Anteil auf drei bis fünf Prozent steigen.

Singapur mit neuer Ticketsteuer – Transitreisende bleiben verschont

Nur bei einer Gruppe Reisender macht Singapur eine Ausnahme: Transitreisende, die für die nationale Fluggesellschaft Singapore Airlines eine wichtige Einnahmequelle darstellen, sind von der Steuer befreit. Wer in Singapur also nur umsteigt und den Flughafen nicht verlässt, der kann die zusätzlichen Kosten künftig umgehen.

""The Straits Times"", eine Tageszeitung aus Singapur, schlüsselt auf, wie die Steuer je nach Flugdistanz gestaffelt werden soll. Die Angaben gehen demnach auf die Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) zurück:

Der Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) fungiert als globales Drehkreuz zwischen Asien, Australien, Europa, dem Nahen Osten und Nordamerika. Er wurde mehrfach als ""bester Flughafen der Welt"" ausgezeichnet und fertigte im vergangenen Jahr rund 68 Millionen Passagiere und circa 366.000 Starts und Landungen ab. In Bezug auf Passagiervolumen liegt er auf dem vierten Platz der internationalen Flughäfen.","https://www.watson.de/imgdb/1291/Z1200,675/1052507181874222",N,,2025-10-18 19:57:06.837373

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.","A new American airline is taking shape with an ambitious plan to bridge the gap between private jet exclusivity and first-class commercial travel.

Magnifica Air, a Florida-based startup, officially unveiled its concept at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas last week, and if all goes according to plan, the carrier could begin flying passengers by late 2027.

The company’s mission is simple yet bold: to make private-jet-style travel accessible to a wider audience, offering a high-end, all-first-class experience at a fraction of the charter price. Led by CEO Wade Black, Magnifica Air will operate as a Part 121 scheduled carrier and aims to deliver what Black calls “luxury travel that is seamless, personal, and unforgettable.”

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” said Black. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline. This is more than transportation—it’s a movement, redefining how discerning guests experience the skies.”

Luxury Air Travel: Redefining Your Journey

Launch Plans and Fleet Details

Magnifica Air plans to launch with a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. The aircraft are being leased through long-term agreements with Air Lease Corporation (ALC) and Azorra, with deliveries expected to begin in early 2027.

The jets will be sent to Comlux—a Swiss completion specialist known for its work on VIP and head-of-state aircraft—for luxury cabin conversions. These modifications will include hand-crafted seating, adaptive lighting, gourmet dining, and lie-flat first-class suites.

The A220s will feature around 54 lay-flat seats and two private suites, while the A321neos will have 44–46 seats, including four private suites and a rear in-flight lounge. There will be no overhead bins, giving the cabins a spacious, minimalist look more reminiscent of a Gulfstream than a traditional airliner.

“Air Lease is pleased to lease these new Airbus A220s and A321neos to Magnifica Air and be the first to provide brand-new aircraft to the airline,” said David Beker, Executive Vice President of Air Lease Corporation. “Magnifica plans to use them to redefine luxury air travel by making the journey on our aircraft a destination itself.”

The company’s partnership with Azorra also includes the purchase of two ex-EgyptAir A220s. The first will arrive at Comlux’s Indianapolis facility in December 2025 for an 18-month fit-out process, followed by the second in early 2027. Both types will use Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, and while Black acknowledged the previous reliability issues that led EgyptAir to retire the type, he added that the Azorra collaboration “puts us in pretty good shape.”

A Focus on Experience, Personalization, and Wellness

Magnifica’s model borrows elements from hybrid private-commercial aviation providers like JSX and Aero, but aims for a more upscale, personalized approach. Travelers will be picked up by black car service at home, greeted by name, and whisked directly to private terminals. A white-glove concierge will take luggage, and TSA-approved screening will be handled privately.

Guests will arrive just 30 minutes before departure, enjoy curated dining and wellness experiences in private lounges, and board via sprinter van or private ramp walk.

Once onboard, technology will drive personalization. Every guest’s preferences, from favorite meals and seat temperature to lighting and entertainment, will be pre-loaded into the system. Magnifica calls this the “curated journey,” where every touchpoint feels familiar and comfortable.

Upon arrival, baggage will be hand-delivered within 10–15 minutes, chauffeurs will be waiting curbside, and post-flight services will include lounge refresh opportunities and concierge follow-ups.

The airline will also debut “The Seven Club”, a membership-based loyalty program featuring Family and Corporate tiers. Members can choose among four levels—Airspace D, C, B, and A—and enjoy guaranteed fixed pricing, exclusive events, and full-service concierge access.

Sustainability as a Founding Principle

Sustainability is deeply embedded in Magnifica Air’s design philosophy. The airline will be carbon-neutral from day one, integrating over seven million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its annual operations. It plans to start operations with a 50 percent SAF blend and achieve 100 percent SAF usage by 2030.

Beyond fuel, Magnifica will incorporate solar-powered lounges, a carbon offset program, and eventually hybrid-electric aircraft as part of its long-term fleet evolution.

“We don’t think of wellness or sustainability as add-ons,” said Black. “They are built into every layer of the Magnifica Air experience.”

The company will also introduce the world’s first commercial-scale surface purification system and a cabin air humidification system designed to help passengers feel more rested and refreshed after a flight.

Routes, Growth, and the Road Ahead

Magnifica Air expects to obtain its FAA Part 121 certificate by late 2026 and become fully operational by the third quarter of 2027. Initial routes will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Jose, with seasonal service to Napa Valley and, eventually, the Caribbean.

Pricing will reflect the exclusivity. A one-way ticket is expected to cost about twice that of a first-class fare, or roughly $20,000 to $25,000, according to Black. The airline will initially operate six to seven daily departures and expects to grow its fleet to 25 aircraft within four years.

Magnifica Air is backed by $150 million in initial capital from CIG Companies, its renewable energy-focused parent firm, and is currently in talks with additional investor groups.

For now, Magnifica plans to focus on intra-US travel.

“The temptation to fly internationally first provides additional complexity,” Black explained. “We will start domestically, build our program here, and grow from there.”

Magnifica’s long-term vision includes 50 aircraft and a mix of scheduled flights, VIP charters, and curated experience trips tied to major cultural and sporting events like Art Basel and Formula 1.

With predictive safety analytics, a “Collaborative Just Culture” for employees, and one spare aircraft for every four in service, Black says the airline is “designed for resilience and consistency.”

And while others have tried to launch luxury carriers before, he believes Magnifica Air’s foundation is stronger. “Previous entrants weren’t properly capitalized,” he said. “We are.”

Magnifica Air Will Give the Ultra-Premium Segment a Brand New Way to Fly

Magnifica Air is positioning itself as a hybrid between Gulfstream comfort and Delta reliability, blending high-touch hospitality with large-aircraft economics. Its promise is not just to move passengers from city to city, but to make the journey itself the destination.

In that sense, Magnifica Air draws obvious comparisons to JSX, another US operator that has carved out a niche with private-terminal service and crowd-free flying. But while JSX uses converted Embraer regional jets seating 30 passengers, Magnifica is taking a different route by using larger Airbus A220s and A321neos with spacious cabins that allow for lie-flat seating, private suites, and dedicated lounges on board.

CEO Wade Black believes this difference in scale and design will set Magnifica apart. “I’ve always felt like smaller regional jets weren’t the right platform for what we’re trying to do,” he said during a press briefing at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas. “Space is part of the experience. You can’t deliver true luxury in a cabin that feels tight.”

By marrying the comfort and personalization of private aviation with the operational scope of a major airline, Magnifica Air aims to occupy a new space in the US market: one that sits above first class but below private charter, appealing to travelers who value privacy, efficiency, and indulgence in equal measure.

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?","One of the world's most iconic carriers, Delta Air Lines, continues to invest in its aircraft capabilities and performance. The Atlanta-based carrier favors Split Scimitar Wingletson its Boeing 737-800 and 737-900ER airplanes. This is through a partnership with Avition Partners Boeing (also known as APB), which develops an upgrade to the current APB ubiquitous Blended Winglet.

The move is expected to improve not only overall fuel efficiency but also deliver savings in the overall consumption of aviation jet fuel and improve the carriers' operational efficiency. Delta already operates one of the largest airline fleets in the world and has an extensive network of domestic and international flights from its various US hubs.

APB Winglet Products At Delta

The decision to add Split Scimitar Winglets to the carrier's 737 family of aircraft comes at a time when the airline had already installed the APB winglet products on a range of its current fleet, albeit the ubiquitous Blended Winglets. These are currently flying on the Boeing 737-800, 737-900ER, 757-200, 757-300, and Boeing 767-300ER.

Currently, the ubiquitous Blended Winglets are a widespread wingtip device, which is common across most modern aircraft. These winglets support a smooth transition across the wing while reducing drag. This provides improved fuel efficiency and, as a result, adds additional range for the aircraft.

As a comparison, Split Scimitar Winglets feature both an upward and downward pointing fin, which creates a weaker vortex on the wing tip, resulting in improved fuel efficiency, reduced drag, and, as a result, a significant reduction in the overall carbon emissions of each flight.

Ubiquitous Blended Winglets

These are designed with one upward fin and are a common sight on popular aircraft around the world, including the Boeing 737, 757, and 767. The design is smooth and features curved extensions that blend right onto the wing's edge. These have been engineered to reduce drag by reducing the formation of the airplane's wingtip vortices. These vortices are swirling air masses that create aircraft drag.

The smooth design allows a more aerodynamic aircraft, which has been shown to increase the operating aircraft's fuel efficiency, which, as a collective result, will save airlines billions of dollars in annual operating costs. Not only will they save airlines in their pocket, but also ensure the plane's longitudinal and directional stability, which allows the aircraft to handle smoother landings, especially in wild weather such as high winds.

The Ubiquitous Blended Winglets were first introduced in the early 2000s and have been installed and adopted on aircraft around the world. Developed by Aviation Partners, the manufacturer first installed these onto the 737, and subsequently, they are now a feature on new aircraft at the assembly line, but can also be retrofitted onto existing aircraft.

Split Scimitar Winglets

First certified in 2014, Aviation Partners' joint venture with Boeing allowed a blended winglet design, which was first offered on the 737NG. Its success led to similar designs being developed for the 757 and 767. The split scimitar is designed with an aerodynamically shaped cap, with a ventral strake that extends downwards. This is proven to save more fuel, add additional range, and even increase in overall payload.

The dual-blade design is unlike normal standard winglets, given its upward and downward blades that optimize airflow. The design allows the plane to create a weaker vortex, lowering the overall drag of the airplane. This has resulted in increased fuel savings, as planes are shown to lower fuel burn by 1.6% to 2.2% per aircraft. This enhanced performance stimulates fuel savings for airlines, given their increased payload and better operational performance.

Many of the world's largest airlines have already adopted these winglet designs, with Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair, being one of the biggest adopters of the split scimitar winglet. Other airlines, such as United Airlines and Qantas, have also led to the retrofit of these on existing aircraft, while accepting new deliveries of planes with these already installed. Aeromexico also has the Split Scimitar winglets on its Boeing 737-800 fleet.

Other Carriers' Adoption Of The Split Scimitar Winglet

United Airlines invested in the split scimitar winglet due to the attraction of increased fuel efficiency, which would, as a result, mean lower operational costs. The design provides around 2% of fuel savings, and is fully implemented across the carrier's 737, 757, and 767 fleet. The lower emissions mean that these planes are now more fuel-efficient, improving the airline's carbon footprint.

Qantas Airways, the flag carrier of Australia, also opted for the split scimitar in a bid to improve its fuel burn across its 737-800 aircraft fleet. The significant savings expected from these will lead to a significant annual fuel saving for the airline's balance sheet. The carrier program of work to install the split scimitar winglet at Qantas is expected to run through until some stage in 2026.

This retrofit at Qantas will see the fleet of its narrowbody Boeing 737s have its winglets gradually replaced, cementing these popular aircraft into the next decade of operations. The red-tailed airline is fitting the winglets on all 23 of its Boeing 737-800s. These aircraft are deployed on domestic routes, while also providing capacity on short-haul international services such as to New Zealand, Indonesia, and other South Pacific nations.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?

Atlanta-based Delta is investing in the development and installation of split scimitar winglets, in a bid to not only help improve the fuel efficiency of its Boeing 737 aircraft, but also lower the airline's carbon footprint. These winglets achieve improved operational efficiency due to their design being reshaped in the traditional blended design. Reduction in drag is a big factor for airlines being able to improve operational handling, as high-pressure air spills onto the lower pressure of the tip.

This creates vortices that sap energy from the jet, but the downward strakes weaken these vortices, so, compared to blended winglets, this design is far superior. With Delta looking to improve its efficiency, this also supports its goal of reducing its carbon emissions, reminding the industry that it remains committed to finding ways to develop cleaner, greener ways to fly. Delta has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and is striving to do so through the initiatives detailed below.

The maximized efficiency produces long-haul savings, with the airplanes being able to operate longer flights, which is why we are now seeing the carrier introduce the 737-900ER and 737-800 on longer services. Given that fuel is a major operating cost for airlines, these improvements result in billions of dollars shaved off carriers' yearly fuel bill.

What's Next?

While Delta partnered with Aviation Partners in 2015, the latest move to acquire additional APB winglet products is evident in the carrier's dedication to ensuring sustainable air travel. There is a solid environmental argument for this investment, with the winglets reducing overall fuel consumption on any aircraft that has the split scimitar or even blended winglet fitted. Delta Air Lines is one of the world's largest airlines and one of America's 'Big Three' carriers.

The new partnership will see benefits that not only trickle to the airline's bottom line, but also to the passengers' tickets. Understanding the economics of fuel reduction and optimized performance should result in lower operating costs for the airline, meaning cheaper airfares for travelers.

The split scimitar winglet will see Delta reduce its overall per passenger emission while improving the overall onboard experience, not just in feel-good factor, but also lower the effects of strong jet streams and air vortices that can affect the enjoyment of the flight, but also reduce the amount of carbon emissions that the aircraft would have once produced when carrying more drag.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blended-winglets-are-great-but-delta-air-lines-thinks-these-winglets-are-better.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:56:36.829724

Ini adalah langkah teknologi dan lingkungan yang cukup berani di tengah upaya global pengurangan emisi.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adalah bahan bakar pesawat yang dibuat dari sumber non-fosil seperti :

minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil),

limbah pertanian,

lemak hewan,

biomassa, atau bahkan

karbon daur ulang dari atmosfer (melalui teknologi carbon capture).

Berbeda dari avtur konvensional yang berasal dari minyak bumi, SAF dapat mengurangi emisi karbon hingga 80% selama siklus hidupnya, tergantung pada bahan baku dan proses produksinya.

Detail Informasi :

Pertamina, perusahaan energi milik negara, sudah mulai memproduksi SAF dari minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil/UCO) dan merencanakan konversi dua kilang agar kapasitas produksinya naik.

Pemerintah menyusun regulasi untuk implementasi awal 1% SAF pada 2026, dengan target peningkatan bertahap menjadi hingga 5% pada 2035.

Potensi produksi UCO di Indonesia cukup besar: diperkirakan 3-4 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Mengapa Ini Penting :

Teknologi & Lingkungan: Penggunaan SAF merupakan integrasi teknologi energi baru dan pengurangan emisi untuk sektor penerbangan yang selama ini sulit dikurangi.

Industri dan Produksi Lokal: Pemanfaatan UCO sebagai bahan baku membuka peluang ekonomi baru, meningkatkan nilai tambah limbah, serta memperkuat rantai industri domestik.

Posisi Indonesia di Kancah Global: Langkah ini menunjukkan kesiapan Indonesia untuk masuk dalam arus teknologi energi bersih dan menjadi bagian dari solusi global perubahan iklim.

Kesiapan Infrastruktur & Regulasi: Regulasi baru dan konversi kilang menunjukkan bahwa aspek teknologi dan kebijakan sedang digarap bersamaan — bukan hanya janji tapi juga tindakan.

Tantangan dan Catatan :

Menerapkan SAF tinggi-teknologi masih menghadapi kendala seperti harga produksi, efisiensi proses, dan regulasi yang siap pakai.

Meski potensi UCO besar, logistik pengumpulan, pengolahan, dan standar mutu SAF harus dijaga agar kualitasnya layak untuk penerbangan.

Industri penerbangan dan maskapai harus bersiap dengan infrastruktur baru (misalnya, penyimpanan, distribusi SAF) dan perubahan operasional.

Kenaikan dari 1% ke target 5% hingga 2035 menunjukkan bahwa ini adalah perjalanan panjang, bukan solusi instan.

Langkah untuk menerapkan 1% SAF pada 2026 adalah langkah teknologi strategis yang menggabungkan inovasi energi, lingkungan, dan industri. Meski masih banyak tantangan, ini memberi sinyal bahwa Indonesia tidak hanya menjadi pengguna teknologi, tetapi juga bisa menjadi pionir di kawasan untuk penerapan teknologi “bersih” di sektor penerbangan.(FA)",https://ifakta.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2648.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:47.688281
