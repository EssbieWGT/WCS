As airlines worldwide intensify efforts to achieve ambitious decarbonization targets, the sector confronts significant obstacles. In particular, fragmented and costly government policies—especially across Europe—have hindered SAF production and escalated costs. Industry leaders warn that these regulatory complexities threaten to undermine the aviation sector’s capacity to scale SAF usage, jeopardizing progress toward net-zero emissions by 2050.

Challenges in SAF Production and Distribution

FlyORO, a Singapore-based technology company, is at the forefront of addressing these challenges by developing novel approaches to SAF distribution. The firm’s patented modular blending units can be deployed flexibly from production sites to airports, facilitating a more distributed and responsive delivery network. McLoughlin underscores that while much of the industry’s focus remains on SAF production, significant difficulties persist downstream in the supply chain. Without localized and adaptable solutions, he cautions, the sector risks creating disparities between airports—some gaining access to SAF while others are left behind.

The global SAF landscape remains uneven. Europe continues to struggle with policy fragmentation, impeding cohesive growth. In contrast, Asia currently stands as the only region experiencing tangible expansion in SAF capacity. Australia, despite recent momentum in its SAF transition, still lacks the structural certainty, coordinated government support, and clear investment signals necessary to establish a sustainable domestic industry. Aviation leaders in Australia emphasize that without these foundational elements, the country will face considerable challenges in building a viable SAF supply chain.

Emerging Pressures and Solutions

Compounding these issues is the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technologies, whose soaring energy demands increasingly compete for the same renewable energy resources required for SAF production. This competition poses a further risk to airlines’ sustainability ambitions.

In response to these complexities, demand is rising for SAF certificates and greater flexibility in accounting for Scope 3 emissions. McLoughlin highlights the critical role of robust traceability and the “book-and-claim” system, which enables airlines to claim environmental benefits from SAF even when physical delivery is not feasible. He argues that this mechanism is essential for scaling SAF demand and maintaining credibility, as it complements physical deployment with transparent and accountable tracking.

While experts acknowledge that the aviation industry is unlikely to meet its 2030 targets for sustainable fuel adoption, innovations such as FlyORO’s modular blending technology and an emphasis on traceable, flexible supply chains offer promising avenues.

The upgrade applies to one of four daily services and will be operated by the Airbus A350 Long Haul, improving comfort and consistency for passengers connecting on ultra-long-haul itineraries.

Singapore Airlines A350 Brisbane Flights

From 1 November 2026, Singapore Airlines will upgrade the SQ265/266 rotation between Singapore (SIN) and Brisbane (BNE) from the Airbus A350 Medium Haul to the Airbus A350 Long Haul configuration.

Advertisement

This aircraft features the airline’s 2013 long-haul Business Class seats and a dedicated Premium Economy cabin.

According to Mainly Miles, this marks the first time since October 2022 that Brisbane will again receive Singapore Airlines’ long-haul cabin products, which were a regular feature on at least one daily service prior to the pandemic.

While overall seat capacity on the route will fall by approximately four percent, Business Class capacity will increase.

The A350 Long Haul’s premium-heavy layout adds 14 additional Business Class seats per week in each direction compared to the Medium Haul configuration.

Aircraft Assignment and Operational Shift

The change represents a clear operational shift. In both 2022 and pre-pandemic operations, the 3-class Airbus A350 Long Haul aircraft was assigned to the SQ245/246 service. From November 2026, this designation moves to SQ265/266.

The SQ265/266 rotation is notable as it was the final Brisbane frequency to be restored to daily service following the pandemic. The flight was upgraded from four weekly services to daily operation in mid-June 2025.

Brisbane’s Long-Haul Cabin History

In 2018, Singapore Airlines operated all four daily Brisbane services with long-haul Business Class seating, using either the 2013 Business Class product or the now-retired 2006 configuration.

These seats were progressively replaced by the Regional Business Class product from 2018 onward.

Although technically newer, the regional seat is narrower and is widely regarded by passengers as less comfortable than the older long-haul design. The return of the A350 Long Haul therefore, represents a qualitative improvement rather than a simple fleet substitution.

Daily Schedule from 1 November 2026

Singapore Airlines will operate four daily flights in each direction between Singapore and Brisbane. All services operate every day.

Singapore to Brisbane

Brisbane to Singapore

This structure provides a daytime service from Singapore to Brisbane with an evening return, supporting both local demand and onward connectivity.

Connectivity for Ultra-Long-Haul Passengers

The timing of SQ265 and SQ266 is optimized for long-haul connections via Singapore.

Inbound connections to SQ265 include arrivals from London Gatwick, London Heathrow, Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich, Rome, Johannesburg, and Cape Town, alongside selected services from India and China.

Outbound connections from SQ266 include London Heathrow, Zurich, Rome, Manchester, Johannesburg, Cape Town, and multiple destinations across India and North Asia.

Many passengers on these itineraries undertake journeys exceeding 22 hours. The availability of long-haul Business Class and Premium Economy on the Brisbane sector eliminates the current downgrade in comfort experienced by connecting passengers.

Strategic Importance

Singapore is Brisbane Airport’s second-busiest international route after Auckland. In 2024, Brisbane Airport CEO Gert-Jan de Graaff stated that more than half of all visitors from India to Brisbane traveled via Singapore Airlines.

Indian nationals were the largest group of non-Australian passport holders arriving in Brisbane on Singapore Airlines flights in 2024, followed by Singaporean and British travelers. This highlights the airline’s critical role in Queensland’s inbound tourism market.

KrisFlyer Award Redemption Rates

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer members can redeem miles for one-way flights between Singapore and Brisbane at the following rates per person:

Taxes and fees apply in addition to mileage and typically total around S$102 from Singapore to Brisbane and S$97 in the return direction.

These amounts are higher than many other routes due to Australia’s international arrival and departure taxes.

Redemptions made on or after 1 April 2026, for travel on or after 1 October 2026, will also incur Singapore’s new Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy on this route.

New Closed-Door Business Class Suites

Singapore Airlines plans to introduce its new closed-door Business Class suites on the Airbus A350 Long Haul from the second quarter of 2026.

The airline aims to complete the full fleet retrofit by late 2030, although similar programs have historically taken longer than initially projected.

While Brisbane may not be among the first destinations to receive the new seats, continued A350 Long Haul deployment positions the route alongside Sydney and Melbourne, both of which already see flights operated by this aircraft type.

Bottom Line

Singapore Airlines’ decision to restore long-haul cabin products on the Singapore–Brisbane route from November 2026 strengthens the route’s appeal for premium and long-haul travelers.

The upgrade of SQ265/266 to the Airbus A350 Long Haul reintroduces Premium Economy and increases Business Class capacity.

For passengers connecting between Australia, Europe, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, the change delivers consistent comfort across the entire journey.

Compared with 2018, when all four daily flights featured long-haul seating, this represents a measured but meaningful step toward rebuilding Brisbane’s long-haul product offering.

KISSIMMEE, Fla., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ECD Automotive Design, Inc. (“ECD” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ECDA), the world’s largest Land Rover and Jaguar restoration company known for its custom luxury builds, including bespoke Defenders, Range Rovers, Jaguar E-Types, Ford Mustangs and Toyota FJs, announced that it will implement a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (“Reverse Stock Split”), effective at market opening time on December 26, 2025. ECD common stock will remain on the Nasdaq Capital Market and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the markets open on December 26, 2025, under the Company’s existing trading symbol “ECDA,” with the new CUSIP number 27877D302.

The Reverse Stock Split was previously approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on July 22, 2025, with the final ratio determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the per share trading price of ECD’s common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Rule 550(a)(1)).

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every five pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically be reclassified and combined into one share of common stock. This will reduce the number of outstanding shares of ECD’s common stock from approximately 6,925,006 shares to approximately 1,385,002 shares. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the number of authorized shares of the company’s common stock or the par value of the common stock. Proportional adjustments will be made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the company’s outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, as well as the applicable exercise price of the stock options.

Shareholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive the post-split shares. Shareholders who hold certificated shares will receive instructions from Continental Stock Transfer and Trust, the Company’s transfer agent who is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share will instead have their fractional share rounded up to the nearest whole share.

Additional information regarding the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Proxy Statement filed with the SEC.

SKOKIE, Ill., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and Chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

The sustainable aviation fuel industry remains capital-intensive and subject to evolving regulatory and market dynamics. LanzaJet, like many in the sector, is managing operational and financial pressures as it scales. LanzaTech’s increased equity interest does not imply a change in governance or control.

LanzaTech and LanzaJet continue to collaborate on new projects and licensing opportunities via their CirculAir™ offering, leveraging the strengths of both organizations to work towards delivering new energy solutions and driving lasting impact in the aviation industry.

Accounting Impact of Transaction

The Company’s interest in LanzaJet is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with income (loss) from equity method investments, net, including gain on dilution, recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and equity method investments recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

About LanzaTech

LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) is a carbon management solutions company that transforms industrial emissions, gasified solid waste and carbon dioxide into recycled carbon ethanol via proprietary bio-fermentation technology. Ethanol is a crucial building block in the world – a key feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine fuel and other downstream chemical derivatives. Operating commercially at six assets today, LanzaTech’s technology unlocks value across the supply chain, reducing the carbon footprint of hard-to-abate sectors while shepherding recycled carbon fuels and products to the world, building a circular carbon economy. www.lanzatech.com

EDISON, N.J., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (""Eos"" or the “Company”) an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced that Russ Stidolph, who has served as non-executive Chair since April 2018 and whose firm, AltEnergy, LLC, has been a lead investor in Eos for the past eleven years, has decided to step down from the Board of Directors, effective December 31, 2025, to focus his efforts, full time, on AltEnergy Acquisition Corp. The Board has appointed Joseph Nigro to succeed Stidolph as non-executive Chair, effective January 1, 2026.

“I am proud to have played an integral role in guiding Eos from an early-stage research and development company into a scaled leader of stationary energy storage. When AltEnergy first invested in Eos, the Company built prototype battery cells that to this day cycle twice daily. Watching that product then successfully be piloted in the field, establishing a U.S. manufacturing strategy, building a robust pipeline and backlog and successfully deploying over 5 GWh of operations in the field are accomplishments I will always be proud of,” stated Stidolph. “Bringing Joe Nigro onto the Board earlier this year, with his more than three decades of global energy, utility, and infrastructure experience, positioned Eos for a seamless leadership transition to its next phase of operations and growth.”

Stidolph played a foundational role in Eos’ evolution from its early commercialization efforts to its NASDAQ listing and growth into a scaled American manufacturer. Stidolph has been one of Eos’ earliest and most enduring champions – first as an investor more than a decade ago and later as a Director and Chair.

“Without Russ’ leadership, there would be no Eos,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “From bringing the required capital along with always recognizing the long-term potential of Eos to recruiting me to the Company, Russ has been instrumental in getting us to where we stand today and we are grateful for his leadership and the many contributions he has made to Eos’ evolution.”

“Russ leaves Eos with a strong foundation for the future,” said Nigro. “His leadership and continued investment allowed Eos to innovate, commercialize, and build one of the most advanced long-duration storage manufacturing platforms in the country. We are grateful for his steady leadership, partnership, and the many contributions he has made to Eos’ development.”

Proposed acquisition will add direct mortgage lending capabilities to complement the Company’s existing mortgage brokerage operations

Expected to close in the first half of 2026 following regulatory approval

DUBLIN, Ohio, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- reAlpha Tech Corp. (Nasdaq: AIRE) (the “Company” or “reAlpha”), an AI-powered real estate technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire InstaMortgage Inc. (“InstaMortgage”), an independent mortgage lender.

reAlpha currently operates a mortgage brokerage. The proposed acquisition is intended to complement reAlpha’s existing mortgage brokerage operations by adding direct mortgage lending capabilities and extending reAlpha’s footprint into additional key markets, and enabling greater alignment between brokerage and lending workflows to support a more coordinated borrower experience across the mortgage process.

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in San Jose, California, InstaMortgage is an originations-focused mortgage lender specializing in purchase and refinance loans. Through its technology-enabled platform and experienced lending team, InstaMortgage has helped more than 3,500 borrowers secure residential mortgage financing across 32 states, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, which would be new markets for reAlpha. InstaMortgage has reported more than $4 billion over the past five years and has received multiple recognitions, being named by the Financial Times as one of America's Fastest-Growing Companies, and being included on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 and Inc.’s Inc. 500 list of fastest-growing private companies.

“This agreement is about building the operating system for modern homebuying,” said Mike Logozzo, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha. “Buyers don’t experience brokerage, lending, and closing as separate categories. They experience one process where clarity and execution matter. Following the completion of the acquisition, InstaMortgage will bring direct lending infrastructure and multi-state licensing that fits our platform strategy. When combined with our existing mortgage brokerage, it will position us to further reduce friction across handoffs and deliver a more coordinated experience, while operating with the discipline this industry demands.”

“Once completed, this transaction will materially expand our mortgage business capabilities,"" said Jamie Cavanaugh, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha Mortgage. “A direct lender platform will give us another execution path alongside brokerage and support tighter workflow alignment from intake through closing.”

Shashank Shekhar, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of InstaMortgage, said, “We built InstaMortgage with a clear focus: deliver a modern origination experience powered by strong operators and a digital-first process. reAlpha’s vision for an integrated AI-powered homebuying platform aligns with how we see the market evolving, and we’re excited about what this could mean for borrowers, loan officers, and partners as we work toward closing.”

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, reAlpha would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of InstaMortgage for total consideration of approximately $8.5 million, payable in a combination of cash and reAlpha common stock, including deferred consideration, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. reAlpha expects to fund the cash portion of the consideration from cash on hand at the appropriate time, subject to closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 following the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

For additional details regarding the terms of the agreement, please refer to the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2025.

LanzaTech Global ( (LNZA) ) has shared an announcement.

On December 22, 2025, LanzaTech Global announced that its ownership in sustainable aviation fuel specialist LanzaJet, Inc. had risen to 53% from about 36%, after receiving final tranches of LanzaJet common stock on December 16, 2025 under a pre‑existing investment agreement that required no new capital outlay and leaves governance and control unchanged. The move follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM‑certified sustainable fuels, including SPK and renewable diesel, at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia—the first commercial‑scale plant to make jet fuel from ethanol—and underscores LanzaTech’s strategic focus on scaling ethanol‑to‑jet technology, leveraging diverse waste‑ and agriculture‑based feedstocks to cut aviation emissions, bolster energy security and rural economies, while LanzaJet continues to face the capital‑intensive, regulation‑sensitive realities of the sustainable aviation fuel market and remains accounted for as an equity‑method, non‑controlling investment.

The most recent analyst rating on (LNZA) stock is a Sell with a $14.50 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on LanzaTech Global stock, see the LNZA Stock Forecast page.

Spark’s Take on LNZA Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, LNZA is a Underperform.

LanzaTech Global’s overall stock score is primarily impacted by its poor financial performance, characterized by declining revenues, high leverage, and negative cash flows. The technical analysis indicates a bearish trend, further weighing down the score. Valuation metrics are unfavorable, with a negative P/E ratio and no dividend yield. While there are positive corporate developments, they are not sufficient to offset the significant financial and technical challenges.

SKOKIE, Ill., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

(NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

This year marked the point where hydrogen transportation stopped being a future tense conversation and became an accounting exercise. Across light duty vehicles, buses, trucks, trains, mining equipment, refueling infrastructure, and even aviation, withdrawals outpaced commitments. These were not isolated pilots failing at the margins. They were coordinated retreats spread across continents, business models, and political systems. Most were announced quietly through strategy updates, end of week disclosures, or year end statements framed as focus or discipline. Taken together, they form a coherent pattern of abandonment driven by operational reality rather than ideology.

In light duty transportation, hydrogen failed completely as demand collapsed. The French hydrogen taxi firm Hype ended hydrogen operations entirely and moved to battery electric vehicles. Global fuel cell car sales fell to near zero outside South Korea. South Korea remained an outlier only because vehicles were subsidized at roughly 50% to 60% and hydrogen fuel received direct support. Hydrogen refueling stations closed across Europe, North America, and Asia. California stations experienced outages, rationing, and closures that undermined now almost non-existent consumer trust. Automakers stopped marketing fuel cell cars in most markets without issuing formal exit statements. The absence of new city or fleet commitments was more telling than any individual cancellation.

Heavy trucks were supposed to be hydrogen’s strongest case. Long distances, high payloads, and centralized depots were repeatedly cited as advantages. Reality moved in the opposite direction. Fuel cell heavy truck sales declined globally while battery electric heavy truck deployments surged, especially in China. Chinese fleets adopted battery electric trucks at scale for port drayage, construction haulage, and regional freight. Meanwhile, major manufacturers including Stellantis, GM, Daimler, Honda, and MAN withdrew from hydrogen truck programs, sometimes with a face-saving statement about deferring them. Startups built around hydrogen trucking collapsed. Hyzon, Nikola, and Quantron entered bankruptcy along with a long tail of suppliers and integrators. Cummins initiated a strategic assessment of its hydrogen business, a signal that further contraction is likely. Bosch reduced emphasis on hydrogen mobility while shifting investment toward electrification. No hydrogen truck platform reached sustained serial production. At the same time, battery electric trucks demonstrated daily freight operations with predictable costs and maintenance regimes. Fleets chose vehicles that arrived, worked, and stayed in service.

Public transit exposed hydrogen’s operating cost problem more clearly than any other segment. Cities learned that capital grants did not solve fuel and maintenance risk. Dijon abandoned hydrogen bus acquisitions after committing real capital and infrastructure. Van Hool, heavily exposed to hydrogen buses, went bankrupt. McPhy, a supplier of hydrogen fueling and electrolysis systems tied to bus deployments, collapsed, leaving stranded assets. In Poland, 26 cities that had bought or were buying hydrogen buses appealed to the national government for emergency fuel subsidies after discovering that hydrogen prices were far higher than expected. Similar dynamics played out across Europe and North America as transit agencies paused or canceled hydrogen procurements. Canada improved its zero emission transit fund, and in the process eliminated the sole-source advisory role for a think tank that kept inserting hydrogen into fleet plans through modeling tricks and bad data. Battery electric buses delivered predictable energy costs, simpler maintenance, and higher availability. Transit agencies reverted to technologies that fit their budgets and workforce skills.

Rail was another sector where hydrogen was framed as unavoidable. The claim was that lightly used or rural lines could not justify electrification. In practice, hydrogen trains added complexity without solving infrastructure constraints. Lower Saxony reduced its hydrogen train operations with only a fraction of the original fleet remaining active and dropped plans to acquire more. Alstom dropped hydrogen trains from its product focus after years of promotion. In the United Kingdom, hydrogen traction quietly disappeared from rail planning. India hit 99.2% heavy rail electrification with overhead wires. Switzerland and Austria reaffirmed electrification strategies and battery assisted solutions for non electrified segments. Rail operators favored overhead wires, partial electrification, and batteries because they reduced operating risk and fit existing maintenance models. Hydrogen trains failed to demonstrate reliability or cost advantages at scale.

The same pattern played out on water. Hydrogen ferries and marine vessels have delivered a small number of demonstration projects over the past few years that featured higher capital costs, higher operating costs, and in many cases higher lifecycle emissions once upstream hydrogen production was included. Hydrogen storage displaced payload and passenger space, bunkering infrastructure failed to appear at scale, and utilization rates remained low. Hydrogen marine projects depended on subsidies and novelty rather than economics and did not progress beyond pilots. In contrast, battery electric vessels moved rapidly from demonstration to deployment. Electric ferries scaled across Norway, Europe, China, and North America on fixed routes with high utilization, supported by declining battery costs and straightforward shore power infrastructure. Orders for 2,100 passenger pure electric ferries were booked. Battery electric container ships also entered service in Europe and China on short sea and inland routes, with ports installing megawatt scale charging and containerized battery swapping to support high frequency operations. Installed battery capacity in marine vessels increased year over year, while hydrogen activity remained flat or declined as projects were canceled or quietly reframed as research. In marine transport, as on land, hydrogen delivered higher costs and worse emissions profiles without market growth, while battery electric systems expanded because they worked.

Off road and industrial mobility removed one of hydrogen’s last rhetorical defenses. Mining, construction, and port equipment were often cited as sectors where batteries would struggle. Fortescue formally abandoned hydrogen plans and ordered billions of dollars of battery electric mining trucks and equipment. Construction equipment manufacturers advanced electrified platforms without hydrogen pilots. Ports electrified yard tractors, cranes, material handling equipment and tugs rather than pursuing hydrogen. Even in remote and heavy duty applications, electricity proved easier to manage than compressed hydrogen. Maintenance, energy delivery, and system efficiency favored electrification.

Refueling infrastructure collapsed in parallel with vehicle demand. Shell exited the hydrogen refueling station business entirely. BP closed its hydrogen fuels division. Stations shut down across Europe, North America, and China. Japan saw declining utilization rates despite long standing national support. No private capital stepped in to replace oil major investment. Hydrogen stations had no secondary economic use and could not be repurposed easily. Infrastructure built ahead of demand remained idle while operating costs accumulated. Without vehicles, stations closed. Without stations, vehicles had no reason to exist.

Corporate balance sheets confirmed what deployments already showed. Fuel cell manufacturers focused on transportation bled cash at accelerating rates. Ballard Power, Plug Power, and FuelCell Energy reported ongoing losses, shrinking backlogs, and geographic retrenchment. Firms like Lhyfe continued their fiscal delivery of massive losses and declining cash reserves, along with rhetorical claims of success, while the reality is staff layoffs, cost cutting, and geographical and segment retrenchment. Reverse stock splits were used to maintain listings as share prices fell. Venture capital avoided hydrogen transportation startups. Project finance dried up even where government guarantees existed. Revenues increasingly came from non transportation segments or one off contracts. Public markets reflected operational reality rather than long term narratives.

Aviation marked the final symbolic retreat. Airbus shelved its hydrogen aviation programs after years of promotional work. Hydrogen aviation startup ZeroAvia continues to burn cash without delivering any certified aircraft, missing its 2025 target and laying off needed staff on both sides of the Atlantic this year. Hydrogen aircraft were always speculative to the point of being science fiction, dependent on breakthroughs in storage, weight, and infrastructure. As costs and timelines became clearer, even symbolic long term bets were abandoned. Aviation attention returned to efficiency improvements and sustainable aviation fuel pathways that align with existing aircraft and infrastructure, as well as hybrid and fully electric aircraft.

None of this should have been surprising. Hydrogen transportation suffers from efficiency losses at every conversion step. Electricity must be generated, converted to hydrogen, compressed or liquefied, transported, stored, and converted back to electricity or mechanical energy. Each step adds cost, complexity, and energy loss. Capital requirements are high and operating costs volatile. Fuel delivery involves specialized equipment, safety constraints, and leakage risk. Institutions rewarded announcements and pilot projects rather than delivered outcomes. Subsidy uptake was treated as validation rather than a warning sign. Sunk cost bias, prestige projects, and salience effects kept programs alive longer than performance justified.

Hydrogen remains a necessary industrial feedstock that has to be decarbonized, a climate change problem on the scale of all of aviation. It does not function as a general purpose transportation energy carrier. The past year tested the proposition across every major vehicle class, geography, and subsidy regime. The results were consistent. This was not corruption or incompetence. It was systems reality asserting itself.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_j7276hj7276hj727-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-22 17:57:18.862395

This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork,” said Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii.
“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James.","Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines on Dec. 17 announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai’i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai‘i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaiʻi’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy. Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi’s energy independence,” said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines.

“We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai‘i’s transportation needs. We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean energy goals,” said Ed Sniffen, director, Hawai‘i State Department of Transportation.

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai‘i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai‘i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels. By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai‘i’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai‘i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions,” said Chris Bennett, vice president of sustainable energy solutions at Pono Pacific Land Management LLC.

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai‘i’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai‘i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly. With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork,” said Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii.

“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James.

“This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai’i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Biomass_updated_Logo_8d3314e0ca.png,N,,2025-12-22 17:57:23.121725

Through the end of the year, The Bedford Citizen will be sharing recaps of some of the major stories in town from 2025. The stories are in no particular order.

Happenings at Hanscom Field in 2025 included potential hangar expansion, the suspension and resumption of ICE flights at the facility and environmental matters.

About a year after a draft environmental impact report (DEIR) for the development of a proposed hangar complex at Hanscom Field was submitted but deemed unsatisfactory by Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper, community members continued voicing their opposition to the project, with some calling on their elected representatives to step in and stop the expansion due to environmental impact concerns.

In February, Kathy Kerby called the proposed hangar expansion – commonly referred to as the North Airfield development – a “climate bomb in sheep’s clothing,” urging the community to not let the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), who owns Hanscom Field, “pull the wool over our eyes.”

In March, Janet Rothrock of the First Parish in Concord and Sue Swanson of Bedford, a member of Episcopal Creation Care Justice Network in Massachusetts, called on Gov. Maura Healey to stop the project, stating that faith communities throughout the region were concerned that the proposed expansion would “intensify both the climate crisis and environmental injustice impacts.”

That same month, Warren Senders also urged Healey to stop the proposed expansion, calling it “a recipe for inequality and irresponsibility.”

A State House rally was held in April in an effort to publicize and stop the proposed expansion. At the rally, a letter from more than 40 historians, scientists, and climate and environmental advocates was delivered to Healey, urging her to “preserve the area’s endangered historic sites and protect the climate by halting the proposed private jet hangar expansion at Hanscom [Field].”

That same month, Lori Etringer of the Bedford chapter of Mothers Out Front thanked state Sen. Michael Barrett for sentiments he shared at the rally. Etringer said Barrett described the proposed expansion as “the worst conjoining of wealth disparity and climate destructiveness.”

In May, climate activist Brian Okum was acquitted in Concord District Court on charges of felony malicious destruction of property more than $1,200 and disorderly conduct in relation to an April 2024 protest of the proposed expansion at Hanscom Field. Okum was convicted on a trespassing count and sentenced to one year of probation.

The advocacy group Extinction Rebellion organized the protest, and police arrested Okum and 20 others after they allegedly breached a secure area at the airport. Roughly 50 police officers responded, according to court testimony, and the incident disrupted activity at Hanscom Field for roughly 3 1/2 hours.

Navy Hangar Activity

Potential use of the Navy hangar space on Hartwell Road became a topic of interest for research and development and medical services companies.

Autonomous aviation startup Merlin Labs showed interest in May in setting up a research and development facility at the Navy hangar site, which was included in the North Airfield development. The idea was to initially set up a facility with a few dozen positions, the majority of which would be engineers and pilots running testing.

Future plans possibly included moving the headquarters, along with more than 100 new and existing jobs, from Boston to Bedford.

Runway Realty Ventures LLC previously purchased the space with the intention of incorporating the Navy hangar into a substantial infrastructure project. The project intent was to add aviation support – aircraft storage hangar and administration space – to the area close to Hartwell Road, by renovating the Navy hangar and also adding approximately 450,000 square feet of hangar space across 17 new construction buildings.

Negotiations between Merlin Labs and Runway Realty Ventures LLC and North Airfield Ventures LLC included plans for the company to lease 75% to 80% of the Navy hangar space – which had been vacant for around 25 years – in a long-term lease. The proponents would fund renovation of the hangar space, formerly used for research and development by Raytheon and the Navy operations.

In June, North Airfield Ventures LLC and Runway Realty Ventures LLC submitted a Notice of Project Change (NPC) with a phase one waiver request to remove the existing Navy hangar building and some surrounding property from the larger North Airfield expansion project proposal into its own separate project.

In addition to the hangar being renovated for research and development purposes, the proposal called for updating an existing ramp to access the Hanscom Field runway and creating an access to Hartwell Road, as well as creating a surface parking lot with 140 spaces.

North Airfield Ventures LLC and Runway Realty Ventures LLC held a public information session that same month to provide an overview and answer questions about the Navy hangar project.

The information session included a presentation of the project by Rick Muse, North Airfield Ventures director of operations, and an overview of the contents and technical studies in the NPC by Lauren DeVoe, environmental review consultant with VHB.

Additionally, the project team claimed one to two Merlin test flights per day with at least one human operator on board, with some additional flights from other potential Navy hangar tenants. Experimental flights were proposed to take place in uncongested areas like the New Hampshire coastline, as well as some takeoffs and landings.

A handful of people commented and asked questions, with a few raising concerns over adding any amount of greenhouse gasses as the state, Bedford, and other neighboring towns work toward Net Zero. The team said that plans for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hanscom Field are in the near future (including in the larger project plan), and the use of clean or electric aircraft is not out of the question, but availability of that technology is not here yet.

In July, members of the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission (HFAC), which represents the residents of the four towns surrounding Hanscom Field, had questions regarding the Navy hangar project and voiced concerns about the safety of experimental autonomous technology over the populated areas neighboring Hanscom Field.

Additionally, some HFAC members were wary about the larger North Airfield development. HFAC members decided to create and submit individual statements of concern ahead of the July 25 NPC comment period deadline, with potential wording including: “We feel that any increase in aviation traffic will harm the communities and should be opposed.”

In September, Merlin Labs officially announced it will establish a new test flight center at Hanscom Field, with operations likely beginning in early 2027. It will occupy hangar, office, and lab space in the former Navy hangar.

According to the company’s announcement, the move to Hanscom Field began the next phase of its ongoing flight test campaign with its Cessna Caravan aircraft, “which is the world’s first and only approved certification basis for AI-enabled, takeoff-to-touchdown onboard autonomy.”

The company also stated that test operations at Hanscom Field support Merlin’s partnership with the U.S. Special Operations Command and the Air Force to integrate the Merlin Pilot on the C-130J and the KC-135 aircraft platforms.

ICE Flights

HFAC Lincoln representative Christopher Eliot was quoted about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flights out of Hanscom Field in a WBUR story that was released ahead of HFAC’s June meeting. There was some discussion about the reported “dramatic increase” in flights leaving from Hanscom Field to transport detainees to holding facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

When asked to verify or quantify the activities, Amber Goodspeed, manager of airport administration for Hanscom Field, said that “as a general aviation airport, nobody is required permission,” and charter clients and passengers are not registered with Massport.

While commission members had personal opinions, they decided that, like Massport, it was not HFAC business. Margaret Coppe, HFAC chair and Lexington representative, said that while it seemed important to publicly shine a light on the activities going on so close by, from the commission’s purview, there is “no basis for objecting to them using Hanscom [Field].”

In July, ICE stopped using Hanscom Field for local detainee flights. Prior to that announcement, reports said that many Massachusetts ICE detainees had been sent to Hanscom Field from the Plymouth County Jail. Detainees were then reportedly flown from Hanscom Field to larger detention centers around the country.

ICE Boston spokesperson James Covington, quoted in a story by The Concord Bridge, did not know why the move away from Hanscom Field was made, but did believe it was not just a temporary halt.

When the topic of ICE flights was revisited at HFAC’s July meeting, the group consensus had changed somewhat, seeing that it was an issue of concern to the community and that the commission had a right to have its input considered.

ICE resumed its use of Hanscom Field in September. Covington said ICE’s use of the airport had resumed “to support Operation Patriot 2.0. Flying aliens out of Hanscom [Field] allows ICE to move detainees quickly from the intake center at Burlington to a detention center once they have been processed.”

Coppe said HFAC was not notified, instead receiving reports from the community that ICE had resumed flights to Hanscom Field.

“In order to properly carry out our charge, we need to know this information,” she said. “We have a role to perform, and we can’t do it unless we’re properly informed.”

In response to questions and concerns voiced by community members, HFAC asked for more transparency from Massport and ICE in regard to ICE activity at Hanscom Field.

HFAC’s September meeting had what members described as an “unprecedented” number of participants, as nearly 80 people logged onto the Zoom meeting to join in on the commission’s conversation about ICE’s use of Hanscom Field. Participants included community members from Hanscom’s towns, as well as activists from the region and other states, such as Vermont, who were protesting against ICE’s actions.

HFAC sent a letter to Massport CEO Richard Davey, calling on ICE and Massport “to supply information for any and all upcoming ICE flights including date, time, and type of aircraft.” Additionally, the letter requested commentary on the safety and legality of ICE’s activity.

Hanscom Field Director Christopher Willenborg responded on behalf of Davey on Sept. 24. In his response, Willenborg wrote that Hanscom Field is “legally obligated to allow all types of aircraft operations without unjust discrimination, including those sponsored by the federal government.” He also advised HFAC to contact ICE directly, as airport representatives do not receive advance notification of the agency’s flight activity.

However, the assertion that airport representatives do not receive advance notice of ICE activity was disputed in November when The Lexington Observer received an email exchange acquired by a local activist through a public records request. According to the Observer, the source wished to remain anonymous, but The Bedford Citizen independently confirmed the existence of the emails.

In the exchange, Anthony Caruso – a general manager with Hanscom airfield services operations company Signature Aviation – wrote to Willenborg and Keith Leonhardt, Massport airport and operations manager for Hanscom, that Signature had received information about two ICE charter flights at Hanscom.

Rev. Jamie Hinson-Rieger, senior minister at First Parish–Unitarian Universalist, and Rev. John Gibbons, minister emeritus at First Parish, called the Observer’s story and the email exchange “a blockbuster revelation that reveals covert collaboration between ICE, Hanscom Field, and Massport that previously has been denied.”

Due to the significance of the concerns brought to the commission in September, HFAC also wrote a letter to Covington and ICE leadership, outlining the same concerns as written in the commission’s letter to Massport.

On Dec. 12, Healey wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, calling on ICE to stop flying detainees out of Hanscom Field.

Fuel Emissions/Air Quality

In March, HFAC reviewed challenges and potential solutions to reducing the use of leaded aviation gasoline (avgas) at Hanscom Field, as well as the impact of leaded aviation fuel emissions on public health.

Eliot shared that according to his research, low levels of lead exposure can have major health implications. He said that studies at other airports have shown that lead pollution is most concentrated within a one-kilometer (0.62-mile) radius of an airport.

The culmination of months of work, HFAC put together a statement of its “best guess as to what the concern is” surrounding the use of leaded avgas at Hanscom Field.

While “the danger of lead poisoning is so well documented,” said Eliot in the April meeting, the group’s research found some conflicting – some alarming and some reassuring – scientific and anecdotal results in studies concerning lead exposure surrounding airports.

The statement mentioned the Northeast region as a hot spot for lead exposure, and, locally, “Hanscom Field is among the top 50 most lead polluting airports in the country.”

The statement called for “Massport and the [Federal Aviation Administration] to recognize the severity of this problem both nationally and locally and to take all necessary measures to implement a solution at Hanscom Airport with urgent priority.”

A research project regarding air quality impacts in the towns that border Hanscom Field found that there is a high concentration of ultrafine particles (UFP) and airborne lead.

Neelakshi Hudda of Tufts University presented the results of the study in September. The study was requested due to concern that the proposed North Airfield development project will result in a significant increase in greenhouse gas and UFP emissions.

The study showed that the highest concentration of UFPs occurred at sites downwind of the airport during periods of moderate wind and high flight activity. Hudda said the Bedford sampling sites showed higher concentrations of UFPs when the wind was coming from the southwest.

Hudda also noted that airborne lead was detected in 100% of samples taken from the testing sites in the Hanscom communities. Hudda compared her team’s measured lead concentrations – hypothesized to be affected by the combustion of leaded fuel used by aircraft with piston engines – to measurements made at the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency data-collection site in Boston and found that concentrations of lead around Hanscom Field are, on average, larger than in the Boston area.

The World Health Organization issued “good practice” statements on UFPs to guide researchers and other decisionmakers toward measures to reduce ambient UFP concentrations. Information about UFPs can be found on pages 149 to 151 of WHO’s global air quality guidelines.

The study found that UFP concentrations exceed World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds at varying levels at each study site under at least one of the testing conditions. While many exceeded the WHO threshold by 4% and below, three of the test sites – the two closest to runways and one along the landing path – exceeded the threshold by an average of 35% and by as much as 79% during a monitoring period.

In October, The Coalition to Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere (SPJE) held a rally at the State House against the potential use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to reduce the spread of greenhouse gases in Massachusetts and to continue the fight against expansion at Hanscom Field.

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel, but with a smaller carbon footprint. SAF can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including food and yard waste, portions of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats, greases, oils, and other feedstocks.

Rally participants argued that SAFs will not be beneficial in reducing lifecycle aviation emissions to near zero by 2050 to contribute to the state’s clean energy and climate plan. Diane Proctor of the Concord-Carlisle League of Women Voters presented a letter to the governor and state legislators, urging them to reject policies and subsidies promoting the production and distribution of SAFs in Massachusetts. The letter was signed by over 50 organizations, six of which are based in Bedford.

Other Activities at Hanscom Field

In April, Massport appointed Willenborg as the new director of Hanscom Field. He succeeded Sharon Williams, who was named director of aviation facilities and passenger services at Boston Logan International Airport.

Willenborg had more than 25 years of leadership experience in the airport industry as an airport manager, state aeronautics director, and airport consultant.

He previously served as the airport manager of Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport in Westfield, where he was responsible for overseeing daily operations, managing the development and execution of annual budgets, and leading strategic initiatives. Over the past four years, this included directing more than $60 million in airside and landside capital improvement projects.

HFAC member and pilot Tom Hirsch provided insight, history, pilot perspective, and technical information about Hanscom Field in June.

About 100 animals from shelters impacted by flooding in Texas made their way to Hanscom Field in July. Two staff members from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell Animal Medical Center (MSPCA-Angell) were on the ground in Texas to aid in the transport.

MSPCA-Angell staff members prepared about 100 cats and dogs to make the journey from Texas to shelters in the Northeast. Of those 100, approximately 50 animals were taken to a transport space at MSPCA-Angell’s Cape Cod Adoption Center.

Roughly 20 cats and 30 dogs came from the Williamson Animal Shelter, which is located about five miles from the flood zone. Williamson Animal Shelter had been taking in animals to help two other local shelters, Lampasas Animal Shelter and Georgetown Animal Shelter, which did not have access to drinkable water.

The animals that were transported were living in the shelters prior to the floods and were not displaced by them.

In October, Massport, alongside several mutual aid partners, held an emergency response exercise at Hanscom Field. This exercise is mandated by the FAA every three years.

The drill tested the coordination, communication, and response in the event of a major incident at Hanscom Field. Mutual aid partners taking part in the drill alongside Massport Fire Rescue included the Bedford, Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, and Waltham fire and police departments, Massachusetts State Police, the Hanscom Air Force Base Fire Department, Armstrong Ambulance, Action Ambulance, and Boston MedFlight.",https://cdn.thebedfordcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/phoMOF-at-State-House.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 18:57:00.177695

Proposed by Nova Sustainable Fuels, the project has received environmental approval from the province, according to a report by CBC News. The company, backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy, plans to build a $4-6 billion facility to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable ethanol, using solar and wind power and biomass. The company describes the products as ""two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.""

The project would proceed in two phases. The first phase is building a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, NS. In the second phase, wind and solar farms would be built to connect to the plant. That would require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The jet fuel plant would require 60 truckloads of biomass (wood waste) per day and 586 cubic meters of fresh water per hour, which would be pulled from two nearby lakes.

Nova Sustainable Fuels expects it will take two to three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan. Nova Scotia's environment minister, Tim Halman, has put a few conditions on the project, including that it must be built within two years.

Nova Scotia has recently turned toward traditional oil and gas sources, despite strategizing a shift from fossil fuels to renewables focused on wind power. In July the province announced it is returning to offshore petroleum exploration for the first time since 2018, offering 13 new parcels covering 3.3 million hectares near the Scotian Shelf. Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau said offshore natural gas presents a ""major economic opportunity.""

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from sustainable sources such as biofuels, biomass, and captured carbon from oil and gas operations. It is said to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.

Boeing has intensified its oversight of a vast global supplier network in an effort to reduce defects and streamline aircraft production. Company executives report that these measures are already yielding significant improvements as the aerospace giant works to stabilize its complex supply chain. India remains a pivotal market for Boeing, with over 325 suppliers contributing more than $1.25 billion annually in sourcing. The country operates more than 265 Boeing commercial and military aircraft, underscoring its strategic importance within Boeing’s global operations.

The aviation industry has faced persistent supply chain disruptions in recent years, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. These challenges have resulted in delayed aircraft deliveries and shortages of critical components and materials, prompting Boeing to adopt a more rigorous approach to supplier management.

Impact of Increased Oversight and Data-Driven Risk Mitigation

Hector Silva, Vice President of Regulatory Compliance & Quality Core for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, revealed that since March 2024, the company has significantly ramped up its supplier oversight. This initiative has contributed to a reduction in defects by as much as 40 percent. Additionally, pending jobs on aircraft prior to delivery have decreased by 60 percent. Silva highlighted the proactive use of data analytics as a key tool in identifying and mitigating supply chain risks, enabling Boeing to address potential issues before they impact production.

Scott Stocker, Vice President and General Manager of the 787 Program and Boeing South Carolina Site Leader, emphasized the scale and complexity of Boeing’s supply chain organization, which employs several thousand personnel. He explained that the company continuously monitors factors that could affect suppliers and is prepared to allocate resources to support them when necessary. This includes conducting detailed production reviews focusing on supplier capacity, staffing, and the health of sub-tier supply chains. These efforts form part of Boeing’s “rate readiness” process, designed to support planned increases in monthly 787 production rates.

Addressing concerns that heightened oversight might impede production, Stocker stated that the opposite has occurred. The enhanced focus on the supply chain has actually facilitated Boeing’s ramp-up plans by improving operational clarity and responsiveness.

Strategic Supplier Partnerships and Future Outlook

Katie Ringgold, Vice President and General Manager of the 737 Program and Renton Site Leader, underscored India’s critical role in Boeing’s supply chain. She noted that a robust supply chain is essential for maintaining factory stability and that recent diversification of suppliers has positioned Boeing well for future growth. Key Indian partners include Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, which supplies floor beams for Dreamliners, and Mahindra Aerostructures Pvt Ltd, responsible for inlet outer barrel components.

Boeing’s intensified supplier oversight coincides with the company’s broader strategic initiatives, including a shift toward greater vertical integration following its acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. Managing the seamless integration of new production lines and mitigating potential supply chain disruptions remain top priorities. The market has responded favorably to these developments, with Boeing’s stock rising following the completion of the Spirit AeroSystems deal. Meanwhile, competitors are reassessing their own supply chain strategies, and suppliers to both Boeing and Airbus anticipate increased production demands and potential price adjustments beginning in 2026.

As Boeing strives to stabilize production and achieve positive free cash flow by 2026, its supply chain management strategies continue to attract close attention from investors and industry analysts alike.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/7f9d2dba4ddb4ddb880190bcacba5f18.avif,N,,2025-12-22 17:07:21.202749

Previously, the Canadian aviation industry purchased SAF from other countries and imported it into Canada.

SAF is being employed at major airports including Amsterdam, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston.

Airlines are collaborating with fuel suppliers, airports and industries like tech and agriculture to boost SAF supply chains. They are also signing multi-year agreements with fuel producers like Neste and World Energy.

Despite these developments, the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been slower than expected due to high costs and economic uncertainty, putting global clean jet fuel supply off course to reach the 2030 targets, according to a March report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Airlines and airports globally invest just 1-3% of their revenues or capex on SAF, per the report cited by Reuters.

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG's findings.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, director general at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.

In 2024, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tons, double the 500,000 tons produced in 2023. However, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel, according to IATA's latest estimates.

by Joey Stoate (Airport Industry News) Salvador Bahia Airport (SSA) has become the first airport in Brazil to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for commercial operations following the introduction of its regular use in November.

The use of SAF at SSA brings VINCI Airports’ total number of sites using the alternative fuel to more than 15, strengthening its position as a leader in decarbonisation.

...

SAF is distributed commercially by Vibra in Brazil, with the fuel blend used at Salvador fully complying with all international sustainability criteria.

From November onward, two daily flights departing from Salvador Bahia and operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas and LATAM Airlines Brasil have been supplied with a SAF blend containing 10% pure SAF and 90% conventional jet fuel, currently the highest proportion applied in Brazilian aviation.

The introduction of SAF at Salvador Bahia Airport represents the first step in expanding its use in Brazil’s aviation sector.

Governor Jerônimo Rodrigues said:

Now it could be put on the map for an entirely different reason: low-carbon, sustainable jet fuel.

CBC News reported this week that a proposal for an industrial plant on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore has passed its first regulatory hurdle: environmental approval from the province.

The proponent, Nova Sustainable Fuels, backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy, plans to build a $4-6 billion facility to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable ethanol, using solar and wind power and biomass. The company describes the products as “two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

The project would proceed in two phases. The first phase is building a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, NS. In the second phase, wind and solar farms would be built to connect to the plant. That, says CBC, would require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The jet fuel plant would require 60 truckloads of biomass (wood waste) per day and 586 cubic meters of fresh water per hour, which would be pulled from two nearby lakes.

Related: $60 Oil Is No Longer a Floor

Nova Sustainable Fuels expects it will take two to three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan. Nova Scotia’s environment minister, Tim Halman, has put a few conditions on the project, including that it must be built within two years.

Nova Scotia has recently turned toward traditional oil and gas sources, despite strategizing a shift from fossil fuels to renewables focused on wind power. In July the province announced it is returning to offshore petroleum exploration for the first time since 2018, offering 13 new parcels covering 3.3 million hectares near the Scotian Shelf.

Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau said offshore natural gas presents a “major economic opportunity”.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from sustainable sources such as biofuels, biomass, and captured carbon from oil and gas operations. It is said to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.

SAF has another Canadian connection in Parkland Corporation, which in 2024 produced the first batch of made-in-Canada low-carbon jet fuel from its facility in Burnaby, British Columbia, just outside of Vancouver.

The 10,000 liters of fuel were sourced from non-food-grade canola and tallow. The entire batch of the production run was bought by Air Canada.

Previously, the Canadian aviation industry purchased SAF from other countries and imported it into Canada.

SAF is being employed at major airports including Amsterdam, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston.

Airlines are collaborating with fuel suppliers, airports and industries like tech and agriculture to boost SAF supply chains. They are also signing multi-year agreements with fuel producers like Neste and World Energy.

Despite these developments, the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been slower than expected due to high costs and economic uncertainty, putting global clean jet fuel supply off course to reach the 2030 targets, according to a March report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Airlines and airports globally invest just 1-3% of their revenues or capex on SAF, per the report cited by Reuters.

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG's findings.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, director general at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.

In 2024, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tons, double the 500,000 tons produced in 2023. However, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel, according to IATA's latest estimates.

Salvador Bahia Airport (SSA), part of VINCI Airports’ network since 2018, is pioneering Brazil’s aviation decarbonisation by becoming the country’s first airport to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for commercial operations. Regular use of SAF begins this November, marking a significant milestone for both the airport and VINCI Airports’ commitment to accelerating the energy transition across its mobility infrastructure and stakeholders.

The airport already serves as a regional benchmark for environmental performance. It was the first in the Americas to achieve the highest level of Airport Carbon Accreditation, ACA 5, implementing advanced practices for carbon management and reduction. More than 15 airports in the VINCI network now offer SAF, and Salvador Bahia’s introduction of regular SAF operations further strengthens its environmental position and aligns with decarbonisation goals across the network.

In Brazil, SAF is commercially distributed by Vibra. The fuel blend used at Salvador meets international sustainability criteria and can help lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Two daily flights from Salvador Bahia, operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas and LATAM Airlines Brasil, now use a blend of 10 per cent pure SAF and 90 per cent conventional jet fuel, the highest proportion currently applied in Brazilian aviation. The pure SAF, produced from used cooking oil, is presently the only type available nationally. While flight emissions fall under airlines’ scope 1 and the airport’s scope 3, the renewable fuel reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and represents a first step in expanding SAF use in Brazil.

Governor Jerônimo Rodrigues said, “Bahia has made significant progress in clean energy production and in building a more sustainable future, where development and social justice move forward together.”

Julio Ribas, CEO of VINCI Airports in Brazil, added, “SAF is currently the most effective tool for reducing emissions in commercial aviation. Being able to offer flights fuelled with SAF in Salvador on a continuous basis places Bahia at the forefront of the energy transition and reinforces our commitment to transforming passenger journeys with increasingly sustainable solutions.”

EPA’s proposed rollback of the GHGRP could impact the ability of carbon-based hydrogen projects to claim 45Q or 45V, and hydrogen projects seeking to claim 45V.","Billions of dollars in federal investments, including tax credits and funds authorized through legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have stimulated private investment in clean energy deployment. Now federal priorities are shifting, narrowing the federal incentives available for climate and clean energy investments. To deploy more innovative energy technologies for U.S. energy security, resilience, and growth, it is crucial to understand how shifts in federal policy and executive actions impact private investment. CATF’s new clean energy investment tracker is designed to do just that.

This tool tracks private investments that have been catalyzed by federal incentives and those that have been canceled while also tracking how changes to federal policy and executive actions impact the range of federal incentives available to projects. The data for this tracker comes from Rhodium’s Clean Investment Monitor combined with CATF’s data and analysis of federal incentives.

Federal incentives may be impacted by legislation and agency actions, which can limit project access to tax credits, grants, and loans. Where CATF has identified federal incentives as impacted by federal actions, the tracker labels project investments eligible for these incentives as “incentive eligibility impacted” (see top dashboard and status filter for investment totals for this label, and project details showing impacted incentives when selecting a project on the tracker to learn more). This label does not mean a project will not move forward, but that federal support is being withheld in some way. This information is essential to understand how federal activities impact private investments.

What’s impacting investments this quarter?

Federal legislation

Through the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July 2025, many clean energy tax credits were repealed or narrowed by new restrictions and/or accelerated phasedowns. The table below summarizes key changes to the tax credits:

Executive actions

The following executive agency actions could limit access to many of these tax credits, depending how they are implemented.

Proposed EPA Rule: Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). On September 12, 2025, EPA proposed to permanently remove program reporting obligations for 46 of 47 source categories of the GHGRP. EPA’s proposal also includes permanently removing the natural gas distribution segment of the petroleum and natural gas source category (subpart W) and suspending reporting of the remaining nine subpart W segments until reporting year 2034. The Treasury Department and IRS rely on the GHGRP to administer Section 45Q Carbon Sequestration Tax Credits, Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Tax Credits, and Section 45Y Clean Electricity Tax Credits. Revising the GHGRP as proposed could hinder compliance with tax credit reporting requirements reliant on GHGRP data, and therefore the ability to claim the credits, unless IRS regulations are revised, and/or sufficient alternatives for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) and lifecycle analysis (LCA) are implemented.

Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)/Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions. FEOC is shorthand for a type of tax provision that restricts entities with ties to certain countries considered national security threats from claiming or otherwise benefiting from federal clean energy tax credits. Previously, the IRA applied FEOC restrictions only to the 30D clean vehicle credit. OBBBA expanded upon IRA’s FEOC definition and created two new categories of Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFEs): (1) Specified Foreign Entities and (2) Foreign Influenced Entities. PFE/FEOC restrictions added by OBBBA apply to six energy tax credits: 45U, 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, and 45Z, increasing compliance burdens and impacting projects claiming those credits, including enhanced geothermal and advanced nuclear. Treasury and IRS have yet to publish implementation guidance, contributing to industry uncertainty on compliance. A recent market analysis found that industry preparation is underway, but only 38% of firms surveyed describe themselves as “fully prepared” to comply with PFE/FEOC rules for 2026.

DOE announced project funding cuts and additional cuts being considered for existing awards. DOE canceled federal cost-share funding for hundreds of existing grant awards. In May and early October, DOE announced it was rescinding awards (grants and loans). Another leaked list, yet unconfirmed by DOE, was reported later in October. These nationwide funding cuts impact industrial and transportation sectors, near-term infrastructure deployment of solar and wind and grid resiliency projects, as well as methane pollution reduction investments. It is currently unknown which projects will ultimately proceed without the relied upon federal cost-share from DOE. Private sector and state level cost-share investments into these projects also face risk.

Findings

The majority of federal incentives driving private investments are impacted by recent federal activities, including OBBBA tax credit provisions, uncertainty in Treasury’s approach to PFE/FEOC implementation, EPA’s proposed GHGRP rollback, and DOE’s announced and reported cancellations of funding.

Sectors impacted by these federal actions include electric power, manufacturing, and energy and industry, which include transportation throughout. In Q3 2025, new manufacturing investment totaled $10 billion in actual investment and project cancellations totaled $2 billion, mostly from the cancellation of battery manufacturing projects. New energy and industry sector investment totaled $25 billion in actual investment in Q3, and project cancellations totaled $2 billion, primarily solar, storage, and hydrogen projects.

Read on for a few sector snapshots of how federal activities are currently impacting investments.

Electric power

Solar and wind

Utility-scale solar, together with storage installations, accounted for most clean electricity investments, and wind investments increased over 30% from the previous quarter. This is partly driven by projects accelerating timelines to fit within narrowed eligibility timelines, which is accelerating timelines, distorting supply chains, and raising costs but not driving new projects. However, recent federal actions are driving deep uncertainty for these industries with still unknown consequences for private investments in solar and wind. In particular, OBBBA narrows the time horizons for wind and solar projects (to commence construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027) to access the 45Y and 48E tax credits, eliminates eligibility for wind components sold after December 31, 2027 for 45X tax credit access, and creates uncertainty related to PFE/FEOC implementation. Uncertainty in solar investment will also have implications for battery investment and deployment, even if incentives for battery technologies remain largely intact.

Additionally, while most solar and wind projects are on private land, they can be sited on federal lands or otherwise require federal permits. Recent executive actions, such as the U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary’s Order prioritizing permits based on an energy project’s capacity density and the requirements for the Secretary of the Interior to personally sign off on solar and wind projects on federal lands could severely limit the solar and wind sectors’ ability to secure necessary permits. The administration has also taken several steps to slow or stop the development of offshore wind projects, which require federal approvals as they are sited in federal waters. The administration issued a halt on project approvals – a move a federal judge recently deemed unlawful – and has issued stop work orders on projects already under construction. These tax credit and permitting uncertainties upend the federal policy environment for solar and wind projects.

Looking ahead

DOE’s October project cuts announcement and additional project awards being considered for termination will likely affect wind and solar investments. EPA recently terminated the $7 billion Solar for All program within the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. These cuts are a withdrawal of federal support for communities across the country that applied for and received funding support to invest in these technologies.

Manufacturing

Fueling equipment and zero emission vehicles

While zero emission vehicle supply chains drove manufacturing investments in Q3 2025, these investment numbers were likely tied to investors taking action prior to the September 30, 2025, termination of 30D Clean Vehicle, 25E Previously-Owned Clean Vehicle, and 45W Commercial Clean Vehicle tax credits. OBBBA’s PFE/FEOC restrictions apply to the 45Y, 48E, and 45X tax credits that incentivize investment in the EV manufacturing supply chain – including critical minerals and batteries – creating investment uncertainty in those sectors while the industry waits for Treasury to release guidance that explains how they are implementing FEOC restrictions. The additional narrowing of the 48C Advanced Energy Project credit and the June 30, 2026, termination of the 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property credit creates further uncertainty for future investments in fuel fabrication, fueling equipment, and EVs.

Separately, the administration continues to withdraw federal support for zero-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure. In addition to actions earlier this year to delay the release of funds for EV charging stations, the October DOE project cancellations further target EV supply chains for producing low-carbon fuels, building EV charging and freight corridors, and electrifying heavy-duty and public transit fleets.

Energy and industry

Sustainable aviation fuel

Investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology continued to decline in Q3 2025. While OBBBA extended the 45Z tax credit through 2029, it dramatically reduced the maximum per-gallon credit value available to SAF producers from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon, limiting the incentive for domestic investment in new or expanded SAF facilities. OBBBA also amended 45Z to require feedstocks to be from the U.S., Canada, or Mexico. The SAF industry had been positioned to expand, but these changes create new uncertainties for the domestic SAF industry.

Hydrogen

Q3 2025 hydrogen investments also declined from Q2, but hydrogen investments still comprised the majority of industry sector announcements. Subsequent quarters are likely to illustrate more of the impacts from recent federal actions, such as the OBBBA’s 45V Clean Hydrogen Credit phasedown (terminating the credit for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027, instead of the original phaseout in 2033).

EPA’s proposed rollback of the GHGRP could impact the ability of carbon-based hydrogen projects to claim 45Q or 45V, and hydrogen projects seeking to claim 45V. The proposed delay of subpart W until reporting year 2034 would negatively impact the ability of taxpayers to receive higher incentives for better performance (i.e. lower-emissions hydrogen production) and potentially render some projects uneconomical. Carbon-based hydrogen projects can opt to claim either 45V or 45Q Carbon Sequestration tax credits; if the GHGRP is rolled back and data from subpart W is no longer available, 45Q may be the better route, but 45Q also relies on GHGRP to verify tax credit eligibility.

DOE’s announced hydrogen funding cuts in October, and the additional cuts being considered, are destabilizing for the U.S. hydrogen sector and may further alter 2025 Q4 investment data for the hydrogen sector. The announced cuts and additional cuts under consideration include eliminating federal cost share for all of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs as well as 76 other hydrogen projects that support the buildout of a domestic hydrogen industry. It is unclear if projects will be able to move forward without federal cost share; at least one Hydrogen Hub announced it would pause activities in response to recent changes, including DOE’s decision to cut federal funding. Exxon announced it was halting plans for its blue hydrogen facility in Baytown, Texas – a project selected to receive up to ~$322 million in federal-cost share from DOE that was terminated in the spring.

Carbon management

Q3 2025 carbon management investments were slightly lower than Q2 levels. While OBBBA maintained the 45Q Carbon Sequestration tax credit and even included parity for enhanced oil recovery, other recent federal actions, including EPA’s proposed GHGRP rollback and DOE project cuts, have contributed to industry investment uncertainty.

Recent reporting indicates that Treasury and the IRS plan to issue guidance by the end of 2025 to clarify how taxpayers can verify their projects by an independent engineer or geologist to meet the 45Q credit requirement for tax year 2025. Until that guidance is finalized, there will be no way for taxpayers to substantiate 45Q claims if the GHGRP is eliminated.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/21170632/united-states.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 17:12:06.902305

US interest in Greenland has intensified since Trump returned to office in January, with the president repeatedly citing national security concerns to justify his claims.","Denmark has condemned the United States’ decision to appoint a special envoy to Greenland, calling the move “totally unacceptable” and summoning the US ambassador for explanations.

The reaction followed the nomination by US President Donald Trump of Louisiana republican Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory that the former president has repeatedly suggested should become part of the United States.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said he was “deeply angry” about the appointment, adding that Copenhagen would formally raise the issue with Washington in the coming days.

Trump announced the nomination on his Truth Social platform, arguing that Greenland was of strategic importance to US national security. He said Landry would work to defend American interests, as well as those of US allies.

Danish MEP Anders Vistisen told Brussels Signal that the appointment reflected what he described as a flawed view of national security.

“Contrary to what US President Trump thinks, the territories of other countries are not put there simply to geographically defend the United States,” he said, adding that Denmark was a committed NATO member whose soldiers had taken part in alliance missions.

While Denmark shared concerns about the growing influence of China and Russia in the Arctic, Vistisen said this did not justify what he described as expansionist rhetoric directed at a NATO ally.

He stressed that Greenland was both an integral and autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark and that its status was not up for negotiation. “It is not for sale, nor is it an item to be robbed,” he said.

Greenland governs its own domestic affairs, while Denmark retains responsibility for foreign policy, defence and security. Decisions affecting the territory’s international position are traditionally taken with both Danish and Greenlandic representatives involved.

US interest in Greenland has intensified since Trump returned to office in January, with the president repeatedly citing national security concerns to justify his claims. Danish media have recently reported efforts by Washington to establish more direct contacts with Greenland’s government, a move that has caused unease in Copenhagen.

Landry posted on X that it was an honour to take on the role, adding that he would work to make Greenland “a part of the US”.

European leaders also weighed in following the announcement. Germany’s foreign ministry said it had “taken note of the new announcement” and stressed that its position remained unchanged.

“The future of Greenland lies in the hands of the Greenlanders,” a spokesperson said.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen echoed that view, saying respect for sovereignty remained fundamental. “We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” they said together.

With the news that the government is backing Heathrow's £49 billion plan for a third runway, the long running debate over airport expansion is back at the top of the agenda.

Supporters say the move is vital for UK competitiveness and future connectivity.

Critics question the environmental and community impact.

So what does this decision really mean for Britain's place in global aviation? And what happens if we don't expand?

Aviation expert and special advisor to the Secretary General of UN Tourism, Anita Menderrata, speaks to The Standard’s Tech and Science Daily podcast to help unpack the story.

The expansion of Heathrow, namely the addition of a third runway, is incredibly important to the UK as a whole.

Not just Heathrow, because it strengthens the competitiveness of the UK both in terms of travel and tourism, but also importantly trade.

Any airport that operates will have a busyness factor. It's all about the efficiency of how the busyness is managed, and this is where airport operations, airlines, and air traffic control needs to come in incredibly effectively.

So the beauty of adding in a third runway, which will only be operational in 2035, is that you can actually elevate the efficiency of the aircraft taking off and landing rather than having the risk of bottlenecks, because you now have the flexibility of a third runway, especially if for any reason any of the other runways come into any operational challenges.

The net effect will be very good because when it comes to a project like this, which is core infrastructure for a nation, it's always about the opportunity cost. It's not just should we; it’s if we don't make this investment, what will this mean for the UK economy, for all of its productivity and its identity?

So there is potentially some big national upside, but what about the people living around the airport?

The entire process of developing the third runway at Heathrow is very much about upgrading the entire infrastructure itself.

If we look at other airports in the world, whether it's JFK, Charles de Gaulle, Schiphol, those are in high density areas. Heathrow has the benefit of being outside of central London, so it actually has the environment around it to be able to stretch with minimal disruption.

Any community living on the edges effectively of an airport is going to be impacted by growth of the airport, and it's understandable that there's frustration.

The consultation process and the engagement process with the local community is vital, so they actually understand the benefits of this, not only some potential hardships they may face.

Lib Dem MPs gathered in Westminster to oppose a third Heathrow runway

.

From the middle of next year, the public consultation process is going to begin. Heathrow is needing to put through not just an economic impact assessment, but an environmental and a social impact assessment that will allow the casemaking to be clear, because once again it's about the opportunity cost of if we don't do this. Communities might stay in place, but there will be a limitation to their own growth.

It's very important that Heathrow as an airport establishment and the ecosystem around it work very closely with the community ecosystem so it's very clear the benefits. Equally, communities must be able to voice concerns they might have, in order to have those concerns answered.

But more planes equals more pollution, right? What are the environmental implications of adding a new runway to Heathrow Airport?

What's very important is that the expansion of Heathrow and the third runway actually strengthens the UK's ability when it comes to reaching net zero by 2050.

Not only is it more effective operations of the runway, it's going to be a completely electric powered terminal itself.

It's using much more efficient air traffic control, and it's bringing in the aircraft that are allowed to utilise a sustainable aviation fuel, which cuts emissions by 80%.

There will be higher traffic flows of people. But a third runway that allows for larger aircraft could actually mean fewer aircraft taking off with more people and cargo rather than increasing the number of smaller aircraft.

The interesting thing, and something that is often completely underestimated and under-celebrated, is how much the aviation industry per se is at the forefront of innovation in sustainable engineering for all other industries.

The investment that aviation has been putting into sustainability for decades now and the billions that have gone into it have gone into other modes of transport have gone into other industries. So in many ways aviation almost becomes an incubator for innovation itself.

So much learning from the Heathrow expansion will be cascaded through the UK as a whole. So this is very important.

When we look at any nation's competitiveness, productivity growth is essential. But scaling up growth does not have to mean scaling up negative environmental impact.

So ironically, while people might question why aviation is not damaging to the environment, it's actually going to help the environment because it's going to catapult the UK's ability to continue to grow through essential aviation, but through smart green aviation that works towards net zero by 2050.

Airlines across Asia Pacific are enjoying a strong rebound in passenger demand, but beneath the headline growth, chief executives are grappling with persistent supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability, and outdated air traffic management systems.

In November, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) held its 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, bringing together airline CEOs and senior leaders from across the region. The event, hosted by Bangkok Airways, was supported by major aircraft and engine OEMs, aviation experts, and international media, including Aerospace Global News.

Nearly 200 delegates attended, representing carriers including Air Astana, Air India, Air New Zealand, ANA, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, EVA Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Lion Group, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Royal Brunei, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Vietnam Airlines.

Strong passenger growth masks mounting operational pressures

With global passenger numbers now exceeding pre-pandemic levels, it would be easy to assume commercial aviation is firmly back on track. Conversations with Asia Pacific airline leaders, however, paint a more complex picture.

Across the region, airlines are struggling with delayed aircraft deliveries, engines stuck off-wing, shortages in maintenance and repair capacity, constrained spare parts availability, and difficulties sourcing trained personnel. These challenges are limiting growth just as demand accelerates.

Supply chain disruption, tariffs, and airspace closures compound costs

Opening the assembly, AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that fragile supply chain recovery is now being undermined by rising tariffs, driving up supplier costs while simultaneously dampening demand through inflation.

He added that regulatory burdens and military conflicts are further inflating operating costs. At various points over the past year, airspace across more than 14 countries has been closed, forcing longer routings, delays, and cancellations.

“It is an inefficient operating environment,” Menon said, warning of the risks posed by civil aircraft operating near active conflict zones, including spoofing of air navigation systems and the threat of aircraft being caught in military crossfire.

SAF ambitions clash with limited supply and high costs

Sustainability featured prominently on the agenda. AAPA airlines have committed to a collective target of 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) utilisation by 2030, but concern is growing over the slow pace of supply development.

“Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector for carbon emissions, yet we are asked to rely mostly on a hard-to-get commodity called SAF,” Menon told delegates, arguing that fuel suppliers must shoulder greater responsibility for delivering SAF at scale and at competitive prices.

IATA highlights Asia Pacific growth and air traffic management risks

IATA data presented at the assembly underlined Asia Pacific’s role as the fastest-growing aviation market globally. October passenger demand grew 8.1% year-on-year in the region, compared with 2.5% in North America and 6.7% in Europe, with international traffic to and from China, Japan, and Vietnam all posting double-digit growth.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh described the region as “the largest market in the world,” accounting for around 35% of global commercial traffic. However, he warned that airline expansion and airport investment risk being constrained by outdated air traffic management systems.

Walsh also addressed safety concerns, including lithium-ion battery risks and passenger behaviour during evacuations, noting an increase in incidents involving travellers attempting to retrieve cabin baggage.

Resolutions focus on safety, sustainability, and supply chain resilience

The assembly concluded with the adoption of four resolutions covering aviation sustainability, safety, taxes and charges, and supply chain strengthening. Looking ahead, AAPA signalled a clear focus on collaboration with regulators and suppliers to improve resilience and maintain connectivity across the region.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4-Singapore-Airlines-Boeing-777-scaled.png,N,,2025-12-21 08:57:08.866635

In line with the efforts, international aircraft taking off from South Korea will be required to use SAF for at least 1 percent of their fuel, and the share will be raised to between 3 percent and 5 percent after 2030.

South Korea will come up with measures to ease the financial burden on air carriers, considering that SAF prices are around three times higher than those of conventional jet fuel, including partially assisting with related costs.

Meanwhile, Korean Air build a next-generation aircraft maintenance hangar at Incheon International Airport, South Korea's main gateway, under a 176 billion-won (US$119.2 million) joint investment deal with the airport operator, the airline said.

The new hangar will be located inside the airport's High Tech Aviation Complex and will support airframe inspections, component checks, heavy maintenance and aircraft modification. The 69,299-square-meter site will accommodate two wide-body aircraft and one narrow-body aircraft at once. Construction is set to begin in 2027, with operations planned from late 2029.

Korean Air said the facility will strengthen its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capabilities ahead of the launch of the integrated carrier following the acquisition of rival carrier Asiana Airlines Inc.

“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday, Dec. 19 issued a long-awaited Dakota Access Pipeline environmental impact statement, recommending that the pipeline keep operating, but with some new conditions for its Missouri River crossing in North Dakota.

The pipeline has been operating since June 2017, carrying crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oil field to Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has opposed the project and challenged it in court, citing concerns about impacts to the tribe’s Missouri River water supply.

A federal judge in 2020 revoked the easement for the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock reservation, requiring additional environmental study.

The 464-page environmental impact statement evaluated five alternatives, including denying the easement or rerouting the pipeline. The corps said its preferred alternative grants the easement, allowing the pipeline to keep operating, but with some additional conditions.

The recommendation is not official until after a 30-day waiting period required under the National Environmental Policy Act. After that period concludes on Jan. 20, 2026, the corps may issue a record of decision.

The options evaluated were:

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline by removal.

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline in place.

Grant the easement with the same conditions as the previous easement, which Dakota Access LLC prefers.

Grant the easement with additional conditions.

Construct and operate a pipeline reroute north of Bismarck.

In its analysis, the corps wrote that the fourth option, granting the easement with conditions, protects environmental resources and responds to comments raised by tribal nations.

The conditions aim to prevent an oil spill and minimize the impacts of a spill, such as implementing new leak detection technology as it becomes available and conducting groundwater monitoring and surface water sampling.

The corps held two meetings in Bismarck in November 2023 to collect public comment on the environmental impact statement. At the time, corps officials said the final statement was expected in 2024.

In interviews after those 2023 meetings, the chairs of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said the Dakota Access Pipeline was operating illegally without a permit and should be shut down. Tribal leaders and environmental groups have also raised concerns about an inadequate spill response plan.

North Dakota officials, meanwhile, have supported the continuing operation of the pipeline.

“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement. “Its continued operation will ensure energy security and affordability for the country while providing positive economic impact that touches every North Dakotan.”

“We are certainly working everyday on both fuels demand and opportunities,” says Caleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA). He is also a farmer based in Magnolia, Kentucky.

“Whether it be biodiesel, renewable diesel—there are opportunities with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), and there’s different feed stocks that can be used in SAF,” says Ragland. “As the saying goes, ‘The rising tide lifts all boats,’ and biofuels are such an exciting opportunity for the soybean industry that we must be pursuing.”

He tells Hoosier Ag Today that he and other soybean producers will continue to press your lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass legislation in 2026 to further expand the biofuels industry.

“We have opportunities right now that need to be completed by Congress,” says Ragland. “We have the 45Z tax credit that’s hanging out there that needs to be done. We have the Renewable Volume Obligations, RVO’s, that need to be completed. That number has been debated and beaten to death. It’s time to get the deal done.”

“We need Congress to step up and make it happen. That’s good for demand, and it brings stability and some certainty to our industry, as well, that we desperately need,” he says.

Ragland adds that the expansion of biodiesel would truly be a win for everyone.

“The American farmer is growing a product that is getting used here domestically. It’s creating fuel that is good for the environment. It’s good for the economy. It brings jobs. It brings economic opportunity to our farms, which ties back to economic opportunity for all of our rural communities. That local farmer dollar gets turned over 6-to-8 times, at least, locally. It’s also good for all of the small businesses and it’s just good for everybody involved,” says Ragland.

Indiana is home to one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in the U.S.—which is Louis Dreyfus near Claypool in Kosciusko County. The facility currently produces around 99 million gallons of biodiesel each year.

Brazil closes 2025 with a decisive step toward the decarbonization of aviation. In early December, Petrobras announced the first production and delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) fully produced in the country.

The milestone gained further relevance with the official participation of Anac (Brazil’s National Civil Aviation Agency) in the launch, reinforcing that the product meets the most rigorous international sustainability standards.

The initiative places Brazil among the countries that have taken effective steps to transform the aviation sector, one of the most complex industries when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

What SAF is

SAF – or Sustainable Aviation Fuel – is designed to replace conventional jet fuel partially or entirely.

Its main advantage is full compatibility with aircraft and existing airport infrastructure, without the need for technical adaptations.

In practice, this allows airlines to reduce carbon emissions immediately by using a certified fuel that is internationally recognized as one of the leading solutions for decarbonizing air transport.

Fully Brazilian SAF production with international certification

Petrobras’ SAF was produced through coprocessing at the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc), in Rio de Janeiro, using technical corn oil (TCO), a residual vegetable-based feedstock.

According to official data, the fuel can reduce net CO₂ emissions by up to 87 percent in the renewable portion of the product.

The Brazilian SAF received ISCC-CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), confirming its compliance with the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

This certification is essential for the fuel to be accepted in international operations, ensuring sustainability, traceability and quality standards recognized worldwide.

Anac reinforces regulatory certainty and credibility

Anac attended the ceremony marking Petrobras’ first SAF production and delivery, highlighting the relevance of the fuel for the future of aviation in Brazil.

According to the agency, the fact that SAF is produced entirely in the country and already meets international criteria represents an important step forward for the development of the domestic market.

In this first phase, 3,000 cubic meters (m³) of SAF were produced and sold to distributors operating at Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport. This volume corresponds to approximately one day of aviation fuel consumption across airports in the state of Rio de Janeiro, demonstrating the product’s operational viability.

Contribution to global decarbonization targets

The launch of SAF comes at a strategic moment for the aviation sector.

From 2027 onward, airlines will be required to comply with CORSIA, ICAO’s global program aimed at reducing emissions from international flights. In Brazil, the use of sustainable fuels is also aligned with the guidelines established by the Future Fuel Law (Lei do Combustível do Futuro).

By anticipating SAF production and certification, Petrobras offers the domestic market a solution ready to meet future regulatory requirements, reducing dependence on imports and strengthening Brazil’s energy industry.

A tangible step forward in the just energy transition

With institutional backing from Anac and compliance with international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, sustainable aviation fuel moves beyond promise and becomes a tangible part of the present and future of air transport in Brazil.

This strengthens the country’s industry and energy sovereignty, opening the way for a new cycle of innovation and sustainability in the national aviation sector.

By closing the year with this major achievement, Brazil demonstrates that it is prepared to lead the global decarbonization agenda with real, certified and competitive solutions.",https://bricsbrasil.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BRICS-Brasil-SAF-da-Petrobras.png,N,,2025-12-20 20:56:34.753940

The crisis sent shipping rates soaring and forced businesses relying on just-in-time manufacturing to reconsider fundamental assumptions about supply chain design.
If the Red Sea crisis tested maritime logistics, infrastructure vulnerability exposed different weaknesses.","The first quarter of 2025 unfolded as a defining period for global procurement – marked by competing priorities of equity and efficiency, regulatory upheaval and resilience tests that challenged even the most prepared organisations.

The conversation began with vision. The World Economic Forum, alongside Deloitte and the Schwab Foundation, released research spotlighting equity's role in green and digital transformation.

WEF: The Role of Equity in Green & Digital Transformation

The report emphasised that social enterprises – businesses prioritising impact over profit – could be instrumental in ensuring inclusive growth during these transitions. With 10 million social enterprises globally generating US$2tn annually, the message was clear: procurement professionals hold considerable power in directing resources toward equitable outcomes.

Yet vision alone wouldn't sustain progress. The aviation sector grappled with translating sustainable ambitions into operational reality as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) confronted scaling challenges.

Can Aviation Overcome SAF Scaling and Cost Challenges?

Despite offering an 80% reduction in lifecycle emissions, SAF production remained hampered by feedstock scarcity, concentrated production facilities and costs exceeding traditional jet fuel.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President of Sustainability, articulated the urgency: ""We need the whole world to produce as much renewable energy as possible for everybody. Airlines simply want to access their fair share of that output.""

The bottleneck revealed a fundamental procurement challenge – securing diverse, sustainable feedstock whilst building logistics networks capable of supporting global distribution.

Meanwhile, businesses faced more immediate concerns as political transitions reshaped cost structures. When President Donald Trump took office, proposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico threatened to raise US grocery prices and disrupt established sourcing strategies.

How Costco Wholesale Will Deal With Tariffs Uncertainty

Costco's response illustrated pragmatic procurement leadership.

CFO Gary Millerchip acknowledged the challenge candidly: ""Tariffs raise costs so that's not something that we see as a positive in general.""

Yet the company's approach – pulling forward inventory, working with vendors to mitigate costs, exploring alternative sourcing locations and pivoting SKUs when value disappeared – demonstrated how experienced procurement teams navigate policy uncertainty.

His predecessor's wisdom echoed through the strategy: ""When it rains, it rains on everybody.""

Andreas Rasche, Professor at Copenhagen Business School, expressed concern: ""This is very disappointing and not at all proportionate. The document gives no evidence-based reasons for the changes.""

For procurement teams, the implications were significant – reduced access to sustainability data could create blind spots in responsible sourcing efforts, particularly in complex global networks.

Regulatory upheaval wasn't confined to Brussels. In the UK, plans to abolish NHS England and integrate its functions into the Department of Health marked a pivotal shift in healthcare procurement.

NHS England Reform: What Does It Mean for Procurement?

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer positioned the move as streamlining administration, yet the restructuring threatened to disrupt ongoing procurement reforms and delay purchasing of essential medicines and medical devices.

With approximately 9,000 job losses expected and a £7bn deficit to manage, procurement teams faced budgetary constraints whilst navigating decentralised decision-making through local Integrated Care Boards. The challenge became clear: achieving efficiency improvements without undermining supplier relationships or equitable patient care.

Beyond regulatory shifts, physical disruptions tested supply chain resilience. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea forced shipping companies to reroute vessels around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, avoiding the Suez Canal entirely.

How the Shipping Crisis in the Red Sea is Impacting Trade

Container shipments through the region dropped 75% as companies navigated the trade-off between security risks and the costs of detours adding 10 to 14 days to transit times.

Xeneta's Chief Analyst Peter Sand stated: ""All ships transiting the Suez Canal must sail through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and the Houthi militia has made clear that any vessel is a target.""

The crisis sent shipping rates soaring and forced businesses relying on just-in-time manufacturing to reconsider fundamental assumptions about supply chain design.

If the Red Sea crisis tested maritime logistics, infrastructure vulnerability exposed different weaknesses. A fire at an electrical substation forced Heathrow Airport's closure until midnight on 21 March, affecting more than 1,300 flights.

How the Heathrow Airport Closure Impacted Supply Chains

The incident disrupted not just passenger travel but cargo operations at the UK's largest port by value, handling more than 1.6 million metric tonnes of freight annually.

John Manners-Bell, CEO of Transport Intelligence, criticised the apparent oversight: ""A fire at a single power sub-station bringing one of the world's busiest airports to a complete halt? Someone has been asleep at the wheel.""

The event served as a stark reminder that even the most sophisticated supply chains remain vulnerable to infrastructure failures beyond procurement's direct control.

These individual disruptions converged into a broader pattern. QIMA's 2025 Sourcing Survey revealed that three-quarters of businesses expected supply chain disruptions to persist, whilst nearly 90% still lacked full visibility into their supply chains.

Businesses Dealing with Escalating Supply Chain Disruptions

Companies responded by diversifying sourcing strategies – two-thirds maintained or expanded Chinese supplier operations whilst half of US businesses shifted volumes closer to home through nearshoring.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8628c3f40169c454f8fa452f3a23619a:8e1915f0f9ebf64a1f030a451272b3c5/gettyimages-1347183021.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:00.864302

How Air New Zealand’s New Routes Will Transform Travel

Air New Zealand’s new and expanded routes are not just about increasing convenience for travelers – they are also about opening up new opportunities for tourism, business, and cultural exchange between New Zealand, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Each new route brings with it the potential for enhanced connectivity, increased tourism, and better access to some of the most beautiful and vibrant regions in the Southern Hemisphere.

Table: Summary of New Routes by Air New Zealand

The Economic Impact of Air New Zealand’s New Routes

One of the most significant aspects of Air New Zealand’s route expansion is its economic impact on both New Zealand and Australia. New routes generally bring an increase in tourism, which boosts local businesses, job creation, and infrastructure growth.

For Queenstown, the new seasonal route from Brisbane not only makes it more accessible for adventure tourists but also enhances local employment in the tourism and hospitality sectors. Air New Zealand’s additional capacity on routes between Brisbane and Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch opens up more opportunities for international business travelers, fostering cross-border trade and collaboration.

The addition of the Christchurch ↔ Rarotonga seasonal flight will stimulate growth in the Pacific Islands tourism sector as well, bringing more travelers to Rarotonga and enhancing connections between New Zealand and the Cook Islands. This will also foster more cultural exchanges and increase awareness of Pacific Island tourism globally.

Sustainability and Air New Zealand’s Commitment to the Environment

Air New Zealand is renowned for its commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. With the addition of these new routes, the airline is working hard to implement eco-friendly initiatives to ensure the growth of air travel is balanced with environmental responsibility.

These efforts include:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which reduces carbon emissions from flights.

More fuel-efficient aircraft, which Air New Zealand has been integrating into its fleet over recent years.

Carbon offset programs, allowing passengers to voluntarily offset their travel-related carbon emissions.

Through these sustainability measures, Air New Zealand is not only enhancing connectivity but also contributing to the broader effort to make air travel more environmentally conscious.

Traveler Tips: Making the Most of These New Routes

With the launch of these new routes, it’s important for travelers to take full advantage of the opportunity. Here are some tips to make the most out of Air New Zealand’s new services:

Book Early for Best Prices: Air New Zealand typically offers the best deals for early bookings. Take advantage of this to save money on your flight.

Explore New Destinations: With these new routes, travelers now have the chance to experience Queenstown’s adventure tourism, Auckland’s thriving city life, and Rarotonga’s tropical beauty in a more convenient and affordable way.

Take Advantage of Air New Zealand’s Loyalty Programs: Travelers can benefit from the airline’s Frequent Flyer Program, which offers points and rewards for frequent travelers.

Connect with Local Activities: Once at your destination, make sure to explore not only the popular tourist spots but also local hidden gems. For example, in Wellington, you can explore lesser-known nature reserves and cultural museums.

What Makes These New Routes Stand Out

Each of Air New Zealand’s new routes is carefully designed to meet the growing demand for easy access to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. But what sets them apart?

Queenstown ↔ Brisbane: The fact that this route is a seasonal, direct flight makes it highly attractive to adventure travelers who want to visit Queenstown’s ski resorts, bungy jumping locations, and vineyards without the hassle of long travel times.

Brisbane ↔ Auckland/Wellington/Christchurch: The increased capacity on these routes ensures that business and leisure travelers alike can find more flight options to these vibrant cities, making it easier to attend business meetings, festivals, and explore New Zealand’s natural beauty.

Christchurch ↔ Rarotonga: This route directly connects two beautiful destinations that are often overlooked. Rarotonga’s pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters make it a perfect getaway for those seeking tropical relaxation after exploring Christchurch’s gardens and mountain ranges.

Each of these routes allows travelers to experience New Zealand and the Pacific Islands in a more seamless and connected way, making these regions more accessible to global tourists.

Looking Ahead: More Routes and Future Expansion Plans

While Air New Zealand is making significant strides with its new routes, it’s clear that this expansion is only the beginning. The airline has indicated that it plans to continue expanding its network to meet the increasing demand for travel between Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.

Future route expansions could include:

More seasonal or year-round routes connecting New Zealand with other Pacific Islands such as Tahiti, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands.

Additional connections between New Zealand and Asia, expanding options for tourists and business travelers who wish to visit both regions.

More flights to North America and Europe, offering travelers new, convenient ways to travel between these major continents.

Air New Zealand’s continued growth is an exciting development for both the aviation industry and tourism. As the world continues to recover from the global pandemic, Air New Zealand is setting the stage for a vibrant and interconnected future for international travel.

Conclusion: Why Air New Zealand’s New Routes Are a Game-Changer for Travel

Air New Zealand’s newly launched and enhanced routes are more than just a means of getting from one place to another. They represent new opportunities for travelers to explore the beautiful destinations of New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. From the thrill of Queenstown’s adventure tourism to the tranquil beaches of Rarotonga, these routes make travel easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

Whether you’re an adventure seeker, a culture lover, or someone looking to unwind in a tropical paradise, Air New Zealand’s new routes are designed to make these dream destinations more accessible. The added capacity on existing routes between Brisbane and Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch further solidifies Air New Zealand’s position as the leading carrier in the region.

The flight marks the restart of the assembly entirely with domestic components, as part of ongoing efforts to replace foreign suppliers.

The maiden flight lasted 1 hour and 10 minutes. The aircraft, which subsequently flew from Kazan to Minsk on 17 December, supports the Russian government’s import-substitution policy for the aviation sector.

This Tu-214 was initially reported as intended for Tatarstan-based UVT-Aero. However, UVT-Aero has stated it will focus on other aircraft types in coordination with the federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia.

UVT-Aero’s chief, Pyotr Trubaev, has said the carrier is examining the Ilyushin Il-114-300 and the Yakovlev SJ-100, both featuring significant domestic content. Aeroflot Group previously considered adding Tu-214s but is reportedly prioritizing MC-21s instead, said Flight Global.

State lessor GTLK committed to over 40 Tu-214s last year, reflecting broader fleet modernization efforts. Red Wings has recently taken delivery of Tu-214s, but these were older aircraft refurbished from storage rather than newly manufactured.

The Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade launched a restoration and airworthiness program for the Tu-204/214, Il-96, and An-124 in October 2022, initially targeting 12 aircraft for return to service by 2024.

The program has been extended to 2027 to accommodate delivery delays and modernization needs, underlining the Tu-214’s role in sustaining Russian domestic air transport.

The Tu-214, developed as a variant of the Tu-204 and first flown in 1996, features higher gross weight and additional fuel capacity compared to its predecessor. It is produced at the Kazan Aviation Plant, while the Tu-204 is assembled in Ulyanovsk with a different door configuration.",https://www.airdatanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tu-214-kazan.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:06.114082

O certame está orçamentado em 7,5 milhões de euros, com uma parte a ser financiada por dinheiros públicos e outra por patrocinadores, mas a participação do público é gratuita. “O Air Invictus está alinhado com a “Estratégia 2035″, visando parcerias que estão a ser estabelecidas com países do mundo árabe e da Ásia, entre outros mercados”, é adiantado.

Os autarcas Luís Filipe Menezes e Pedro Duarte são dois dos principais entusiastas do regresso dos aviões ao Douro. Menezes falou do assunto durante a campanha e logo após a sua eleição para a presidência da autarquia gaiense, sempre com o objetivo acolher iniciativas a abranger as duas autarquias.

O programa engloba corrida de aviões, acrobacias aéreas, demonstrações militares pela Força Aérea Portuguesa, demonstrações policiais pelo Grupo de Operações Especiais/PSP, um festival de aeromodelismo, festivais de drones com a tentativa de bater o recorde da Europa na praia do Titan (Matosinhos); exposições de meios aéreos e militares com batismos de voo e festivais de música, entre outras iniciativas.

A Força Aérea Portuguesa é o parceiro oficial do Air Invictus e irá envolver diversas aeronaves como o KC 390, C 295, F 16 e os Super Tucanos. Haverá um F16 colocado na margem de Gaia e dois outros aviões do lado do Porto.

Um dos eventos associados é o “Eyes in the sky”, a primeira feira e “summit” da indústria de defesa aérea e aeroespacial, que irá mostrar na Alfândega do Porto, em 5000 m2 de exposição, “o que de melhor as empresas portuguesas estão a inovar, produzir e exportar para todo o mundo, e que trará ao nosso país visitantes, expositores, especialistas e cientistas para várias conferências”. Estará patente até ao dia 23 de junho. Haverá uma forte promoção internacional com ativações, campanhas na televisão e nas redes sociais, entre outras.

O regresso das aeronaves ao Douro “engloba uma componente de literacia aeronáutica para as escolas da região Norte, com visitas, palestras, contacto com pilotos e aviões, bem como batismos de voo, onde se pretende que os mais novos voltem a ganhar a paixão pelo espaço e pela aviação”, como explica a organização.

A organização refere que um forte dispositivo ficará estacionado no Aeródromo Vilar de Luz, na Maia, estando a ser equacionada a possibilidade de organizar um encontro mundial de “Chipmunks”, que comemoram 75 anos em 2026. Certa é a vinda dos “Warbirds”, aviões da segunda guerra mundial e que estarão em exposição no concelho maiato. O município será o centro das operações, com acrobacias, descolagens e aterragens, e batismos de voo. A organização espera que mais de 200 mil pessoas visitem o aeródromo no evento.
