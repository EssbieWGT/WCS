Jacquelyn Francis: So it's going to be a first-of-its-kind methane prize that's focused on the food systems.
There are also supplements that can be given to cattle and vaccines that can reduce their methane emissions by about 80-85%.
The real barrier for sustainable aviation fuel is not the technology and what can be done with biotechnology solutions in aviation fuel, but that it costs more.","Jacquelyn Francis founded The Global Warming Mitigation Project in 2017 when she realized that existing climate entrepreneurs around the world needed more exposure.

Since then, the Aspen-based organization, now called Climate Curve, has awarded $2.75 million to 80 innovators working to curb climate change. The awardees have gone on to raise $2.87 billion in investments.

In February 2026, Climate Curve is launching a new prize focused on methane emissions from food systems. The Climate Curve Prize: Methane will distribute $200,000 across eight solutions worldwide.

Francis told Aspen Public Radio’s Michael Fanelli that methane emissions are growing worldwide, and curbing them could act as a “parachute” to slow the trajectory of global warming.

The conversation below has been edited for clarity and length.

Michael Fanelli: Tell me about the forthcoming methane prize.

Jacquelyn Francis: So it's going to be a first-of-its-kind methane prize that's focused on the food systems. And that basically means everything from soil to soil. So everything where it's grown in agriculture, to livestock, to how things are transported. And also the waste, like what happens before and after it's thrown away, and it's a full cycle kind of idea of circular economy.

MF: Why is this an important thing to focus on now methane?

JF: Methane is just increasing in our world right now, and there's not a lot being done about that. It is a very potent greenhouse gas. It actually disperses into the atmosphere quite quickly. And it's a heat-trapping gas that actually traps 85% more heat than carbon dioxide. So if we were able to actually reduce our man-made methane impacts, then it could be considered like an emergency brake on our global heating that's happening right now. This could give us more time to actually move past some of the other really more embedded systems that we have in our world when it comes to fossil fuels. We're basically falling into a volcano, our entire civilization, and methane [reduction] is a way to kind of slow our fall.

MF: It sounds like this might have an agricultural focus. Can you talk about how this might be relevant to locals here in the Roaring Fork Valley?

JF: Yeah for sure, agriculture and waste [are] all part of our food systems. There are ways that you can actually grow your food differently that can produce less emissions. There are ways that you can feed your cattle differently to increase their ability to digest the food so that they don't have as much methane gas coming from their systems. There are also supplements that can be given to cattle and vaccines that can reduce their methane emissions by about 80-85%. A lot of companies are working on covering landfills in order to capture the methane emissions and then use them as an energy source.

MF: Your main thing you do as an organization is the Keeling Curve Prize. I realize there's been a lot, but can you think of an example or two of a memorable standout project that has won?

JF: There are a few that have really gone on to be incredible investment opportunities. One of those is a company called LanzaTech that actually is a publicly traded company now, and they make materials out of carbon that comes from all different kinds of sources. And one of the things they're working on is sustainable aviation fuel. So I've done a lot of extra work with LanzaTech as well, because I'm really, really interested in the idea of creating a market around sustainable aviation fuel. The real barrier for sustainable aviation fuel is not the technology and what can be done with biotechnology solutions in aviation fuel, but that it costs more. And we're not really willing as a society to pay more for our aviation fuel, which I find to be something that should change. So LanzaTech is one of them. We have a lot of nature-based solutions that I find super interesting. One of them, Canopy Planet, is about supply chains and getting your products from verified sources that have good practices.

MF: Was there anything else that you wanted to touch on?

JF: I think one of the things that I'd like your listeners to hear is: this is a problem that's fixable. And in my view, there are four existential crises in our world. It's nuclear warfare; it's an asteroid hitting us; it's some kind of biological or virus that takes everybody out that's much more powerful than Covid; And it's climate change — climate systems change. And I think people don't understand that this is such an important issue that we can solve, and this is probably the one out of those four that is the most solvable by human ingenuity and momentum building. We can do this. We just have to put more money behind it and more awareness and take on the challenge, just like humans are able to do in a lot of other situations. This is a huge endeavor, but we can do it, and the opportunities around it are — they're just immense. And that's what I want people to understand, that you have to do something about it, and we have to do something about it now, but we can.

MF: I think that's a good note to end on.

The new 10‑year Cleaner Fuels Program is designed to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.
“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia,” said Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers.
“Low carbon liquid fuels are essential for heavy vehicles and machinery that cannot yet be easily electrified,” he said.
Fast Fact Australia’s new $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program aims to kick-start domestic production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, with first ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels expected by 2029.","The Australian Federal Government has announced it is investing $1.1 billion in low carbon liquid fuels.

This investment will reportedly bolster the sustainable fuel supply chain for all modes of transport.

The new 10‑year Cleaner Fuels Program is designed to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has access to feedstocks including canola, sorghum, sugar and waste – the goods needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives could deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock, will reportedly help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make domestic fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the government’s support via the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia,” said Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global Net Zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global Net Zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, said making cleaner fuels locally from Australian feedstocks creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production,” he said.

“A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Murray Watt, Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, said it is essential to invest in future fuels as demand for air travel grows and more goods are moved by road and rail.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels,” he said.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Julie Collins, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, said this investment is great news for farmers and regional communities.

“Producing more low carbon liquid fuels right here in Australia won’t just benefit our fuel security and emissions reduction, it will support Australian farmers, foresters and our regions,” she said.

“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.

“This investment will complement our National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy – which we are developing so our agricultural sector can seize the economic opportunities that come with feedstocks.”

NatRoad CEO, Warren Clark, also welcomes this announcement which is in line with NatRoad’s recommendations as part of its advocacy efforts.

“It’s good to see the Federal Government is listening to industry and taking action,” said Clark.

“NatRoad has been working behind the scenes for years now and thanks the government and the departments for making solid progress.

“We have provided multiple submissions recommending low carbon diesel as a key component of the broader plan, and providing monetary support to help kick-start the support and businesses required to reduce heavy vehicle emissions as we transition to Net Zero.

“This includes NatRoad’s Stronger Economy, Lower Emissions policy paper that included low carbon liquid fuels as one of our critical recommendations to government, and this week we provided a submission to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into cheaper, cleaner energy solutions that supported policies aimed at increasing supply and lowering prices of low-carbon fuels.”

Clark added that while NatRoad welcomes this investment, managing the cost of using alternative fuels for road transport operators will be critical to their effectiveness in lowering heavy vehicle emissions.

“We have made it clear in our advocacy that the road transport industry needs a ‘fair go’ transition strategy, with a clear and cost-effective policy framework to ensure road transport operators aren’t forced to absorb higher fuel costs,” said Clark.

“This is particularly important at a time when margins are incredibly tight, and operators are already dealing with significant uncertainty around costs.”

Clark said the road freight sector is ready to adapt and support the transition to lower carbon-emitting ways of operating, but it is vital that measures are put in place to ensure as many road transport businesses can participate as possible.

“About 98 per cent of the road freight industry consists of small businesses, and we must ensure carbon reduction initiatives aren’t too costly, time consuming or complicated for them to take part,” said Clark.

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Federal Government to help bring about a transition to net zero emissions that is fair, cost-effective and accessible for all the road freight industry.”

In addition to its regular submissions to government on emissions-reduction initiatives, NatRoad has developed a Get Fleet Fit roadmap aimed at helping truck operators cut costs, improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions as part of the Net Zero transition.

Meanwhile, Victorian Transport Association (VTA) CEO, Peter Anderson, described this investment as a vital step in supporting the industry’s transition to a lower-emissions future.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are essential for heavy vehicles and machinery that cannot yet be easily electrified,” he said.

“Supporting local production of these fuels will help reduce emissions while maintaining the reliability and resilience of our supply chains.

“The VTA has long advocated for a supported and realistic transition, and this announcement shows the government understands that decarbonising freight will take time, investment and collaboration.

“We also urge continued support for freight operators, particularly small and medium businesses, as they adapt to new fuel technologies and infrastructure.”

The VTA continues to lead industry efforts to decarbonise through education, advocacy and collaboration.

On 18 November, the VTA hosted its Alternative Fuel Summit in Melbourne, bringing together experts, operators and policymakers to explore the theme ‘Is transport ready to decarbonise?’.

Now in its fourth iteration, the summit reflects the VTA’s ongoing commitment to helping members navigate the transition to low-emission technologies. The event will provide a platform for robust discussion and practical insights into the readiness of the freight sector for this significant shift.

“The Alternative Fuel Summit is about bringing the industry together to ask the hard questions and share knowledge,” said Anderson. “We’re proud to play a role in guiding our members through this transition and ensuring they’re equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of a low-carbon future.”

Australian Logistics Council CEO, Dr Hermione Parsons, said the commitment is a milestone that recognises the scale of change required across the economy.

“Freight and supply chains enable every sector from agriculture to resources to health care,” she said.

“Decarbonising these systems is not simply an environmental imperative, it is essential to national productivity, resilience and prosperity. The Net Zero Plan sets a platform for action, and the ALC advocates for freight to be positioned at the centre of this transition.”

The plan, according to the ALC, identifies clean electricity, electrification, low carbon fuels and technology innovation as national priorities to ensure freight can contribute effectively to these goals.

“The ALC considers it essential to develop a nationally coordinated transition plan for heavy vehicles,” said Dr Parsons.

“This should include measures such as corridor charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, depot energy planning, targeted operator incentives and reforms to licensing frameworks that currently limit workforce participation.

“The ALC also recommends addressing the operational realities of rail freight, including access regimes, pricing and last-mile bottlenecks to enable genuine mode shift rather than a narrow focus on new technologies.

“Freight continuity, redundancy and cross-border protocols should be embedded into disaster and infrastructure planning to strengthen resilience and prevent communities and businesses from being isolated during crises.”

The transition will also require a workforce transformation, the ALC added.

Investment in skills, training and VET pathways must be matched with deliberate measures to boost diversity and First Nations participation. Licensing and regulatory reforms should also support broader workforce participation, ensuring freight remains safe, efficient and inclusive as the sector modernises.

Infrastructure and construction must also be part of the solution according to the ALC. Measuring and reducing embodied emissions in steel, cement and concrete, embedding circular economy practices and aligning procurement standards will be critical to lowering the carbon footprint of freight infrastructure.

This demands cross-government collaboration, harmonised policy settings, consistent emissions reporting frameworks and interoperable data systems.

Dr Parsons said ALC will work closely with government to ensure the freight sector is positioned at the heart of the transition.

“Australia cannot reach its climate goals without freight,” she said.

“Placing freight at the centre of planning and reform will strengthen supply chains, deliver energy security and create new opportunities for investment and jobs.

“We welcome the ambition of the 2035 target and the Net Zero Plan, and we look forward to working with government and industry to build a resilient, productive and sustainable freight system that supports a prosperous, low-emissions future for Australia.”

Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Previous studies have been limited in spatial scale or focused on the first years after establishment, early in the perennial life cycle. But Lee’s group is working to provide more realistic, long-term solutions to maximize biomass productivity and grow a more sustainable fuel industry.

In the first of two recent studies, Lee’s team conducted an economic and environmental analysis of two harvest methods for switchgrass.

“Harvesting operations account for 60-80% of the total production costs for switchgrass,” said Muhammad Umer Arshad, postdoctoral researcher in Lee’s group and first author on the Bioresource Technology paper. “We wanted to understand why the harvesting cost is so high and how each operation contributes to cost, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as identify where reductions are possible.”

Arshad explains that switchgrass harvesting can happen via the stepwise method, in which tasks like mowing, raking, baling, and roadsiding are separated into individual operations; or the integrated method, which uses different equipment to consolidate mowing and raking into one pass. Hypothetically, an integrated approach could reduce effort, energy consumption, and costs. But, after analyzing data from 125 Virginia commercial-scale sites varying in field size and biomass yield, Arshad found a more nuanced answer.

“We found that the integrated method makes more sense for smaller fields (less than 3 hectares, or 10 acres) and low-yield (less than 3.2 tons per acre) conditions, reducing GHG emissions by 9% and energy use by 5%,” Arshad said. “The stepwise method was better for large fields with high biomass yield, reducing harvesting costs to $37.70 per ton and achieving the lowest GHG emissions.”

The costs were estimated assuming the farmers are using their own machinery, tractors, and harvesting equipment.

Lee adds that the results reveal the importance of tailoring harvesting strategies to site-specific conditions and provide the first evidence-based guidance that harvest methods can improve both economic and environmental outcomes.

In a separate study published in Biomass & Bioenergy, the team tackled age-related declines in Miscanthus biomass yield, a function of tiller (stem) mass and density. These long-lived perennial grasses follow a predictable growth trajectory, including a juvenile stage that builds over several years to reach peak biomass yield, followed by a slow decline after about 10 years. Until now, it wasn’t clear which components of yield change over time and how nutrient management might help.

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi analyzed data from a long-term Miscanthus trial with nitrogen fertilization treatments that varied in amount and timing. First, he looked at how tiller mass and density changed over time and with various nitrogen treatments. Then, he asked what other soil fertility factors may influence the decline in biomass yield in older stands.

“We found that both tiller mass and density increase from the first year of establishment to the fourth year, and if you apply nitrogen, you get an increase in both factors,” Namoi said. “But over time, as you withdraw nitrogen by harvesting biomass, the first component to be impacted is tiller mass. So tiller mass is very sensitive to nitrogen management.”

Namoi adds that tiller density continues to increase until individual stands become saturated, with no more space for further expansion. After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.

He notes that the decline in biomass yield over time may not be entirely tied to nitrogen. With every harvest, soil nutrients tied up in plant biomass are removed from the system, depleting elements that play a role in photosynthetic efficiency. When Namoi analyzed soil phosphorus and potassium in mature Miscanthus stands, he found significant deficits in both essential nutrients.

“Our findings identify tiller mass as a key determinant of biomass yield in aging Miscanthus and highlight the need for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium management for long-term productivity,” he said.

Both studies provide practical guidance to increase profitability, a key factor for any producer looking to explore biomass crops.

The first study, “Optimizing bioenergy biofuel harvest: a comparative analysis of stepwise and integrated methods for economic and environmental sustainability,” is published in Bioresource Technology [DOI: 10.1016/j.biortech.2025.133288].

The second study, “Soil fertility management for sustainable Miscanthus × giganteus production: Increased tiller weight from nitrogen management explains yield gains in aged miscanthus,” is published in Biomass & Bioenergy [DOI: 10.1016/j.biombioe.2025.108394].

Research in the College of ACES is made possible in part by Hatch funding from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. This work was also funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Bioenergy Technologies Office (DOE-BETO) under Award Number (DE-EE0008521) and the DOE Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program under Award Number DE-SC0018420).

Japan agreed to $8 billion in American agricultural purchases including corn, soybeans, ethanol, fertilizer, and sustainable aviation fuel.
At the same time, President Trump is securing new, unprecedented market access for American agricultural producers around the world.","(Washington, D.C., December 8, 2025) – President Donald J. Trump alongside U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (AR), Senator Deb Fischer (NE), Senator John Hoeven (ND), Representative Austin Scott (GA), and farmers from Arkansas, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas today announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will make $12 billion available in one time bridge payments to American farmers in response to temporary trade market disruptions and increased production costs that are still impacting farmers following four years of disastrous Biden Administration policies that resulted in record high input prices and zero new trade deals. These bridge payments are intended in part to aid farmers until historic investments from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), including reference prices which are set to increase between 10-21% for major covered commodities such as soybeans, corn, and wheat and will reach eligible farmers on October 1, 2026.

Of the $12 billion provided, up to $11 billion will be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) Program, which provides broad relief to United States row crop farmers who produce Barley, Chickpeas, Corn, Cotton, Lentils, Oats, Peanuts, Peas, Rice, Sorghum, Soybeans, Wheat, Canola, Crambe, Flax, Mustard, Rapeseed, Safflower, Sesame, and Sunflower. FBA will help address market disruptions, elevated input costs, persistent inflation, and market losses from foreign competitors engaging in unfair trade practices that impede exports. The FBA Program applies simple, proportional support to producers using a uniform formula to cover a portion of modeled losses during the 2025 crop year. This national loss average is based on FSA reported planted acres, Economic Research Service cost of production estimates, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates yields and prices and economic modeling.

Farmers who qualify for the FBA Program can expect payments to be released by February 28, 2026. Eligible farmers should ensure their 2025 acreage reporting is factual and accurate by 5pm ET on December 19, 2025. Commodity-specific payment rates will be released by the end of the month. Crop insurance linkage will not be required for the FBA Program; however, USDA strongly urges producers to take advantage of the new OBBBA risk management tools to best protect against price risk and volatility in the future.

The remaining $1 billion of the $12 billion in bridge payments will be reserved for commodities not covered in the FBA Program such as specialty crops and sugar, for example, though details including timelines for those payments are still under development and require additional understanding of market impacts and economic needs.

The $12 billion in farmer bridge payments, including those provided through the FBA Program, are authorized under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act and will be administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

To submit questions, justification for USDA farmer bridge aid, or to request a meeting on farmer bridge aid, producers can reach out to farmerbridge@usda.gov.

“Four years under the failed Biden Administration continues to leave the American farm economy reeling from record inflation, a depleted farm safety net, and delayed disaster assistance. The lack of new trade deals under the last Administration turned a trade surplus under Trump into a $50 billion trade deficit, causing our farmers to lose markets and feel acute pain from lower commodity prices. President Trump will not let our farmers be left behind, so he directed our team to build a bridge program to see quick relief while the President’s dozens of new trade deals and new market access take effect,” said Secretary Brooke Rollins. “The plan we are announcing today ensures American farmers can continue to plan for the next crop year. It is imperative we do what it takes to help our farmers, because if we cannot feed ourselves, we will no longer have a country. With this program serving as a bridge to the improvements President Trump and Republicans in Congress have made, it will allow farmers to leverage strengthened price protection risk management tools and the reliability of fair trade deals so they do not have to depend on large ad hoc assistance packages from the government.”

Additional Farmer First Actions Taken by the Trump Administration

In addition to $12 billion in bridge payments announced today, the Trump Administration has been working around the clock since January 20th to put American farmers first after inheriting one of the worst farm economies the country has experienced in decades. The following actions have been taken to date and together show historic investments and bold and unrelenting dedication to helping our nation’s farmers thrive again.

Over $30 Billion in Ad Hoc Assistance Delivered to Farmers Since January 2025

Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) is helping farmers recover from the economic hardships of 2024. This program distributed more than $9.3 billion to over 560,000 farmers for soy, corn, sorghum, and other row crops.

Marketing Assistance for Specialty Crops (MASC) is helping specialty crop producers recover from rising input costs and other market disruptions stemming from the Biden Administration. This program distributed over 1.8 billion in assistance to over 52,000 producers.

The Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP) is helping producers recover from severe weather events in 2023 and 2024. This program has distributed nearly $6 billion to over 388,000 farmers with up to an additional $9 billion to be distributed over the next four months.

Over $2.5 billion via block grants delivered to states and sugar beet and cane processors via block grants to cover losses from 2023 and 2024 that were left uncovered by existing USDA programs.

Trump Supported OBBBA Farmer Wins

With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, President Trump has made crop insurance more workable and affordable for American farmers and ranchers. Crop insurance is an essential risk management tool that allows American farmers and ranchers endure weather and market volatility. The bill increases crop insurance premium support for beginning farmers and ranchers by expanding the definition from five to 10 years of experience, enabling more producers to qualify for assistance over a longer period. These improvements will result in over $400 million in savings every year for America’s farmers on insurance premiums.

For the first time in over a decade the statutory reference prices for the farm safety net programs, ARC and PLC, were raised by 10-21% for major commodities such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Thanks to OBBBA USDA is also expanding eligibility for these price support programs by adding more than 30 million new base acres to the program making them eligible for future PLC or ARC payments starting in crop year 2026.

OBBBA extended the marketing assistance loan programs through 2031 and updated loan rates for major commodities beginning in the 2026 crop year, providing stronger loan rates for crops like wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans.

The bill included historic investments to the domestic sugar programs and USDA made them available starting October 1, 2025. The loan rate for raw cane sugar has increased to an average 24 cents per pound for the 2025 - 2031 crop years, with refined beet sugar rates increased to an average of 32.77 cents per pound.

OBBBA invested in USDA’s major conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). These funds will result in over $34B in conservation work on agricultural land over the next 10 years.

OBBBA provides $285 million a year for agricultural trade promotion and facilitation. This is in addition to the existing $234M per year of funding for MAP and FMD. These dollars are key to opening and expanding foreign markets.

OBBBA included many important tax provisions for farmers and ranchers. Some of the most impactful provisions for agriculture are the permanency of the 20% qualified business income deduction, full bonus depreciation and the $15 million per individual estate tax exemption, now also indexed for inflation. With the current land values, equipment costs and input prices, even modest-sized farms can easily exceed that threshold, meaning upon the owner’s death, far more family operations would face massive tax bills than previously estimated. A permanent bonus depreciation means that farmers can continue to write off the entire cost of new equipment, land improvements, new barns and other capital upgrades in the year of purchase, rather than depreciating them over many years.

Oversight on Competition & Farmer Input Costs

On September 26, 2025, the USDA and the Department of Justice signed a Memorandum of Understanding (PDF, 1.3 MB) that represents a joint commitment by both agencies to protect American farmers and ranchers from the burdens imposed by high and volatile input costs—such as feed, fertilizer, fuel, seed, equipment, and other essential goods—while ensuring competitive supply chains, lower consumer prices, and the resilience of U.S. agriculture and the food supply.

On December 6, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to stop price fixing, anti-competitive behavior, and foreign influence that drives up prices and threatens the security of America’s food supply. This EO recognizes that sectors including seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment may be vulnerable to anti-competitive manipulation that result in higher prices for farmers and seeks to take aggressive action in part by the establishment of Task Forces created to investigate price fixing and anti-competitive behavior, especially regarding foreign owned entities.

These actions combined reiterate the Trump Administration’s commitment to scrutinizing competitive conditions in the agricultural marketplace, including antitrust enforcement that promotes free market competition.

Lowering Farm Labor Costs through Deregulatory Actions

Farm labor costs alone increased 47% since 2020 largely due to the high cost of utilizing the H-2A program to secure seasonal labor under the Biden Administration who artificially inflated Adverse Effect Wage Rates set by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) using USDA’s Farm Labor Survey which was never designed to be used for setting government-mandated wage rates and is duplicative of other DOL data sources. As such, USDA discontinued this survey while DOL issued a bold new interim final rule which decreased wage costs for H-2A agricultural employers resulting in initial savings of at least $2 billion. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule, effective October 2, 2025, to streamline the filing process for certain temporary agricultural worker petitions. These actions combined are making farm labor more affordable and more accessible for American agriculture.

USDA is Prioritizing the Purchase of Healthy U.S. Grown Commodities to Feed Those Most in Need through Section 32 Buys

This year alone, USDA has provided nearly $1 billion in Section 32 purchases, all which benefit the charitable feeding network.

On November 24, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $30 million Section 32 buy of American grown oranges, grapefruit, and mandarins.

On August 6, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $2 million Section 32 buy of invasive Chesapeake Bay blue catfish.

On August 1, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced up to $230 million Section 32 buy of Alaska pollock, catfish, apples, beans and cranberries.

On May 23, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $67 million Section 32 buy of American groundfish, pears, cherries, shrimp and beans.

USDA will continue to buy Section 32 commodity purchases to support American seafood, fruit, vegetable, and tree-nut producers for distribution to U.S. food banks, schools, and other outlets serving low-income individuals. These actions support President Trump’s vision to Make America Healthy Again through U.S. local farmer grown, healthy, and nutritious commodities.

This is the most pro-biofuels Administration in history

President Trump recognizes how important the Renewable Fuel Standard is for American corn and soybean farmers. EPA Administrator Zeldin delivered the boldest Renewable Volume Obligations ever and provided much certainty in the market for our producers while delivering lower prices at the pump for consumers. The RVO gives the markets the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world.

EPA’s decision to allow the summer sale of E-15 constituted 2025 year-round E15 and continues to deliver immediate relief to consumers, give more choices at the pump, and drive demand for corn grown, processed, and used right here in America. America’s national security depends on our energy security, and biofuels are a crucial asset that brings more jobs and helps farmers in rural America.

List of Trade & Market Access Wins to Date

USDA announced applications are now open through January 23, 2026, for the $285 million America First Trade Promotion Program (AFTPP), a key component of the Trump Administration’s work to expand global market access and create new export opportunities for America’s farmers, ranchers, and producers.

Additionally, President Trump and his administration have worked to pen new trade deals and trade frameworks with more than 15 countries.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein will invest at least $200 billion in the United States, remove tariffs on several agricultural products, allow for market access for American beef, bison, and poultry, and remove non-tariff barriers for poultry and dairy.

El Salvador has removed non-tariff barriers including fumigation requirements and arbitrary geographic indicator restrictions on dairy product names.

Argentina will allow access for U.S. poultry and poultry products, within one year, and simplify red tape for U.S. exporters of beef, beef products, pork, and pork products. Argentina also has agreed to protect U.S. exporters’ use of certain meat and cheese terms, preserving market access and creating the potential for new opportunities in the region.

Ecuador has reduced or eliminated tariffs on American nuts, wheat, and wine; and will reduce major non-tariff barriers for many agricultural products regarding import licensing and facility registration requirements.

Guatemala will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in its market; maintain science- and risk-based regulatory frameworks; and efficient authorization processes for agricultural products.

China committed to delaying new export controls on rare earth minerals, resume large purchases of U.S. soybeans, sorghum, and more. To date, China is already purchasing additional soybeans, wheat, and sorghum.

Malaysia will provide significant market access for U.S. products like dairy, horticultural products, poultry, pork, rice, and ethanol; recognize the U.S. food safety systems for U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy products; streamline its halal certification of U.S. food and agricultural products; and open market access for U.S. sorghum.

Cambodia will eliminate 100% of its tariffs on U.S. products, while the U.S. maintains a 19% reciprocal tariff rate for imports from Cambodia. It will also recognize the U.S. scientific guidelines for most U.S. agricultural goods and food.

Thailand will eliminate tariffs on 99% of U.S. goods, including most food and agricultural products and expedite access for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service-certified meat and poultry products, giving American producers unprecedented access to the market.

Vietnam will accept preferential access for U.S. agricultural goods, including specialty cheese and meats, and is already improving access for U.S. peaches and nectarines. Vietnam will pay the United States 20% tariffs on all goods and 40% on any transshipped goods

South Korea will pay 15 percent tariff to the United States.

European Union will purchase $750 billion of American energy and addressing non-tariff barriers for farmers and ranchers - pork and dairy products. Market access for U.S. agricultural goods like tree nuts, sorghum, and more will also be provided as we work to commit to a simpler regulatory agenda.

Philippines is opening their market to the United States and charging us zero tariffs while the Philippines will pay 19 percent tariffs to the United States.

Indonesia will eliminate 90 percent of tariffs on American exports including for all agricultural products.

Japan agreed to $8 billion in American agricultural purchases including corn, soybeans, ethanol, fertilizer, and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan will increase US rice imports by 75%.

United Kingdom will create $5 billion in new agricultural export opportunities. $700 million in ethanol and better market access for American beef.

At the same time, President Trump is securing new, unprecedented market access for American agricultural producers around the world. For example, wine exports to Mexico are up 30 percent in 2025, reaching $18 million; South Korea has purchased $1 billion in corn, more than double from 2024; Bangladesh purchased $172 million in soybeans; Costa Rica streamlined its dairy access for U.S. producers; and India cut its bourbon tariff in half.

As the Victorian Farmers Federation president, he sees an opportunity for the agricultural industry in the growth of low-carbon fuels.

""We've seen it overseas for many years now.""

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050, with many across the agricultural and industrial sectors saying it is an untapped market.

Renewable or low-carbon fuels are alternatives to fossil fuels and are often made from agricultural feedstock, such as canola oil, or waste products.

They are used in industries that cannot be easily electrified, such as heavy transport or aviation.

The United States, Brazil and the European Union are the largest low-carbon fuel producers globally.

Liquid gold

Australia exported nearly 6 million tonnes of canola from 2023–2024 to be turned into biofuel overseas.

Now industry is advocating to create a domestic market for Australia to create and use its own biofuel.

""It will be a big boost for farmers, to be sure,"" Mr Hosking said.

""We produce an incredibly high-quality product … using very low emissions in our cropping systems.""

Industry body GrainCorp's head of agri-energy Jesse Scott said a local industry would lead to more investment in regional Australia and would service domestic demand.

GrainCorp is working with Ampol and super fund IFM Investors to refine canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry.

""I fully expect that all parts of Australia are going to contribute feedstock,"" Mr Scott said, adding that Victoria would play a major role.

Waste not

In Victoria's east, a feasibility study is underway at the Australian Paper Mill, near Morwell, to investigate the viability of producing a new biofuel.

The paper mill's owner, Opal, has partnered with renewables developer European Energy Australia to assess the feasibility of carbon capture at the mill to capture biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2).

Biogenic CO2 is carbon dioxide produced from natural sources, and is already produced at the Maryvale facility as a by-product of pulping from one of its boilers.

When combined with renewable energy and water, biogenic CO2 can be used in the production of e-methanol, a low-carbon fuel and alternative to fossil fuels that can be used in freight ships.

European Energy has already used this technology in Denmark to supply e-methanol to international shipping companies.

Opal's general manager of environment and sustainability, David Jettner, said it was still early days but the project had the potential to generate between $25 million and $30 million.

Should it prove to be successful, the project could deliver a significant injection into the local economy — a substantial turnaround for the company, which axed 400 jobs in 2023.

Trash into treasure

The study is not the first biofuel project being explored in the Gippsland region.

An upcycling facility planned for the Wellington Shire that will recycle household waste into hydrogen and low-carbon fuels has been given the green light.

The project, being run by Zerogen, Boson Energy and Xseed Solutions, aims to extract hydrogen for aviation fuel by gasifying household waste.

Zerogen director Scott McArdle said the project would help to reduce waste while developing a low-carbon fuel that could be used in transport, particularly in aviation.

""We are targeting those municipal waste, kerbside garbage, non-recyclables,"" Mr McArdle said.

""Being able to reduce the existing pressures on our landfill infrastructure, we get to extend the life of those facilities and create new industries around it.""

Director of XSeed Solutions Craig Allen said the partners were working to secure funding, but the aim was to be operational by 2028.

""Our Gippsland project continues to progress well,"" he said.

""We're working closely with our partners as they finalise the initial funding round, which is expected to reach completion within the next couple of months.""

Need for a fuel injection

As part of its Future Made in Australia plan, the federal government is fast-tracking support for a low-carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry, recently announcing a $1 billion fund to encourage private investors to develop the market.

The government says the domestic LCLF industry will initially focus on sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel to reduce emissions in fuel-reliant sectors, including transport, mining and agriculture.

By 2040, an Australian renewable fuels industry could directly support 13,000 jobs and contribute $13 billion in GDP annually.

While the grants process has been welcomed by industry, proponents say more needs to be done to get it off the ground.

Mr Hosking said Australia would do well to follow the lead of the United Kingdom and European Union and mandate the use of LCLF, to guarantee a market for investors.

""We are talking billions of dollars to build a low-carbon liquid fuel plant, so it's not a small investment for anyone,"" he said.

""What we need is government to send a signal that there will be a guaranteed market for that product at the end.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/27eebb5b5c6afd5c799a42e20e0e3e6e?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1578&cropW=2805&xPos=0&yPos=344&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:01.902828

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) shared about the new tax in a November 2025 press release. Known as the “Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy,” the tax will apply to most flights departing from Singapore. These include passenger planes, cargo shipments, and “general and business aviation flights,” according to the government.

For most passengers, that levy won’t put too much of an added expense to their departure from Singapore. Depending on their cabin and flight destination, the additional fee will range from S$1 to S$41.60. That’s up to around $32 on the levy’s higher end. Travelers will see the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy as a distinct fee listed when booking with airlines, as part of their airfare. Notably, the Singaporean government will not tax travelers passing through the country on their way to their ultimate destination.

CAAS detailed that the levy money collected will solely be used to purchase “SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs)3.” It will also go toward covering “associated administrative costs.” Implementing the tax is Singapore’s way of hitting its goals for more sustainable air travel, with target dates in 2026 and 2030. With the rollout of the “SAF Levy,” Singapore will be the first country in the world to explicitly tax its flyers for the usage of the eco-friendly fuel.

What Else Is There To Know About Singapore’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy?

Flyers will begin seeing the tax on their airfare for tickets sold from April 1, 2026, applying to flights departing on or after October 1, 2026. How much tax will be tacked on depends on the length of a passenger’s flight and how much SAF the plane will need to fly, with aircraft required to use at least 1% of the more eco-friendly fuel. The Singaporean government notes that the levy is also determined by “the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel, and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery.”

In addition to where they’ll be flying from Singapore, passengers will also be taxed based on their cabin class. Those flying economy will be taxed less than those flying in a premium cabin. Those in the latter section of the plane will pay four times as much for the levy.

Officials will determine the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy slightly differently for cargo shipments, and for general and business flights. Flights exempt from paying the tax include those made for “charitable or humanitarian purposes.”

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provides insight on what sustainable aviation fuels are. It defines the energy as “renewable or waste-derived aviation fuels that meet sustainability criteria.” The source further asserted that “SAF has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation.”

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,” said CAAS Director-General Mr. Han Kok. “It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses, and the public time to adjust.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZV9mP9XaSwLKrQsC.xFzaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel_noire_articles_954/43efcb6105b6cc970a11ce4c3e0c2fbb,N,,2025-12-08 15:58:26.869298

Riyadh, December 08, 2025 –

Saudia, the national flag carrier of Saudi Arabia, begun operating domestic flights using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) uplifted from Red Sea International Airport in September 2025, conducted in partnership with Red Sea Global.

This milestone underscores Saudia’s ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. It also aligns with the General Authority of Civil Aviation’s Comprehensive Environmental Sustainability Program (CAESP), which aims to reduce the aviation sector’s environmental impact.

Maryam Telmesani, Vice President of Sustainability at Saudia Group, said: “This milestone reflects how Saudia is translating its sustainability vision into concrete results. By turning national ambitions into implementation and collaborating with key partners such as Red Sea Global, we are driving meaningful progress across the Kingdom’s sustainability efforts.”

She added: “Our actions contribute directly to both the Kingdom’s domestic and global efforts to support sustainability and the environment, reinforcing Saudia’s role as a leader in advancing efforts for a more sustainable future for aviation.”

Produced through innovative processes that significantly reduce lifecycle emissions, The operation of SAF-powered flights represents a tangible step within Saudia’s broader contribution to the Kingdom’s sustainability efforts. Saudia Group is expanding its efforts by exploring other alternative fuel technologies, including Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) and Emerging/Synthetic Aviation Fuels (eSAF), as part of the Kingdom’s efforts to manage GHGs, and use all available approaches and pathways to diversify energy sources to support sustainable development. These efforts contribute to the Kingdom’s broader transport sustainability targets, in line with its strategy to reduce carbon emissions.

Raed Albasseet, Group Chief Sustainability and Environment Officer at RSG, said: “We are proud to have been the first to introduce SAF into the Kingdom earlier this year, a milestone that reflects our commitment to reducing our emissions. Saudia was the first airline to operate flights to Red Sea International Airport, and it’s fitting that they are now the first to utilize our sustainable fuel supply.”

He added: “We are committed to utilizing all clean energy technologies, including renewable energy and advanced water reuse to low-carbon emission mobility, we’re setting a new benchmark for responsible, regenerative travel.”

As the Kingdom accelerates its transformation, milestones such as the introduction of sustainable aviation fuels highlight how collective national efforts are reshaping the future of air travel.

Today, challenges move faster, cross more boundaries and demand more interdisciplinary thinking than ever before.

In my work at ICF, a global consulting and technology services company, I see this every day. Our teams are on the front lines of some of the toughest challenges facing our generation.

We help communities detect disease outbreaks earlier by using advanced data analytics and improving communications across federal, state and local public health leaders. We supported the first transatlantic flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel — overcoming one of the hardest barriers to decarbonizing the transportation industry. And we’re using AI-driven digital twins to help utilities navigate rising electricity demand from data centers, while strengthening grid reliability and keeping energy more affordable for vulnerable communities.

None of this work is simple. It requires people who can move between disciplines, ask hard questions and stay grounded in the data.

That mindset starts forming long before someone enters the workforce. The engineers who will tackle tomorrow’s challenges are in classrooms and labs right now, learning how to think, how to collaborate and how to approach uncertainty with curiosity rather than fear. That foundation matters. I know because UC Davis gave me mine.

How UC Davis Shaped the Way I Think

My career was shaped in profound ways by UC Davis. The faculty in the Department of Chemical Engineering were committed to teaching us to think, not just to memorize. My professors insisted we understand the underlying math and physics. They pushed us to break down problems instead of jumping to answers. And they expected a level of precision that, at the time, felt demanding but has served me well.

Just as meaningful were the hands-on experiences that brought engineering to life. Long days in the lab made the equations real. An internship with IBM taught me what I did and didn’t want to do with my degree. Studying abroad in England opened up an entirely new world. Those experiences helped me understand how theory meets reality, and they broadened my perspective.

They prepared me for graduate school at MIT and, ultimately, for a career at ICF that has spanned nearly four decades working at the crossroads of engineering, science, policy and technology. They also grounded me in a particular mindset: Solve the problem in front of you using data, technical rigor and collaboration. That approach has carried me through my entire career, and why I think it is important to give back.

How Small Steps Grew into 20 Years of Momentum

My first gifts to UC Davis were small — contributions to an undergraduate scholarship fund. I wasn’t thinking about “philanthropy.” I was simply grateful for what I had received and wanted the next group of students to have something similar.

Years later, the college reached out with a proposal to support scholarships, upgrade aging lab equipment and help develop a new course called “Design of Coffee.” I loved the idea of making engineering accessible and fun without sacrificing precision. I agreed to support the plan and added a scholarship for a student to study abroad each year, because having that opportunity changed my own path.

Over time, my involvement expanded. I’ve served on the College of Engineering Dean’s Executive Committee for more than a decade, including several years as chair, and now chair the Manetti Shrem Museum Advisory Board. That combination may seem unexpected, but UC Davis has always brought together the analytical and creative, and the more I’ve learned about the university’s remarkable role in California’s art history, the more compelled I’ve felt to support it alongside engineering.

The reward for staying close has been seeing the impact firsthand: meeting students, watching new research and design spaces take shape, seeing labs modernized and hearing from scholarship recipients whose paths were changed because someone invested in them.

At the same time, the needs have grown. Enrollment is rising. State support is down. The demand for modern facilities and interdisciplinary learning environments continues to increase.

With these challenges, it’s important to give back. It’s important to invest in the next generation of changemakers.

Showing Up for the Next Generation

Engineers have always been problem solvers, but the problems ahead — AI ethics, climate resilience, sustainable energy, public health, global-scale digital modernization — require a different level of preparation. Students will need strong fundamentals, yes, but also experience working on messy, multidisciplinary challenges. UC Davis is well-positioned to give them that mix.

Philanthropy helps make that possible. Not just big gifts, but all forms: mentoring, advising, opening doors to internships, volunteering time, sharing hard-earned lessons and giving financially when you can. The three “W’s” as I call them — work, wisdom and wealth — are all essential when it comes to giving back. It’s a collective effort focused on continuity, helping ensure students have access to the kinds of transformative, hands-on experiences that shaped me, and that remain essential for the world they’re stepping into and the problems they’ll help solve.

I’ve spent my career working on complex issues. But nothing has been more meaningful than supporting the UC Davis students who will take on the challenges we can’t yet see. The future will be demanding, but it’s full of promise. And every step we take to support today’s students brings us closer to the breakthroughs our world needs.",https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk2151/files/styles/sf_landscape_16x9/public/media/images/Wasson.png?h=d1cb525d&itok=YANbxV6z,N,,2025-12-08 18:57:05.542047

Topsoe has contributed with technical input to the paper and recommendations on alternative fuel readiness.

Fuel security in Europe is at a crossroads

Over 60% of Europe’s energy is imported, leaving defense operations exposed to external disruptions and market volatility.

Europe is also facing a significant jet fuel deficit. 750,000 barrels per day were imported in July 2025, covering 88% of Europe's average daily demand. Just a few years ago, from 2017 to 2023, imports only accounted for 30% of the region's needs.

This necessitates a reassessment of military fuel readiness.​ Continued reliance on crude oil imports to produce kerosene in European refineries represents an increasing risk due to geopolitical tensions and potential disruptions of the fuel supply chains, not least in wartime.

Dependence on crude oil imports

Declining and uneven refining capacity

NBAA said the legislation has raised “significant concerns for business aviation,” which per Derner has caused some operators to reconsider renewing their leases in the state.
In other words, the buyer of a $600,000 aircraft would be taxed $10,000 because they surpassed that threshold by $100,000.
NBAA is targeting net-zero emissions from business aviation operations by 2050—a goal shared by many U.S. and international organizations.
Derner told FLYING that the Washington coalition may be the first of many.","Aviation industry groups are uniting to fight legislation in Washington state that they argue is based on a “grossly uninformed understanding” of high-value aircraft.

That was the language used by the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), National Air Transportation Association (NATA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), Vertical Aviation International (VAI), Corporate Angel Network (CAN), and Angel Flight West in an April letter to Washington Governor Bob Ferguson.

Earlier this year, Ferguson signed off on a provision that will levy a 10 percent tax on the sale, lease, or transfer of noncommercial aircraft valued at over $500,000—as well as users of those aircraft. Proceeds will be deposited into the state’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Account.

On Monday, NBAA announced it formed a coalition with the explicit goal of opposing the tax, which it described as “burdensome” despite the admirable goal of sustainability. Phil Derner, NBAA’s Western region representative, told FLYING the coalition comprises all of the aforementioned groups as well as chambers of commerce and smaller members, including the organization’s entire Washington state mailing list.

NBAA said the legislation has raised “significant concerns for business aviation,” which per Derner has caused some operators to reconsider renewing their leases in the state. He said that while business operators are “at the forefront” of the issue, the luxury tax would affect “nearly every corner of general aviation.”

Per NBAA, the coalition is working to open lines of communication with “key partners,” including the bill’s sponsor. Recently, it said, about 100 stakeholders met at Seattle Paine Field International Airport (KPAE) to discuss their needs and hear from Washington State Representative Tom Dent—a “strong industry advocate” and leader of the state’s aviation caucus.

“Sustainability is a driving force for NBAA and the broader aviation industry, as evidenced in our 2050 net-zero emission target and advocacy for sustainable aviation fuel,” Derner said in a statement. “This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress. We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

Case For (and Against) a Luxury Aircraft Tax

Washington state’s 10 percent tax on luxury noncommercial aircraft is set to take effect in April, impacting aircraft plus trade-in property valued over $500,000. For leased aircraft, fair market value at the start of the lease must be greater than $500,000.

Tax will be collected only on the “portion of the selling price in excess of $500,000,” the bill reads. In other words, the buyer of a $600,000 aircraft would be taxed $10,000 because they surpassed that threshold by $100,000. However, Derner said some in the industry have interpreted the language to mean the tax would be $60,000, or 10 percent of the full $600,000 price.

The idea behind the legislation is to generate fresh funding for transportation sustainability projects. But NBAA and other groups in their letter warned it could have “sweeping, unintended consequences” for the state’s economy.

Stakeholders argued that costly, noncommercial aircraft are not just luxury items. CAN and Angel Flight West, for example, operate networks of volunteer pilots that fly to underserved rural areas.

Other organizations, including the Washington State Department of Natural Resources’ aviation division, use expensive helicopters—like the Bell UH-1H(M) Huey—to battle blazes from above or evacuate victims. Agricultural operators often fly costly aircraft for crop dusting and environmental monitoring.

All of these stakeholders, the groups said, would be negatively impacted by the higher tax.

Business and recreational flyers will feel the difference, too, as will airports, which could see fewer operations. According to the groups, operations that would be affected by the tax support 407,000 airport jobs and generate $8.6 billion in economic output. In addition, 107 repair stations, 22 flight schools, 4,400 instructors and nearly 8,000 students would be “adversely affected,” they said.

NBAA said the legislation passed with “limited industry input,” prompting the formation of a coalition to extol the industry’s commitments to sustainability.

NBAA is targeting net-zero emissions from business aviation operations by 2050—a goal shared by many U.S. and international organizations. In 2019, it created an Emerging Technologies Committee to advocate for industry-friendly rules for new, environmentally friendly entrants—drones, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis, supersonic jets, and others.

eVTOL aircraft, in particular, will have a “profound impact” on the industry’s future, NBAA wrote in a 2019 report titled “Business Aviation Embraces Electric Flight.”

At the group’s 2025 Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in October, attendees could purchase helicopter flights from Blade Air Mobility, whose passenger division was acquired by eVTOL developer Joby Aviation in August. While those trips weren’t electric, passengers had the chance to speak with Joby representatives about the company’s plans to integrate air taxis on the Blade platform. That combination—as well as a planned integration with Uber —could happen in the next few years.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy and its environment,” Derner said of the new coalition.

Derner told FLYING that the Washington coalition may be the first of many. He emphasized NBAA’s effort to improve communication with policymakers in order to proactively provide input, rather than react to signed legislation.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/BAI-March-April-2021-Member-Profile-Premier-Bone-King-Air-C90A-ramp.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:56:21.186272

To initiate this engagement, in collaboration with leading management consultants Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Roland Berger and Estuaire, RMI has led a series of corporate contrail accounting and reporting pilots to develop and compare methodologies for measuring contrail impacts associated with business air travel.

Three proposed methodologies for contrail accounting with different levels of complexity and accuracy were assessed:

Baseline Approach: Standard Multiplier — The baseline approach uses a single, static 1.7x multiplier on the CO2 impact, to account for the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, including contrails.

Differentiated Default Approach: Tiered Multiplier — A tiered multiplier offers a more nuanced method by sorting flights into low, medium, and high-impact categories based on key flight characteristics such as time of departure, season, region, etc.

Bottom-Up Approach: Flight Specific Modeling — The most granular and accurate method is the bottom-up approach, which models the specific climate impact of each individual flight. This technique uses detailed operational data to calculate climate impact.

These studies found that flight-by-flight, bottom-up accounting can significantly improve the accuracy of measured contrail and other non-CO2 effects as well as CO2 impact compared with current standard methods. Results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.3x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The pilot analysis also revealed 2% of flight bookings account for 80% of total contrail impact.

As a result of these findings, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings may misrepresent the true climate impact of reporting companies.

Additionally, the results indicate the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate travel emissions by identifying key flight characteristics attributable to high warming impacts. Companies could use their air travel and transport data to make more informed decisions that help minimize travel on routes with higher contrail-formation potential, providing an additional lever to reduce climate impact.

Acting now to explore and pilot refined emissions accounting and reporting approaches can further support collective efforts to reduce the climate impact of contrails and unlock both environmental and economic benefits through lower aviation emissions.

Contrail management is a significant opportunity to tackle aviation’s full climate impact. According to ICCT’s September 2025 Aviation Vision 2050 outlook report, contrail avoidance is estimated to represent more than 40% of total avoidable warming from aviation by 2050. While critical decarbonization efforts such as increasing the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and improving operational efficiency must continue to be pursued, it is clear that the climate-warming impact of contrails demands action.

Increased research attention in recent years has enhanced understanding of contrails as a potent aviation non-CO2 effect , and the development and testing of technologies to predict and avoid contrail formation continue to advance. These contrail management activities have strongly improved the aviation industry’s opportunity to reduce contrail warming. However, contrail science and management is still nascent and requires continued collaboration across key groups, including corporates, airlines, standard setters, regulators, and other aviation and emissions accounting and reporting value chain stakeholders. Increased engagement across these stakeholders can help create the right data flows and incentives to more accurately measure and mitigate contrail warming impacts.

In tandem with continuing climate impact research and solutions development advancements, initiating demand-side aviation customer engagement today on the topic of contrail management can help raise awareness of contrail impact and advance exploration of comprehensive air travel climate impact accounting frameworks.

To initiate this engagement, RMI led a series of corporate aviation emissions accounting pilots, in collaboration with leading management consultancies BCG and Roland Berger, as well as flight analytics platform provider Estuaire. These studies found that flight-by-flight, bottom-up accounting can significantly improve the accuracy of measured contrail and other non-CO2 effects, as well as CO2 impact, compared with current standard methods. Current contrail and non-CO₂ accounting processes, while precise (as they are based on a fixed multiplier), are not necessarily accurate, as they lack the specificity derived from additional bottom-up data. Beyond refining report quality, the pilot results revealed data granularity can uncover opportunities to reduce air transport climate impacts.

Today, companies are likely to inaccurately report contrail climate impacts by applying broad, static multipliers to their CO2 emissions. Applying the flight-specific bottom-up approach, results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.32x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The pilot analysis revealed 2.14% of flight bookings account for 80% of total contrail impact. As a result, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings would misrepresent their true climate impact. Additionally, the results indicate the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate travel emissions by identifying key flight characteristics attributable to high warming impacts. Companies could use their air travel and transport data to make more informed decisions that help minimize travel on routes with higher contrail-formation potential, providing an additional lever to reduce climate impact.

With data-driven and consistent contrail accounting and reporting methodologies in place, corporate customers of aviation have the opportunity to measure and disclose both the CO2 and non-CO2 climate impact of business air travel more accurately than reported under current processes. This could help enable companies to explore internal travel policy adjustments based on improved reporting processes that may limit contrail impacts associated with future business air travel. Additionally, with more granular data, companies can better ensure that climate impact compensation strategies reflect the emissions they actually generate. Refined emissions accounting approaches enable companies to align reported impacts more closely with actual flight-level conditions, improving accuracy and strengthening consistency with compensation mechanisms such as carbon credit purchases.

Strengthening corporate emissions accounting and reporting practices for contrail impacts can help air transport customers, such as corporate travelers and freight shippers, better understand aviation’s full climate impact. By piloting and applying refined emissions accounting methods, these customers can begin to account and report contrail impacts more accurately, while identifying practical actions to reduce them.

By engaging constructively with data providers, airlines, standard setters, and other aviation and emissions accounting value chain stakeholders, corporate customers can help shape emerging contrail management practices and contribute to more comprehensive aviation climate accountability. Acting now to explore and pilot refined emissions accounting and reporting approaches can further support collective efforts to reduce the climate impact of contrails and unlock both environmental and economic benefits through lower aviation emissions.

Additional contrail science and management research is needed to understand the scale of contrails’ climate impact and the feasibility of levers available to mitigate it. In the absence of certainty, best practice to date has been to apply a multiplier of 1.7x to CO2 emissions to account for non-CO2 impacts, including contrails. This multiplier was identified based on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) analysis of the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation released in 2020. Although establishing this initial multiplier has been a positive step in the right direction, its application is far too broad considering the remaining uncertainty bands associated with contrail impact – despite tightening consensus among research conducted over the last five years — as well as significant climate impact variability from flight to flight based on factors such as region of travel, season, flight time of day, actual weather conditions at the time of flight, and aircraft performance characteristics. By using a singular multiplier in this way, companies may be significantly under- or over-reporting their emissions attributable to contrails. Moreover, using a flat multiplier does not provide any incentive to make more informed, sustainable flight choices with a lower likelihood of contrail warming.

Additionally, differences in emissions calculation methodologies set by regulatory agencies can make it difficult to compare emissions reported from one company to another. Depending on the emissions factor agency source, two or more companies, for example, may report significantly different results even if they theoretically were to have traveled on the exact same flights for the year.

Furthermore, even within the same regulatory agencies, emissions factors can change from year to year and are subject to global economic activity. This can make it difficult for companies to contextualize emissions from one year to the next. For example, UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) 2025 GHG emissions factors for business air travel were adjusted downward between 16% to 42% depending on seating class from 2024 emissions factors. Emissions factors used in 2023 and 2024 were still based on 2021 data, a year that was impacted by the COVID pandemic resulting in lower air travel demand. This inflated annual per passenger emissions factors for 2023 and 2024 reporting years, which saw air travel demand normalize during the post pandemic recovery. In this case, CO2 emissions (and non-CO2 emissions) were likely over reported in general during this period. Therefore, emissions factor update delays such as this can significantly impact the ability of companies to accurately report emissions and achieve their climate targets.

In collaboration with leading management consultancies BCG and Roland Berger and flight analytics platform provider Estuaire, RMI has led a series of corporate contrail accounting and reporting pilots to develop and compare methodologies for measuring contrail impacts associated with business air travel. Three proposed methodologies for contrail accounting with different levels of complexity and accuracy were assessed.

Baseline Approach: Standard Multiplier

The baseline approach uses a single, static multiplier to account for the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, including contrails. This method is straightforward, applying a universal multiplier value of 1.7x to a flight’s CO2 emissions and requiring no additional flight-level data for calculation. While this method is simple to implement for quick estimates, it fails to account for key factors that influence contrail formation, such as weather conditions, flight trajectory, aircraft characteristics, time of day, season, and region. As a result, in addition to having limited ability to accurately account for contrails as previously discussed, this approach fails to incentivize better operational practices. Without understanding and improved visibility of contributing contrail impact variables, businesses are limited in their ability to explore meaningful opportunities to reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

Differentiated Default Approach: Tiered Multiplier

A tiered multiplier offers a more nuanced method by sorting flights into low, medium, and high-impact categories based on key factors mentioned above. For example, known factors such as time of departure, season, region, etc. could apply contrail risk scores that are summed and then allocated into impact categories based on standard scoring thresholds. Average multipliers per category could then be applied per flight. This method encourages better business air travel policy opportunities when compared to the baseline approach. By grouping general flight characteristics and knowing the emissions multiplier to apply to the flight in advance of travel, companies may be able to manage emissions more effectively.

However, as an approximation of the potential contrail impact, this approach remains limited to inform accurate decision-making: flights with significantly different contrail risk may still fall into the same category, limiting the ability to target high-impact routes. This weakens both the accuracy of Scope 3 reporting and the effectiveness of corporate travel emissions strategies. Additionally, the forecast contrail impact from a selected flight may differ significantly from the actual impact once the flight has been completed, which again may limit emissions accounting and reporting accuracy.

Bottom-Up Approach: Flight-Specific Modeling

The most granular and accurate method is the bottom-up approach, which models the specific climate impact of each individual flight. This technique uses detailed operational data, including aircraft and engine type, flight trajectory, and altitude in combination with weather conditions, time of day, flight origin and destination, and flight booking class to calculate climate impact. This approach provides the highest accuracy impact calculation — for both contrails and other non-CO2 effects and CO2 emissions — and best incentivizes the implementation of targeted travel emissions reduction policies. Additionally, the bottom-up analysis is currently the most closely aligned approach to the EU non-CO2 MRV framework for airline reporting, which can result in greater transparency and consistency in emissions disclosures from both corporate travelers and airlines. This approach, however, may have higher costs associated with detailed data collection requirements and the need for specialized service providers to conduct analyses.

Exhibit 1

Pilot Key Findings and Insights

For this set of pilots, Estuaire conducted an analysis of the contrail impact associated with flight bookings over 2024. Applying the flight-specific bottom-up approach, results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.3x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The study revealed 2% of flight bookings account for 80% of the total contrail impact, as illustrated in Exhibit 2 below. This highlights the highly uneven distribution of contrail effects across flights, including flights that produced contrails with cooling effects. As a result, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings would misrepresent its true climate impact. Additionally, analyses confirmed initial hypotheses such as higher radiative forcing impact during winter and cool spring and fall months, evening and nighttime flights, and along medium- and long-haul routes. Based on these results, each company is now better positioned to take additional steps toward more informed decisions on opportunities that can reduce the full climate impact of their business air travel.

Exhibit 2

Further analysis confirmed the non-linearity of contrail impact with respect to both seasonality and departure time. Specifically, Exhibit 3 below shows that flights departing in winter months exhibit a higher mean contrail impact per distance flown compared to those departing in summer.

Exhibit 3

Exhibit 4 below highlights that morning departures tend to have a lower mean contrail impact per distance than late afternoon flights.

Exhibit 4

It is well known that you can’t manage what you don’t measure. Companies that are able to leverage data to understand the complexity and feasibility of potential reduction levers have the opportunity to be better positioned to convert information into actionable context-sensitive travel policies. Tools and service providers are now available to conduct detailed flight-level emissions analysis. Additionally, resources such as the Travel Impact Model (TIM) can help companies estimate future air travel impacts associated with specific flights.

Although significant advancements have been made in recent years, it is important to note that accurate contrail forecasting remains a challenge, given contrail formation is highly dependent on real-time weather conditions, which are difficult to measure with accuracy in real time, and aircraft operating characteristics such as altitude. These challenges make the exercise of identifying specific flights that may reduce air travel climate impact more complex. Without certainty that contrail forecasts will result in contrail formation or understanding the aircraft operating characteristics, companies risk making well-intentioned decisions to reduce flight impacts that may not be realized for unforeseen reasons. Reducing this risk calls for companies to use detailed historic company-level air travel emissions analysis in combination with tools such as TIM to help make informed travel policy adjustments that may reduce their future business air travel climate impacts.

It is also important to acknowledge that business travel decisions are not made in a vacuum. Not only do businesses need to account for their air travel emissions footprint, but they must also take additional factors into consideration, such as client needs, cost of travel, as well as other Scope 3 emissions that impact business decisions. For example, a business may have the option to take a flight that is likely to have low contrail impact compared to another flight at a different time of day, but if this alternative doesn’t meet the needs of a client, then a higher potential impact flight may be necessary to meet project demands. Similarly, if a lower contrail impact flight is available but would require an additional night of lodging, for example, the additional cost and emissions associated with the trip extension could exceed the available travel budget and/or negate the avoided contrail impact.

Therefore, companies could benefit from exploring comprehensive, customized travel policy guidelines based on the relationship between contrail impact forecasts, flight time and availability, cost considerations, and regional/local emissions at the business destination, enabling more effective and targeted reductions in aviation-related climate impacts. To help generate employee buy-in, companies could explore embedding incentives within travel booking tools for employees to encourage the selection of low-emissions options. Companies could also consider developing educational and policy training materials that detail the importance of more accurate emissions accounting and the role company personnel can play in reducing emissions.

Key Stakeholders

The corporate emissions accounting and reporting chain is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of stakeholders, each with a vested interest in the accuracy, transparency, and use of the reported data. Each plays a distinct role in defining, generating, managing and verifying the data that underpin credible corporate disclosures, and together they form the foundation on which future contrail and other non-CO2 accounting and reporting can build. As air travel contrail impact and non-CO2 emissions corporate accounting processes continue to develop, each stakeholder group will need to be engaged to raise awareness and ensure cohesion and practicality.

Reporting companies (i.e., air transport customers such as corporate travelers and freight shippers) compile air travel and freight transport data from internal systems and external partners to calculate aviation emissions. Within companies, ESG, finance, accounting, and air transport management teams coordinate disclosure and data governance, integrating both CO2 and non-CO2 effects into their business operations. Continued engagement in pilot projects could help to refine contrails and other non-CO2 emissions accounting methodologies and test their viability in real-world settings. By sharing learnings transparently, corporates could help to collectively strengthen the evidence base for refined accounting methods.

Travel management companies or freight forwarders act as intermediaries connecting corporate customers to airlines and carriers. They provide flight-level booking and activity data, such as routes, distances, and seating classes, that serve as key inputs for aviation emissions accounting. Coordination between data providers, reporting companies, and emissions accounting providers could help to develop data management processes that enable improved efficiency in data analysis.

Emissions accounting and analytics providers (including both internal corporate teams and external modeling partners) convert flight activity data into quantified CO2, contrail impact, and other non-CO2 outputs. Depending on data availability and other factors, they may apply standard emission factors or calculate results using actual flight-level information through bottom-up modeling approaches provided. Continued engagement in pilot projects to test accounting methodologies could help these service providers better understand existing challenges to data collection activities and support the development of solutions to address them in collaboration with data providers and reporting companies.

Verification and assurance providers review corporate emissions data for completeness, consistency, and credibility. As flight-level and contrail-related accounting practices mature, these actors could play an important role in developing corresponding verification criteria. Engaging them early could help identify what evidence and data transparency are necessary for acceptance within established assurance processes.

Voluntary standard setters and guidance providers, including GHG Protocol and SBTi provide voluntary frameworks for stakeholders across the aviation value chain to establish accounting boundaries, methodological consistency and disclosure expectations. These organizations play a foundational role in shaping how corporate emissions are measured and disclosed. GHG Protocol is currently revising its corporate, Scope 2, and 3 standards guidance with plans to finalize updates in 2027. In parallel, SBTi is undertaking a major update to its Corporate Net-Zero Standard (v2.0) and the initiative has indicated plans for a formal aviation sector update process. Together, these revision efforts create a key window for aviation and corporate stakeholders to contribute insights that reflect advances in refined accounting methodologies and the growing understanding of contrails and other non-CO2 effects.

Regulatory bodies such as the European Commission, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) design and implement compliance frameworks, such as the EU’s MRV regulation, that are beginning to include non-CO2 effects and may influence future corporate reporting. These bodies influence methodology and emissions factors development. Engaging in early dialogue with these regulators could potentially improve alignment across frameworks and avoid duplicative or inconsistent requirements as contrails and other non-CO2 effects accounting matures.

Aircraft operators (i.e., airlines, carriers) hold primary operational data, such as fuel use, aircraft type, flight trajectory, and increasingly contrail-related parameters. Their participation in research pilots and collaboration with data and modeling providers could significantly support improving the quality and accessibility of flight-level information that supports more accurate accounting. Additionally, industry associations and standardization bodies such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO) could potentially serve as critical conveners to align aviation accounting practices. Their collaboration could help ensure alignment with air travel provider emissions accounting developments.

Broader aviation value-chain participants, including SAF suppliers, airports, aircraft lessors, financial institutions, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), all share accountability for the emissions generated through air transport. Each may also influence the accuracy and flow of emissions of data through their operations, financing, infrastructure and technology innovation.

Data platforms and registries serve as connective infrastructure for emissions information across the aviation value chain. The emerging Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate (SAFc) book and claim system and SAFc Registry illustrate how verified GHG emissions information can move transparently along the value chain, providing a useful model for how shared data infrastructure might support future contrail and non-CO2 accounting.

At present, coordination among these stakeholders remains limited, with data and responsibility distributed across different parts of the value chain. Developing a cohesive and transparent accounting and reporting ecosystem capable of addressing aviation’s full climate impact calls for expanding collaborative pilots, improving data-sharing protocols, and engaging in explorative discussions with standard setters.

Envisioning a Future State

As we look forward to when accounting and reporting for contrails and other non-CO2 effects of aviation become standard practice, we can compare the existing process steps to a future state. For the most part, steps remain consistent. The primary difference lies in the increasing accuracy and consistency of data inputs and the tools used to analyze them.

In today’s process, corporates often rely on broad emissions factors and multipliers to estimate non-CO2 impacts including contrails. In the future, these generalized methods may be complemented by more differentiated, data-driven approaches that better capture variation across flights and conditions. Depending on the data access and analytical capability, corporates could use tiered multipliers or detailed flight-by-flight analyses to enhance accuracy and transparency. Companies can coordinate with their travel management or logistics service providers and emissions modeling and data providers to conduct analyses.

Exhibit 5 - Standard vs. bottom-up corporate emissions accounting process

To enable more consistent and verifiable data exchange, a minimum standard for flight-information reporting (e.g., flight number, date and time, aircraft type) could be established across airlines, travel or logistics service providers. Such alignment would improve data quality and interoperability, supporting high-fidelity inputs for both CO2 and emerging contrails and other non-CO2 effects accounting and reporting practices.

To achieve this future state, an illustrative phased framework is envisioned (see Exhibit 8). This preliminary framework could help guide organizations through incremental steps, beginning with the adoption of current best practices in emissions accounting and gradually integrating more advanced, differentiated default and bottom-up methodologies for greater accuracy and comprehensiveness.

This pilot initiative and report fall into Phase 1, focusing on the conceptualization and initial testing of refined accounting methodologies and processes that allow corporates to capture aviation’s full climate impact. The pilots have demonstrated how refined, flight-by-flight data can improve the accuracy of reported emissions.

Phase 2 could focus on enhancing awareness and building capacity by engaging key stakeholders, as previously discussed. Additional corporates could begin to explore, pilot, and refine emissions accounting approaches. These follow-on pilot projects could continue to provide valuable insights into the practical challenges and opportunities of detailed emissions measurement, informing future improvements and standardization efforts.

As experience and confidence in advanced emissions methodologies grows and sufficient data has been collected and analyzed, Phase 3 of the framework could support the development of customized low emissions travel policies and broader adoption across the corporate sector. Corporates could start to explore alignment opportunities with air service providers on contrails and other non-CO2 emissions accounting practices, deepening partnerships with travel management and emissions accounting providers, strengthening internal capacity through training and education for employees, and help build coalitions to accelerate alignment with revised, science-based emissions accounting standards.

Last, Phase 4 could recognize the adoption of refined emissions accounting approaches, enabling scaled application.

Ultimately, a phased approach could ensure that the transition to comprehensive, high-fidelity corporate emissions accounting is both practical and sustainable, enabling businesses to play a pivotal role in reducing aviation climate impacts and advancing industry wide best practices.

· Sky-High Connectivity: The successful launch of Air Peace’s Lagos-London route and the return of carriers like Emirates underscore Nigeria’s expanding global reach.
The current MRO announcement is the concrete realization of a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Nigerian government and Boeing.
That agreement, executed in Seattle by Aviation Minister Festus Keyamo, committed Boeing to providing Nigerian operators with comprehensive training, technical support, and operational assessments.
“This partnership marks a major step in modernising Nigerian airlines,” stated Minister Festus Keyamo at the time of the MoU.","In a transformative move for the continent’s aviation landscape, the Nigerian Federal Government has announced a strategic partnership with global aerospace leader Boeing and the UK’s renowned Cranfield University to develop internationally certified Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities on Nigerian soil. This landmark initiative, confirmed at the inaugural Nigerian International Airshow, directly targets the repatriation of an estimated $200 million annually spent by Nigerian airlines on overseas aircraft maintenance.

The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator George Akume, unveiled the partnership, naming leading Nigerian operators Aero Contractors and XEJet as the local drivers of the project. New MRO hubs are already planned for the nation’s key aviation nodes: Lagos and Abuja.

This ambitious infrastructure push is not occurring in isolation. It is strategically positioned atop a platform of robust sectoral growth and sweeping modernization:

· Traffic & Revenue Surge: Nigeria’s passenger traffic hit 15.89 million in 2023, with projections soaring to 25.7 million by 2029. Annual industry revenue is expected to reach $2.58 billion.

· GDP Contributor: Aviation contributes approximately 2.5% to national GDP, supported by 20 airports, 23 active airlines, and a deepening talent pool.

· Infrastructure Revolution: A monumental ₦712 billion overhaul of Lagos’s Murtala Muhammed Airport is underway, complemented by modernization projects at five other major airports and runways nationwide.

· Regulatory Leadership: Nigeria now ranks as Africa’s leading country for compliance with international aviation safety standards.

· Sky-High Connectivity: The successful launch of Air Peace’s Lagos-London route and the return of carriers like Emirates underscore Nigeria’s expanding global reach.

The current MRO announcement is the concrete realization of a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Nigerian government and Boeing. That agreement, executed in Seattle by Aviation Minister Festus Keyamo, committed Boeing to providing Nigerian operators with comprehensive training, technical support, and operational assessments.

Crucially, Boeing’s Airport Engineering team was tasked with advising on airport expansion and the development of local maintenance facilities—laying the direct technical groundwork for the hubs now being established.

“This partnership marks a major step in modernising Nigerian airlines,” stated Minister Festus Keyamo at the time of the MoU.

Echoing this sentiment, Boeing’s Vice-President for Commercial Sales in Africa, Anbessie Yitbarek, emphasized the deal’s role in “building a sustainable civil aviation ecosystem in Nigeria.”

The shift from advisory support to physical infrastructure represents a pivotal moment. Nigeria is now poised to become a major MRO player in West Africa, though it enters a competitive field with established hubs in the Middle East and emerging centers across the continent.

Officials, however, are confident in Nigeria’s strategic advantages: its vast domestic market, geographic position as a natural West African gateway, and rapidly expanding airline network. The scale of local fleet growth alone creates a compelling business case for in-country MRO services.

Secretary Akume highlighted Nigeria’s proactive engagement on the global stage, noting, “At the Dubai Airshow, Nigeria showcased its readiness to collaborate on next-generation aviation and defence technologies.”",https://airspace-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Boeing-737-MAX-via-Boeing.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:58:34.079797

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.
She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel.
The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.
“Everybody’s dragging their heels.","Aviation and cruise sustainability experts are hopeful of progress within the sectors next year but admit delays and increased emissions are also likely.

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.

Progress would rely on “how quickly they can enrol contracts, depending upon the projects that come forward”, he said, but insisted: “There will be more momentum around RCM this time next year, and I think we’ll be much more developed in terms of our thinking and government’s thinking as well as the greenhouse gas removals market.”

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks agreed: “We’re not sure whether that means contracts being awarded at the end of next year, but that’s the idea. That will give us an indication of whether we’re going to hit the 2030 SAF targets.”

But she said she also expected to see “delay and increased international aviation emissions” over the next 12 months, and accused the industry as a whole of “dragging its heels” on the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel. The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.

“Everybody’s dragging their heels. It’s easy for everybody to blame each other, but we don’t see the progress.”

Carnival UK vice-president sustainability and strategy Sophie Portlock was hopeful of progress in 2026 towards an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal to reduce carbon emissions globally to reach net zero by 2050, despite talks falling apart earlier this year.

Referring to a one year delay to a vote on adopting a global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping, she said: “It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of the IMO discussions around the net zero framework.”

She stressed the deal had not been “discarded”, adding: “It’s just been delayed by a year. That vote is now due to take place in October next year, and over the coming 12 months, there is work that is going to be done to look at some of these technical challenges and how we overcome some of those within that framework.”

While cruise only makes up 2% of the international shipping industry, ensuring alignment in the move to alternative fuels was “key” to provide confidence and clarity in the market, she stressed.

Carnival Corporation had already seen an 11% reduction in its total greenhouse gasses since a peak in 2011 following investment in energy efficiency measures and new technology, despite a 38% capacity increase over the same period of time, she said.

“That shows how these initiatives and these developments are leading to a reduction in our total carbon footprint,” she said, adding Carnival Corporation had 11 ships operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with 18 due to have LNG by 2033, covering around a third of total passenger capacity.

She added more than 70% of the group’s fleet had shore power capability but said the challenge in Europe was the number of available ports.

“There are about 16 ports that have shore power capability that can support cruise ships of our size,” she said, but noted: “We are expecting to see a further seven ports of a shore power capability next year. So it is increasing.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/384/Tim_Alderslade_sustainability_summit1_Main.webp,N,,2025-12-08 14:56:32.576862

Now, two new studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign help fill in the blanks for Miscanthus and switchgrass management.

“We have come a long way in our understanding of purpose-grown energy crops for SAF, but we still need to optimize agronomic management practices, like harvesting and nutrient management, to reduce production costs and incentivize growers,” said D.K. Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Previous studies have been limited in spatial scale or focused on the first years after establishment, early in the perennial life cycle. But Lee’s group is working to provide more realistic, long-term solutions to maximize biomass productivity and grow a more sustainable fuel industry.

In the first of two recent studies, Lee’s team conducted an economic and environmental analysis of two harvest methods for switchgrass.

“Harvesting operations account for 60-80% of the total production costs for switchgrass,” said Muhammad Umer Arshad, postdoctoral researcher in Lee’s group and first author on the Bioresource Technology paper. “We wanted to understand why the harvesting cost is so high and how each operation contributes to cost, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as identify where reductions are possible.”

Arshad explains that switchgrass harvesting can happen via the stepwise method, in which tasks like mowing, raking, baling, and roadsiding are separated into individual operations; or the integrated method, which uses different equipment to consolidate mowing and raking into one pass. Hypothetically, an integrated approach could reduce effort, energy consumption, and costs. But, after analyzing data from 125 Virginia commercial-scale sites varying in field size and biomass yield, Arshad found a more nuanced answer.

“We found that the integrated method makes more sense for smaller fields (less than 3 hectares, or 10 acres) and low-yield (less than 3.2 tons per acre) conditions, reducing GHG emissions by 9% and energy use by 5%,” Arshad said. “The stepwise method was better for large fields with high biomass yield, reducing harvesting costs to $37.70 per ton and achieving the lowest GHG emissions.”

The costs were estimated assuming the farmers are using their own machinery, tractors, and harvesting equipment.

Lee adds that the results reveal the importance of tailoring harvesting strategies to site-specific conditions and provide the first evidence-based guidance that harvest methods can improve both economic and environmental outcomes.

In a separate study published in Biomass & Bioenergy, the team tackled age-related declines in Miscanthus biomass yield, a function of tiller (stem) mass and density. These long-lived perennial grasses follow a predictable growth trajectory, including a juvenile stage that builds over several years to reach peak biomass yield, followed by a slow decline after about 10 years. Until now, it wasn’t clear which components of yield change over time and how nutrient management might help.

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi analyzed data from a long-term Miscanthus trial with nitrogen fertilization treatments that varied in amount and timing. First, he looked at how tiller mass and density changed over time and with various nitrogen treatments. Then, he asked what other soil fertility factors may influence the decline in biomass yield in older stands.

“We found that both tiller mass and density increase from the first year of establishment to the fourth year, and if you apply nitrogen, you get an increase in both factors,” Namoi said. “But over time, as you withdraw nitrogen by harvesting biomass, the first component to be impacted is tiller mass. So tiller mass is very sensitive to nitrogen management.”

Namoi adds that tiller density continues to increase until individual stands become saturated, with no more space for further expansion. After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.

He notes that the decline in biomass yield over time may not be entirely tied to nitrogen. With every harvest, soil nutrients tied up in plant biomass are removed from the system, depleting elements that play a role in photosynthetic efficiency. When Namoi analyzed soil phosphorus and potassium in mature Miscanthus stands, he found significant deficits in both essential nutrients.

“Our findings identify tiller mass as a key determinant of biomass yield in aging Miscanthus and highlight the need for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium management for long-term productivity,” he said.

Both studies provide practical guidance to increase profitability, a key factor for any producer looking to explore biomass crops.

URBANA, Ill. — To meet ambitious U.S. Department of Energy targets for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), production of purpose-grown energy crops must ramp up significantly. Although researchers have made substantial progress in understanding the management and conversion of these crops, key knowledge gaps hold the industry back. Now, two new studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign help fill in the blanks for Miscanthus and switchgrass management.

The beach is under another jurisdiction, where the jailers have no authority. Every day, the prisoners beg to be released, and don’t think of sliding down the rope to freedom.

Around 2008, some revolutionary economic thinkers conceived a cheaper route for landlocked Uganda to the sea, linking Kampala city on Lake Victoria to Tanga on the Indian Ocean.

A joint venture between Dodoma and Kampala was registered and capitalised to create a route shorter and much cheaper than Mombasa–Kampala, based only on rail and water barges.

The railway from Tanga to Musoma would switch containers between rail and barges linking different destinations on Lake Victoria including far eastern Uganda, Kampala and Western.

Read: Uganda-Tanzania crude pipeline project gains steam as Eacop opens new coating plant

Uganda, Congo, Rwanda and even north western Tanzania. Feasibility studies were completed, Tanzania offered Uganda a chunk of territory at Tanga to base its operations. The project was promptly forgotten.

Then came the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (Eacop) linking western Uganda to, again, Tanga. It is 75 percent complete, likely to be operational in a year. Still Ugandans as often are crying over lack of secure access to the sea contrary to international law.

When in 1976 Idi Amin mentioned Uganda’s old boundaries, official Kenya closed the borders bringing Uganda’s transport sector to a standstill. In 1987, Uganda and Kenya nearly went to war over access to the sea.

Last year, Uganda took Kenya to court over the latter’s blocking Kampala from directly importing its petroleum products then worth $2 billion a year, instead using Kenyan middlemen who we were told made the fuel pump prices twice what they should be in Uganda.

But Uganda already has its own access to the sea. It is called Eacop stupid! All it needs is an upgrade to have an electric railway running above the oil pipe, silly!

It is not an easy mission, but who said it is supposed to be easy? Remember the famous statement by US President John F. Kennedy on September 12, 1962 at Rice University, thus: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”.

The difference from a man walking on the moon in 1969 is that Uganda adding a trade route over an already existing oil evacuation one is even easier than the pipeline which is 75 percent done.

The complicated pipeline needs to have the crude oil electrically heated all the way along its 1,443km to keep flowing because Uganda’s raw petroleum is waxy and solid at “room” temperature.

Running an electric railway above the existing space would require examining some special technical and economic considerations by an expert-executed feasibility study like: neutralising trains’ vibrations near the pipe; economic viability and opportunities like adding decent, world class passenger travel between Uganda and the coast; and the financing model at about the same cost as the pipeline ($4 billion).

With the Hoima sports stadium construction for Afcon 2007 (Hoima is again the area where Eacop starts) being Uganda’s first infrastructure eye opener that has seen a Turkish finance and execution model build the ultramodern stadium at record speed, the secure trade route can be handled along similar arrangements.

But own finance is another option — the other day Uganda’s social security fund offered a billion dollars it has lying around to the government for a highway for which it has been begging foreign moneylenders.

A secure rail link to Tanga for Uganda over already existing land isn’t a genius suggestion considering that Ethiopia has already done an electric 755km rail link to Djibouti. But more relevantly, Tanzania is a pioneer of railway electrification in East Africa; again with Turkish participation. And, before I forget, Hoima has built a huge cargo airport that can take any size of cargo aircraft existing in the world.

Add a rail link to the Indian Ocean and an incredible modern trade network for the region would be good to go. Meanwhile Uganda’s Civil Aviation Authority is busy developing Sustainable Aviation Fuel —that is bio not fossil based, thus climate friendly — which could make Uganda bio cargo aviation.

So there is really no need to waste time asking foreign money lenders for a secure access to the sea as they will just shoot it down or cost it at several times the true price.

Upgrading Eacop to a general rail trade route would be a game-changer for East Africa, unlocking economic growth, improving regional connectivity, and enhancing competitiveness.

However, all Airbus A350 variants have an incredibly impressive range. The spread across all variants is 8,500 to 9,700 nautical miles. No range has been published for the A350-1000ULR, but it is expected to remain in the air for 22 hours.

Find out the exact ranges for each A350 variant. You can then learn more about how advanced materials and design decisions facilitate the impressive range, and how this aircraft continues to be commercially successful.

What Are The Ranges Of The A350 Variants?

A standard Airbus A350-900 has a range of 8,500 nautical miles (15,740 km). The larger A350-1000 has a longer range of 9,000 nautical miles (16,668 km). This is overtaken by the 9,700 nautical miles (17,964 km) of the A350-900ULR. To facilitate the additional fuel needed for this range, the A350-900ULR has a higher maximum takeoff weight of 322 tons. This is the same as that available on the standard A350-1000, increased to this level in October 2023.

The table below shows the ranges of the A350 variants, as far as they have currently been published:

An A350-1000ULR will be able to conduct 22-hour missions. This extra range is facilitated by adaptations that reduce seating to 238 passengers, facilitating a 20,000-liter (4,400 gallon) rear center fuel tank.

How Singapore Uses Its A350-900ULRs

In 2018, Singapore Airlines announced that it would use its A350-900ULRs, a variant exclusive to the carrier, to fly the world's longest routes in commercial aviation. The route from Singapore to Newark began on 11 October 2018, initially served three times a week. This route travels a distance of approximately 9,000nm (16,700km), with a traveling time of 18 hours and 45 minutes. Singapore Airlines’ CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said:

“Singapore Airlines has always taken pride in pushing the boundaries to provide the best possible travel convenience for our customers, and we are pleased to be leading the way with these new non-stop flights using the latest-technology, ultra-long-range Airbus A350-900ULR. The flights will offer our customers the fastest way to travel between the two cities – in great comfort, together with Singapore Airlines’ legendary service - and will help boost connectivity to and through the Singapore hub.”

Singapore has now greatly expanded the number of destinations that it serves from Singapore using the Airbus A350-900ULR. This includes New York John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

The First A350-1000ULR Is Under Construction In Toulouse

Qantas' Project Sunrise, where A350s will fly further than ever before, may arrive soon as the carrier's first A350-1000ULR is already taking shape in Toulouse, where Airbus has its manufacturing facility. Qantas' Newsroom has announced that key airframe components have now all been attached. This includes the forward, center, and rear fuselage sections along with the wings, tail, and landing gear. The manufacturer then transferred the aircraft to a new hangar to have its engines and testing instruments installed. This all sets up the jet for an extensive testing program to begin in 2026.

Qantas Group Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Hudson explained the importance of the jet for Project Sunrise in Qantas Newsroom's press release: “Given Australia’s position in the world, Qantas has a long history of breaking aviation barriers. Project Sunrise will not only overcome the tyranny of distance, it will fundamentally change the way our customers travel the world. These flights will cut up to four hours off the journey and transform how people experience ultra-long-haul travel, through science-backed design to minimize jetlag and maximize wellbeing.”

Following the testing regime, Qantas expects the first 12 A350-1000ULR to be delivered in late 2026. That will allow Project Sunrise services to begin during the first half of 2027.

How Does The A350 Achieve Such Remarkable Range?

This article has displayed the exceptional range of the A350. It is a key selling point, facilitated by astonishing efficiency and enormous fuel tanks. Airbus claims that its design decisions and advancements for the aircraft make it 25% more fuel-efficient than long-haul aircraft from the previous generation.

A key reason that the aircraft is so efficient is its advanced Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, which exclusively power the jet. The engine also produces a tremendous amount of power needed to lift the enormous amount of fuel required for ultra-long-range flights. The Trent XWB-97 engine is the most powerful Rolls-Royce engine to enter commercial operations, producing 97,000 lbf (431 kN) of thrust on takeoff. The table below features key specifications for the -84 and -87 variants of the engine according to the EASA's Type Certificate Data Sheet:

The aircraft uses a clean-sheet design. Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer fuselage and wings are featured in over half of the airframe's structure. This material has led to substantial weight reductions while maintaining the required strength. The aircraft also has high-aspect-ratio wings and modern winglets. As a result, drag is reduced while the necessary lift is maintained.

A350s Are Finding New Customers

Extensive, successful long-range operations are leading new airlines to consider bringing in the A350. In November 2024, Emirates announced that it had taken delivery of its first A350-900 at its Dubai International Airport (DXB) hub. This aircraft was the first of the carrier's orders for 65 A350s. This aircraft, registered A6-EXA, was also the first widebody aircraft of a new type to be delivered to Emirates since 2008. That year, the Middle Eastern carrier received its first-ever A380. As with many other Airbus deliveries in recent years, this delivery was powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and regular fuel. The jet entered service shortly after, flying first to Edinburgh in January 2024. The A350s were first deployed to serve nine new routes, as announced in May 2024.

Emirates expected its new A350-900s to be a game-changer, allowing the carrier to serve more destinations with better efficiency and flexibility. Adnan Kazim, the deputy president and chief commercial officer (CCO) of Emirates, said: “With the latest generation cabin products including more of our sought-after Premium Economy to more cities, top-notch in-flight entertainment technologies and an abundance of other customer-friendly features, the Emirates A350 builds on our long-standing commitment of investing in the very best customer experience in the sky.”

As of November 2025, the carrier had 13 A350-900s in its fleet, with a remaining 52 on order. The jets are currently all in a three-class configuration, totaling 312 seats. The carrier has also planned to incorporate an additional layout into its A350-900s flying the furthest. These aircraft will have just 298 seats, but an extra row of premium economy and more galley space. Not all the routes currently flown on Emirates A350s from Dubai are exclusive to that aircraft. This includes the route to Amman (A380), Dammam (777-300ER), and Kuwait City (777-300ER).

The A350 Achieves Its High Range While Being Quieter

Despite its incredibly powerful engines and the need to lift a huge amount of fuel into the sky, the A350 is an incredibly quiet aircraft. The manufacturer claims that the A350 is five decibels quieter than its competitors and aircraft from the last generation. The noise in front of the cabin is also nine decibels quieter. Compared with the Airbus A330, the A350 has a 50% lower noise footprint. Such noise reduction is essential for comfortable flying during trips that regularly exceed 10 hours, making it easier for passengers to sleep. Producing less noise also reduces the impact on communities near airports or the wildlife that lives alongside them.

A number of factors allow this aircraft to operate more quietly. Firstly, the jet's engines have a lower fan tip speed, and the engine's shape and nacelles manage airflow to reduce noise. The aircraft's aerodynamic shape also reduces drag. As drag produces noise, the shape reduces noise during flight. Finally, the cabin features soundproofing technology. Any noise that does travel from the engines to the cabin will be heavily dampened.

Reducing noise also allows airlines to operate across more hours of the day and night. Under pressure from neighboring communities, many airports have to deal with Heathrow-style restrictions that limit flying hours. Such limits can be pushed wider by quieter aircraft. Opening up more slots in this way is particularly important at the world's busiest airports.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/here-s-how-much-more-range-the-airbus-a350-1000ulr-has-compared-to-the-a350-900ulr.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-08 13:56:59.996759

Southern is a U.S.-based developer of low-cost, biomass-derived clean fuels, best known for its flagship project in Louisiana that plans to transform regional wood-waste feedstock into green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on a large commercial scale. The two organizations will merge under a newly formed, U.S.-domiciled parent company that is expected to be listed on Nasdaq after fulfilling all customary closing requirements.

The new combined entity aims to play a central role in helping global aviation and maritime operators comply with increasingly stringent decarbonization mandates issued under frameworks such as ReFuelEU and by global regulatory bodies like the International Maritime Organization (IMO). By developing a fully integrated clean-fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, the company intends to use domestic resources, secure supply chains, and a local workforce to manufacture carbon-negative SAF and green methanol at competitive prices.

Under the proposed structure, the combined organization will operate through two core divisions. The first will focus on climate-oriented solutions that generate environmental assets such as carbon credits. The second division will concentrate on clean-fuel production, with its initial emphasis on the previously announced Louisiana biomass-to-fuel project. By merging DevvStream's environmental-asset expertise with Southern's biomass-conversion technology, the new company seeks to lower production costs and remove a major barrier that has slowed alternative fuel adoption across the aviation and maritime industries.

Management anticipates that by taking advantage of early federal incentives, combined with co-products generated during fuel production, the platform can ultimately achieve cost competitiveness even without government subsidies. Additionally, the company plans to leverage early engagement from airlines and maritime offtakers who are preparing to meet future carbon-reduction obligations. For investors, this strategic move signifies a transformation of DevvStream—from a smaller services-oriented company into a scalable industrial clean-fuels producer with long-term revenue visibility.

Leadership of the newly formed company is expected to be headed by Carl Stanton, who will assume the role of CEO. The organization will operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. The transaction is currently expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory clearances and shareholder approvals.

Stanton highlighted the urgency behind the merger, noting that aviation and maritime companies face some of the most aggressive global decarbonization requirements.

As a leading logistics provider, DHL offers insight into how sustainable shipping can enhance a company’s reputation.
Large corporations often impose strict sustainability standards on their partners, meaning that offering sustainable shipping can open the door to new business.
Although initial costs may be higher, sustainable shipping can reduce expenses over time, particularly through lower fuel consumption driven by energy-efficient transport.
A sustainable shipping strategy B2C transactions have begun to influence the growth of B2B e-commerce, with more buyers expecting speed, convenience and sustainability.","As customer expectations rise, many businesses are turning delivery into a key source of competitive advantage.

Sustainability is now central to the shift, with organisations actively integrating ESG measures into their operations.

Global logistics giant DHL has outlined some of the most effective ways for companies to boost customer satisfaction by ensuring B2B deliveries are cleaner, more efficient and more cost-effective.

Meeting demands

B2B procurement has traditionally centred on cost savings and securing the best value, but sustainability has become a leading factor in recent years. With global regulations tightening, emissions tracking across Scope 1, 2 and 3 has moved sharply into focus. As a result, more businesses are exploring sustainable shipping as a way to strengthen their competitive position and reduce supply chain impact.

Research from Bain & Company shows that 36% of B2B buyers would leave suppliers that fail to meet their sustainability expectations. A supplier’s environmental performance can determine whether a customer chooses to work with them, making informed supply chain decisions essential. As a leading logistics provider, DHL offers insight into how sustainable shipping can enhance a company’s reputation.

Only 53% of B2B customers are satisfied with the sustainable options offered by suppliers, highlighting a clear opportunity for differentiation. Large corporations often impose strict sustainability standards on their partners, meaning that offering sustainable shipping can open the door to new business. Although initial costs may be higher, sustainable shipping can reduce expenses over time, particularly through lower fuel consumption driven by energy-efficient transport.

""Even with economic pressures, both B2C and B2B customers are choosing brands that prioritise ESG goals and are sincere and transparent about their efforts,"" explains Katharina Tomoff, SVP for Global ESG at DHL Supply Chain.

A sustainable shipping strategy

B2C transactions have begun to influence the growth of B2B e-commerce, with more buyers expecting speed, convenience and sustainability.

The nature of B2B shipping means that it is very easy to implement a sustainable shipping strategy:

Shipment size and frequency: B2B shipping leans towards larger deliveries with infrequent shipping, allowing for route optimisation and reduced emissions

Delivery speed & flexibility: B2B deliveries are usually scheduled in advanced, meaning that sustainable planning can take place

Order destination: B2B consumerism makes it easier to optimise routes, reduce inefficiencies associated with last-mile delivery and consolidate shipments as orders are usually delivered to a singular location - such as warehouses or distribution centres

Achieving eco-friendly shipping

As well as having a positive environmental impact, low-emissions B2B delivery is proven to increase long-term efficiency, brand reputation and cost savings.

""E-commerce is evolving – from AI-driven personalisation and social commerce to the rise of B2B and borderless trade,"" says Pablo Ciano, CEO at DHL eCommerce.

“Businesses are scaling faster, selling smarter and prioritising sustainability like never before. At DHL, we’re proud to support this momentum, helping retailers deliver with speed, trust and responsibility in every market they serve.”

Sustainable fuels

DHL's GoGreen Plus uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to help businesses reduce carbon emissions, as it is produced from renewable sources like vegetable oils and waste products and can reduce GHG emissions by up to 80%. It is a good option for SMEs and e-commerce businesses with small cargo loads.

Electrifying fleets

DHL is aiming to electrify 66% of its last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030, as part of its wider plan to achieve net-zero by 2050. By partnering with an EV-focused company, businesses stand to reduce carbon from final-mile deliveries.

Optimise routes

AI-powered route planning is a smart and efficient solution. It can find the most time- and fuel-efficient routes to help drivers complete deliveries in the most strategic way. This cuts down on emissions, demonstrates driver reliability and meets customer demand for speed.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/176f28b608485324109551e457f7fa87:e6e6b1a433243f50cd30cfb12ff7a412/dhl-b2b-sustainable-shipping-pc.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 11:56:34.669926

Locally grown Miscanthus will be used to supply small to medium-scale power plants, decentralizing the energy infrastructure and making it less vulnerable to attacks. Miscanthus will also provide raw materials for the domestic building materials sector, decreasing dependence on imports.

Supported by the UK government through its InnovateUkraine program funded by the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) and UK International Development, the MERIT project will develop scalable Miscanthus supply chains and agronomic models to enable Ukraine to harness its potential for domestic biomass production while creating economic opportunities for Ukrainian farmers.

“There are two main goals of this project,” explains Florian Ilias, Terravesta managing director. “Energy system impact and socioeconomic impact. In the short term, the project enables local energy economies to flourish, using and cleaning war-contaminated land no longer fit for food production. In the long term, it supports Ukraine’s transition to a more secure, low-carbon economy.

“The project will also create jobs, sequester carbon, and restore contaminated land, as well as improving energy access and promoting social inclusion.”

The project brings together a strong international partnership. As lead partner, Terravesta is collaborating with Liverpool John Moores University as scientific partner, LLC Miscanthus Technology (Ukraine) as technology lead, and remote monitoring and agronomy partner LLC Fendt (Ukraine).

A step towards energy independence and climate resilience

“MERIT is about delivering practical support for Ukraine at a critical time,” says Florian. “By unlocking Miscanthus production, we can help Ukraine replace lost energy capacity, reduce carbon emissions, and build a secure, local biomass resource for heat and power.”

The project will demonstrate Miscanthus’s role in restoring degraded land, building climate resilience, and providing a reliable, low-input crop that supports rural communities in recovery.

Working with Ukrainian farmers and partners, the MERIT project will:

● Establish demonstration sites across various climate areas showcasing Miscanthus as a sustainable biomass source.

● Provide training, planting models, and agronomic support tailored to Ukrainian conditions.

● Assess logistics, processing, and market pathways for Miscanthus-derived bioenergy.

● Generate evidence on carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits to inform policy frameworks and support biomass adoption.

The Space Summit 2026 will be held from Feb 2 to 3 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. It is officially endorsed by Singapore’s Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn) and the Economic Development Board.

“The summit positions Singapore as the hub for space dialogue and collaboration in Asia-Pacific,” said Experia in its statement.

The space economy, a key topic to be discussed at the summit, is projected to reach a US$1.8 trillion value by 2035, up from US$630 billion in 2023, according to a McKinsey report from January.

The forecast value includes both “backbone” applications, such as those for satellites, launchers and services such as broadcast television or GPS, as well as “reach” applications, such as those for which space technology helps companies generate revenue.

Themed “New Frontiers: Shaping a Responsible and Inclusive Space Future”, the Space Summit 2026 will convene global policymakers, space agencies, investors and innovators to discuss topics such as infrastructure, sustainability, investment and the in-space economy.

OSTIn in August had said that Singapore can support the global space industry as a geospatial data hub, with the potential to “create high-value jobs”.

In February, it also announced plans to put S$60 million towards developing satellite technology, among other space industry moves – including a regional satellite imaging project.

That followed a Deloitte report that forecast that the increased use of earth observation data could add US$100 billion to South-east Asia’s gross domestic product by 2030.

Airbus, Boeing and Comac return

Having debuted in 2008, the main event of the Singapore Airshow 2026 will take place from Feb 3 to 8 at the Changi Exhibition Centre, with more than 1,000 participating companies spanning 50 regions.

An “expanded presence” is expected from both the Italian Trade Agency Pavilion and the China Pavilion. Other countries such as Singapore, Japan and the UK will also have country pavilions.

Europe’s Airbus, the US’ Boeing and China’s Comac will return as exhibitors, alongside more defence-focused players such as Lockheed Martin. Local companies such as SIA Engineering and ST Engineering will also be present.

While Boeing was in attendance in 2024 as an exhibitor, it chose not to display its passenger aircraft such as the 737 Max or 777X after a fuselage panel on one of its 737 Max 9s blew out mid-air at the start of the year.

A Boeing spokesperson declined to confirm if its passenger aircraft will be making a return to the Singapore Airshow in 2026. Experia Events said confirmation on static and flying displays will only be ready nearer the show date, likely to be end-January.

The US planemaker’s long-delayed 777X made an appearance at the Dubai Airshow in November – its first since the Wings India show in Hyderabad in January 2024.

The jet’s first delivery was delayed a fifth time in October, this time to 2027 from the previous 2026 target. The aircraft was originally slated to begin deliveries in 2020.

Singapore Airlines, which has 31 777X jets on order, in November said that it is not expecting a “major impact” from the delay.

Sustainable aviation fuel and net zero in focus

Sustainable aviation fuel and net-zero intiatives are also expected to be in the spotlight.

Singapore’s sustainable aviation fuel levy will kick in on Oct 1 next year for all passengers and cargo on commercial flights originating in Singapore.

It will vary by destination and class of travel for passengers, ranging from S$1 to S$10.40 for economy class, and S$4 to S$41.60 for business and first class. For cargo, the levy ranges from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram.

In October this year, Singapore also set up the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company, the world’s first non-profit to centralise the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. Central procurement of the fuel by the company aims to give airlines operating to and from Singapore the ability to negotiate its supply as an aggregate.

At the airshow’s AeroForum, renewable fuels leader Neste will discuss the fuel’s adoption, supply chain transformation and greener aviation operations.

The AeroForum will also discuss market and budget outlooks, autonomy and human-machine teaming, cybersecurity, advanced air mobility, workforce transformation and commercialisation of next generation technologies, said Experia.

Alongside the other events will be the Changi Aviation Summit 2026, to be held on Feb 2, with senior government officials and industry leaders set to discuss “key issues” faced by the civil aviation industry.

For the 2026 air show, sustainability is set to be a major theme, with a focus on sustainable aviation fuel and net-zero initiatives.

Renewable fuels company Neste will share its insights on the adoption of greener aviation fuel, supply chain transformation and enabling greener aviation operations.

Air show attendees will be able to offset carbon emissions associated with their travel by buying carbon credits from New Zealand company CarbonClick, an initiative first introduced at the 2024 show.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/2d95d147f7fe6e5b36ea00b1dd9935f3b0c0487892c228dc051125e4b2f4149b,N,,2025-12-08 10:56:30.885243
,,2025-12-08 14:09:51+00:00,Sky News,'I'm a flight attendant - here's the truth about the mile-high club and one thing passengers do ...,Not Available,,,,,https://news.sky.com/story/im-a-flight-attendant-heres-the-truth-about-the-mile-high-club-and-one-thing-passengers-do-that-i-secretly-love-13480846,"This week we chat to international flight attendant Grace Hampson... Our salary is organised into three parts... so it's hard to give a typical salary.
We're paid a basic salary, flight pay and also per diems depending on where we are travelling to.
One thing I wish passengers would stop doing is... asking if they can move seats as they are boarding.
Many passengers ask if we are going to be flying the aircraft straight home after a long-haul flight.
In total, I've had 36 years (both as a passenger and a flight attendant) without so much as a near-miss.","If you've ever spent your morning commute daydreaming about starting afresh with your career, this feature is for you. Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week we chat to international flight attendant Grace Hampson...

Our salary is organised into three parts... so it's hard to give a typical salary. We're paid a basic salary, flight pay and also per diems depending on where we are travelling to. [The Money team had a look at the average basic salary, and the National Careers Service says it starts at around £19,000 and goes up to £28,000 a year.]

We don't have set working hours in a week... Flight time limitations are set by the Civil Aviation Authority. They allow us to fly 900 hours in a rolling year and no more than 100 hours in a rolling 28 days. We get 28 days of holiday a year.

The training is different for every airline... If you don't already have one, you will need to obtain an attestation, which is a professional safety qualification all flight attendants need. That course can be done in a week. After that, you will need to be type-rated to a certain aircraft to learn the specifics on things like safety equipment and emergency drills. That's where the training lengths can differ.

The chance to explore is our greatest perk... Meeting diverse people and learning about different cultures is incredible. And I also love the flexible schedule that comes with long-haul flying.

One thing I wish passengers would stop doing is... asking if they can move seats as they are boarding. We are happy to accommodate and make passengers as comfortable as we possibly can during the flight, but we need all passengers to take their allocated seat for take-off. The weight and balance of the aircraft gets calculated, and that includes passengers as well as cargo and other factors. Correct weight distribution is essential for the aircraft to maintain stability and control. In short, the decision is out of the flight attendants' hands!

A lot of people call us ""waitresses in the sky""... and although part of our job is to provide excellent service, the most important thing is that we keep our passengers safe. We can deal with a large number of emergencies that have the possibility of emerging in the air, with fewer resources than you would have on the ground. It's a great responsibility, which each flight attendant has worked hard at during their career.

Every airline probably has their own version of a secret language... However, the most common secret language we use is signalling to each other throughout the cabin when we need a top-up of tea, or another serving of chicken.

In my eyes, the best time to travel is... first thing in the morning. The travel to the airport is usually easier, and early flights tend to be less expensive. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are normally the best days for cheaper flights.

My favourite airport is... Los Angeles International Airport. This may be an unpopular opinion as it holds a reputation for being crowded. Not only does it have a great shopping and dining experience, but it also has the most flights to and from other airports, meaning you can connect to some amazing places.

We follow a very strict policy when it comes to the service of alcohol on board... especially flying such a long distance. We always monitor to make sure people aren't overdoing it. We also make sure that we are looking out for people's well-being at the boarding door when it comes to alcohol consumption.

An ongoing issue with aviation is always environmental pressures... and keeping carbon footprint low where possible. Modernising fleets and using aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner can contribute to an improvement as they are known for their fuel efficiency and lower emissions in comparison to older aircraft. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel is going to make a great difference when it is made commercially viable to use.

My top packing tip is... rolling clothes instead of folding them. Somehow this creates more room and I can get more in. When I'm packing for a trip, I try to keep my outfits in similar colour palettes so I can rewear a pair of trousers or a cardigan and mix and match things I have bought with me.

Something surprising that people might not know is... We don't just turn the aircraft round and come home. Many passengers ask if we are going to be flying the aircraft straight home after a long-haul flight. Due to required rest, we tend to stay in a destination for a night or two before working the flight back. Another crew will be waiting at the destination for us to arrive and to take over the aircraft. They will then work the return flight.

I have never nearly been in an accident... Aviation continues to be one of the safest forms of travel. Even before I was flying for a job, my dad was a pilot and I travelled with him a lot. In total, I've had 36 years (both as a passenger and a flight attendant) without so much as a near-miss.

People trying to join the mile high club aren't a total myth but... it doesn't happen often like people think. Increased security and regular cabin patrolling make it near on impossible.

Turbulence doesn't frighten me at all... During turbulence, we are regularly doing safety checks in the cabin. We are making sure passengers are continuing to wear their seatbelts and of course checking in on their general wellbeing. We move through the cabin calmly and unpanicked, which I think helps passengers to see. We are also happy to explain turbulence to our passengers and why it happens. I recently started a series of FAQs for pilots on my TikTok channel, which features my dad, a retired pilot.

As for the energy sectors, the incentives will target increasing the share of energy produced from new and renewable sources to 42 percent in Egypt’s energy mix.
Madbouly emphasized that more investments for the energy sector will help expand explorations and extractions to increase petroleum products and natural gas production to meet consumer needs.

The package will create more job opportunities and increase local production and exports, as per the new economic development narrative for the next five years.

Madbouly noted that the new incentives will attract new capital to reach certain targets and expand certain sectors such as tourism, where the government aims to attract 30 million tourists in the upcoming years.

Plans were revealed in October to raise investments in the tourism and antiquities sector by 60 percent to EGP 116.2 billion in FY 2025/2026, according to Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat.

The Prime Minister affirmed that Egypt’s top priority remains in the health sector, with initiatives like the Decent Life rural development programme, which has eased pressure on central and general hospitals.

As for the energy sectors, the incentives will target increasing the share of energy produced from new and renewable sources to 42 percent in Egypt’s energy mix.

The country signed its first production license for sustainable aviation fuel, earlier this month, with the goal of converting used cooking oil into aviation fuel with an annual production capacity of up to 120,000 tons.

Madbouly emphasized that more investments for the energy sector will help expand explorations and extractions to increase petroleum products and natural gas production to meet consumer needs.

Another priority for the incentives will be to raise export rates in sectors with opportunities for expansions, mainly in pharmaceuticals and expanding the number of governorates benefitting from the Universal Health Insurance System, according to Madbouly.

Madbouly confirmed that Egypt’s key economic indicators are showing positive results, on the back of productive sectors driving economic growth. The IMF mission currently in Cairo commended the progress in investments and trade reforms in a recent meeting with the Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, Hassan El-Khatib, noting the country’s economic strategy has become more consistent and transparent.

Egypt has made progress in its fiscal position, achieving a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in FY2024/2025. It also reduced its overall debt to 86 percent of GDP.

More urban planning projects are also in the pipeline, through maximizing the utilization of investment opportunities in new cities and increase private sector involvement to establish urban expansions, Madbouly explained.

NBAA is helping lead a new chapter for business aviation in Washington state by bringing together an industry coalition to address recent legislative changes and foster stronger, more collaborative relationships with state leaders and communities.

The newly formed coalition is a powerhouse of industry advocates, including state and national NBAA members, the Pacific Northwest Business Aviation Association, allied national associations, local business owners and representatives from across the business aviation industry. This broad coalition reflects a shared commitment to ensure that aviation’s contributions to Washington’s economy and communities are well understood and valued.

The group’s primary mission, for now, is to champion an industry response to Senate Bill 5801, which passed late in the last state legislative session and imposes a burdensome tax on business aircraft owners and operators, many of whom are small and medium-sized local companies.

Citing the need to raise funds for sustainability efforts, the bill’s broad scope impacts aircraft sales, use and leasing. Although the tax will not take effect until April 1, its impact is already being felt, with some businesses reconsidering their presence in Washington state.

The measure, which passed with limited industry input, has raised significant concerns for business aviation and underscored the need for a unified voice from the business aviation community.

Recognizing the need for a coordinated response, NBAA has taken the lead in forming the new coalition, with a mission to communicate business aviation’s commitment to sustainability and its essential contribution to Washington’s economy and local communities.

“Sustainability is a driving force for NBAA and the broader aviation industry, as evidenced in our 2050 net-zero emission target and advocacy for sustainable aviation fuel,” said NBAA Regional Director Phil Derner.

“This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress,” he added. “We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

The coalition is working to open lines of communication with key partners,

including the sponsor of Senate Bill 5801, state Sen. Marko Liias, who has acknowledged the need for greater industry involvement in future legislative efforts.

The coalition also recently gathered close to 100 industry and community representatives at Paine Field (PAE) to discuss aviation’s needs in Washington state and hear from state Rep. Tom Dent, leader of the state’s aviation caucus and a strong industry advocate.

“Our conversations with lawmakers have created opportunities to share the industry’s perspective, highlight the broader effects of Senate Bill 5801 and explore ways to ensure that future policies support both sustainability and economic vitality,” said Derner.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy and its environment.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BAI-March-April-2021-Member-Profile-Premier-Bone-King-Air-C90A-ramp.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 10:56:55.279887

Sustainable Aviation Fuel gives airlines a practical path to lower lifecycle emissions while preserving connectivity. The United Kingdom already hosts promising research centres and feedstock suppliers. What has been missing is a reliable domestic market signal large enough to unlock private capital. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill aims to create that signal.

How committee stage works

During committee stage every clause is read aloud and members can suggest amendments. Because peers sit without constituency pressures they often look closely at technical wording. This slow method may appear ceremonial yet it routinely spots unintended loopholes before a bill returns to the Commons.

Revenue certainty in plain language

At the heart of the proposal is a government backed counterparty that will sign long term contracts with fuel producers. Instead of subsidising every litre up front the state promises to top up revenue only when the market price falls below an agreed floor. A less obvious benefit is cheaper borrowing. Banks price risk aggressively; guaranteed minimum cash flow can reduce interest rates enough to shave millions from project costs.

Wider effects on travellers

Members have flagged potential impacts on ticket prices. Early modelling shows that even full SAF compliance by 2030 would add roughly the cost of a coffee to a short haul fare. Meanwhile airlines gain resilience against future carbon pricing.

Staying informed

Citizens can stream every debate on Parliament TV and read verbatim transcripts the same day. Written briefings from the Lords Library explain each proposed change in clear language.

Conclusion

The committee process may move deliberately, yet it is steadily building a foundation for scalable, cleaner aviation. By coupling scrutiny with an elegant revenue backstop, the Bill positions the United Kingdom to capture jobs, innovation and climate gains from homegrown fuel.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-44.svg,N,,2025-12-08 08:56:18.133055

China has also expanded airborne atmospheric monitoring in recent years through its meteorological and aviation research institutes, using dedicated research aircraft and modified transport planes to measure greenhouse gases and regional air pollution.","Japan Airlines (JAL) and its research partners said they will transfer sensors used in a government-backed atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring programme, known as CONTRAIL, to Boeing 787-9 aircraft, preserving one of the world’s longest-running airborne climate datasets as Japan retires older widebody jets and expands climate surveillance across new regions.

The programme, jointly led by the airlines and Japan’s national research institutes, has collected more than 30,000 greenhouse gas datasets from about 22,000 commercial flights over 30 years. This has formed the core of the country’s upper-atmosphere CO2 monitoring and the datasets are a critical reference for global climate modelling.

The shift follows the retirement of JAL’s Boeing 777 fleet that had previously carried the sensors, leaving only one operational aircraft earlier this year and raising concerns over potential data disruption, according to a statement by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment on 5 December.

The first modified 787-9 jet will begin observation on a JAL flight from Tokyo’s Narita airport to Frankfurt on Wednesday, after a ferry flight from Haneda earlier in the day, with four more aircraft to be converted by the end of the financial year. This restores the the total fleet carrying the sensors to five aircraft. A ferry flight is a non-commercial flight used solely to reposition an aircraft from one location to another, usually without paying passengers.

Launched in 1993 by JAL, the JAL Foundation and the Meteorological Research Institute of the Japan Meteorological Agency, and later joined by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) and aircraft interiors maker Jamco, the project equips commercial aircraft with instruments that continuously measure atmospheric CO2 and collect air samples of methane and nitrous oxide at near-stratospheric cruising altitudes.

The system consists of a continuous CO2 analyser capable of running for up to two months and an automatic sampler that collects 12 air samples per round trip, both developed by Jamco and already fitted to the first 787-9 plane.

Data collected are released publicly via NIES servers, and Japan now holds one of the world’s largest upper-atmosphere CO2 datasets, with more than 10,000 observations over Narita, 1,700 over Bangkok and 1,500 over Sydney alone.

Scientists of the project say the aircraft sensors offer continuous, high-frequency, wide-area and vertical measurements which are unavailable from ground stations or satellites, allowing researchers to track how emissions move across hemispheres and how agricultural cycles, forest fires and industrial activity shape atmospheric composition.

The upgraded fleet will extend monitoring deeper into the southern hemisphere via Melbourne, closer to the Arctic through Frankfurt routes, and for the first time into the Middle East via Doha, while also resuming observations over India through Delhi, where crop cycles have already been shown to influence seasonal CO2 fluctuations. Researchers previously detected emissions spikes over Singapore during Indonesia’s 2015 forest fires comparable to Japan’s annual national output.

“Through atmospheric observation using next-generation aircraft, we will continue to track changes in greenhouse gas absorption and emissions at both the global scale and across major metropolitan areas, while also using the data to verify the effectiveness of emissions-reduction measures,” said the ministry.

Japan’s programme operates alongside a smaller number of comparable efforts overseas. In Europe, a government-backed research infrastructure known as In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS), equips selected long-haul aircraft operated by carriers including Lufthansa, Air France, China Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Iberia with atmospheric monitoring instruments.

Building on the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapour by Airbus In-Service Aircraft (MOZAIC) programme launched in 1994, designed to measure the composition of the atmosphere using commercial passenger aircraft during routine flights, and formalised in 2011, IAGOS measures ozone, carbon monoxide and water vapour on every equipped flight, with optional modules adding greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as aerosols and cloud particles. Data are used in evaluating European climate and air-quality models and in studies cited by the IPCC.

China has also expanded airborne atmospheric monitoring in recent years through its meteorological and aviation research institutes, using dedicated research aircraft and modified transport planes to measure greenhouse gases and regional air pollution.

These campaigns are typically designed around specific scientific studies or policy questions, and their datasets are usually published through individual research projects rather than via long-running, open operational databases like Japan’s CONTRAIL or Europe’s IAGOS systems.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/srtgraphy-Q4km-Yt20oA-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 04:56:33.999308

This development expands the intellectual property protection of CPTech’s breakthrough technology, which is a key component of the company’s Plastics-to-SAF (P2SAF) programme.

The newly granted patents add to the UK patent that was first awarded in 2022, increasing the global reach of CPTech’s proprietary method for converting low-grade, highly variable pyrolysis oils into ultra-low sulphur fuels and circular petrochemical feedstocks. This technology improves stability, reduces impurities, and allows for more efficient downstream upgrading.

CPTech’s multi-stage upgrading process, which includes fractional condensation, tailored hydrotreating, and precision distillation, was originally developed for ultra-low sulphur diesel, naphtha, and marine fuels. It is now a central enabling technology within the P2SAF programme, allowing CPTech to transform mixed waste plastics into an ultra-clean product suitable for further refining into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This approach was recently showcased by CPTech CEO Dr. Andrew Odjo at the SAF Global Summit, where he presented the UK’s first Plastics-to-SAF pathway to over 500 policymakers, airlines, and industry leaders.

Dr. Odjo stated, “The fundamentals matter. Reliable, consistent upgrading of plastic-derived oils is essential if we are to diversify SAF feedstocks. Securing these patents strengthens our ability to scale this work globally.”

The timing of the patents aligns with a surge in momentum for CPTech, as the company recently announced the arrival of equipment for its first P2SAF pilot facility, set to be commissioned in Q1 2026. This will be the first real-world demonstration of the SAFe-P2SAF platform, marking the transition of the technology from stage-presentation to steel-in-the-ground deployment.

With UK and EU SAF mandates coming into force, increasing pressure on bio-based feedstock supply chains, and growing airline commitments to decarbonisation, alternative circular feedstocks such as waste plastics are gaining strategic importance.

By securing patent protection in two major energy markets – the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – CPTech is positioning itself to license, develop, and protect its technology across jurisdictions that are central to global fuel production.

CPTech’s patented process addresses long-standing challenges associated with raw pyrolysis oil, which is typically unstable, oxygen-rich, metal-laden, and unsuitable for use in refineries or engines without extensive upgrading. By increasing stability, controlling variability, and removing sulphur, nitrogen, and other contaminants, the technology produces a cleaner, more predictable intermediate oil – exactly what is required for advanced aviation-grade upgrading.

Dr. Odjo commented, “This patent was never just about improving diesel. It was about unlocking a pathway for waste plastics to become genuinely circular. Today, that pathway leads directly into SAF.”

With further announcements expected later this year, the expanded patent protection sends a clear signal: CPTech is not only innovating in the lab and on the stage – it is securing the legal and commercial underpinnings needed to scale plastics-to-fuel production globally.

Dr. Katerina Garyfalou, COO of Clean Planet Technologies, stated, “Turning difficult waste into strategic low-carbon fuels requires more than good science. It demands certainty, protection, and the ability to scale with confidence. These patents help us do exactly that.”

Clean Planet Technologies (CPTech) is a subsidiary of the Clean Planet Group, dedicated to developing proprietary technologies that enable the sustainable use of plastics and the reduction of carbon emissions.

Row-crop producers across the South faced another difficult year in 2025. Weather challenges led to wide yield variability across much of the region. Even where yields were strong, low commodity prices and persistently high input costs kept margins tight, leaving many operations near or below breakeven for a third straight year. Shifts in acreage were common, with corn gaining ground at the expense of cotton and, in some areas, soybeans.

Financial stress remains a major concern heading into 2026, as limited storage capacity, tighter credit conditions and low prices continue to pressure farm profits. To capture conditions across the south, we asked Extension agricultural economists in each state to provide a brief summary of the 2025 season. Their state-by-state perspectives are below.

Arkansas: Ryan Loy, Hunter Biram and Scott Stiles, University of Arkansas

Arkansas row crop producers entered the 2025 crop year in one of the most financially challenging environments of the past decade, as crop receipts fell by $465 million to $4.46 billion, marking the third consecutive annual decline.

Corn led the downturn with a 31% year-over-year decline, followed by soybean and rice receipts, while cotton receipts remain soft due to acreage reductions. At the same time, production expenses remain elevated relative to historical averages, with fertilizer, seed, labor and interest costs continuing to pressure operating margins.

Across all principal crops, state-average net returns are projected to be negative, with breakeven prices and yields often 30%-40% above expected levels; late planting from generational flooding in April further increased downside risk. Record ad hoc assistance through ECAP (Emergency Commodity Assistance Program) and SDRP (Supplemental Disaster Relief Program) is expected to exceed $1 billion and offset a portion of these losses. However, net farm income for the crop sector is still projected to remain negative even after accounting for program payments.

The mounting financial strain facing Arkansas producers continues as they confront low commodity prices, persistently high input costs and tighter credit conditions.

Kentucky: Grant Gardner, University of Kentucky

Three consecutive years of lower prices have already put Kentucky producers in a difficult position, and this year’s extreme yield variability is adding even more pressure. Some areas will post record yields, while others will fall well below average — especially soybeans, which are currently rated in the worst condition of any state.

A major concern right now is the lack of soybeans in storage. At harvest, many producers moved beans rather than storing them due to uncertainty surrounding the trade dispute, leaving most available storage filled with corn. That decision removed the opportunity to take advantage of last month’s rally in soybean futures, and many producers were unable to benefit from the price improvement when it finally arrived.

While diversified operations with livestock may still be close to breakeven, row crop-focused farms are likely hovering at or below breakeven for the third consecutive year, tightening cash reserves and leaving many operations increasingly vulnerable to financial stress or potential default.

Louisiana: Michael Deliberto, Louisiana State University

In Louisiana, corn acres increased by 330,000 acres (+75%) from 2024 to 2025. Most producers favored corn over cotton (and, to a lesser extent, soybeans) due to grain price competitiveness. Overall, yields were near the previous four-year average of 176 bushels per acre. Prices are finally becoming somewhat favorable for producers who elected to store their crop.

Like most of the Midsouth region, cotton acres in Louisiana were down year-over-year. Producers planted only 90,000 acres in 2025. Despite the low acreage, yields were at record highs at 1,314 pounds per acre, nearly a 250-pound-per-acre increase from the previous year. While yields were excellent, prices remained low. The high cost of production, coupled with the narrow price movement within the 66-68 cents per pound range in the spring, was a main factor behind the reduced acreage in the state.

Soybean acres in Louisiana were down year-over-year. Acreage for the oilseed is typically between 1.1 million and 1.2 million acres. However, the 2025 acreage was 790,000, mainly due to lackluster prices and trade uncertainty surrounding exports. Yields were the highest in five years, coming in at 54 bushels per acre.

Rice acres in Louisiana totaled 482,000 planted acres in 2025, the most since 2010. The yield per acre was 6,650 pounds, which is on par with the five-year average. High production costs and decreasing rice prices at harvest presented a major challenge for rice growers heading into the winter.

Mississippi: Will Maples, Mississippi State University

Weather played a major role in Mississippi’s 2025 crop. Frequent heavy rains delayed planting for many producers, and late-summer drought stressed crops, resulting in significant yield variability across the state. Soybeans remained the largest crop at 1.8 million acres, but growers shifted more toward corn than cotton, planting 900,000 acres of corn compared with 330,000 acres of cotton. Financial conditions remain difficult.

The price environment is still unfavorable, and because Mississippi producers harvest early and lack the storage capacity common in other states, many were unable to capitalize on the recent soybean price rally. High production costs continue to squeeze margins, leaving most producers facing negative profits for the third consecutive year. Looking ahead to 2026, a growing number of producers have expressed equity concerns as they evaluate their farm financing options.

Tennessee: Aaron Smith, University of Tennessee

In Tennessee, 2025 row production was highly variable. Drought during July and August reduced yields and contributed to a second consecutive season of losses for many corn, soybean and cotton farmers. Cotton and soybean yields were hardest hit by the drought and will likely result in further downward revisions from current USDA yield estimates.

High input costs, low commodity prices and below trend yields resulted in per-acre losses between $100 and $250 for many producers. Before crop insurance and other government payments, Tennessee corn, cotton, soybean and wheat farmers are projected to lose over $400 million in 2025. With substantial year-over-year losses, many producers will carry operating debt over into the next season for the second straight year.

Obtaining credit for the 2026 crop will be challenging for many producers without ad hoc government payments. Canola acres in Tennessee and Kentucky continued to expand in the fall of 2025, providing producers with an alternative to more traditional double-cropping systems. Growth in canola acreage has been driven by contracted acres, primarily in northwest Tennessee, to support a pilot program to produce sustainable aviation fuel.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt93a8d80d9bb5e1a9/6930741129b53052e7704fac/1208M1-4082A-1800x1013_copy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-08 04:56:50.158837

With Russia’s President Vladimir Putin arrived in India for the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit.

Expectations were high that major defense announcements—especially on the S-400 Triumf air defense system and Su-57 stealth fighter—might finally materialize. However, while the summit delivered momentum and clarity, it stopped short of sealing any new big-ticket deals.

A Focused Summit: Deepening Strategic Dialogue, Not Signing Deals

The high-level talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Putin emphasized continuity, cooperation, and calibrated modernization of India’s defense capabilities. India stressed its push for self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) in advanced aerospace systems, while Russia highlighted its readiness for technology transfer and localized production, including proposals linked to the Su-57.

But as anticipated by analysts, India chose a measured approach—accelerating discussions without committing to new purchases.

S-400: India Wants More, Russia Offers Faster Delivery—but No New Contract Yet

India reiterated strong interest in expanding its S-400 inventory, especially after the system proved decisive during Operation Sindoor (May 2025), where India used the platform to conduct 300+ km precision intercepts against Pakistani assets.

S-400 Triumf: Key Features (embedded into article)

Range: 40–400 km depending on missile variant

Targets: aircraft, drones, cruise missiles, ballistic threats

Radars: multi-layered phased array surveillance and tracking

Engagement: up to 80 targets simultaneously

Missiles: 48N6, 40N6 long-range interceptors

Outcome of Discussions

India proposed five more regiments and additional long-range missiles.

Russia offered up to 50% technology transfer and local production in India.

Russia assured completion of pending deliveries (two regiments) by FY 2026–27.

Talks on S-500 and Pantsir systems were held, but remain exploratory.

For now, the focus is on timely delivery—not new contracts.

Su-57: Russia Pushes Hard, India Stays Cautious

Russia made a renewed proposal for India to acquire the Su-57E export variant, along with a pathway to local manufacturing through HAL. This included a possible two-seat variant tailored for India and full technology transfer covering engines, radars, and stealth materials.

Su-57 Stealth Fighter: Key Features (embedded into article)

5th-gen design: low RCS shaping, composite airframe

Engines: “Izdeliye 30” (future) offering supercruise capability

Avionics: AESA radar, IRST, sensor fusion

Weapons: R-77M, Kinzhal derivatives, hypersonic-capable bays

Role: air superiority + deep strike + electronic attack

India’s Strategic Calculus: Partnerships, Not Dependency

The summit’s outcome matches India’s “multi-alignment” strategy:

Russia remains India’s largest arms supplier (36% from 2020–24).

India is expanding ties with the U.S. (MH-60R, GE engines) and France (Rafale M).

Sanctions and Ukraine-related production delays force India to diversify.

Outside defense, the two leaders signed 20+ MoUs on trade, energy, labor mobility, and nuclear cooperation.

Looking Ahead: Decisions Expected in 2026

India is expected to finalize:

New missile procurement under the 2026 defense budget

S-400 support infrastructure and MRO setup in India

Possible conditional movement on Su-57 by mid-2026, depending on AMCA timelines

Social media reactions echoed the expert consensus:

“No big-ticket deals, but strong strategic continuity.”

Conclusion

No new contracts were signed—but both nations reinforced the defense relationship’s depth. India continues to strengthen deterrence while waiting for the right moment to commit to next-generation platforms.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sukhoi_Design_Bureau_054_Sukhoi_Su-57_49581303977-e1690730325106.jpg?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 04:57:29.534381

Australia risks missing its environmental targets if it fails to win greater investment from China and should change its policies to avoid being left behind other nations.

Reforms should include more transparency about foreign investment decisions, clean energy advocates have recommended, and a “green lane fast track” for strategic renewable energy investments.

Think tank Climate Energy Finance issued the warnings on Monday in a report analysing China’s growing global investments in zero-emissions technology such as solar panels, batteries, hydro-electricity and green hydrogen.

It comes days after the Australian Energy Market Commission revealed electricity prices were expected to fall in the next five years but could rise in 2035 if renewable energy investments did not meet expectations.

Climate Energy Finance’s report, called Rising Tide, analysed China’s clean technology investments during the past three years.

It found Chinese companies have committed more than $US180 billion ($A271 billion) to energy projects such as wind and solar developments since 2023, adding $US100 billion of investment in just one year.

Notable investments include an industrial park producing green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel in Brazil, a hydro-electricity project in Peru, and battery gigafactories in Spain and France.

But Chinese spending in Australia has collapsed, the report found, with outbound direct investment accounting for 1.5 per cent of the nation’s total, down by 85 per cent since 2018.

The low investment rate was particularly troubling, China analyst and report author Caroline Wang said, given 70 per cent of Australia’s clean energy investments come from overseas.

“Australia stands at a critical juncture,” she said.

“Not engaging with China’s capital and expertise will delay Australia’s net-zero transition, putting at risk its decarbonisation goals and future prosperity in a net-zero global economy.”

The group issued five recommendations to boost Chinese investment in Australian projects, including a framework and working group to establish co-operation, an advisory group to issue recommendations, and foreign investment policy reforms, including a fast-track for renewable energy projects.

Without changes, Australia could struggle to meet its 2035 climate target to reduce emissions between 62 and 70 per cent, Ms Wang said.

“A multipolar world, no longer centred on the US … necessitates an urgent overhaul of its economic, foreign investment and foreign policy settings,” she said.

“This means strategically working with China or being left behind in the new world order.”

Taking a sensible, managed approach to allowing Chinese investment in energy projects would be the key to the industry’s success, Ember senior energy analyst Muyi Yang said.

“Almost everyone agrees you can’t hit climate goals without working with China but once co-operation moves to actually making clean products together, worries about over-reliance and de-risking suddenly grow louder,” he said.

“The real challenge isn’t to cut China out, it’s to build more diversified, resilient supply chains that still tap into China’s know-how while helping other countries grow their own clean industries.”",https://i0.wp.com/citynewsqbn.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/20250318124721122363-original-1-scaled-e1765146687430.jpg?fit=900%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 04:57:35.664379

From the CEO of Los Angeles International Airport to the CEO of San Diego International Airport, they all have this vast experience that I love to tap into and pick their brain on different ideas,"" he says.
It’s hard to think of another business with such a large supplier and partner base as an international airport.
""Ontario International Airport proves what’s possible when the governing board and leadership team lead with collaboration, accountability and shared vision.","Atif Elkadi began working in the aviation industry almost by accident. In mid-2008, he moved with his family to Dubai, ready to take on the role of brand manager for a theme park company.

Then the global financial crisis hit.

Fortunately for Elkadi, he was able to pivot into airports, something that still surprises him.

""I never thought I would ever work in an airport,"" he admits, revealing that his experience until that point had mostly been in advertising.

His skills turned out to be transferable, however, and he worked at Dubai Airports for the next four years before deciding it was time to return to the United States. Another four years at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport followed, before Elkadi spotted an opening at Ontario International Airport (ONT).

""I grew up in Northern California and I always knew I wanted to come back to California at some point,"" says Elkadi, now CEO at ONT.

Strong community

From the moment Elkadi stepped into the role of CEO, he could appreciate the strong company culture.

""The first thing I noticed was the pride and the commitment from the community for the airport and for its growth. It’s powerful,"" he says.

""For me, it was like, ‘This is exactly where I want to raise my family. This is where I want to be. I want to be a part of this.’""

He acknowledges that part of this comes down to the attitude of the board and its willingness to encourage new ideas. And under the slogan ‘So Cal. So Easy.’, ONT hopes to showcase its focus on convenience, accessibility and top-tier customer service.

Partners with organizations to build strategic plans, strengthen team communication and create cultures that perform with integrity, innovation and confidence.

With an emphasis on ensuring passengers can move from curbside to gate as quickly and enjoyably as possible, Elkadi wants to keep a human touch across the experience.

""We really serve one of the fastest-growing regions in the country,"" he points out. ""Our area, called the ‘Inland Empire’, is projected to add about a million people over the next 20–25 years. And that growth, coupled with a very diverse economy, really positions us as both a community hub and a global gateway.""

After returning to local ownership in 2016, airport governance is now guided by a board deeply invested in the region’s future, focusing on the needs of the local community.

As Elkadi says, ""We are an airport for the community, and that’s what we’re here for.""

Green gateway

That community connection has also driven the airport’s commitment to sustainability.

""In California, sustainability is a very popular word,"" Elkadi explains.

As such, sustainability isn’t an empty buzzword, but a core part of its operations. Sustainability considerations are discussed in virtually every area of the airport, becoming an integral factor when planning everything from power supplies to EV infrastructure.

Elkadi reveals that collaboration with airlines and cargo partners to reduce emissions has resulted in ONT expanding its infrastructure for EV charging and investing in electric trucks.

""We use a lot of recycled material in our runway projects, as well as having advanced stormwater systems that recharge the groundwater. We also offer support for sustainable aviation fuel adoption and investment in greener infrastructure,"" he notes.

A central challenge in achieving sustainability goals is having the right support infrastructure in place from a power perspective. But thanks to long-standing partnerships with airports in California around green initiatives, real environmental benefits are possible.

""I would say all of us who lead airports in California probably have the biggest challenge in the country because in California, the demands are a little bit more than in other states. So we work together to ensure we can do that,"" he explains.

Elkadi meets quarterly with airport directors and CEOs across California to exchange ideas and best practices.

""These are really, really smart and talented people. From the CEO of Los Angeles International Airport to the CEO of San Diego International Airport, they all have this vast experience that I love to tap into and pick their brain on different ideas,"" he says.

""We all have our own distinct challenges in our individual airports, but when it comes to sustainability and environmental issues, we talk about how they’re handling it, what they’re doing that worked, what didn’t work, so that we can all work together.""

Essential partnerships

Partnerships extend beyond links between airports. On the first day of the job at ONT, board members made it clear to Elkadi how valuable solid relationships are at every level of the organization.

""They said, ‘It’s not about the transaction, it’s about building the relationship and sustaining it,’"" Elkadi remembers. ""I’ll never forget it, and that’s really been our motto moving forward.""

It’s hard to think of another business with such a large supplier and partner base as an international airport. From global logistics firms, including Amazon and UPS, to local police and fire departments and the United States Customs and Border Protection, Elkadi is deeply involved with their regional leadership teams to ensure all organizations are working from the same playbook.

""It’s extremely important to have open dialogue about the relationship we have with all of our partners,"" he adds.

Getting to a place where communication is seamless and based on trust isn’t an overnight process. Thanks to the work put in by Elkadi in building these relationships, when something comes up that needs to be addressed, it is easy to get to the bottom of any issues.

""We can have a quick conversation and make a fix pretty quickly as opposed to if it were transactional and you needed to go through multiple layers, so those relationships play a very critical role in our success,"" he confirms.

Southern California-based consulting firm Jacob Green & Associates works closely with Elkadi and the wider leadership team on strategic planning, risk assessments and emergency response, helping to ensure these diverse collaborations are seamlessly carried out.

In the aviation space, where small issues can rapidly escalate, having access to trusted external partners can make a crucial difference in times of crisis.

Bold mindset

Rather than focusing on innovation for innovation’s sake, Elkadi wholeheartedly believes that improved security, safety and efficiency must be the end goal, as opposed to vanity metrics.

""It’s everybody’s responsibility. The way our organization works is that with every idea, it doesn’t matter what position you’re in, bring it forward and let’s see if we can make it happen,"" he says.

Based on the ambitious ONT Bold development plan, the entire airport is committed to transforming how people think about the airport’s role.

""It’s not just a transportation hub, but a platform for connection, innovation and resilience,"" Elkadi explains.

The ONT Bold plan has now become a mindset held by employees that guides how they approach all parts of their jobs.

During his tenure, Elkadi has doubled down on strengthening what ONT does best: creating an enjoyable customer experience. For example, a US$90 million Federal Aviation Administration-supported project to rehabilitate runways, including enhanced safety, adding lighting, modernizing electrical systems and installing sustainable stormwater management was one of the first initiatives led by Elkadi.

""It’s not necessarily sexy, but it’s very important. We’re currently expanding our Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint lanes, which means we’re going to make our already short wait times even shorter,"" he reveals. ""And then our ongoing collaboration with TSA includes a new global entry enrollment center.""

Before the new global entry enrollment center, travelers would have to visit airports in San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson or other areas just to do their global entry interviews. Now, this five-to-10-minute interview can take place at ONT, further streamlining the experience.

""My vision is that when the world arrives in Southern California, whether it’s for the Olympics, business travel or to visit family, ONT will be their most welcoming, efficient and human experience that they’ve had at an airport,"" Elkadi concludes.

""Ontario International Airport proves what’s possible when the governing board and leadership team lead with collaboration, accountability and shared vision. This alignment has built a culture that delivers results passengers can feel. Partnering with the airport reinforces why we do this work, helping organizations turn great teams into extraordinary ones."" – Jacob Green, President & CEO, Jacob Green & Associates",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08084640/AtifElkadi_OIA_Sharing.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 00:57:45.589393

However we are not closed to the idea and we keep eyes on the development in this area,” said a spokesperson of Godavari Biorefineries.

US company LanzaJet, a subsidiary of LanzaTech Global, a leader in industrial carbon recycling, announced last month operationalisation and commencement of SAF production at its facility in Georgia, marking as the world’s first commercial production of jet fuel using ethanol as a feedstock. Earlier, used cooking oils were the main feedstock to produce SAF and it was not that successful, so far.

Industry sources said that for a greenfield project of about 25,000 tonne annual capacity SAF plant will require an investment of Rs 1400-1600 crore and will take three and half years to start operation.

Triveni’s Sinha said that to produce 80 tonne of SAF, 200 kilo litres of ethanol is required on a daily basis. He said the industry expects a policy roll out in this fiscal, which will provide the necessary foundation for setting up plants.

“Either the airlines have to purchase or the oil marketing companies (OMCs) need to buy SAF from the producers at a government-set rate, similar to the ethanol blending with petrol (EBP) programme. However, the government should fully control the SAF sector to make it sustainable, particularly before allowing plants to come up,” an industry expert said.

SAF is highly promising business but at the same time it highly capital intensive, said Ravi Gupta , chairman of sugar bioenergy group in the Indian Federation of Green Energy (IFGE). Unless there is a clear SAF blend policy and OMCs enter into a long-term agreement, investors may not invest in it, he added.

Currently, the ethanol manufacturers are at a quandary after creating capacities of over 1,900 crore litres whereas the OMCs consented to buy only 1,048 crore litres during 2025-26 supply year (November-October).

At a recent media briefing, Deepak Ballani, director general of Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA), had said: “After meeting the alcohol and other industrial demand for 330 crore litres, there will still be unutilised capacity of more than 450 crore litres.” Ballani had also said that while the sugar mills have about 900 crore litres capacity, they have been allotted only 289 crore litres of ethanol in cycle 1 tender by OMCs.

He also said that there could be 1950-2050 crore litres of additional demand for ethanol generated, including about 100 crore litres from 5 per cent blending with aviation fuel.

International Civil Aviation Organisation has already adopted a vision to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5 per cent by 2030 through cleaner energies like use of SAF and it requires using 23 million tonnes of cleaner fuel.

CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) allows airlines claim credits for lower lifecycle emissions after blending SAF with jet fuel, and the binding phase starts from 2027. India has already declared to achieve 1 per cent blending by 2027, 5 per cent by 2030.

Tentang DevvStream DevvStream (Nasdaq: DEVS) adalah perusahaan pengelolaan karbon yang berfokus pada pengembangan, investasi, dan penjualan aset lingkungan di seluruh dunia, termasuk kredit karbon dan sertifikat energi terbarukan.","Penggabungan ini memadukan keahlian penciptaan kredit karbon dengan bahan bakar negatif karbon produksi A.S. berbiaya rendah untuk memenuhi permintaan global yang terus meningkat.

Southern mendapatkan alokasi obligasi senilai $402 juta dari Louisiana Community Community Development Authority untuk mendukung fasilitas biomass-to-fuel andalannya.

Southern melakukan Investasi Swasta dalam Ekuitas Publik (PIPE) pertama pada DevvStream sekitar $2 juta dengan harga $15,58 per lembar saham

Sacramento, Calif. & New Orleans--(ANTARA/Business Wire)-- DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”) adalah perusahaan terkemuka di bidang pengelolaan karbon dan monetisasi aset lingkungan, sedangkan Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”) adalah produsen asal AS di bidang bahan bakar berbiaya rendah yang terbuat dari biomassa. Proyek unggulan Southern di Louisiana berencana memanfaatkan biomassa limbah kayu regional untuk menghasilkan metanol hijau dan Bahan Bakar Penerbangan Berkelanjutan (“SAF”) negatif karbon dalam skala besar. Hari ini kedua perusahaan mengumumkan penandatanganan perjanjian definitif untuk bergabung di bawah perusahaan baru yang berdomisili di AS dan terdaftar di Nasdaq, dengan mematuhi ketentuan penutupan yang lazim.

Perusahaan baru ini berencana membantu perusahaan penerbangan dan maritim untuk memenuhi permintaan global yang semakin ketat akibat peraturan seperti ReFuelEU dan organisasi seperti Organisasi Maritim Internasional (“IMO”) dengan cara menciptakan platform bahan bakar bersih terintegrasi buatan AS yang berpusat di Louisiana, menggunakan bahan baku dan tenaga kerja dalam negeri untuk memproduksi SAF negatif karbon dan metanol hijau dalam skala komersial. Pengoperasian perusahaan gabungan ini diperkirakan melibatkan dua divisi: divisi pertama berfokus pada solusi iklim yang menghasilkan aset lingkungan, sedangkan divisi kedua berfokus pada bahan bakar dan produk bersih, dengan fokus awal pada fasilitas biomass‑to‑fuel di Louisiana sebagaimana diumumkan sebelumnya.

Perpaduan antara jalur SAF di platform baru dan kemampuan DevvStream di bidang aset lingkungan bertujuan mengurangi beban biaya yang memperlambat penggunaan bahan bakar alternatif saat ini. Manajemen berharap dapat memanfaatkan insentif federal sejak awal selagi menargetkan daya saing biaya meskipun tanpa insentif ini, dan didukung oleh berbagai produk sampingan yang dihasilkan selama proses SAF. Perusahaan juga berencana memanfaatkan keterlibatan perusahaan penerbangan dan maritim sejak awal. Bagi investor, profil DevvStream berubah dari layanan micro‑cap menjadi bisnis bahan bakar dan kredit industri yang dapat dibiayai dengan potensi pendapatan dan skalabilitas jangka panjang. Perusahaan baru yang akan dipimpin oleh Carl Stanton sebagai CEO ini akan beroperasi dengan nama Southern Energy Renewables. Penyelesaian penggabungan bisnis diperkirakan akan dilakukan pada paruh pertama tahun 2026.

""Perusahaan penerbangan dan maritim menghadapi beberapa permintaan dekarbonisasi yang paling ambisius di dunia, dan sebagian besar ingin mematuhinya,” kata Carl Stanton, Pimpinan DevvStream. “Namun pilihan bahan bakar terbarukan saat ini masih jauh lebih mahal dibanding bahan bakar fosil sehingga memperlambat penggunaan dan menyebabkan hambatan praktik untuk bertransisi dengan kecepatan yang diharapkan oleh regulator. Merger ini berperan penting karena tujuan perpaduan antara teknologi, bahan baku berbiaya rendah, dan platform pengembangan milik Southern dengan kemampuan DevvStream di bidang aset lingkungan adalah untuk mengurangi beban biaya tersebut dan memungkinkan kepatuhan dalam skala besar.""

""Negara Bagian Louisiana tetap menjadi mitra penting dalam pengembangan inisiatif ini, dan kami harap Louisiana akan terus mendukung proyek ini selanjutnya,"" kata Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer Southern Energy Renewables. ""Kami yakin, perpaduan ketersediaan bahan baku, infrastruktur logistik, dan tenaga kerja berpengalaman di Louisiana menciptakan landasan yang kuat untuk menghasilkan daya saing jangka panjang. Kami harap dapat memperluas kemitraan dengan Lousiana selagi kami berupaya memperkuat kepemimpinan energi nasional dan memasok pasar global dengan cara yang mendukung perekonomian kita yang sedang berkembang.""

""Rencana kami dibuat untuk menyediakan bahan bakar bersih dalam skala industri dengan keunggulan biaya yang sangat jelas guna menciptakan platform canggih yang dapat bersaing secara efektif dengan Tiongkok dan seluruh dunia,"" kata Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer Southern Energy Renewables. ""Jalur limbah biomassa -> metanol -> SAF kami bergantung pada teknologi yang terbukti dan penangkapan karbon terintegrasi, dengan menargetkan salah satu profil karbon siklus hidup yang terendah di pasar.""

Mengenai transaksi ini, Stanton berkata, “Kami sangat antusias karena Southern bersedia melakukan Investasi Swasta dalam Ekuitas Publik (PIPE) pertama senilai kurang lebih $2 juta pada DevvStream seharga $15,58 per lembar saham. Langkah ini mengakui bahwa bisnis inti dan strategis bisnis monetisasi karbon DevvStream berperan penting dalam menurunkan biaya efektif bagi pelanggan. Dan mengakui skala industri maupun intensitas modal Southern sekaligus memberikan saham substansial kepada pemegang saham DevvStream di platform lebih besar dan lebih terdiversifikasi yang khusus untuk pasar SAF dan metanol hijau yang sedang berkembang.""

""Investment in essential enabling infrastructure- be it energy, telecoms, transport, health, environmental, or other critical services-often led by the private sector,"" Fergal O’Brien, Ibec's Executive Director of Lobbying and Influence, said.

""If these companies were absent or unable to secure new investment, these projects simply would not happen.""

The report gives the example of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the requirement for which is expected to cost Ireland €2.85bn by 2050. Ireland is capable of domestic production and exports, but Ibec said that without government intervention, it is unlikely that private investors will assume the high cost and risk associated with early SAF industrialisation.

“So far, we’ve collected about 160,000 tons of UCO,” Mekky said, enough to power the first phase of production.
The company aims to produce 120,000 tons of SAF annually in its initial rollout—a cleaner-burning alternative that blends with conventional jet fuel.
“We’re creating value from waste—fuel that meets international aviation standards.” In 2024, Petrochemicals Holding established Egypt Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a venture 85% owned by state firms and 15% by private sector partners.
“We’ve developed a strategy with the Ministry of Petroleum to produce up to 1 million tons of SAF by 2050,” Mekky said.","Egypt’s state-run Petrochemicals Holding Company has signed a deal with US industrial giant Honeywell to license technology that will enable the conversion of used cooking oil into Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF.

Speaking to Al Manassa, company chairperson Ibrahim Mekky said one of the project’s greatest strengths is the availability of feedstock inside Egypt—namely, the enormous volumes of cooking oil discarded daily by households and restaurants.

“So far, we’ve collected about 160,000 tons of UCO,” Mekky said, enough to power the first phase of production. The company aims to produce 120,000 tons of SAF annually in its initial rollout—a cleaner-burning alternative that blends with conventional jet fuel.

Globally, UCO is priced between $700 and $1,000 per ton, while SAF can exceed $3,000 per ton. “Most Egyptians throw used oil in the trash,” Mekky said. “We’re creating value from waste—fuel that meets international aviation standards.”

In 2024, Petrochemicals Holding established Egypt Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a venture 85% owned by state firms and 15% by private sector partners. The initiative supports Egypt’s pledge to the European Union to gradually cut aviation emissions.

Mekky said the company plans to scale SAF blending ratios in local aviation fuel from 2% between 2026–2030, to 5% by 2035, and over 10% by 2040.

SAF production remains limited globally. While some countries extract it from agricultural waste like rice straw and palm residues, Mekky argued that UCO is far more cost-effective. “The most important thing is securing the feedstock—and we’ve got more than we need.”

Honeywell has developed more than 27 SAF plants worldwide, many of which are still under construction, he added.

Foreign investment eyes Egypt's clean fuel pivot

According to Mekky, the project has drawn strong interest from foreign investors, who see Egypt not just as a market—but a regional supplier.

The company’s upcoming general assembly will announce new partners, including South Korea’s GS, with other applications under review, such as energy group OAPEC. “There’s a lot of appetite from investors to join,” he said.

ESAF aims to fully meet EgyptAir’s future SAF demand and export surplus volumes abroad. “We’ve developed a strategy with the Ministry of Petroleum to produce up to 1 million tons of SAF by 2050,” Mekky said. “Egypt will become a Middle East hub for clean jet fuel.”

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development backed the early phase with a $100 million feasibility study and grant, and is expected to lead fundraising for the remaining $570 million needed.",https://manassa.news/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/photobank/2025/26028360-19da-4d13-bbb1-a94725e5b031.png?h=feb5a2b9&itok=bUQs_NCY,N,,2025-12-08 00:57:50.340633

The Challenge: Turning a widespread resource into reliable energy Agricultural waste is everywhere, but that does not make it easy to work with.
Brightmark Energy Core Innovation: Specializes in anaerobic digestion to convert dairy manure and other organic waste into renewable natural gas (RNG).
While starting with fermentation ethanol, it can process any bioethanol source, including that derived from agricultural waste.
Wrapping Up The transformation of agricultural waste into clean energy represents a significant frontier in the fight against climate change and the pursuit of energy independence.","The push to decarbonize the world’s energy systems now overlaps with a long standing problem: what to do with the massive amount of agricultural waste produced every year.

Billions of tons of crop residues and animal waste are generated across the globe. Much of it is left to rot or is burned, which adds to air pollution and releases methane.

The result is a two sided problem.

We face avoidable environmental damage on one side, and a large source of unused energy on the other.

A growing group of startups is working to change this. They are building practical technologies that convert agricultural waste into clean energy that farmers and rural communities can actually use.

These companies are cutting waste, lowering emissions, and supporting local economies. They are also helping build a circular bioeconomy that treats waste as a resource rather than a burden.

The Challenge: Turning a widespread resource into reliable energy

Agricultural waste is everywhere, but that does not make it easy to work with. It varies widely in quality, it is often wet, and it is scattered across many small farms.

These factors make collection and conversion costly and complex.

For decades, the most common options have been burning the waste, letting it break down in fields, or using it for low value purposes.

The real challenge is to convert this scattered biomass into dependable energy, whether biogas, biofuels, biochar, or syngas, and to do it in a way that supports food production rather than competes with it.

Biogas & Biorefinery Innovators: Converting Organic Waste to Renewable Fuels

These companies utilize advanced anaerobic digestion, gasification, or pyrolysis to convert diverse organic waste streams into clean-burning gases or liquids.

Brightmark Energy

Core Innovation: Specializes in anaerobic digestion to convert dairy manure and other organic waste into renewable natural gas (RNG). Their technology captures methane emissions and uses the resulting digestate as nutrient-rich fertilizer.

Impact on the Grid/Supply Chain: Brightmark creates pipeline-quality RNG, a direct substitute for fossil natural gas, that can be injected into existing infrastructure for heating, power generation, or transportation fuel. This significantly reduces agricultural methane emissions.

Key Data Point: Operates a growing portfolio of anaerobic digester projects, including large-scale facilities processing manure from tens of thousands of dairy cows.

The date traces back to the signing of the Chicago Convention in 1944, the agreement that created the International Civil Aviation Organization and reshaped how nations cooperate in the skies.

The origin and purpose of International Civil Aviation Day

International Civil Aviation Day was formally proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996. However, the International Civil Aviation Organization had already begun marking the occasion in 1994, aligning it with the 50th anniversary of the Chicago Convention.

The purpose of the day is clear. It highlights how international air transport supports economic growth, social development, and global connectivity. It also reinforces the central role of ICAO in coordinating safe, secure, and sustainable aviation across borders.

The Chicago Convention and its global impact

The Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly called the Chicago Convention, was signed on December 7, 1944, in Chicago by 52 states. It entered into force on April 4, 1947, following its 26th ratification, the same day ICAO officially came into existence.

The convention established the legal and technical foundation for international aviation. It defined national sovereignty over airspace, set principles for international air services, and created uniform rules for safety, security, navigation, and aircraft operations.

Over time, the convention has been amended eight times to reflect changes in technology and aviation practices.

As of March 2019, 193 states were parties to the convention, representing near universal global participation in a shared aviation system.

Core principles enshrined in the convention

Several key articles of the Chicago Convention continue to shape global aviation today. Every state holds complete sovereignty over the airspace above its territory.

States are prohibited from using weapons against civil aircraft in flight. Clear rules govern scheduled international air services, customs landings, entry procedures, and aircraft inspections.

The convention also standardizes requirements for aircraft documentation, crew licensing, radio communications, and the mutual recognition of certificates issued by other states, provided they meet agreed international standards. These provisions ensure predictability, safety, and fairness across international operations.

ICAO annexes and global aviation standards

The convention is supported by nineteen annexes containing Standards and Recommended Practices.

These annexes cover nearly every aspect of civil aviation, including personnel licensing, rules of the air, meteorology, aircraft operations, airworthiness, air traffic services, accident investigation, aviation security, and environmental protection.

Environmental provisions, such as aircraft noise standards, engine emissions limits, and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, reflect the sector’s growing focus on sustainability. The annexes are regularly updated to keep pace with operational and technological change.

International Civil Aviation Day in the modern era

International Civil Aviation Day now aligns closely with broader United Nations goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Aviation is recognized as a critical enabler of trade, tourism, humanitarian assistance, and international cooperation.

Every five years, ICAO marks milestone anniversaries with a dedicated global theme.

December 7, 2024, marked the 80th anniversary of the Chicago Convention, celebrating eight decades of coordinated international aviation and reaffirming commitments to safety, innovation, and environmental responsibility.

Looking ahead at aviation’s future

ICAO’s Strategic Plan for 2026 to 2050 outlines a long-term vision as global air traffic is projected to reach 12.4 billion passengers by mid-century. The plan emphasizes safety, security, economic viability, operational efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and unmanned aircraft systems are expected to play an increasing role. ICAO supports these developments through flexible regulatory approaches that encourage innovation while preserving global harmonization.

International Civil Aviation Day remains a reminder that global aviation functions because nations choose cooperation over fragmentation, guided by principles first set down in Chicago more than eighty years ago.

Business Segments

The company has three revenue contributing business segment:

1. The Bio-Energy segment, contributing nearly 62 percent of Praj Industries’ revenue, is anchored by its Bio-Mobility platform, which develops renewable, carbon-neutral fuels for road, air and marine transportation.

Praj has a long-standing leadership in first-generation ethanol technology, offering multi-feed and multi-product plant solutions, upgrades for existing distilleries, and co-product optimisation.

They are currently being deployed at three commercial-scale bio-refineries in India, highlighting clear commercial traction.

Praj has also commercialised RenGas, its renewable natural gas technology that produces compressed biogas from agricultural residues and press mud at approximately 30 percent lower operating costs due to specialised microbial cultures. It also generates organic manure as a by-product and produces high-purity methane. An additional bio-bitumen module offers a new revenue opportunity, with applications in road construction.

In sustainable aviation fuel, Praj’s partnership with Gevo enables SAF production using renewable iso-butanol derived from sugars, starch and biomass. The company is also expanding into marine biofuels made from certified lignin-based feedstocks, an area gaining interest from global shipping companies.

2. The High Purity Solutions segment contributes 11 percent of Praj Industries’ revenue and is led by HiPurity Systems Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides end-to-end solutions for high-purity water to the pharma, biotech, and wellness industries. With over 450 installations globally, the company serves sectors including cosmetics, food and beverage, and nutraceuticals that follow compendial water quality norms.

The brewery and beverages division, established in 1994, provides customised plants, equipment, and technology solutions for breweries, offering world-class facilities that minimise water and energy usage and reduce carbon footprint. With over 70 percent market share in India and installations in Africa and Southeast Asia, this division delivers end-to-end support from conceptualisation and design to engineering, installation, and commissioning.

Current Scenario

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, sales increased from Rs. 640 crore to Rs. 842 crore, marking a growth of 31.56 percent. Operating profit rose from Rs. 31 crore to Rs. 56 crore, an expansion of 80.65 percent, while PBT improved from Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 30 crore, registering a 200 percent rise. Net profit increased from Rs. 5 crore to Rs. 19 crore, delivering strong growth of 280 percent. The operating margin improved from 5 percent to 7 percent.

On a year-on-year basis, sales increased from Rs. 816 crore to Rs. 842 crore, a modest growth of 3.19 percent. Operating profit declined from Rs. 86 crore to Rs. 56 crore, a reduction of 34.88 percent, while PBT dropped from Rs. 74 crore to Rs. 30 crore, a decline of 59.46 percent. Net profit fell from Rs. 54 crore to Rs. 19 crore, decreasing by 64.81 percent. The operating margin moderated from 11 percent to 7 percent.

The stock jumped from Rs. 43.55 on 25 March 2020 to Rs. 874 on 1 January 2025, giving investors huge returns of about 1907 percent. But after this strong run, the share began to fall sharply and is now around Rs. 313.55, which means it has dropped nearly 64 percent in less than a year. During the same period, the company’s trailing twelve-month profit growth has also slipped by about 62 percent, showing a clear slowdown in its recent performance.

What Went Wrong?

The company has been impacted by a sudden slowdown in ethanol demand largely due to oversupply. The rapid government push for E20 compliance was previously a major growth driver, but the target was achieved much earlier than expected, leading to a sharp drop in new greenfield ethanol plant orders and delays in ongoing projects.

There have also been concerns in the market about E20 causing issues in vehicles, although the government has clarified that no such problems exist. Future growth could revive once the roadmap for the E30 target becomes clear, but until then, the outlook remains uncertain.

Global factors have added further pressure. Tariffs and a broader slowdown in clean energy investments in the US caused several ethanol and low-carbon fuel projects to be deferred, with customers delaying their investment decisions.

As a result, the order pipeline moved much slower than anticipated. At the same time, the GenX facility has been running at very low utilisation while carrying high fixed costs, although the management has said that GenX orders are gradually returning.

Many energy-transition projects the company had earlier pursued have either stalled or remain on hold. Based on its assessment, the company expects clarity on these projects to take more time and has started reshaping its strategy by targeting a wider customer base across different industries, with a stronger focus on opportunities in oil and gas, piping, structures, and conventional energy markets.

Execution timelines have also lengthened because several customers are facing funding challenges. Many projects are struggling to reach financial closure as lenders are carrying out tighter scrutiny, and project developers are required to bring in a higher equity contribution. This has delayed debt arrangements, slowing down execution cycles.

The company clarified that the issue is not with collections but with customers’ funding arrangements taking longer than before. A few projects that were stuck due to financing issues have recently achieved closure and have begun moving into execution during the quarter.

Cost pressures added to the weakness. Other expenses rose compared to last year due to higher execution activity, and under-absorption of fixed costs at the GenX facility further weighed on EBITDA. The facility’s fixed cost is around Rs. 8.5-9 crore per month, and while there was some absorption this quarter, it remained limited because execution is still at a very small scale due to minimal order booking.

The effective tax rate also increased to 35 percent in Q2FY26 and 37 percent for H1FY26, as the deferred tax asset being created on GenX losses is recognised at a lower rate than Praj Industries’ usual tax rate.

Future Growth Drivers

Shift Toward Lifecycle Services and Brownfield Opportunities

Praj Industries said that while new greenfield ethanol projects are slowing, the company is now shifting its attention to lifecycle services and brownfield opportunities across its existing installed base. This includes work such as plant upgrades, improving efficiency, and adding new co-products to already running facilities.

Global Bioenergy Momentum and Low-Carbon Ethanol Projects

On the international bioenergy side, the company highlighted a steady flow of inquiries from the US for low-carbon ethanol projects that will benefit from 45Z tax credits. Praj is currently executing its first low-carbon ethanol project in the US, which is expected to be commissioned by the end of this financial year. In Latin America, countries like Panama and Argentina are moving towards higher blending mandates, while Indonesia has already introduced a 10 percent mandate. Vietnam plans to move to E20 by 2026, and many African nations are also preparing to introduce or expand ethanol blending requirements.

Growing Pipeline in the Compressed Biogas Segment

In the compressed biogas segment, Praj has begun work on its first Napier Grass-based project. The company is seeing strong inquiry levels for projects based on Napier Grass and press mud. However, the wider market is expected to scale up once India’s national gas grid and its connectivity improve further. The service business continues to grow with strong order inflows for performance enhancers, related solutions, and biogenic CO2 capture technologies.

Breakthrough in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

In the sustainable aviation fuel segment, the alcohol-to-jet demo plant at Praj Matrix is now operational and has successfully produced SAF from ethanol. This facility is the world’s first integrated alcohol-to-jet fuel demo plant and is expected to boost customer confidence in both the technology and commercial-scale investment decisions.

Recovery Signs in Brewery and PHS Businesses

The brewery division is seeing early signs of revival, especially in greenfield markets driven by rising demand. In the PHS business, there is growing traction for high-capacity fermenters, complex injectable systems, and blood plasma solutions. New opportunities are also emerging in high-purity water requirements for storage batteries, electric vehicles, solar cells, and semiconductors.

High-Purity Water Opportunities Across New-Age Sectors

For ultra-pure water, Praj noted that new sectors such as semiconductors, solar panel manufacturing, and battery production are opening up in India. These industries require high-purity water at a different scale compared to pharma, but the underlying technology is similar. The company plans to leverage its strong pharma expertise to expand into these new high-growth markets.

Large Opportunity Emerging in Diesel Blending Trials

Praj also mentioned that trials with oil marketing companies and agencies like ARAI are being planned for diesel blending. Once the results are validated, it could unlock significant opportunities, especially because diesel consumption in India is 2-3.5x higher than petrol due to heavy transport usage. This opportunity could potentially be larger than the E20 ethanol blending programme.

CIP Dispatches Expected to Ease Working Capital Pressure

Management added that dispatches under the Contracts-in-Progress (CIP) category should start moving out by December or January. They expect this to ease the temporary working capital blockage seen this quarter, and operating cash flows should improve as these dispatches roll out over the next two to three months.

The EU's Sustainable Transport Investment Plan has launched the eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, aiming to mobilise at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects. This ambition has been overfulfilled! On 4 December, alongside the announcement of the third auction of the European Hydrogen Bank, the EU successfully united eight Member States - Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain - to accelerate the production and uptake of synthetic aviation fuels (eSAF). The funds will be used to finance H2Global-style double-sided auctions in 2026, designed to provide producers with stable long-term revenue and buyers with competitive short-term contracts. This initiative aims to give the sector the necessary boost to bring eSAF projects to Final Investment Decision (FID) and address calls to weaken or abandon the eSAF sub-quota. When designing the auction tender, it should be open for Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) proposals. MtJ is expected to earn its ASTM approval in mid-2026. This versatile eSAF production process combines cost-effective sourcing of green methanol in countries with optimal production conditions and synthesizes jet fuel at an industrial scale plant in Europe. Hence MtJ sits between two positions: ""Europe-only to strengthen our technological base"" and ""imports only to get the cheapest price.""

The European Union has committed a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the commercial production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This public capital immediately de-risks the energy and chemical supply chain by providing a financial bridge to overcome the high initial capital expenditure for new production facilities, particularly those using the Power-to-Liquid (e-fuel) pathway. The funding is a direct policy-to-market intervention designed to ensure the industry can meet the binding regulatory requirement of a 70% SAF blending mandate by 2050.

Context

The core question for the aviation and energy sectors has been: Can the industry meet its aggressive fuel mandates without a massive public capital infusion to bridge the cost and production gap? The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation created a clear demand signal, but the high capital expenditure for new plants and the cost premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel stalled the necessary private investment. Informed professionals were waiting for a mechanism to convert this policy risk into commercial certainty.

Analysis

This development is a direct response to the binding ReFuelEU mandate, which created a future demand that the current supply chain cannot meet. The €3 billion funding acts as the necessary mechanism to build that supply. Manufacturers are now expected to accelerate Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on new SAF plants, especially those focused on synthetic e-fuels.

Think of this funding like a government-backed insurance policy for the first wave of new factories, guaranteeing that the high initial cost will not lead to stranded assets. This policy incentive causes private capital to flow, accelerating the industrial build-out.

Outlook

This development implies that the Power-to-Liquid pathway is now a commercially validated option for industrial decarbonization in aviation. The simple thing to watch next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for large-scale SAF production facilities. A sustained flow of FIDs, secured by new, long-term offtake agreements between airlines and SAF producers, will confirm that the public capital has successfully de-risked the market and that the industrial build-out is now in motion.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Decarbonized-Urban-Mobility-Electric-Tramway-Biophilic-Design-Sustainable-Infrastructure.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:43.177255

Analysts have trimmed their average price target on Honeywell International by about $2, to roughly $239. This reflects modestly higher revenue growth assumptions but slightly lower fair value and profit margin expectations following recent model updates around the Solstice spin and Q3 results.

Analyst Commentary

Street research remains broadly constructive on Honeywell, with most recent notes highlighting upside from portfolio moves and execution improvements, even as some estimates and price targets are nudged lower to reflect the Solstice separation and updated Q3 assumptions.

Bullish Takeaways

Bullish analysts see the company entering a breakup catalyst rich phase. The Solstice spin and portfolio simplification are viewed as creating a clearer roadmap to value unlock and supporting sum of the parts upside.

Several notes point to solid Q3 performance and growing momentum across core segments. This supports confidence in management execution and underpins higher price targets in the mid 250s range.

The recent Quantinuum fundraise at a higher valuation reinforces the perceived hidden value of Honeywell's strategic stakes and adds roughly mid single digit dollars per share to some sum of the parts frameworks.

Stripping out Solstice is viewed as enhancing the quality and stability of the remaining industrial and automation earnings base. This could justify a premium multiple if execution stays on track.

Bearish Takeaways

Bearish analysts are trimming price targets in the low to mid 240s range as they reset models for the loss of Solstice earnings. This modestly reduces near term EPS power and fair value estimates.

Some caution that the timing and magnitude of value realization from Quantinuum is uncertain, with a potential IPO now seen slipping toward 2026. This delays monetization and may cap near term rerating.

There is concern that guidance updates to account for fewer months of Solstice contribution and balance sheet payment transfers could create short term noise around reported growth and margins.

A subset of more cautious views emphasizes that, despite portfolio catalysts, execution still needs to remain consistently strong across all segments to justify current premium valuation levels.

This new tax reflects Singapore’s commitment to sustainable aviation and the global push for eco-friendly travel.

What Does This Mean for Travelers?

As airport taxes continue to rise across the globe, passengers can expect higher costs when booking their flights. Here are some key takeaways from these airport tax increases:

Higher ticket prices: The added airport charges will be incorporated into ticket prices, raising costs for all passengers.

Impact on long-haul travel: Travelers flying long distances or in premium classes will bear the brunt of the increases, especially in the UK and Thailand.

Sustainability initiatives: The introduction of eco-friendly levies like Singapore’s green fuel levy reflects the growing trend of sustainable aviation in response to climate concerns.

How Can Travelers Prepare for These Changes?

Opt for Direct Flights: Direct flights might be a more cost-effective option when accounting for the rising taxes on layovers.

Plan Ahead: Be mindful of the increased taxes when budgeting for your next trip.

Check for Updates: Stay informed about specific charges at your departure airport and look for any discounted routes that might offset the added costs.

When Will the Increase Take Effect?

The Thailand airport tax increase will be implemented in early 2026 and will apply to all outbound international flights from the country. Passengers planning to travel from major Thai airports, such as Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang, will need to account for the increased charges when purchasing their tickets. The increase in taxes is expected to be reflected in ticket prices as airlines adjust their fare structures. Similarly, the UK APD, India UDF, Malaysia PSC, and Singapore Green Fuel Levy will also take effect in 2026, further raising the cost of international travel for passengers flying from these countries.

Why Are Airport Taxes Increasing?

The main reason behind these increases is the need to fund the improvement of airport infrastructure across the globe. Many airports, including those in Thailand, the UK, India, Malaysia, and Singapore, are undergoing major upgrades and expansions to accommodate rising passenger numbers and the demands of modern air travel. The increased fees will also help address the negative environmental impacts of overtourism and promote sustainable travel practices.

Tourism levies and airport taxes are increasingly being used to balance the growth of international travel with the need to manage resources effectively. Airports are using the additional funds to upgrade runways, terminals, and air traffic management systems, as well as to incorporate green technologies like SAF to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation.

How Will This Affect Travelers?

Travelers can expect to see higher ticket prices as airlines pass on the increased airport taxes and charges to passengers. The rise in travel-related costs is a growing trend in the aviation sector, and it may discourage some travelers from taking long-haul flights or flying during peak seasons. However, the increased fees are necessary to ensure that airports remain operational and capable of handling the increasing demands of international travel.

Travelers should also be aware that many of these fees will be rolled into their ticket prices, so it is essential to factor in the cost increases when planning future trips. As airlines and airports adjust to these new charges, passengers will need to navigate higher ticket costs and potential service fees.

Conclusion

The increase in airport taxes across Thailand, the UK, India, Malaysia, and Singapore is part of a broader global trend that will shape the travel industry in 2026. While these increases will affect the cost of international travel, they are necessary to support the growing demands of the aviation sector and promote sustainable travel practices. Travelers planning to fly internationally should be prepared for higher ticket prices and factor in these increases when booking flights.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uk-with-people.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 03:56:13.192757

With the balance sheet de-risking complete and a multiyear SAF ramp on deck, does a modest discount to analyst targets hint at underappreciated upside, or is the market already baking in Calumet’s next leg of growth?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.8% Undervalued

With Calumet last closing at $19.34 versus a narrative fair value of about $21.45, the prevailing storyline leans toward modest upside from here.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026, enabling Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs, capturing premiums of $1-$2/gallon over renewable diesel and tapping into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally. This is likely to drive a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Want to see how one ambitious SAF ramp, steady top line growth, and a richer future earnings multiple all combine to justify that premium fair value? Read on.

Result: Fair Value of $21.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could shift if policy support for renewables weakens or if high leverage constrains Calumet’s ability to fund MaxSAF and other growth projects.

Takeaway Point: Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a game-changer for the aviation industry, offering a realistic and scalable path to reducing carbon emissions while keeping the world connected.","Aviation connects the world, driving economic growth and cultural exchange. Yet, it also comes with a heavy environmental cost. The industry is responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon emissions a figure expected to rise as air travel grows. To address this challenge, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as a critical solution for reducing aviation’s climate impact.

What Are Sustainable Aviation Fuels?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are alternatives to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. They are made from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal waste, or even advanced processes like capturing carbon directly from the air. Unlike conventional fuel, SAF can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock and production method.

What makes SAF particularly appealing is its compatibility. It can be blended with existing jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without the need for modifications. This makes SAF a practical, immediate pathway for decarbonizing aviation while longer-term solutions, such as hydrogen or electric aircraft, are still being developed.

The Industry Shift Toward SAF

Major airlines and aviation hubs around the world are increasingly committing to SAF adoption. Carriers such as United Airlines, Lufthansa, and KLM have already begun incorporating SAF into their operations. Airports in Europe and the U.S. are setting up dedicated supply chains, while governments are introducing incentives and mandates to accelerate production.

For many stakeholders, SAF is not only an environmental necessity but also a business opportunity. Investments in SAF production facilities are growing, driven by the rising demand for low-carbon air travel from both passengers and regulators.

Benefits Beyond Carbon Reduction

While emissions reduction is the most widely recognized advantage, SAF offers other benefits too. Using waste and residues as feedstock reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps build a circular economy. SAF production also opens doors for regional job creation, particularly in areas with strong agricultural or bio-based industries.

Additionally, SAF supports airlines in meeting global climate targets, such as the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Challenges on the Horizon

Despite its promise, SAF is not without hurdles. Production costs remain higher than conventional jet fuel, and current supply is limited. Scaling SAF requires significant investment in infrastructure, technology, and policy support. Ensuring that feedstock sourcing is sustainable, without competing with food supply or causing deforestation, is another critical factor.

Yet, the momentum is undeniable. With technological advancements, supportive regulations, and collaborative industry efforts, SAF production is expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades.

Looking Ahead

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are not just an alternative fuel they represent a shift in how the aviation industry approaches its future. By combining innovation with environmental responsibility, SAF provides a bridge between today’s reliance on fossil fuels and tomorrow’s cleaner aviation solutions.

Takeaway Point: Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a game-changer for the aviation industry, offering a realistic and scalable path to reducing carbon emissions while keeping the world connected. Their success depends on collaboration across industry, government, and communities to ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future for flight.

,,2025-12-07 00:44:20+00:00,www.hansardsociety.org.uk,Parliament Matters Bulletin: What's coming up in Parliament this week? 8-12 December 2025,Not Available,,,,,https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/news/parliament-matters-bulletin-8-december-2025,"On unfair dismissal, the Government has tabled a motion stating that the Commons insists on its disagreement with the Lords amendments but proposes six ‘amendments in lieu’ to replace the Lords amendments.
Similarly to the original Lords amendment, the Government’s amendments would reduce the qualifying period for unfair dismissal to six months.
The Government previously sought to remove this Lords amendment, but it has since conceded.
The Commons must decide how to respond to the new Lords amendments.
Immigration Skills Charge (Amendment) Regulations 2025: Peers will be asked to approve these draft Regulations which were debated in Grand Committee on 4 December.","Unless the Government is now willing to accept the Lords’ position, Ministers will need to propose alternative amendments in relation to guaranteed hours and seasonal work to avoid “double insistence”. This arises when one House agrees an amendment, the other rejects it, the first House insists on its original amendment, and the second House insists on its rejection, and neither House proposes an alternative. Conventionally this parliamentary deadlock results in the loss of the Bill.

On unfair dismissal, the Government has tabled a motion stating that the Commons insists on its disagreement with the Lords amendments but proposes six ‘amendments in lieu’ to replace the Lords amendments. Similarly to the original Lords amendment, the Government’s amendments would reduce the qualifying period for unfair dismissal to six months. In contrast, Labour backbenchers opposed to the concession have tabled their own motion: they also ask the House to insist on its disagreement with the Lords amendments, but they propose no amendments in lieu – effectively urging the House to hold its ground without offering a compromise.

In accordance with the programme order agreed by the House on 15 September, the debate will conclude no later than one hour after it begins. Standing Order No 83G stipulates that if a debate on a Lords Message is brought to a conclusion in accordance with a programme order – that is, if the debate lasts the full one hour – then the only motions that can be put to the House are those moved by a Minister. Unless the debate finishes early, those MPs opposed to the Government’s concession on unfair dismissal may therefore not be able to move their own motion.

There is just one outstanding issue to be resolved in relation to the local planning process and it is one that the Hansard Society highlighted as an issue of concern when the Bill was first published earlier this year. Whereas each council can currently determine what kinds of planning decisions are taken by council committees and what kinds are taken by council officers, the Bill would allow the Government to make regulations to provide for a national scheme of delegation that would apply to all councils. The Bill initially provided that these regulations would be subject to the negative scrutiny procedure, under which Ministers could sign the regulations into law prior to laying them before Parliament and would remain in law unless either House actively voted to reject them within 40 days.

The House of Lords amendment proposes instead to apply the affirmative procedure but only to the first set of regulations enacting a national scheme of delegation. This would ensure the regulations must be actively debated and approved by both Houses before they can be signed by the Minister and become law. The Government previously sought to remove this Lords amendment, but it has since conceded. Today’s sitting is necessary for the Commons to formally agree to re-insert the Lords proposal, subject to a minor drafting change.

In accordance with the programme order agreed by the House on 13 November, the debate will conclude no later than one hour after it begins, after which the questions on Lords amendments will be put to the House. However, since the Government has conceded on the amendment and will only put forward a drafting change, no divisions are expected.

Mental Health Bill (Consideration of Lords Message): Again, there is just one outstanding area of disagreement between the two Houses in relation to parental responsibility for children. As outlined in more detail in a previous edition of the Bulletin, the Lords originally made an amendment to the Bill to allow someone other than a person with parental responsibility – such as a guardian or person with a childcare court order – to represent children detained under the 1983 Mental Health Act, which was then removed by the Commons.

At its sitting on 24 November, the Lords proposed some alternative amendments, which would still allow a guardian or person with a childcare court order to be appointed, but would leave the decision to the relevant mental health professional. The Commons must decide how to respond to the new Lords amendments. It can either insist on its position, accept the Lords position, or propose an alternative of its own.

Select Committees motion: The House of Lords typically appoints four ‘special inquiry committees’ each session or calendar year (depending on the sessional timetable) devoted to a single subject. Normally at least one of the four committees is a post-legislative scrutiny committee, to review the operation of an Act of Parliament to assess whether it has achieved the intended policy objective(s), to identify any problems in implementation and to recommend how these might be addressed.

An investigation by the Commissioner for Standards found that Lord Dannatt breached the Code of Conduct by contacting Ministers and officials about three companies in which he held a financial interest, and by suggesting to undercover reporters that he could introduce them to people within Government. The Commissioner recommended a four-month suspension from the House of Lords. Lord Dannatt did not appeal the findings or the recommended sanction.

An investigation by the Commissioner for Standards found that Lord Evans of Watford breached the Code of Conduct by sponsoring events in Parliament for a company owned by his son, in which he held a one-third stake. He was also found to have told undercover journalists that he could introduce them to MPs. The Commissioner recommended a five-month suspension from the House. Lord Evans did not appeal the findings or the recommended sanction.

Sustainable Aviation Bill (Order of Commitment): After the Bill’s Second Reading, the House agreed that the Bill’s Committee Stage would be in Grand Committee – which takes place in a large Committee room known as the Moses Room – rather than a Committee of the Whole House in the Lords Chamber. The Government now intends to move that this order of commitment be set aside, so the Bill can instead begin its Committee Stage in a Committee of the Whole House on Wednesday 10 December. Any additional Committee Stage required after that first day would then take place in Grand Committee.

English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill (Second Reading): Peers will debate the Government’s legislation to reform the structure of local government in England, which has already passed through the House of Commons. The Bill’s central provisions were outlined in an earlier edition of the Bulletin. Significant new amendments that the Government put forward in the Commons were also discussed in an earlier edition. (House of Lords Library briefing)

At Second Reading, Peers will debate the general principles underlying the Bill. No amendments to the text can be made at this stage. The House of Lords rarely votes against Government Bills at Second Reading, and they usually proceed without a division. Once the Bill has received its Second Reading, it will be committed for detailed clause-by-clause scrutiny in Grand Committee.

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Liberal Democrat MP Dr Al Pinkerton will seek to introduce the UK–EU Customs Union (Duty to Negotiate) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would require the Government to enter into negotiations with the EU to agree a customs union. See our Hansard Society guide for more information about the parliamentary procedure for Ten Minute Rule Bills.

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Conservative MP Katie Lam will seek to introduce the Data Publication and Quality (Immigration, Nationality and Country of Birth) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would require the collection of data on the immigration status, nationality and country of birth of users of public services, claimants of certain benefits, the prison population, and arrests, and to require that such data is published at least once a year.

Opposition Day (Conservatives): This is the 14th of 20 Opposition Days scheduled this Session – days when Government business does not have priority and precedence is instead given to motions tabled by opposition parties. As this is a Conservative Opposition Day, the subject will be chosen by the Leader of the Opposition, Kemi Badenoch. However, Opposition Day topics are typically not announced in advance, so the motion may not be known until Wednesday’s Order Paper is published.

Planning and Infrastructure Bill (Consideration of Commons Amendments): Assuming the House of Commons agrees the Government’s drafting amendment relating to a national scheme of planning delegation on Monday, it will then need to be agreed by the House of Lords. This is unlikely to require a division, since it relates to a limited drafting change to a Government concession.

Employment Rights Bill (Consideration of Commons Amendments and Reasons): The Government has tabled a series of alternative amendments on the five issues of disagreement outlined above in relation to Monday’s business. For each issue, Peers will need to decide whether to insist on their earlier position, accept the Commons’ position, or propose an alternative of their own.

General debate on St. Andrew’s Day and Scottish affairs: This debate was proposed by Graeme Downie, the Labour MP for Dunfermline and Dollar. In his application to the Backbench Business Committee, he argued that it would be “an opportunity for all political parties to come together and share the excellent things that Scotland has done in the past and could continue to do in the future.”

Select Committees can ask the Backbench Business Committee for time to make a statement announcing the launch of an inquiry or the publication of a report. These statements are usually delivered in the Chamber during backbench business time on Thursdays. The statement, presented by the relevant Committee chair or another designated member of the Committee, consists of a 10-minute speech during which interventions are not permitted, followed by 10 minutes of questions from MPs, to which the Select Committee member responds.

General debate on the impact of foreign interference on security, trade and democracy: Liberal Democrat MP James MacCleary proposed this debate to discuss the “changing and sophisticated threats from hostile foreign actors” and “the deliberate targeting of democratic institutions, the spread of disinformation to sow division, and cyber-attacks designed to weaken and undermine Governments around the world”. In his application to the Backbench Business Committee, he said the broad-ranging debate would “offer Parliament an opportunity to send a clear and united message to the rest of the world, and to people across this country, that foreign attempts to erode our sovereignty will not be tolerated”. It would also be an opportunity for “a lot of Back Benchers who do not necessarily get a lot of time to speak on foreign affairs, to express individual views”.

Oral questions: At 11:00, Peers will begin the day by questioning Ministers for 40 minutes, on powers and fiscal instruments to business improvement districts to accelerate town-centre renewal and local growth; intelligence sharing with the United States of America; and the role social media platforms play in enabling scam adverts and fraudulent content. The topic of a fourth question will be decided by a ballot drawn at lunchtime on Tuesday 9 December.

Immigration Skills Charge (Amendment) Regulations 2025: Peers will be asked to approve these draft Regulations which were debated in Grand Committee on 4 December. The Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) is a mandatory fee that must be paid when a UK employer sponsors a foreign worker for a visa. These regulations will increase ISC rates by 32%. This step-change is because the rates have not been reviewed since the ISC was introduced in 2017. The regulations have been drawn to the attention of the House by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. It asked the Government why the ISC rates had not been increased since 2018 and what plans were being put in place to ensure that the rates were reviewed and updated more regularly in future. It described the Minister’s response as “unhelpfully vague” and called on the Home Office to “to keep the ISC under regular review so that it retains its real terms value and to avoid large step-changes in the amounts payable in the future”.

Question for Short Debate (QSD): Labour Peer Lord Hunt of Kings Heath will ask about the Government’s plans to publish a strategy for ensuring high-quality and equitable wheelchair and community equipment provision by NHS and social care services. QSDs are drawn from a ballot every five sitting weeks. The first four entries drawn from the ballot are debated in Grand Committee on a Thursday, with the other entries appearing on a supplementary list in the order they were drawn. Questions on the supplementary list can be taken in the Chamber as short debates between items of business, either in the lunch break, dinner break, or as the last business of the day. (House of Lords Library briefing)

10:00: Public Accounts Committee – Whole of Government Accounts 2023-24: James Bowler, the Permanent Secretary at HM Treasury, will give evidence alongside other senior officials from the Treasury and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) are the consolidated accounts of thousands of national, regional and local public organisations. In 2022-23, the National Audit Office (NAO) was unable to sign off the WGA because only 10% of local councils submitted reliable audit data. The NAO report on the WGA for 2023-24 was published in June and the Comptroller and Auditor General was again unable to provide assurance to Parliament about the accounts due to the “severe backlogs in English local authority accounts and audits”.

At the time of writing, 1,110 amendments have been tabled, and Peers may continue tabling amendments right up to the final sitting. As we outlined in our recent blog, this is an unprecedented volume of amendments for any Bill in the past 20 years.

At Committee Stage, amendments can be grouped and debated together to keep the discussion focussed and coherent and to avoid unnecessary repetition. To date, the Government Whips have organised the 1,110 amendments into 84 groups. Across the three sittings so far, the House has debated:

In total, this means the House has debated just six of the 84 groups, covering 80 (7%) of the amendments tabled, leaving over 1,000 amendments still to be considered. Ten additional days have been scheduled in the New Year. It is not yet clear how these days will be allocated between Committee Stage, Report Stage and any subsequent stages. However, even if all ten days were devoted exclusively to Committee Stage, the current pace – advancing by only two or three groups per sitting – would far fall short of what is needed to complete the remaining groups in time.

Lord Falconer has set a target of debating ten groups at each sitting, but each time the House has fallen significantly short. At the end of the last sitting (Friday 5 December), the Government Chief Whip, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, said that three groups was “less than I had hoped for” and urged that “all noble Lords need to reflect on that before we resume our consideration of this Bill next Friday”.",,N,,2025-12-06 21:56:13.930461

$300 million planned investment will double XCF’s total SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually, positioning New Rise Reno as a major U.S. SAF production center.

Global demand accelerates as mandates tighten, creating one of the strongest growth opportunities in renewable fuels – one that XCF’s modular SAF platform is positioned to capture.

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today announced new development milestones at its New Rise Reno 2 site, the Company’s second SAF production facility and the next deployment of its scalable, modular production platform.

XCF has completed initial site work at New Rise Reno 2, including grading of the 10-acre parcel and construction of new access roads. Engineering, design, and project planning are underway, positioning construction to begin in 2026.

Located adjacent to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new site will benefit from integration with common facilities such as gas, water, rail, and personnel offices as well as existing pre-treatment, hydrogen production, and broader logistics infrastructure – reducing capital costs, lowering execution risk, and accelerating time to production.

Since inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF’s flagship New Rise Reno facility. New Rise Reno 2 represents the next phase of this growth strategy, with an expected $300 million investment enabling XCF to double SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, commented:

“New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy. By adding a second, fully integrated facility, we’re turning New Rise Reno intoa major U.S. SAF production center and positioning XCF for sustained, long-term growth. This expansion exemplifies how XCF grows: intentionally, efficiently, and with a platform built to meet surging global demand.”

Expanding Global Reach

The development of New Rise Reno 2 strengthens XCF’s ability to meet rising SAF demand across the world’s most important aviation markets. In November, XCF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with BGN INT US LLC (“BGN”), a global energy and commodities group, to jointly develop global distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic markets.

The partnership would connect XCF’s expanding production capacity with BGN’s global logistics and trading network, creating an integrated supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

This strategic alignment comes as demand accelerates across major aviation markets.

U.S. SAF Grand Challenge: Federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050; however, current U.S. production remains below 1% of jet fuel demand.

ReFuelEU Aviation Mandates: Airlines will be required to blend 2% SAF in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, and 20% by 2035, ultimately rising to 70% by 2050. With regional supply unable to meet these mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face structural shortages and persistently elevated SAF pricing.

Together, the U.S. and Europe represent one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in the clean-energy transition, with the U.S. SAF market projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030 and global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF’s scalable, modular SAF platform is built to scale directly into this opportunity.

XCF will continue to provide updates as development progresses.

Boeing is playing its part in this, with the US manufacturer recently filing a patent for an emissions reduction system. While it may not be as attention-grabbing as electric or hydrogen aircraft, this could have a real impact on commercial aviation.

Boeing's emissions reduction system combines software, data analysis, and sustainability planning to help airlines, regulators, and stakeholders understand and manage emissions. It shows that reducing carbon is not just about new fuel types or aircraft designs; it is also about tracking and planning smarter. In this article, we will take a closer look at the patent filed by Boeing and the impact it may have on the commercial aviation industry going forward.

The Patent Filed By Boeing

In 2023, Boeing was granted a patent for a “System and Method for Dynamic Display of Aircraft Emissions Data,” which, put simply, is a software tool that collects emissions data from flights and presents it in a clear, interactive display. Airlines can use the system to test different strategies, such as increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or upgrading older aircraft to newer models like the Boeing 737 MAX, 777X, or Airbus A350.

For example, an airline could use the system to see how emissions would change if 50% of its short-haul flights currently operated by Boeing 737‑800s switched to 737 MAXs, which are roughly 14% more fuel-efficient. For long-haul operations, an airline could evaluate how replacing older Boeing 777‑200ERs with 777X aircraft or optimizing 787‑9 flight paths would affect emissions. The system allows users to adjust these variables dynamically, providing a realistic view of potential outcomes, while also enabling scenario comparisons, like combining SAF use with fleet upgrades, giving airlines a comprehensive view of how multiple strategies interact.

This tool could become particularly valuable for carriers with mixed fleets. For instance, American Airlines operates a large number of both Boeing 737‑800s and 737 MAXs for domestic routes, alongside 787‑8s and 787‑9s for long-haul operations. Using the tool, the oneworld carrier can see how incremental fleet upgrades or SAF adoption on certain routes impact overall emissions. The latest data from ch-aviation shows that American Airlines currently operates a total of 1,005 aircraft, with a further 298 on order, as outlined in the table below:

Similarly, Delta Air Lines could model the benefits of efficiency improvements on its Boeing 777‑200ERs or Airbus A330-300s, helping the carrier make informed decisions about where to invest in fleet modernization, SAF production, or operational adjustments. Compared to American Airlines, Delta Air Lines operates a slightly smaller fleet, made up of 986 aircraft, with 261 on order:

Simple Flying has reached out to Boeing for comment on the patent for its emissions reduction system.

Aligning With Boeing's Broader Sustainability Goals

The patent for Boeing's emissions reduction system is part of the manufacturer's broader push to reduce emissions across its operations. Boeing has also launched the Cascade Climate Impact Model - a platform designed to help airlines, policymakers, and manufacturers explore different ways to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 by looking at emissions from fuel production, aircraft operations, and even recycling and end-of-life disposal, allowing a full lifecycle view of the environmental impact.

The new emissions reduction system can be seen as a hands-on, practical version of the Cascade Climate Impact Model, as airlines can use it to model realistic outcomes rather than relying on theoretical projections, turning abstract climate goals into measurable, actionable decisions, and helping airlines set realistic targets and track progress.

Boeing’s approach reflects the complexity of sustainability in aviation. Reducing emissions is not just about adopting a single solution; it involves multiple elements, from fuel and fleet management to operations and even route planning. By providing a tool that can integrate these factors, Boeing enables airlines to see how incremental changes can add up to meaningful reductions, even before radical technologies like electric or hydrogen planes become commercially viable.

Increased Transparency & Accountability

Major airlines operate thousands of flights every day, often with different aircraft types and fuel mixes. Tracking emissions across all these variables is complex, and so decisions about fleet upgrades, SAF adoption, or operational improvements are often made with incomplete information. Boeing’s emissions reduction system addresses this challenge by allowing airlines to model different strategies and see their projected impact, and by providing a clear visual representation of outcomes, the system helps airlines make informed, data-driven decisions.

Transparency is another key benefit of Boeing's emissions reduction system. Regulators, investors, and the public increasingly expect airlines to report their emissions accurately and demonstrate progress toward sustainability goals. Having a standardized tool to model and display emissions can help carriers to provide credible data, and it also encourages accountability, with airlines able to test strategies, measure their effectiveness, and adjust plans if they are not achieving the desired reductions.

The Limits Of Boeing's Patent

It is important to note that Boeing's emissions reduction system is a tool, not a solution on its own, and it does not reduce emissions directly. Real reductions depend on airlines taking action, such as replacing older Boeing 737‑700 or 737‑800 aircraft with 737 MAX models, upgrading long-haul fleets with 787‑10s or 777Xs, investing in SAF, or improving operational efficiency. The upcoming Boeing 777X is currently undergoing testing before its planned entry into commercial service in 2027.

The emissions reduction system’s accuracy relies on correct data and realistic assumptions, and overestimating fuel availability, fleet renewal rates, or efficiency gains could lead to misleading projections. The tool also focuses primarily on carbon dioxide emissions and does not address other environmental concerns, such as nitrogen oxide emissions, contrails, or noise pollution. Additionally, adoption is not guaranteed, and airlines must integrate it into planning processes, train staff to use it effectively, and ensure it complements any other sustainability strategies. Nevertheless, Boeing's emissions reduction system represents a significant step forward and a practical, actionable step that complements other initiatives.

What Could This Mean For The Commercial Aviation Industry?

If widely adopted, Boeing’s emissions reduction system could become an industry standard for planning and tracking emissions, and airlines could use it to decide which aircraft to retire, how much SAF to buy, or which operational improvements to implement. For example, American Airlines is already investing in SAF and modernizing its fleet with 737 MAXs and 787‑9s. Delta Air Lines is focusing on fleet efficiency with its Airbus A330-900 and A350-900 aircraft, while United Airlines is replacing its older aircraft and increasing SAF use to meet its net-zero targets. With this tool, airlines can model these strategies and see their combined effect on emissions, rather than relying on rough estimates.

The system could also influence future aircraft design and operations. By quantifying the emissions impact of fleet renewal and next-generation aircraft, airlines can make stronger business cases for cleaner, more efficient aircraft. Over time, tools like this can help the industry grow without proportionally increasing carbon emissions, making it easier to meet climate goals while maintaining air travel demand.

In practical terms, this means that even small decisions, such as which Boeing 737s to deploy on short routes or how to optimize long-haul flights, can be evaluated and optimized. Over years of operations, these incremental changes add up, potentially saving millions of gallons of fuel and millions of lbs of carbon dioxide, while keeping airlines competitive and compliant with increasingly strict environmental regulations.

A Significant Development For The Future Of Aviation

Some critics say that aviation focuses too much on futuristic solutions like hydrogen or electric aircraft while ignoring practical steps that matter today. Boeing’s patent proves that both approaches are needed, and the emissions reduction system will help airlines across the world to manage current emissions and plan realistic ways to reduce them, while still investing in new technologies for the future.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/emissions.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-06 17:56:09.324319

Transportation is a key sector that contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel used is a key determinant. This explains why electric cars are expanding. Air transport has come under considerable pressure to increase the use of SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel. So is marine transport, where new maritime rulings insist on greater use of renewable and low-emission fuel. The other solution is the deployment of mass transport. To move people and goods, the train has come out on top as the most efficient mass transport instrument. Global investments on rail networks are seen rising worldwide for that reason. As Malaysia steams ahead with the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), there’s no shortage of opinions about whether it’s a wise national investment or a costly gamble. Like many ambitious infrastructure projects, the ECRL sits at the crossroads of hope and caution, promise and peril. The stakes are high not only in ringgit terms but in what it means for Malaysia’s future economic geography, regional equity, and geopolitical positioning.

At its heart, the ECRL is about connectivity. For decades, development in Malaysia has been disproportionately clustered along the west coast, from Penang to Johor. The east coast, rich in culture, natural resources, and tourism potential, has struggled to keep pace. The ECRL promises to narrow this divide, stitching together Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu, and Kota Bharu with the economic heartbeat of the Klang Valley. On paper, the benefits are compelling; faster travel times, enhanced trade routes, better labor mobility, and the rise of new growth nodes along the corridor. The Kuantan Port, for instance, could emerge as a strategic logistics hub linking the South China Sea to Peninsular Malaysia’s hinterland. Tourism circuits, long hampered by poor accessibility, might finally come into their own. Kelantan which has been wallowing at the bottom of the country’s economic ladder may suddenly wake up from its slumber.

Yet, infrastructure alone does not guarantee prosperity. History is littered with examples of underutilised mega-projects that failed to deliver promised economic returns because complementary policies, industries, and ecosystems were missing. The question Malaysia must grapple with is whether the ECRL will be just a railway or the backbone of a broader, integrated development strategy. There are financial realities to confront, too. Even after renegotiations, the ECRL remains one of Malaysia’s most expensive infrastructure projects. Its success depends on achieving cargo and passenger volumes that may prove optimistic in the short to medium term, especially if road transport remains dominant and east coast population densities remain modest. Without careful demand management and aggressive industrial development along its route, the line risks becoming an underutilized asset.

Then there’s the geopolitical dimension. As part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ECRL embeds Malaysia deeper into regional supply chains, an opportunity, but also a strategic risk. Dependence on external financing, construction expertise, and operational know-how must be balanced with local capacity building, technology transfer, and safeguards for national interests. Ultimately, the ECRL will be judged not by its length or cost, but by its legacy. Will it reduce regional inequality, catalyze new industries, and create sustainable livelihoods? Or will it become another symbol of misplaced priorities and economic overreach? The project’s wisdom lies not merely in laying down steel tracks but in what Malaysia chooses to build around them. Ports, industrial zones, tourism clusters, and vocational training centers must all align with this infrastructure to create a viable economic ecosystem. Only then will the ECRL transform from a bold bet into a wise investment.

As the trains begin to roll in the coming years, so too must our determination to ensure that this project delivers more than promises, but real, lasting progress for all Malaysians. The ECRL connects underdeveloped states (Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang) to the Klang Valley, reducing regional inequality. Faster cargo transport could cut shipping times between Port Klang and Kuantan Port, enhancing Malaysia’s trade competitiveness. It strengthens ties with China, Malaysia’s largest trading partner, potentially attracting more BRI-linked investments. Aligns with ASEAN’s Master Plan on Connectivity, positioning Malaysia as a regional logistics hub. There are long-term infrastructure gains. Shifting freight from road to rail would reduce highway congestion and carbon emissions. Must not forget the tourism potential with improved access to east coast tour destinations.

“Dubai Airshow remains a leading platform for aerospace innovation. This year, we signed key agreements, welcomed new customers, and expanded partnerships with Strata and Mubadala. Demand from airlines such as flydubai, Buraq Air, and Etihad reflects the Middle East’s rising role in the global aerospace supply chain.”

20 November — EDGE Group’s defence and aerospace ehowcase

EDGE Group unveiled 42 new products and solutions, including the OMEN VTOL, an autonomous air system co-developed with U.S. innovator Anduril, signalling the UAE’s ambition to build sovereign aerospace capability.

Hamad Al Marar, MD and CEO of EDGE, stated:

“This year’s Airshow demonstrated how EDGE is pushing boundaries across air and space, launching 42 new products including the OMEN VTOL developed with Anduril.”

EDGE also announced partnerships with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), L3Harris Technologies, Republikorp Indonesia (USD 7 billion), Spain’s Indra, and ongoing joint ventures with Leonardo. The UAE’s Tawazun Council disclosed 20 major defence contracts valued at AED 18.016 billion, supporting technology transfer, localisation, and industrial development.

21 November — Innovation and industry consolidation

The closing day emphasised cultural and technological engagement. The “Airshow After Dark” drone display showcased future mobility concepts, including hydrogen aircraft, rockets, and space vehicles, reflecting Dubai’s experiential approach to industry interaction.

Technology, sustainability, and space

Airbus strengthened research partnerships with the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) and Aspire, while renewing collaborations with Strata and Mubadala, reinforcing the UAE’s role in global aerospace supply chains.

Sustainability featured prominently, with exhibition halls powered entirely by renewable energy. Participating aircraft utilised sustainable aviation fuel, and Jetex deployed electrically and propane-powered ground support equipment, highlighting the sector’s shift towards lower-emission operations.

The largest Space Pavilion in Airshow history, organised with the UAE Space Agency, convened over 50 experts and astronauts to discuss commercialisation, regulatory frameworks, and space-economy infrastructure, underscoring Dubai’s growing influence in space technology.

Air cargo: Strategic focus

While passenger aircraft dominated headlines, the cargo sector also drew attention through freighter conversions, digital tracking systems, and autonomous logistics solutions. Etihad’s A350F order and investments in A330-900 capacity reflect fleet modernisation aimed at enhancing belly-hold and dedicated freighter operations.

Middle Eastern carriers, already commanding a significant share of global cargo, are strengthening aircraft and digital capabilities to maintain competitiveness amid structurally higher post-pandemic volumes.

Conclusion: A defining edition for global aerospace

With historic aircraft orders, expanded defence capabilities, technology partnerships, and sustainability initiatives, Dubai Airshow 2025 reinforced its role as a bellwether for global aviation.

The event demonstrated that the Middle East, supported by ambitious national strategies and substantial investment, is reshaping fleet priorities and accelerating next-generation aerospace development. As the industry prepares for its next cycle of innovation, the 2025 Airshow will be remembered as a pivotal moment in commercial aviation, defence aerospace, and space technology.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/R6026497-1-1080x659.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:57:37.002846

Segundo a presidente da Petrobras, Magda Chambriard, o combustível produzido por coprocessamento nas refinarias da companhia é competitivo, atende a padrões internacionais e permitirá ao mercado brasileiro antecipar o cumprimento do CORSIA, programa global da ICAO (Organização da Aviação Civil Internacional, em português) para reduzir emissões em voos internacionais.

A Petrobras afirma que o avanço consolida o Brasil como ator relevante no mercado de combustíveis sustentáveis e reforça a intenção da companhia de liderar a transição energética no país.

As primeiras unidades foram produzidas na Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), autorizada pela ANP (agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis) a incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável. Outras refinarias avançam na preparação para ampliar a oferta: a Revap (SP) já realizou testes, enquanto a Replan (SP) e a Regap (MG) devem iniciar produção e comercialização até 2026.

Europe has seen a litany of nations turning to the sector in order to meet clean energy and emission reduction mandates implemented by the EU Commission. Finland is the latest European nation to turn to the often-overlooked clean energy-generating potential of hydrogen, with Hy2Gen selecting Oulu as the site for a 200 MW hydrogen-based e-fuel production facility.

Hy2Gen has acquired the land needed for a new hydrogen-based e-fuel facility

The European sentiment towards the hydrogen sector has reached a new tipping point recently, as Finland has been selected as the preferred site for a new 200 MW hydrogen-based e-fuel production facility being developed by none other than Hy2Gen. The firm has secured the required rights to purchase land in Oulu for the new facility, but has not revealed the costs it incurred.

The Germany-based energy firm has stated that a more detailed plan will be presented at an event on 12 February 2026, so until then, speculation over the volumes of green hydrogen produced can become a regular occurrence. Notably, the project comes as the European continent is spurring investment in the hydrogen sector following recent commitments to clean energy that were reaffirmed at the G20 Summit in South Africa.

Hydrogen-based energy production has grown beyond previous expectations in recent years

Developing new and pioneering forms of hydrogen-based energy has become the latest trend to sweep across the international energy market, blasting past previous expectations for the sector. Finland is not known for its energy production, and has been embroiled in the danger of Russia entering its borders due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Hy2Gen is positioning Finland to become a regional leader in the e-fuel sector

The firm has noted that the development plans for its 200 MW hydrogen-based e-fuel production facility in Oulu could potentially transform the nation into a regional hub for clean energy production. The plan will enable Oulu to become the largest hub for e-fuel production in the Baltic Sea region based on the number of power-to-X projects being developed by a litany of energy companies in the area.

For instance, Verso Energy’s €1.4bn sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility has been receiving remarkable praise from energy experts as it aims to develop hydrogen-based synthetic fuels. Several European nations are turning to the hydrogen sector to develop alternative power generation sources in the near future, such as the Netherlands’ deal with Plug Power.

Janne Hietaniemi, Key Account Director of BusinessOulu, has noted the substantial benefits of the project being planned, such as strong R&D expertise at the University of Oulu, the overwhelming potential that the region has to support hydrogen-based fuel production, and strategic connectivity through the EU’s TEN-T transport network.

“Furthermore, Gasgrid Finland is planning to establish a hydrogen transport infrastructure to link Oulu’s production capacity with other regions in Finland and across Europe.” – Janne Hietaniemi, Key Account Director of BusinessOulu

Europe’s proclivity for the renewable energy market is set to propel hydrogen production to new heights

Regardless of the sentiment shared by several nations over the potential fallout of the inevitable phasing out of coal and oil production. A litany of European nations is turning to the hydrogen sector to develop new plans for a brand new era of clean energy production. Germany has opened what will be its largest commercial green hydrogen facility in Baden-Württemberg, exemplifying the nation’s plans to increase green hydrogen production across its energy network over the coming years.

They eliminated water from coach over the summer but were forced to bring it back. Last year they served breakfasts in the afternoon in business class because it’s cheaper than other meals. They’re devaluing their miles again.

The airline is now surveying customers to learn what passengers are willing to do to save the carrier money next:

“Opting out of receiving an in-flight meal ahead of flying” British Airways partner Japan Airlines has called skipping meals the ‘ethical choice’ for the environment, suggesting it’s unethical to eat on board. JAL, though, offered customers a reward of an amenity kit for opting out of the meal, so they probably aren’t even reducing waste.

Delta – which owns an oil refinery – suggested that customers opt out of meals for the environment as well.

United offers the meal opt-out and offers it as two different choices in their pre-order meal selection flow.

“Travelling with fewer items of luggage” Less weight saves fuel, and potentially they could save on baggage handlers and equipment as well.

“Bringing a reusable water bottle or travel mug to refill at the airport or onboard my flight” They’re back with another run at cutting down on the expense of bottled water in the cabin.

“Opting out of receiving sleepwear ahead of flying” on routes that feature pajamas BA might save a few pair for future flights.

“Packing less than the maximum luggage allowance weight” Another way of asking the baggage question to save fuel.

“Opting out of receiving amenity kits ahead of flying” just like pajamas.

“Selecting my meal preference ahead of flying” British Airways actually offered this option prior to the pandemic, but it never returned. Today they only offer pre-order of special (e.g. religious, diabetic, etc.) meals.

Here’s the actual survey question:

This selection does not appear to include anything that British Airways would add for customers, and or seem to suggest British Airways would offer customers anything in exchange (although it might be smart for them to do so). It’s likely instead that the narrative would be passengers are benefiting the environment by reducing food waste and disposal of single use items.

It reflects a mindset reminiscent of the 2017 move under CEO Alex Cruz to only offer cold airplane tank water for free on intra-Europe flights – even hot water for customers to make their own tea was charged. In 2018 they began testing offering water as a free perk to elite frequent flyers.

If you don’t like it when cuts are implemented? Flight attendants have been instructed not to apologize.

Another historic British Airways slogan was “To fly, to serve.” They’re reinventing it, it seems, as “To fly, to serve as little as possible.”

PCI’s total energy trade volume reached 530 million metric tons in 2024, covering crude oil, refined fuels, natural gas, chemicals and green commodities.
“The publication of our first ESG report reflects our understanding of global trends, our long-term strategy for sustainable growth and our response to economic and social expectations,” Luo said.
Wen Yamei, a senior CNPC expert, said PCI’s ESG practices combine the responsibilities of a state-owned enterprise with the demands of global energy trading.
She said the report serves as a practical model for multinational energy companies pursuing similar sustainability pathways.","PetroChina International Co. Ltd. (PCI), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), released its first Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report on December 4 in Beijing, marking a major step in the company’s path toward becoming a world-class energy trader by 2025, reports China.org.cn.

The report outlines PCI’s sustainability principles, actions and performance. Executive Director Wu Junli said the company is building a “diversified and synergistic energy trade ecosystem” to navigate an increasingly complex global energy environment shaped by geopolitical tensions, supply-security challenges and the accelerating shift toward low-carbon energy.

PCI’s total energy trade volume reached 530 million metric tons in 2024, covering crude oil, refined fuels, natural gas, chemicals and green commodities. The company expects this figure to rise above 540 million metric tons in 2025, keeping it among the world’s leading energy traders. It has also expanded its role in major benchmark markets, becoming a key Brent market participant, an active trader in the Platts window and a fast-growing player in global gas and power trading.

Wu said the company is strengthening its low-carbon services, with annual carbon-trading volume exceeding 16 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent and electricity-trading volume surpassing 18 million MWh. PCI has advanced low-carbon projects in Australia, Central Asia and other regions, and completed the world’s first physical sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) transaction through the Argus platform.

“These milestones show our accelerating shift toward green and low-carbon development as we work to build a sustainable future energy system,” he said.

The report said PCI has reinforced its ESG-driven risk-governance framework by integrating compliance, internal controls and auditing. In 2024, it achieved full due-diligence coverage across counterparties, banks, insurers and shipping partners, along with 100% compliance-training coverage for employees.

On human-capital development, PCI expanded its global job-grading system, mobility pathways and employee well-being programmes. In 2024, 84% of staff in international operations were local hires, with a growing share of foreign executives. The company also broadened community programmes and support for vulnerable groups, aligning business development with environmental and social goals.

At the release ceremony, PCI general manager Luo Yizhou called the report’s publication a “milestone moment” in strengthening the company’s competitiveness. He said that as China advances high-quality development driven by ecological protection and low-carbon growth, companies are expected not only to create economic value but also to contribute to environmental protection, social progress and improved governance.

“The publication of our first ESG report reflects our understanding of global trends, our long-term strategy for sustainable growth and our response to economic and social expectations,” Luo said. He added that PCI will continue embedding sustainability across its operations while working with partners to build a more stable and inclusive community of shared future.

Lu Ruquan, president of the CNPC Economics & Technology Research Institute, which helped compile the report, said global ESG frameworks are entering a period of restructuring as countries balance climate targets, energy security and competitiveness. Energy-trading companies, he said, are now “critical hubs for green transition, energy security, market resilience and technological innovation.”

Highlighting green shipping, Lu noted PCI’s involvement in building six large LNG carriers with advanced technologies. These vessels offer lower energy consumption, high operational reliability and strong fire-safety performance, meeting top international standards. “This investment shows PCI’s commitment to low-carbon operations and strengthens industry momentum toward a greener future,” he said.

Wen Yamei, a senior CNPC expert, said PCI’s ESG practices combine the responsibilities of a state-owned enterprise with the demands of global energy trading. She said the report serves as a practical model for multinational energy companies pursuing similar sustainability pathways.

“Its significance extends beyond PCI’s own disclosures,” Wen said. “It provides a reference for companies advancing comparable sustainability strategies.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:07.883353

The deal follows a series of strategic meetings and collaborations held during ADIPEC 2025, reports Zawya.

The partnership highlights the growing momentum from ADIPEC 2025 and marks another step in MENA Biofuels’ plan to build a fully integrated SAF value chain — covering feedstock sourcing, production, testing, certification and offtake.

The new laboratory will be located in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone and operate under internationally recognised standards. It will provide independent verification and certification to ensure that SAF produced in the UAE meets global aviation-fuel requirements for both domestic use and export.

Mohamed Saeed Al Raqbani, chairman of MENA Biofuels, said the partnership strengthens the company’s commitment to creating a transparent and globally trusted SAF ecosystem. “Establishing this laboratory in Fujairah ensures that every litre of SAF produced in the UAE is tested, verified and certified to the highest international standards,” he said.

Gati Al Jebouri, CEO of MENA Biofuels, called the collaboration a clear sign of progress since ADIPEC 2025, bringing together technology, expertise and shared purpose to help the UAE’s SAF meet global quality and sustainability benchmarks.

Saybolt president Peter Boks said the partnership marks an important step toward establishing a strong analytical framework for SAF in the region. He said the Fujairah lab will feature advanced instruments and internationally recognised procedures to precisely assess SAF properties, trace feedstock origins and verify lifecycle emissions.

By providing independent certification and quality assurance, Saybolt aims to support regulatory compliance, promote global trade and strengthen the UAE’s SAF value chain, he added.

The agreement follows other major partnerships revealed by MENA Biofuels during ADIPEC 2025 and the Dubai Airshow, including offtake MoUs with Emarat, ENOC, ADNOC and Evertree. Together, these initiatives form a comprehensive framework covering feedstock, production, certification and distribution, further solidifying the UAE’s leadership in sustainable fuel innovation and aviation decarbonisation.

The new laboratory also supports MENA Biofuels’ mission to launch the UAE’s first commercial SAF production facility in Fujairah, positioning the emirate as a regional centre for clean-fuel innovation, certification excellence and export-grade quality assurance.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:16.053615

Now, I don’t have an inside track to what really conspired at IndiGo leading up to this moment.
Things happen, but at this scale, it has been a long, long while.
It’s like they like to take credit for things done right, but when something goes wrong, it is “Team IndiGo”.
And I’m sure there are a ton of things I’ve missed, but one thing is clear.","When an airline that controls 2/3 of India’s aviation capacity falters, things go massively wrong. All this week, we have seen the viral images of a system that broke down and was not fixed until it was too late. Eventually, aviation is a complex chain of events, and these things happen. Eventually, aviation ticks on 100s of systems working together. Sometimes a passenger service system goes down when the cloud goes down. Sometimes, the luggage belt gives up. Sometimes, there is a Cyber Attack. Sometimes there is a grounding. Sometimes there is a software issue.

When IndiGo left the people to fight for themselves

I’m sure we’ve all seen images all week of bags, people, and circumstances that were not arriving at their destinations because IndiGo did not deliver on its “on time promise”. It is usually a slick operation, and I’ve had deep respect for that ship. But sometimes there is plain stupidity, and that is what we’ve witnessed all week. Or it was an act of connivance, as many conspiracy theorists are saying. What we know is that IndiGo did not have adequate pilots to operate its flights under the new FDTL, and they managed to turn a ton of plans to dust. Weddings, Funerals, Honeymoons, Exams. Without Exception. And it left nonchalance in its wake.

What I’ve been telling people all week long has been, “They could be Stupid, but they couldn’t be Wicked”. Now, I don’t have an inside track to what really conspired at IndiGo leading up to this moment. I wouldn’t know. I will leave it to the government committee that is investigating this to pronounce upon. But I did see how heartless they were. And it was an act equivalent to that of a headless chicken crossing the road.

The usually cheeky airline just shut down and refused to communicate, even with their own people. As a consequence, those on the frontline did not have information to offer customers. And it leads to scenes like these across the airports.

There was a total social media blackout, with the airline not announcing an issue until December 4, 2025, for the first time. Till then, they were quiet and celebrating something on their X Feed.

And this is their website this morning—no mention of any issues on hand, just the usual cheer.

The airline was not communicating AT ALL. This is not how you handle a crisis, by living in Denial for three days.

What the airline could have done, but did not.

The most ridiculous thing IndiGo did was not to handle the whole mess professionally. For instance, for the first three days (December 2-3-4), there was no resolution in sight. IndiGo knew there was a problem, but insisted that people stay inside the airport through repeated postponements, rather than offer a cancellation and send people home. It was in a state of readiness to depart (subject to getting a pilot) rather than in a state of “we cannot handle this, let’s at least release the passengers who are our prisoners right now”. There is a concept in the aviation industry of distress fares. But it costs money when one airline has to endorse its customers to another airline, especially on IndiGo’s scale. Also, IndiGo cannot access those fares because it does not have any arrangement with other airlines, such as Akasa, Air India, or SpiceJet, to have their passengers fly out on another carrier. Those serpentine queues could have been a little smaller, and the noise at the airport would have been less. But oh, the Hubris.

Second, IndiGo could have cancelled flights more proactively, which would have helped them recover faster. Yes, they’d still be unpopular, but the recovery would have been faster. As someone outside the system, I find it so predictable to reset, but IndiGo took until day 4 to reach this conclusion and had to cancel 1000s of flights to get things back on track. Common sense is uncommon these days.

Third, it takes time to organise hotel rooms in an international territory without ground handling. That is what happens with Air India when a plane lands in a Russian Village or in Myanmar. It shouldn’t happen in India, to India’s largest airline, which clearly did not have a contingency plan to round up as many hotel rooms as possible.

Even providing meals or lounge access was a problem for IndiGo because there was either no authorisation to spend money to cover all the food available at the airport, or no intent. Hey, this is a part of the DGCA and the Ministry mandate to provide basics.

IndiGo, it was just being miserly

All of the above problems boil down to two issues. No empowerment of the people down the chain to endorse people to other airlines, no power to book hotels or provide refunds and so on. In my years working in the corporate arena, the one thing I’ve always been taught to think of is Reputation Risk. Here, IndiGo was okay with letting go of its 19 years of Brand Equity to save some bucks.

I’ve always believed in the mantra of “Do Unto Others as you’d want to be done to you.” This week was the antithesis of that adage. The last time I’ve seen this chaos play out was on Air Deccan in the early 2000s, with Indian Airlines in a December Fog cancellation in the 2000s, and then SpiceJet in 2013. Things happen, but at this scale, it has been a long, long while.

The Standard of Care that was never offered.

The airline should have had a simple playbook. Cancel now, grant a refund now, and handle the consequences later. It took IndiGo 4 days to conclude. Only on November 5, after my tweet (which I am sure some competent person at IndiGo had also thought about, not just me), did IndiGo put out a policy of offering full refunds for flights through December 15. What’s mortifying is that these full refunds are only in effect between December 5 and 15, 2025. What about the days of incompetence before? December 1 – 4, 2025, wasn’t a cake walk either, IndiGo.

And even when it came, IndiGo’s language was lame, and it was a non-apology. It was as if they went, Let’s get this out of the way.

Notice that IndiGo is not putting the name of anyone senior on this non-apology. It’s like they like to take credit for things done right, but when something goes wrong, it is “Team IndiGo”. Rahul Bhatia is a rare occurrence, but they could have at least put out the CXOs on the ground to pacify passengers? Even when the DGCA or the MoCA called them in for a dressing-down on December 4, none of them went over.

Please keep in mind that IndiGo promises to refund to your account, but they are unable to process it online, so people are not receiving their full refund right now.

Since Indians love to compare ourselves with the Americans a lot, a carrier had a meltdown earlier this year, I cannot remember the name for the life of me. At the time, rooms were provided, or people were told to get their own rooms and meals, and they’d be refunded. And of course, anything they paid for due to the distress caused by the airline was refunded. From a toothbrush to a shirt to god knows what not. And other things were done for them. Out here, there is no compassion, no duty of care. Not even compliance with the DGCA’s Passenger Charter. It is just apparent defiance.

And I’m sure there are a ton of things I’ve missed, but one thing is clear. The lakhs of IndiGo customers found their trust broken this week; they are all pissed, and they will obviously keep this experience in mind the next time they book flights.

Bottomline

IndiGo let the nation down and made ambassadors miss out on travel, people miss out on meetings, weddings, funerals, exams, and all sorts of situations you can imagine. And they did not bother to treat them with respect either. They just stretched it far enough to make it a progressively worse situation, and did not offer any help to the customers stuck there due to IndiGo. All, because there was no empowerment on the ground and no empathy at the top, but rather the purse strings were kept tight. Or perhaps it was all unintentional, and they did not use common sense. We’ll never know. And since we will never learn from our mistakes, we will see this happen again.

Above him, the roar of a jet engine tore through the tropical air as a Fiji Airways plane descended toward Nadi.
Yet without these planes, Fiji's modern economy would collapse.
A carbon warrior comes to the South Pacific Scurrah is not a recent convert to the cause of environmentalism.
Before Fiji, he ran Pacific National, Australia’s largest private rail freight operator, and served as CEO of Virgin Australia.","On the talcum-fine sands of Fiji's Wailoaloa Beach, Paul Scurrah stood knee-deep in the reality of his job last week. The newly appointed CEO of Fiji Airways was planting a mangrove seedling in the wet earth. Above him, the roar of a jet engine tore through the tropical air as a Fiji Airways plane descended toward Nadi.

""You could see the intersection between what we do for Fiji in terms of connecting the world, and what we have to do for the environment,"" Scurrah says. ""It was quite a powerful image.""

Powerful, but also controversial. The airline chief was planting a tree to protect the coastline from the climate change his industry creates.

For Scurrah, that morning on the beach represented a show-and-tell of the airline's survival strategy as it tries to connect Fiji's 333 islands—where global warming, as he puts it, is ""very obvious and in your face.""

Fiji's island paradox

Scurrah, who is also the airline's managing director, oversees a flag carrier trapped in a dilemma. Aviation is a worrisome source of carbon emissions. Yet without these planes, Fiji's modern economy would collapse.

Tourism accounts for about 40 percent of the nation's GDP. The jets bring the visitors who sustain the archipelago, but their emissions also threaten the coral reefs and coastlines the tourists come to see.

""We would not be able to do what we do without aviation,"" says Scurrah. ""But we emit carbon, and that's contributing to the problem. We are not on our own.""

To navigate this, Scurrah relies on a concept called Maroroya, a Fijian philosophy meaning ""to care, protect, and preserve."" It drives a triple bottom line strategy: balancing financial outcomes, social obligation, and environmental responsibility.

But to understand how a CEO sits in a tropical office talking about saving reefs while burning jet fuel, you have to take a look at his résumé.

A carbon warrior comes to the South Pacific

Scurrah is not a recent convert to the cause of environmentalism. He's a veteran of the carbon wars. Before Fiji, he ran Pacific National, Australia’s largest private rail freight operator, and served as CEO of Virgin Australia.

His career has been defined by machines built to last—locomotives or jetliners that you can’t just swap for a Prius. Economists call them long-dated assets; you need to get a return on investment over 25 years.

Scurrah has the battle scars to prove it. He recalls a conference during his tenure at Virgin Australia, back when the ""plane shaming"" movement—led by environmentalists like Greta Thunberg—was reaching a fever pitch. The industry was in the crosshairs, accused of destroying the planet for the sake of a vacation.

Scurrah, never one to shy away from a fight, took the stage and went off-script, pointing out that commercial aviation accounts for roughly 2 percent of global emissions, while the beef industry churns out 14 percent.

""I don't see people burger-shaming McDonald's,"" he joked with the crowd.

The headline that day was, ""People should be burger-shaming McDonald's."" It was a deflection, perhaps, but it revealed Scurrah’s worldview: He refuses to be the scapegoat for our carbon addiction. His point was statistical, but the backlash was visceral.

""I got all this hate mail from hamburger lovers,"" he laughs.

Now, in Fiji, that defiance has matured into a complex pragmatism. He is no longer just defending an industry, but a nation’s economic lifeline.

He says it's important to ground the lofty talk of sustainability in the hard earth of the bottom line.

""We can't be sustainable unless we're profitable,"" he says.

Flying new planes on smarter routes

The airline’s first line of defense is its planes. By aggressively swapping out older 747s and 737s for modern Airbus A350s and Boeing 737 MAXs, Fiji Airways has cut fuel burn by 25 percent compared to previous models, according to Scurrah.

""That's a pretty big leap,"" he says.

But hardware is only half the battle. The rest lies in human behavior and data. Inside the cockpit, pilots use SkyBreathe Analytics software that helps pilots make real-time decisions to adjust routes and flight profiles to burn less fuel. From 2019 to 2023, this data-driven flying has prevented an estimated 20 million tons of carbon from being released into the atmosphere.

Sugar cane and drone taxis

Scurrah knows the industry's holy grail is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The airline proved its readiness by flying a recent Airbus A350 delivery leg from Singapore using a 40 percent SAF blend. The problem, Scurrah admits, is the real difficulty of supply and the prohibitive cost.

""We don't need to invent everything here,"" he said, noting that Fiji will lean on its Oneworld Alliance partners for global innovation. However, the airline is looking inward as well, investigating the feasibility of producing fuel locally using biomass from Fiji’s domestic sugar cane industry.

Perhaps most futuristically, the airline has invested in electric vertical takeoff and landing technology. Scurrah envisions battery-operated drone-type taxis whisking passengers from the main airport to remote islands with zero emissions—a sci-fi solution to the ""last mile"" problem of island travel.

The world's happiest airline?

Ultimately, Scurrah is banking on a blend of high-tech ambition and traditional values. He recently made a promise to his staff that it would aspire to be the world's happiest airline, leveraging the natural hospitality of the Fijian people.

But that happiness depends on a future where the planes keep flying and the islands stay above water. Back on the beach, with the mangroves in the sand and the jets in the air, the stakes of that gamble are clear. The airline has already planted over 96,000 seedlings, but for Scurrah, the work is just beginning.

""We have to protect the beauty that is a big part of Fiji's heritage and economy,"" he says.

It's a job that requires keeping one eye on the bottom line, and the other on the rising tide.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6932112c4a0c9f04293bcc51/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:20.572003

The company has finished initial preparation at the 10-acre New Rise Reno 2 site, including land grading and construction of new access roads.
“New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global.
“By adding a second fully integrated facility, we’re transforming New Rise Reno into a major U.S. SAF production hub and positioning XCF for sustained long-term growth.
The U.S. SAF sector is projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030, with global demand exceeding $25 billion.","XCF Global, Inc., a leading force in aviation decarbonization through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), announced new development milestones at its New Rise Reno 2 site, the company’s second SAF production facility and the next implementation of its modular, scalable production platform.

The company has finished initial preparation at the 10-acre New Rise Reno 2 site, including land grading and construction of new access roads. Engineering, design, and project planning are now in progress, with full construction expected to begin in 2026.

Situated next to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new plant will leverage shared infrastructure—including gas, water, rail access, personnel offices, pre-treatment systems, hydrogen production, and logistics assets—to cut capital expenditures, reduce development risk, and speed up the path to production.

XCF has invested about $350 million in its flagship New Rise Reno facility since launch. New Rise Reno 2 marks the next stage of that expansion plan, with an anticipated $300 million investment that will allow the company to double its annual SAF output to roughly 80 million gallons.

“New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. “By adding a second fully integrated facility, we’re transforming New Rise Reno into a major U.S. SAF production hub and positioning XCF for sustained long-term growth. This expansion reflects how we build—intentionally, efficiently, and with a platform designed to meet soaring global demand.”

Expanding Global Reach

The addition of New Rise Reno 2 further strengthens XCF’s ability to serve rising SAF demand across key international aviation markets. In November, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BGN INT US LLC (BGN), a global energy and commodities group, to jointly develop distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic regions.

The collaboration aims to link XCF’s growing production volumes with BGN’s global logistics and trading network, establishing an integrated supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

This alignment comes as demand climbs in major aviation centers.

U.S. SAF Grand Challenge: Federal goals call for producing 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050—enough to meet all domestic jet fuel demand. Yet current U.S. SAF production is still below 1% of total jet fuel use.

ReFuelEU Aviation Mandates: European airlines must blend 2% SAF beginning in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050. With regional capacity falling short of mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face persistent supply deficits and higher SAF prices.

Together, the U.S. and Europe form one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in the clean-energy transition. The U.S. SAF sector is projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030, with global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF’s modular, scalable production platform is designed to expand alongside this opportunity.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/XCF-global-image-logo-updated.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:28.405509

As primeiras entregas de combustível sustentável de aviação (SAF) foram anunciadas pela Petrobras, na sexta-feira (5), no Rio de Janeiro. A empresa é a primeira a produzir, integralmente no Brasil, o combustível que recebe a certificação de sustentabilidade de acordo com as regras da ICAO (sigla em inglês de Organização Internacional de Aviação Civil). O volume de 3 mil m³ foi comercializado com distribuidoras de combustíveis de aviação que operam no Aeroporto Internacional Tom Jobim (Galeão), no Rio de Janeiro. Esse volume corresponde a cerca de um dia de consumo nos aeroportos do estado.

O combustível sustentável de aviação, também conhecido como SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), pode substituir o querosene de aviação convencional sem necessidade de modificações nas aeronaves ou na infraestrutura de abastecimento. Isso o torna uma solução prática e rápida para reduzir as emissões do setor aéreo.

“O SAF, produzido por coprocessamento no parque de refino da Petrobras, é uma solução que contribui para o cumprimento das metas de descarbonização do setor aéreo. É um produto competitivo, que atende a rigorosos padrões internacionais da aviação. Estamos oferecendo ao mercado nacional a possibilidade de atender às demandas globais, antecipando o cumprimento do CORSIA, que é um programa internacional para a redução das emissões provenientes dos voos internacionais”, afirma a presidente da Petrobras, Magda Chambriard.

A antecipação da produção de SAF em relação à legislação vigente é fundamental para o mercado de aviação, considerando as futuras exigências do setor. A partir de 2027, as companhias aéreas no Brasil deverão começar a usar esse tipo de combustível em voos internacionais, seguindo as regras do programa CORSIA (sigla em inglês de Esquema de Compensação e Redução de Carbono para a Aviação Internacional) da ICAO; e em voos domésticos, com base na Lei do Combustível do Futuro.

Nova geração

O SAF Petrobras tem certificado de sustentabilidade ISCC-CORSIA (siglas em inglês de Certificação Internacional de Sustentabilidade e Carbono – Esquema de Compensação e Redução de Carbono para a Aviação Internacional). É um combustível com menor intensidade de carbono porque utiliza um percentual de matéria-prima de origem vegetal, que é processada junto com o querosene de aviação mineral.

No momento, a Petrobras está certificada para o uso de óleo técnico de milho (TCO), uma matéria-prima residual, ou óleo de soja, com uma redução prevista nas emissões líquidas de CO2 de até 87% na parcela renovável. O produto obtido é quimicamente idêntico ao combustível mineral, mas com uma parcela derivada de matéria-prima sustentável.

O combustível das primeiras entregas foi produzido na Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, certificada para produzir e comercializar SAF. A Reduc possui autorização da Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF por essa rota.

A Refinaria Henrique Lage (Revap), em São José dos Campos (SP), já realizou testes para a produção de SAF pela rota de coprocessamento de óleo vegetal com correntes tradicionais de petróleo. A previsão é que, ainda em 2026, a Refinaria de Paulínia (Replan), no estado de São Paulo, e a Refinaria Gabriel Passos (Regap), em Minas Gerais, também passem a produzir e comercializar o combustível.",https://portalbenews.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Reduc_SAF_Home_Credito_Francisco-de-Souza-e1765025168616.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:57:47.729296

Neue Großaufträge und strategische Positionierung

Kürzlich gingen mehrere wichtige Projekte an Saipem. Am 1. Dezember sicherte sich das Unternehmen zwei Verträge von Dangote Fertilizer für den Bau von Harnstoffanlagen in Nigeria und Äthiopien. Nur wenige Tage später, am 5. Dezember, wurde Saipem gemeinsam mit ISS International S.p.A. als technischer Berater für Ghanas wegweisendes Waste-to-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)-Projekt ausgewählt. Dies unterstreicht die strategische Ausrichtung auf nachhaltige Energielösungen.

Zudem profitiert Saipem von Europas Bestrebungen, die Energiesicherheit zu erhöhen. Angesichts des geplanten EU-weiten Verbots russischen Gases bis 2027 gewinnt der Ausbau heimischer Kapazitäten an Bedeutung, was Saipem als wichtigen Dienstleister positioniert.

Fusion mit Subsea 7 unter Beschuss

Die geplante Fusion mit dem Konkurrenten Subsea 7 stößt bei wichtigen Kunden in Brasilien auf massiven Widerstand. Ölkonzerne wie Petrobras, ExxonMobil und TotalEnergies haben formelle Bedenken bei der brasilianischen Wettbewerbsbehörde Cade eingereicht. Sie fürchten, dass der Zusammenschluss den Wettbewerb im Tiefsee-Markt erheblich einschränken könnte.

Das fusionierte Unternehmen ""Saipem7"" würde über einen Auftragsbestand von rund 43 Milliarden Euro und einen Jahresumsatz von etwa 21 Milliarden Euro verfügen. Die schärfsten Einwände betreffen das Geschäft mit Unterwasserleitungen (SURF), wo nur wenige globale Anbieter tätig sind. TotalEnergies bezweifelt in einer Stellungnahme, dass Auflagen die wettbewerblichen Risiken vollständig beseitigen könnten. Cade hat um zusätzliche Daten gebeten; ihre Entscheidung wird für den weiteren Verlauf der Fusion entscheidend sein.

Die starke operative Performance und der wachsende Auftragsbestand bilden ein solides Fundament für Saipem. Die finale Entscheidung der brasilianischen Behörde zur Fusion mit Subsea 7 im kommenden Quartal wird jedoch die strategische Weichenstellung für die kommenden Jahre bestimmen.

Neue Großaufträge und strategische Positionierung

Kürzlich gingen mehrere wichtige Projekte an Saipem. Am 1. Dezember sicherte sich das Unternehmen zwei Verträge von Dangote Fertilizer für den Bau von Harnstoffanlagen in Nigeria und Äthiopien. Nur wenige Tage später, am 5. Dezember, wurde Saipem gemeinsam mit ISS International S.p.A. als technischer Berater für Ghanas wegweisendes Waste-to-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)-Projekt ausgewählt. Dies unterstreicht die strategische Ausrichtung auf nachhaltige Energielösungen.

Zudem profitiert Saipem von Europas Bestrebungen, die Energiesicherheit zu erhöhen. Angesichts des geplanten EU-weiten Verbots russischen Gases bis 2027 gewinnt der Ausbau heimischer Kapazitäten an Bedeutung, was Saipem als wichtigen Dienstleister positioniert.

Fusion mit Subsea 7 unter Beschuss

Die geplante Fusion mit dem Konkurrenten Subsea 7 stößt bei wichtigen Kunden in Brasilien auf massiven Widerstand. Ölkonzerne wie Petrobras, ExxonMobil und TotalEnergies haben formelle Bedenken bei der brasilianischen Wettbewerbsbehörde Cade eingereicht. Sie fürchten, dass der Zusammenschluss den Wettbewerb im Tiefsee-Markt erheblich einschränken könnte.

Das fusionierte Unternehmen ""Saipem7"" würde über einen Auftragsbestand von rund 43 Milliarden Euro und einen Jahresumsatz von etwa 21 Milliarden Euro verfügen. Die schärfsten Einwände betreffen das Geschäft mit Unterwasserleitungen (SURF), wo nur wenige globale Anbieter tätig sind. TotalEnergies bezweifelt in einer Stellungnahme, dass Auflagen die wettbewerblichen Risiken vollständig beseitigen könnten. Cade hat um zusätzliche Daten gebeten; ihre Entscheidung wird für den weiteren Verlauf der Fusion entscheidend sein.

Die starke operative Performance und der wachsende Auftragsbestand bilden ein solides Fundament für Saipem. Die finale Entscheidung der brasilianischen Behörde zur Fusion mit Subsea 7 im kommenden Quartal wird jedoch die strategische Weichenstellung für die kommenden Jahre bestimmen.
