The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.
Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector.
The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024.
Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building.","The Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025, introduced by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was passed in the Lok Sabha on April 3, following its earlier approval in the Rajya Sabha. With both Houses clearing the legislation, this marks the second major aviation reform under his leadership.

The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.

It builds on the framework of the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which sought to simplify and standardize international leasing agreements. Although India formally adopted this convention in 2008, gaps in legal enforcement led to higher leasing costs—typically 8 to 10 percent higher than in other nations. This legislation aims to address those gaps, ensuring legal certainty for aircraft financiers and reducing costs for Indian carriers.

Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector. He pointed to concrete figures demonstrating this growth: between Independence and 2014, the total number of passengers flying annually in India stood at 10.38 crore.

In just the next decade, that number more than doubled to 22.81 crore in 2024. Similarly, the number of airports in India grew from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more set to be launched soon.

The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. He stated that no other country has witnessed such rapid aviation expansion in such a short period.

The bill is expected to streamline leasing processes, make India a more attractive destination for aviation investments, and improve the country’s compliance scores under the Cape Town Convention. These changes are essential for reducing airline costs and encouraging new entrants into the sector.

Discussions on the bill also touched upon broader challenges in the civil aviation sector, such as the high cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which accounts for nearly 45% of an airline’s operational costs. The minister expressed concern over the variation in ATF tax across states and urged more states to follow the example of those who have reduced their rates. Lowering these taxes, he argued, would boost regional connectivity and reduce costs for passengers.

Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building. Plans are in place to generate 2.5 crore liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2025 and transition over 100 airports to renewable energy, underscoring India’s commitment to greener aviation.

The sector also faces a growing demand for trained pilots, estimated at 30,000 to 34,000 over the next 10 to 15 years. The government is working on increasing the number of Flight Training Organizations (FTOs) and issuing more commercial pilot licenses annually to meet this demand.",https://ddnews.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:56:38.341254

Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.","International Airlines Group and Microsoft are strengthening their efforts to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions across the industry by extending their 2023 co-funded purchase agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by five years. Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 metric tons of SAF that will help reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 metric tons. The extension to the agreement enables Microsoft to address Scope 3 lifecycle emissions and is the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement to date, according to publicly available data.

Scope 3 encompasses lifecycle carbon emissions that are not produced by a company itself, but that it is indirectly responsible for up and down its value chain. By partnering with its corporate customers, IAG is able to purchase more SAF and reduce its Scope 1 (direct) emissions. Corporate customers also benefit by lowering Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from the industry commensurate to a proportion of their corporate flying.

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF that is used by the Group’s airlines to ship data center components globally, in partnership with Microsoft’s freight forwarders. Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability officer, said, “We’re pleased to work with like-minded organizations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions. Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

Julia Fidler, environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonization lead at Microsoft, said, ""We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production. We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

Using alternative fuel sources – rather than newly extracted fossil materials – means SAF releases existing carbon, instead of adding new carbon from fossil fuels to the atmosphere. By the end of 2024, 1.9% of IAG's total fuel usage for the year was SAF and total expenditure, including future commitments for SAF offtakes, exceeded $3.5 billion. IAG has been working with the aviation industry in its campaign for further government policy support to stimulate investment in new SAF production technologies.

The SAF used as part of the IAG and Microsoft agreement will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery, and from sustainably source bioethanol at Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, LanzaJet’s facility in the United States. Both fuels are certified by International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, a $1 billion initiative supporting new climate technologies through investments, has previously invested in LanzaJet. LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines facility is the world’s first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet production facility and will supply SAF to British Airways.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/IAG_Logo_9c6a871741.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 10:57:02.804999

As the demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) markets grows, conservation practices like no-till farming and cover cropping are becoming increasingly important. Corn farmers are beginning to use conservation practices for the option to sell to companies wanting ethanol for SAF. Reducing the number of trips across the field, implementing minimal or no-till farming, and utilizing cover crops can significantly lower the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of corn used for SAF.

Justin Rahn, an Illinois corn farmer, recently went to the SAF conference, Illinois Future of Fuels: Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference, held by Illinois Manufacturers’ Association (IMA). Rahn spoke on a panel during this conference to talk about the conservation practices he partakes in and how they affect his farm. Attendees unfamiliar with farming practices were able to ask him questions about sustainable practices and learn their impacts directly from a farmer.

Reducing Carbon Intensity with Conservation Practices

""Fewer trips across the field, minimal tilling, and cover crops help reduce carbon emissions,"" Rahn explained. Some cover crops contribute by putting carbon directly into the soil, further improving sustainability by using crops as opposed to machines to implement carbon into the soil.

Precision Conservation Management Data Collection

Due to the requirements of SAF, farmers will need to track their conservation practices to have the opportunity to sell to SAF markets. ""I work with PCM [Precision Conservation Management], who collects and tracks everything I do on my farm. They meet with me twice a year to record what I planted, how much fertilizer I used, how many passes I made, and what inputs were applied to my fields. At the end of harvest, they track my yields, moisture levels, and transportation distances,"" Rahn shared.shared.

This data provides insights to farmers on the effectiveness of conservation practices and makes it easier for farmers to sell to SAF markets. These practices can be of great use to farmers, but they do come with challenges.

Challenges in Conservation

Farmers face several challenges when integrating conservation practices into their operations. ""Terminating cover crops at the right time can be difficult, especially when the weather doesn’t cooperate. Germination and growth in fall can be a struggle, particularly in dry soil conditions,"" Rahn explained.

Another issue is the high costs of using cover crops and the need for financial incentives. ""We need to be paid more for what we’re doing—cover crops cost money, and farmers need support to make it work,” Rahn expresses. He goes on to address that the companies who need the ethanol for SAF should be the ones to provide those incentives.

For conservation practices to be used by more farmers, they must have incentives. ""There is an incentive if the premium is high enough,"" Rahn stated. However, some farmers still rely on conventional methods like chisel plowing to manage soil compaction, highlighting the need for a balance between profitability and sustainability.

The company faced a hold on funding from the Department of Energy, tariffs on materials and equipment, and difficulties securing purchase agreements for recycled materials.

Mitch Hecht, the CEO and Founder of International Recycling Group, worried aloud in an October interview that public opinion could sink his fundraising efforts.

And that could have scuttled plans for one of the world's largest plastics recycling facilities that he hoped to build in Erie.

But even with a presidential election looming, Hecht said he wasn't concerned about the status of a Department of Energy conditional loan guarantee, announced in August, that would provide $182.6 million toward the project's $300 million price tag.

Such promises typically survived from one administration to the next.

Whatever the outcome of the election in November, Hecht said he expected the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office would make good on the conditional offer.

He was focused instead on the concern that public opposition could stand in the way of raising money for a project expected to create 300 jobs.

""Investors at Goldman Sachs are going to Google up what's going on,"" he said in that October interview. ""If the first thing they see is a ----show in Erie, nobody is going to want to invest. They are going to take their money and put it into something else.""

A statement from IRG on Thursday, however, suggests that the changes in administration policy made it more difficult to raise money.

""Among these challenges are a hold of unspecified duration placed on funding commitments issued by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office,"" IRG said in a statement. ""Additional challenges include recently-announced tariffs on materials and on equipment from Europe not made in the US, resulting in expectations of substantially higher project development costs than anticipated, as well as difficulties in securing long-term purchase agreements for recycled materials from plastics manufacturers and consumer product groups, many of whom are cutting back on sustainability pledges.""

Other loans are on hold as well

International Recycling Group's project hasn't been the only one affected.

According to an advisory from the international law firm of Holland & Knight, the Department of Energy has moved ahead with a $782 million advance on a loan guarantee for the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

However, that loan, according to Holland & Knight, marks the first significant disbursement to a DOE loan or grant project since President Donald Trump signed an executive order that paused the release of federal funds under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act, including Department of Energy Loans and Grants.

In October, Hecht defended the intentions of the loan program under President Joe Biden, which provided funds for projects deemed too risky for commercial lenders.

""it's doing exactly what the administration intended it for, which is to stand up to commercialize and deploy novel technologies that are ready for deployment,"" he said.

Pulling the plug wasn't easy for Hecht.

""I am personally devastated after 18 years of working to bring this vision to a reality that we have failed to overcome these challenges,” he said.

'To see it pulled is a significant loss'

Brandon Mendoza, CEO of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, expressed his own disappointment in a statement.

“The Erie Regional Chamber is frustrated by the financial pressure building due to economic uncertainty at the federal level, which IRG cited as the reason to cancel plans for its Erie plastics recycling plant project,"" he said in a statement.

""This project had significant support at the state and local level, across public and private sectors, and to see it pulled is a significant loss.""

Kim Thomas, executive director of Infinite Erie, also registered disappoint about canceling plans for the project.

""This project is part of the Infinite Erie investment playbook and has received widespread financial support across local and state government, as well as private sector investments,"" she said.

What brought the project to Erie in the first place?

There was more than one reason that Hecht chose Erie, including the presence of a thriving plastics industry and Penn State Behrend's status as one of the nation's leading schools for plastics engineering.

But it was something else that prompted Hecht to visit Erie after originally deciding on another location.

It was a news story about Erie Insurance announcing a $50 million Opportunity Zone investment fund.

He worked with the company for months to vet the concept.

By the time IRG was ready to announce its plans in October of 2020, Erie Insurance and Erie-based Plastek Group had agreed to make a combined $9 million investment in the project.

Plastek was more than an investor. It was on the road to becoming a customer.

The Erie-based company, which manufactures a large share of the deodorant containers used around the world, was under pressure from its customers to use recycled materials to make those containers.

In 2020, Dennis Prischak, the company's CEO, said ""We’re keenly aware of the increasing demand from consumers for post-use content in new packaging.""

Investors in the company react

There is little to suggest that either of those companies will be able to recover the money they invested to develop the business.

Speaking on behalf of Erie Insurance, company spokesman Matthew Cummings said, ""We are disappointed that the project is ending this way, but it is the right decision and only option given the current challenges and complexities.""

He went on to acknowledge the risk involved in an investment of this kind.

""We have always recognized that our investment carried an inherently high level of risk. It was also an investment in a promising local economic development, job creation and sustainability project.""

Cummings concluded: ""We appreciate the work and expertise that Mitch and his team at IRG, as well as countless other community partners and investors, put into this economic development effort.""

Prischak said Thursday that Plastek and his family became involved for what they believed were all the right reasons.

""We are very sad and disappointed at the recent news and the fact that plastics recycling, the plastics industry, the environment, and the jobs IRG would have created in Erie have missed out on a great opportunity,"" he said.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/09/NETN/75589557007-p-1-hecht-100824.jpg?crop=5138,2891,x0,y206&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-04 07:56:50.279854

Step forward for sustainable aviation

Described as a “critical platform” by IATA, the SAF Registry enables airlines and industry stakeholders to track, verify, and claim their SAF usage in a secure and transparent way.

It ensures that environmental benefits from SAF purchases are recorded immutably, eliminating the risk of double counting – an essential step in building trust and accountability in the carbon reduction process.

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO, we have put in place a system that benefits all stakeholders, airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate customers. It is a foundational tool for building a transparent, global SAF market.”

Shift from fossil fuel

Thomsen, however, emphasised that the registry is only one piece of the puzzle. She also called on governments to urgently shift financial support from fossil fuel industries toward renewable energy development, including SAF.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” she said.

As SAF continues to emerge as a key solution for decarbonising air travel, the launch of the registry marks a major milestone, bringing structure, trust, and momentum to the global effort to make aviation more sustainable.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/04/04/nazariy-kovalchuk-uGGBsPokvH8-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 04:56:09.009121

This feature puts information in front of travel bookers and travellers so they can make more informed travel choices that support their organisation’s sustainability goals.

Businesses, governments and non-profit organisations are all seeking ways to minimise the environmental impact of their corporate travel. CTM’s sustainability tools have been at the forefront of smarter data, decisions and measurement across the whole lifecycle of a business trip.

CTM is excited to strengthen its partnership with RDC Aviation, a leading airline data analytics company, to deliver actionable SAF scores in Lightning for our customers.

We’re proud to work with CTM to deliver meaningful insights for business travellers.” Gareth Kitching, Director of Operations, RDC Aviation.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF works in the same way as traditional jet fuel, which you’ll often hear it referred to as a “drop-in fuel”, that can be blended with jet fuel and used in commercial airlines with no significant changes to an aircraft or its engine. Today, SAF can be made in three ways, as a biofuel, a waste fuel, or synthetic “e-Fuel”.

Biofuel: Where crops can be grown and fermented to turn sugar or fat into ethanol.

Waste Fuel: Used cooking oils, greases and other oils can be refined into jet fuel.

E-Fuels: Where electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen then combined with carbon dioxide to make drop-in hydrocarbons like diesel and jet fuel.

The International Aviation Travel Authority (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The largest acceleration is expected in the 2030s as policy support becomes global.

SAF scores – What are they made of?

To provide the most comprehensive assessment of airline SAF adoption, the scores displayed in Lightning, provided by RDC Aviation include several different data points, including but not limited to:

Partnership/development: Agreements between an airline and one provider to test, develop and/or produce SAF.

SAF offtake agreement: Arrangement between the airline and producer to purchase SAF.

Stake in production: Partnership in the SAF production (airline as a partner in the company).

CO2 offset: Airline and/or passenger offset carbon emissions.

Sustainability program: SAF as a criteria of the airline sustainability program.

Efficiency of their fleet: Reflection of investment in modern, efficient equipment and aircraft.

A key factor to scoring is the commitment of airlines to sustainable aviation which includes goals for future use of SAF. The specific metrics and data captured by RDC Aviation as part of this assessment and scoring include data on 250 leading world airlines that show:

Current percentage: Volume of SAF used, which could be network-wide, or, if available, on a particular route shown in Lightning.

Commitment percentage: Volume of SAF committed to purchase. This could be network-wide or on a shown route.

Commitment date: The specific date the SAF commitment will be implemented.

How can CTM customers use SAF scores?

Lightning users will be able to see SAF scores for all 250+ leading airlines when viewing flight results, alongside other critical flight information used to determine an appropriate choice such as price, in-policy status, seat availability, granular carbon emissions, and other planned data such as on-time performance.

Users can sort results by SAF score, highlighting those airlines with AAA SAF scores first. CTM will also be making the SAF scores available to travel managers upon request who wish to incorporate the data into their preferred airline review and contracting process or airline RFPs.

The addition of SAF scores further strengthens Lightning’s sustainability features including carbon emissions for air, hotel and car; the ability to filter and preference car results for EV and hybrid vehicles and the ability to sort flights, hotels and cars by lowest emissions.",https://au.travelctm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-favicon-96x96-CTM-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-04 08:56:10.288388

The system also allows airlines’ corporate customers to support decarbonization through co-financing arrangements, leveraging their ability to contribute to the cost of sustainable fuel uptake. Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will operate on a cost recovery basis.

IATA emphasizes that the Registry is technology- and feedstock-neutral, promoting a diversity of SAF production methods and supporting harmonization across regions. It is also designed to be interoperable with other registries, encouraging open markets and competition.

“The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced,” said Thomsen. She added that further progress depends on stronger government support for renewable energy, including redirecting subsidies away from fossil fuels.

Developed in consultation with airlines, OEMs, governments, fuel suppliers, and corporate travel stakeholders, the SAF Registry already has over 30 early users onboarding. It is underpinned by IATA’s SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, providing a consistent framework for environmental claims regardless of geography.

As such, Natixis CIB is committed to working closely with its clients, partners, and regulatory authorities to accelerate the adoption of SAF.
We believe that with the right partnerships, investments, and regulatory framework, SAF can become the cornerstone of a carbon-neutral aviation sector.","Indeed, we are not witnessing a slowdown in flight demand; in fact, the opposite is true – and as such, there is an urgent need to decarbonize air travel.

One of the most promising solutions emerging in this context is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to projections, if we are to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, more than 60% of the reductions in aviation sector emissions will need to come from SAF. This statistic clearly underscores the critical importance of accelerating both the production and adoption of this innovative fuel.

Facilitating its adoption, perhaps the key advantage of SAF is its ""drop-in"" capability, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring any modifications. This positions SAF not merely as a potential future solution but as a viable option available to the industry today. Airlines can begin integrating SAF into their operations now, making strides toward sustainability without the need for costly overhauls of their current fleets.

The transition to SAF is further bolstered by a supportive regulatory environment and favorable market dynamics. Initiatives such as the European “Refuel EU” program and the “SAF Grand Challenge” in the United States, backed by the Inflation Reduction Act, have established a robust regulatory framework to encourage investment and innovation in SAF production. Countries like the United Kingdom, Japan, and Singapore are also taking proactive steps to develop strategies that will accelerate the growth of SAF, ensuring that the aviation sector can meet its environmental goals.

Moreover, there is a growing commitment from major airlines to incorporate SAF into their operations. Companies are responding to increasing pressure from customers, investors, and NGOs to decarbonize their activities. By signing long-term purchase agreements for SAF, these airlines are not only committing to a greener future but also facilitating the financing and industrialization of the necessary infrastructure for SAF production.

But development of SAF requires a broader effort than that of just the aviation industry. It requires collaboration among a range of stakeholders: fuel producers, airlines, regulators, and financiers, to note a few.

As such, Natixis CIB is committed to working closely with its clients, partners, and regulatory authorities to accelerate the adoption of SAF. We believe that with the right partnerships, investments, and regulatory framework, SAF can become the cornerstone of a carbon-neutral aviation sector.",https://files.natixis.sbcdnsb.com/images/dt7uf2li9bnv/content/1743751324/1387848/600/adobestock_1052431724.jpeg,N,,2025-04-04 03:56:20.050634

Speaking at Toronto Pearson International Airport as the carrier re-started flying to Canada for the first time since 2014, Branson said: “People said it was impossible to fly across the Atlantic with SAF.
We needed to prove them wrong and took off from London [in November 2023] with a full belly of SAF and landed in New York.
Then we flew the first transatlantic flight by a commercial plane on 100% SAF and we landed safely at JKF.

Speaking at Toronto Pearson International Airport as the carrier re-started flying to Canada for the first time since 2014, Branson said: “People said it was impossible to fly across the Atlantic with SAF. We needed to prove them wrong and took off from London [in November 2023] with a full belly of SAF and landed in New York.

“I have tried to break a number of records. I attempted to cross the Atlantic in a boat and it sank. I then tried in a hot air balloon and it ended up in the sea and we had to be rescued by helicopters. Then we flew the first transatlantic flight by a commercial plane on 100% SAF and we landed safely at JKF.

“We’ve proven it can be done but it’s not easy because getting the quantities of SAF that we need is tough – and we’re challenging the industry to get enough SAF so that all our planes can fly on it.”

He added: “Obviously, what’s happened in America is going to make it tougher. The world was moving towards a place where it was a priority to make this happen and now for one side at least, it’s not high on the agenda.”

Asked how President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping trade tariffs might affect the Virgin group of companies, Branson said: “All I can say is that between Canada and Britain there are no tariffs that I am aware of.

“I can’t see any tariffs existing between our two countries and I hope we can become even closer than we have been over the last 50 years and we will try to make sure that happens.”

Branson was also asked what made him confident Virgin Atlantic would not withdraw again from Canada, as it had in 2001 after 9/11, ending its Toronto service, and then pulling out of Vancouver after flying there between 2012-2014.

“Nothing is guaranteed in life. But we’re much stronger than we were 20 years ago,” he said.

“We managed to survive Covid without British government help and were the only airline to do that. We paid back debts and made a profit so I’m confident that 25 years from now, Virgin will still be going strong. We’ve also got new partners which we didn’t have before, [in Delta, Air France/KLM and Westjet].”

He added that he would like to see the Canadian operation expand.

“I’d love to see Virgin flying to the other side of Canada in the near future. I’m not going to mention specific cities, but you can guess which one. Until then, we have a great partner to connect us to 13 cities across the country.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/258/Virgin_Atlantic_Toronto_Branson1_Main.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 03:56:27.146112

Some of the trends we are seeing emerge, will continue in 2025 and beyond. Emerging markets are showing significant interest in producing SAF, and are aiming to export to regulated zones while gradually implementing domestic mandates.

In the meantime, Glessing said farmers will have to try and minimize market loss while continuing to look for new opportunities.
He said they’re working hard to focus on the relationships with their trading partners, but it’s hard for people to plan for the future with so much uncertainty.
Petersen said another way around the tariffs is add value within our own country.","GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. — Uncertainty about the future is a feeling no one wants.

“People may feel effects of tariffs tomorrow, others may not feel them for six months to a year,” said Thom Petersen, the commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

Petersen said the last few years have been tough on farmers, and tariffs will add to the strain.

“Basically, it’s going to add to chaos,” Petersen said.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on nearly all imported goods.

Petersen is worried about the impact the tariffs could have on the state’s biggest trading partners and the impact of anticipated reciprocal tariffs.

“About a third of our crop is exported and my concern is what the reciprocal tariffs will look like from some our biggest trading partners, and if some of our trading partners that we’ve worked years to develop relationships that our farmers have worked years to develop those relationships that those markets will go and look somewhere else.”

The tariff announcement comes on the heels of a difficult year for farmers.

“Farmers are struggling. We know mediation notices sent to farmers are double this year from what they were in 2024, so we know farmers are having a hard time on balance sheets, so any kind of cut or slowdown is going to be difficult,” Petersen said.

“Commodity prices have been challenging the last three years probably 2-3 and those margins are very, very tight,” said President of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Dan Glessing. “It’s been some tough sledding the last couple of years.”

Glessing is also a dairy farmer. He’s hoping for swift action by the administration on unilateral trade deals. Unilateral because he doesn’t think this administration will be interested in bilateral trade.

“It’s concerning to our members, to farmers, obviously, we are very good at producing food and fiber in this country and if that doesn’t get to where it needs to go, and if farmers can’t stay in business, that’s a challenge,” Glessing said.

He said some countries will need to continue importing American products and will continue to do so. However, they might not import as many products if there’s an additional cost to import them.

“Realistically, we don’t know how long they’re going to be on that’s probably the most unsettling part of it The duration of them is kind of the key to how much an effect it has on our bottom line,” he said.

In the meantime, Glessing said farmers will have to try and minimize market loss while continuing to look for new opportunities.

Petersen said they’ll have to explore other markets of trade farmers can tap into and add value where they can like biofuel and sustainable aviation fuel.

He said they’re working hard to focus on the relationships with their trading partners, but it’s hard for people to plan for the future with so much uncertainty.

“You know we’re really concerned for some of our farmers that they really can’t get through another bad crop year, a bad price or production year, so the tariffs you know too are being levied against some of our biggest trading partners,” Petersen said. “A lot of concern about uncertainties and we’ll just have to see how this plays out

He said he thinks tariffs are an outdated idea because we have become a global market.

Petersen said another way around the tariffs is add value within our own country.

“It takes time though to build new factories. It takes time to hire new people, you know, so I just don’t see that we’re going to see an immediate return on some of these tariffs. I think it’s going to take time to sort some of that out,” Petersen said.",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/089a5537-cc16-4098-8daf-a67e93c42971/20250403T232851/089a5537-cc16-4098-8daf-a67e93c42971_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 00:56:07.938893

Brazil SAF industry set to take off in 2027

Sao Paulo, 2 April (Argus) — Brazil's aviation industry is keeping an eye on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) regulations as the domestic market awaits the kickoff of local production to comply with the planned blend mandate and with potential for exports. The fuels of the future law envisages raising biofuel mix standards to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in domestic flights over a 10-year period starting in 2027, as Brazil has committed to applying a 10pc SAF mandate by 2037. The country's efforts to implement a SAF mandate runs in tandem with the guidelines from UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) program, which oversees GHG reduction in international flights. The program set up two phases until reduction targets are fully implemented, so airlines and producers adapt to changes efficiently. Airlines can voluntarily adhere between 2024-2026, followed by global compulsory targets from 2027-2035, prompting SAF usage or carbon credits compensation. The mandatory phase embraces all international flights, including those from and to non-voluntary countries, except for so-called underdeveloped countries and those with a low share of global air traffic flows. Brazil's SAF is a newborn industry that holds potential for feedstock supply , mostly for its traditional production pathways using soybean oil, corn and sugarcane ethanol, as well as widespread agricultural lands engaged in biomass production without practicing land-use change. Its variability also allows new projects to reuse degraded lands and existing agricultural assets to comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sustainability criteria related to land-use and soil health enhancement. SAF input in Brazil faces economic hurdles as high market volatility weighs on long-term investments, says A&M Infra's management consultant Filipe Bonaldo. But he also says that the political agenda will not hinder the energy transition as has happened in the US under President Donald Trump, since Brazil's economy is heavily based on agriculture its regulatory processes spur optimism. As an agricultural powerhouse, Brazil offers low-cost production and multiple sources to provide demand, both internally and offshore. Brazil is the third largest global exporter in agriculture and livestock markets, leading soy, orange juice and beef markets globally, according to agriculture and livestock confederation CAN. Debut in Rio Brazilian fuel distributor Vibra is the first to offer SAF in Brazil, before the blend mandate comes into effect. The company imported 550,000l (16,000bl) of SAF produced with used-cooking oil (UCO) from the port of Antwerp, in the Netherlands, in January. The biofuel is available for customers at Vibra's facility at the Rio de Janeiro international airport after a 10-month logistics plan was concluded. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) has secured all processes of the plan, from the supply chain of the product to distribution. Vibra operates in more than 90 airports in Brazil and accounts for 60pc of national aviation market share through its sector subsidiary BR Aviation, said executive vice-president of operations Marcelo Bragança. Why it took so long? The sector has long had doubts over the technical feasibility of admitting the use of biofuels in aviation , especially from a security point of view, said Anac's head of the environment and energy transition Marcela Anselmi. The agency, along with oil and biofuels regulator ANP, follow international regulations for SAF as it requires a physical and chemical resemblance to current fossil aviation fuels to ensure flight operations security. It is still not possible to use 100pc of SAF in aircraft motors, said Anselmi. There is a 50pc mix limit that inhibits worldwide adherence as there are technical restrictions yet to overcome. Recent engagement in the energy transition agenda is promoting biomass supply for aviation, as well as road and marine modalities, requiring new production pathways. For example, ATJ uses ethanol to convert it into SAF, which can be expensive to install and implies high capital expenditure. In a global context, Brazil stands in the vanguard of the SAF agenda as Europe and the US have only deployed legislation related to output and consumption over the past two years, Anselmi pointed out. Meanwhile, South America's planned SAF production capacity may reach 1.1mn l/yr in 2030, according to EPE.

US oil, farm groups push EPA for steep biofuel mandate

New York, 1 April (Argus) — The American Petroleum Institute and biofuel-supporting groups told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials at a meeting today that the agency should sharply raise advanced biofuel blend mandates for 2026. The coalition told EPA that it supported a biomass-based diesel mandate next year of 5.25bn USG, up from 3.35bn USG this year, and a broader advanced biofuel mandate, including the cellulosic category, at 10bn Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits, up from 7.33bn RINs this year, according to three different groups that attended the meeting. Both mandates would be record highs for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Soybean oil futures and RIN credit prices have risen sharply over the past week on optimism that oil and biofuel interests were working to coordinate volume mandate requests for consideration by President Donald Trump's administration. The coalition is also pushing the agency to set a total conventional volume requirement at 25bn RINs, which would keep an implied mandate for corn ethanol flat at 15bn USG. Ethanol groups had previously eyed a mandate even higher, but limits on the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline make much more-stringent requirements a tough sell to oil refiners. The coalition provided no specific request for the cellulosic biofuel subcategory, where most credit generation comes from biogas. Credits in that category are more expensive, but price concerns have been less potent recently given an EPA proposal to lower previously set cellulosic obligations, signaling that future volume requirements can be cut, too. EPA is aiming to finalize new RFS volume mandates by the end of the year if not earlier, people familiar with the administration's thinking have said. EPA officials signaled at the meeting they were working urgently on the rulemaking. ""The agency is intent on getting the RFS program back on the statutory timeline for issuing renewable volume obligation rules,"" EPA said, declining to comment further on its plans for the rule. The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy credits from those who do. Under the program's unique nesting structure, credits from blending lower-carbon biofuels can be used to meet obligations for other program categories. One gallon of corn ethanol generates 1 RIN, but more energy-dense fuels earn more RIN credits per gallon. Some disagreements persist While groups at the meeting were aligned around high-level mandates, how administration officials and courts treat small refinery requests for exemptions from RFS requirements could undercut those targets. Groups present were broadly aligned on asking EPA not to grant widespread exemptions, though there is still disagreement in the industry about how best to account for exempted volumes when deciding requirements for other refiners. Groups present at the meeting today included the American Petroleum Institute and representatives of biofuel producers and crop feedstock suppliers. Some groups that previously engaged with the coalition's efforts to project unity to the Trump administration were not present. And some groups more historically skeptical of the RFS and more supportive of small refinery exemptions — including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — have not been closely involved. Fuel marketer groups notably did not attend the meeting after a representative sparred with others in the coalition at an American Petroleum Institute meeting last month. Some retail groups, including the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, instead sent a letter to EPA today arguing that the groups pushing steep volumes are discounting potential headwinds to the sector from new tax credit policy. Some of the groups advocating for higher biofuel volumes have pointed to high production capacity and feedstock availability, but have preferred to ignore thornier issues like tax credits, lobbyists say. ""An overly aggressive increase in advanced biofuel blending mandates under the RFS will be punitive for American consumers"" without extending a long-running $1/USG tax credit for biomass-based diesel blenders, the retailers' letter said. That incentive expired last year and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" credit, which offers subsidies to producers instead of blenders and throttles benefits based on carbon intensity. Generally lower credit values for biomass-based diesel — coupled with the US government's delays setting final regulations on qualifying for the credit — have spurred a sharp drop in biofuel production to start the year. Without a blenders credit, the RFS volume mandates pushed by some groups could increase retail diesel prices by 30¢/USG, the fuel marketers estimate, a potential political headache for a president that ran on curbing consumer costs. Other biofuel groups say that extending the credit would be an uphill battle this year, with some lawmakers and lobbyists instead focused on legislatively tweaking the 45Z incentive's rules to benefit crop feedstocks instead of reverting wholesale to the prior tax policy.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures. Industry participants said yesterday that the EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids, and Biomass Fuels is drafting implementing regulations that would include a two-and-a-half year pause to obligatory acceptance of ISCC EU certification for waste-based biofuels. ""This action is said to be subject to further legal scrutiny and will need approval by member states,"" the ISCC said. Currently, member states accept EU-recognised voluntary scheme certification as proof that fuel or feedstocks are compliant with the bloc's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria. Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap. The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels and would seriously jeopardise the ability of the obligated parties to comply with blending mandates,"" the ISCC said. The ISCC has been singled out in a discriminatory way and has supported European Commission and member states' investigations into alleged fraud, it said. ""We are more than surprised by this step […and] are unable to see the rationale of the planned measure, which seems ad hoc and baseless,"" it added. Secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) Xavier Noyon told Argus that, if confirmed, the suspension would affect thousands of operators. ""At this time, member states are refusing to comment, and we call on the commission to urgently clarify any decisions of this nature that are on the table,"" he said. The EBB published its own proposed revision to the RED implementing legislation last month, which expanded the supervisory power of member states over voluntary schemes and certification bodies. The European Commission confirmed that the committee met on 26 March to discuss sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, avoidance of double counting, and alleged fraud. ""We are still working on our examination of this alleged fraud in biodiesel imports from China,"" said commission energy spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. But the commission has not taken any decision yet and cannot allude to ""possible"" scenarios, she said.

Most assessments of mitigation potential of biochar have focussed on technical or sustainable potential, and several consider economic potential.
In this review, we considered 19 peer-reviewed articles on global biochar mitigation potential published between 2010 and 2022 (Supplementary Table 1).
According to the definition in 'Definition of mitigation potential’, this aligns with sustainable potential (i.e., a sustainable subset of the technical maximum).
This demand-driven approach differs from most biochar potential studies that applied a supply-driven approach based on feedstock availability.","Strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are critically important but will not be sufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The IPCC1,2 has shown that it will also be necessary to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Biochar is one of the few technologically mature strategies available to deliver CO2 removal (CDR). Biochar systems, that involve production of biochar for use as a soil amendment, combine a biological removal process with a durable storage mechanism3. Biochar systems can provide benefits for climate change adaptation, land degradation management, food security4 and human health (e.g. Mohammadi et al.5).

Biochars are charcoal-like heterogeneous porous materials produced by heating organic matter such as forestry residues or straw in an oxygen-limited environment, generally used as soil amendments6. Biochars vary widely in their properties, dependent on feedstock and production conditions. The production process is exothermic: a small amount of external heat is required to initiate pyrolysis, whereafter combustible gas is released, which is commonly used to fuel the process. Excess pyrolysis gas (also known as syngas) can be used as a renewable energy source for heat or electricity generation, replacing fossil fuels. Thus, renewable energy is a co-product of biochar production. Biochar production systems are sometimes also termed pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS). In this review, biochar is assumed to be produced with other co-products of biomass pyrolysis, that is, bio-oil and syngas.

The primary contribution of biochar systems to climate change mitigation is CDR achieved through the persistence of biochar: biochar carbon persists in soil over centuries7,8,9 which greatly delays the oxidation of biochar compared with its biomass feedstock. Biochar can contribute additionally to climate change mitigation by building soil C through reduced mineralisation of soil organic matter10, reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from soil11, and through fossil fuel displacement12. Besides mitigation contributions, biochar could play an integral role in system-level strategies for sustainable development and the circular bioeconomy13,14,15.

While there has been intense activity to elucidate the mechanisms of biochar impacts on soil properties and plant response16, there are relatively few studies on the climate change mitigation value of biochar systems. Life cycle assessments (LCA) of biochar systems show wide variation between feedstocks, pyrolysis conditions, and biochar applications, though most biochar systems show substantial net climate benefits. In their Special report on Climate Change and the Land17, the IPCC reported mitigation potential for biochar in the range 0.4–1.2 t CO2 equivalent t−1 dry feedstock.

There are few studies on global mitigation potential of biochar. One of the most comprehensive studies of biochar mitigation potential, by Woolf et al.12, estimated global sustainable mitigation potential to be ~3.7–6.6 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. Synthesising available literature, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report18 estimated theoretical potential of 0.2–6.6 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. There have been no critical reviews focussed solely on mitigation potential of biochar systems.

This paper reviews the literature on potential mitigation through biochar, examining the scope and assumptions applied, to pinpoint the basis for the wide variation between studies. We start by reviewing the various processes that provide GHG mitigation in biochar systems. We distinguish the contributions of different GHG mitigation processes to the net mitigation potential, separating CDR and GHG emissions reductions (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We examine the relationship between studies of mitigation potential and distinguish novel analyses from those based on earlier studies. Here we show that most studies since 2010 are not new analyses, but instead many are based on the study by Woolf et al.12, sometimes misquoted or selectively extracted. Differences between studies sometimes arise from confusion between CO2 vs. C due to the unusual choice of units in the study by Woolf et al.12, but, more importantly, are largely due to differences in scope of the study (CDR and emissions reduction processes included) and assumed biomass availability.

Persistent biochar carbon

The conversion of biomass to biochar, via pyrolysis, greatly delays the oxidation of biomass. Biochar has a mean residence time (MRT) in soil of hundreds to thousands of years9,19. The key factors controlling the persistence of biochar-C are feedstock type, the highest pyrolysis temperature, and duration of pyrolysis, which determine the degree of aromatisation. Long-term persistence of biochar is predicted from multi-year incubation studies using isotopic difference to quantify loss of biochar carbon. Biochar carbon is commonly assumed to comprise two pools: (1) the labile pool, the small fraction of biochar C that is susceptible to rapid mineralisation, comprising aliphatic-C, phenolic-C, and carbohydrate C, and (2) the persistent pool, the aromatised C that mineralises very slowly20,21. Estimating MRT commonly involves applying a double first-order exponential decay model. Azzi et al. 19 demonstrated the sensitivity of BC100 (fraction of biochar carbon remaining after 100 years) to the curve-fitting approach. The H/C ratio is an effective predictor of biochar persistence19; for biochars with H/C < 0.7 (considered a threshold for classification as biochar) the BC100 is 60–90%. Sanei et al.22 identified that biochars produced at temperatures > 550 °C are dominated by inertinite, with estimated half-life of 100 million years, and that random reflectance (Ro) is an effective method to characterise biochar carbon pools of differing stability. The CDR due to biomass conversion to biochar is determined by the biochar yield per unit of feedstock and the relative mineralisation rate of the biochar carbon in comparison with the unpyrolysed feedstock. Conversion rates from biomass-C to biochar-C are generally 20–50%, with lower recoveries, but greater persistence, at higher pyrolysis temperatures23,24.

Impact on soil carbon dynamics

Biochar amendment can decrease mineralisation of native soil organic matter (SOM)9 and newly added organic matter10,25,26, increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The capacity of biochar to increase total soil organic C beyond the addition of persistent biochar-C is both a function of the properties of the biochar and those of the soil.

Change in the mineralisation rate of SOM induced by organic amendments is known as priming27. Meta-analyses of biochar-induced priming based on incubation studies in the absence of plants indicate an initial phase of positive priming (20 days28; 2 years29) followed by negative priming, with an average decrease in the mineralisation rate of SOM of 3.8% (−8.1 to 0.8% for different soils and biochars) compared with the unamended control9. Studies of soil-plant-biochar interactions have similarly reported increased mineralisation of native SOM over 66 days30 but reduction in mineralisation of 19–29% over longer periods31,32. A decadal study in an acidic Ferralsol showed that wood biochar can increase soil C through soil aggregation processes that slow the mineralisation of new C (e.g. root exudates, root detritus, microbial necromass) resulting in ongoing soil C accumulation over 10 years after one biochar application10,26. Long-term negative priming has also been recorded from wood biochar applied to a neutral pH Mollisol33. Essentially, application of biochar protects SOM from microbial breakdown. This phenomenon is likely applicable to soils with high clay content. However, in sandy soils, biochar is found to enhance priming, and aggregate formation is limited by absence of clays.

Besides its direct effect on SOC stocks, biochar-induced increase in SOM can enhance plant growth through its effect on soil water holding capacity and aggregation, and soil fertility and cycling of nutrients, further increasing SOC input to the soil.

Additional mitigation through enhanced plant growth

Biochar facilitates biotic and abiotic soil-plant-microbe reactions, particularly in the root zone, that can enhance nutrient and water supply to plants, thereby enhancing plant growth16. Meta-analyses have found that, on average, biochar increases crop yield by 10–42%16. The greatest responses are observed in acidic tropical soils and sandy soils in the drylands, while small or nil yield responses are often observed in temperate climates and high fertility soils16,34,35. Biochar-induced productivity enhancement stores additional C in vegetation, offering additional CDR, and extra biomass could be used to make more biochar.

Emissions reduction—non-CO2 GHG from soil and composting

Meta-analyses have found that biochar application can effectively mitigate N2O and CH4 emissions from soil in the short to medium term, though the effects vary widely36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43.

Meta-analyses of the impact of biochar on soil N2O emissions showed an average reduction of 12% in the field compared with the unamended control43 and reduction of 38% combining both field and laboratory conditions36. The interacting biotic and abiotic processes involved in decreasing N2O emissions include direct sorption and reaction of greenhouse gases on biochar surfaces, and changes in soil properties such as porosity, pH, availability of substrates, and microbial community composition and activity11,16. Separate meta-analyses of C sequestration44 and N2O emissions36,42 suggest a strong synergy between CDR and emissions reduction in biochar systems, in contrast with alternative organic amendments that tend to increase soil N2O emissions45. With respect to CH4, application of biochar can reduce emissions from waterlogged soils (especially acid soils), but biochar commonly decreases the CH4 sink of upland soils40,46.

Studies of soil emissions typically do not compare emissions after addition of biochar with the emissions that would arise from application of the equivalent amount of unpyrolysed biomass (commonly about three times more material). This comparison, which is applicable when considering alternative uses of a finite biomass source, would likely reveal a greater mitigation impact of biochar systems on soil emissions in many circumstances.

Recent syntheses have improved understanding of processes underlying biochar-induced decrease in GHG emissions from soil, and enhanced the capability to predict the potential impact based on biochar properties, soil types and environmental factors11,16. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the longevity of influence on soil emissions and indirect effects through impacts on leaching and volatilisation of nitrogen (N)47.

Addition of biochar to composting organic matter can reduce the emissions of N2O and CH448,49, through sorption of N on biochar surfaces, increasing N retention, and oxidation of CH4 by methanotrophs. Biochar can also indirectly lower N2O emissions through lower N leaching and volatilisation.

Emissions avoided

Avoided emissions are emissions that occur outside the biochar supply chain, that are indirectly reduced or prevented through the adoption of biochar systems, including through the use of pyrolysis gases as renewable energy, modified management of organic residues and wastes, and reduced fertiliser manufacture.

Pyrolysis gases released during the production of biochar are combusted to produce heat to drive the pyrolytic process, and excess gas can be used as a renewable energy source to displace fossil fuels used for electricity and/or heat. The amount of excess syngas produced is greater for feedstock materials with lower moisture content, which therefore require less energy to reach pyrolysis temperatures, and greater at higher pyrolysis temperatures, which produce a higher yield of gas relative to biochar. In a life cycle assessment of climate change mitigation potential of biochar production in China, the fossil fuel displacement through bio-electricity production was calculated at 0.2–6.7 t CO2-equivalent t−1 biochar applied for biochar produced from crop residues, 0.2–8.2 t CO2 equivalent t−1 for forest residues, 0.3–2.1 t CO2-equivalent t−1 for livestock manure, 0.1–1.7 t CO2 equivalent t−1 for sewage sludge, and 0.4–2.8 t CO2 equivalent t−1 for food waste50, where the lower and higher values relate to pyrolysis temperatures of <300 °C and >500 °C, respectively. Although additional fuel is required for biomass transportation, feedstock processing, and biochar production, the associated GHG emissions (0.1–1.5 t CO2 equivalent t−1) are small compared with the fossil fuel displacement50. The mitigation value of bioenergy co-produced with biochar depends on the GHG intensity of displaced energy products, and the efficiency of gas capture and electricity generation51. Greatest mitigation is achieved where syngas is used for heat rather than electricity, and where GHG-intensive electricity sources such as brown coal are displaced. While it is acknowledged that economic cost from pyrolysis energy is higher than some other renewable energy sources such as solar, pyrolysis energy could play an important role as a dispatchable energy source, firming the grid as intermittent energy sources expand.

Pyrolysing organic wastes such as poultry litter avoids N2O and CH4 emissions that arise during handling, storage and land application of the unpyrolysed waste11. Biochar is an effective and efficient way to recycle nutrients in biosolids and other organic residues that are otherwise lost and cause pollution if landfilled, combusted or discharged to waterways. Biochar and biochar-fertilizer combinations can reduce leaching and volatilisation losses of soil N, thus increasing N use efficiency52,53, reducing the amount of chemical fertiliser required, and therefore avoiding the manufacturing emissions of GHG-intensive N fertilisers.

Definition of mitigation potential

Estimates of mitigation potential of a strategy can be categorised into four types: (1) technical potential, (2) economic potential, (3) sustainable potential, and (4) feasible potential54. Technical potential is the theoretical maximum mitigation that a strategy could deliver, determined by biogeophysical limits, with known technology. Economic potential is the technical potential that can be realised economically under assumed costs, benefits, and costs of alternative options. Sustainable potential is the portion of the technical potential that allows for other societal objectives such as biodiversity conservation, maintenance of the natural resource base, and food security. Feasible potential considers geophysical, ecological, technological, economic, social and institutional barriers to adoption, to determine the likely rate of implementation at a specified time. The magnitude of estimates of potential generally decreases, while uncertainty and subjectivity increase, moving from technical through economic and sustainable to feasible potential. Most assessments of mitigation potential of biochar have focussed on technical or sustainable potential, and several consider economic potential.

Scope of analysis regarding GHG fluxes

As discussed in ‘Climate change mitigation contributions of biochar systems’, factors that contribute to mitigation through biochar systems are: CDR, reduced non-CO2 GHG emissions, and avoided emissions, particularly from fossil fuel displacement. CDR includes the carbon stabilised through pyrolysis, often expressed as carbon remaining after 100 years (BC100) (see 'Persistent biochar carbon') and can also include negative priming (see 'Impact on soil carbon dynamics') and enhanced plant growth (see 'Additional mitigation through enhanced plant growth'). All studies include carbon sequestered in biochar, but the latter two sources of CDR are omitted in most assessments of mitigation potential.

Adoption of biochar systems can reduce N2O and CH4 emitted from soil (see 'Emissions reduction—non-CO2 GHG from soil and composting'), and avoid GHG emissions from feedstock handling (collection, transport and storage), landfill, and production of electricity and heat (see 'Emissions avoided'). Some studies of global mitigation potential include many of these components (e.g. Woolf et al.12), though none that we reviewed contains all. Other mitigation components that could be considered include reduced manufacturing emissions from fertiliser production due to lower fertiliser requirements, and reduced fuel use in cultivation (due to reduced soil strength) or irrigation pumping (due to enhanced water holding capacity). However, while these are included in some LCA studies of specific biochar systems, we are not aware of any global studies of mitigation potential that include them.

Assumptions for key variables

Assumptions for several key variables influence the potential derived in each assessment: (1) available biomass (2) products of pyrolysis; and (3) persistence of biochar carbon.

Availability of biomass

To estimate the global mitigation potential of biochar systems, one must quantify the available biomass. Biomass residues and wastes that are already aggregated at processing facilities e.g. poultry litter, feedlot manure, urban greenwaste, nut shells, cotton gin trash, sawmill and paper mill residues are desirable biochar feedstocks. The current fate of the residues must be considered, to determine the amount available for biochar, and the net effect on GHG emissions. Food residues, urban greenwaste and biosolids are often landfilled or incinerated, so diversion for biochar has no risk of 'leakage', that is, inducing increased emissions elsewhere as a result of adopting biochar systems. Conversely, although crop residues make highly-effective biochar16, they are commonly retained on site to preserve soil moisture, control weeds and reduce erosion risk, and sometimes used for fuel, animal bedding or animal feed, so diversion for biochar could lead to leakage, through provision of alternative sources for these functions. Nevertheless, in high-yielding crops (e.g. irrigated cereals, sugarcane) residues are often burned to facilitate crop establishment or manage disease and pests. Pyrolysing these residues in place of in-field burning also offers benefits for the environment by avoiding GHG emissions especially CH455, and for human health by avoiding particulate emissions5. Manure is often spread in fields as organic fertiliser, so diverting for biochar could increase demand for synthetic fertiliser, however, it would reduce emissions of N2O from manure handling, and provide environmental and health benefits through reduced eutrophication and risk of transfer of pathogens.

Studies of technical potential consider the total quantities of biomass theoretically available for biochar production, while studies of economic or sustainable potential consider constraints such as competition from alternative uses, sustainability and food security implications and costs. Studies commonly use bottom-up assessments of feedstock available, for example, based on statistics for crop yields or area harvested, to estimate available crop and forest residues (e.g. Woolf et al.12; Roe et al.56). However, it should be noted that a number of uncertainties are associated with such global assessments, arising from the choice of crops, definitions of crop residues, assumptions for ratios of residues to crop yields (harvest index), consideration of technical, environmental and economic limitations, and annual variability in yields57,58. In a review of published global estimates for residue availability for bioenergy use, Hanssen et al.59 found a range of 12–76 exajoule (EJ) yr−1 in 2050 for eight bottom-up studies and attributed this variation to different methodologies, definitions and criteria for assessing availability.

Besides biomass residues, another feedstock considered in many studies is purpose-grown biomass crops, so a key assumption is the quantity of land available for dedicated biomass production. Risks to biodiversity, food security and vulnerable communities need to be considered. The use of marginal land and abandoned land for purpose-grown biomass minimises these risks, and substantial potential has been identified (e.g. Field et al.60). Furthermore, production of biomass for biochar that is then applied to the same land could restore degraded land, enhancing productivity. However, the definition and extent of marginal land are debated, and depend on the intended land use12,61, thus estimates of marginal land area are highly uncertain and purpose-specific60,61. Uncertainties regarding marginal land estimates arise from temporal and spatial variation in productivity and land use, related to seasonal conditions and transhumance patterns, for example. In a recent assessment of potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland, Gvein et al.62 estimated 67–115 Mha of abandoned cropland available for biomass crops, excluding priority biodiversity conservation areas, in 2050. The authors noted high uncertainty of projections with respect to location of abandoned cropland, associated with inter-model differences and different socio-economic pathways, but commented that results at global scale were largely consistent and insensitive to the individual scenario.

The biomass availability assumed by Woolf et al.12 was based on the estimate derived by Field et al.60 who combined remotely sensed land use change products to identify the abandoned crop and pasture land area, which they coupled with spatial estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) from Randerson et al.63 From this, Woolf et al.12 estimated that up to 1250 Mt dry matter of purpose-grown biomass could be produced sustainably by 2100, while safeguarding biodiversity and food security. Besides high uncertainty regarding the land area, using the potential NPP to estimate lignocellulosic energy crop productivity provides a crude approximation, as realised NPP is dependent on the plant species.

Smith64 back-calculated from the CDR potential estimate of Woolf et al.12, to estimate the land requirement for biomass crops of 40–260 Mha for 2050. In contrast, Werner et al.65 used a process-based vegetation model to derive spatially explicit estimates of available biomass, and determined ‘land- and calorie-neutral’ production potential of purpose-grown biomass in 2100 for a scenario that constrained cropland to current area and maintained calorie production to ensure for food security through biochar-mediated yield increase. Assuming a yield increase of 15% from 2t biochar ha-1 biochar applied to tropical and subtropical croplands, they determined that 13.7 Mha of cropland was freed for biomass production.

Competition for biomass is likely to be a considerable constraint to biochar production. Competing uses of manures and food waste include compost, fertiliser and biogas, while bio-electricity, liquid biofuels and heat currently compete for crop and forestry residues and purpose-grown biomass. Competition for sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be strong in the future, as the growing airline industry has limited options to reduce emissions66. Several of the studies considered in this review explicitly addressed competition for residues by assuming that some fraction of the residues produced will continue to be used for feed, energy and/or soil protection (e.g. Woolf et al.12; Powell and Lenton67; Griscom et al.68). Integrated assessment models (IAMs) often assume that most available biomass is used for bioenergy: IAMs suggest strong demand for biomass for heat, bio-electricity and liquid biofuels for transport, and also for biochemicals, with proportions of each varying between socio-economic pathways, and large allocation to electricity with CCS under ambitious mitigation targets69. If the biomass assumed to be used for bioenergy in these models is instead used for biochar, energy will need to be produced from other sources, which should be factored into calculations of the net climate impact of alternative uses of biomass.

Biochar yield and persistence of biochar carbon

As discussed in ‘Persistent biochar carbon’, the carbon contained in biochar is highly persistent in soil, and persistence varies with feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. Pyrolysis conditions also determine the biochar yield, with lower yield—but higher persistence—at higher temperatures. Biochars comprise a mixture of organic compounds with different durabilities. Biochar carbon persistence is usually characterised in terms of MRT for the recalcitrant fraction, or BC100, the fraction remaining after 100 years19. Most studies apply the same assumptions for persistence across all feedstocks and include only the carbon assumed to be retained beyond 100 years. For example, Roe et al.56 assumed 50% conversion of biomass carbon to biochar; 97% recalcitrant fraction with half-life of 556 years, with 80% retained beyond 100 years. Similarly, Werner et al.70 assumed 55% conversion, and MRT of >750 years, with 90% of biochar carbon retained. In contrast, Woolf et al.12 used a dynamic approach, modelling biochar carbon kinetics using a 2-stage exponential decay function assuming a half-life for the recalcitrant fraction of 300 years, and demonstrated the strong sensitivity to this assumption.

In this review, we considered 19 peer-reviewed articles on global biochar mitigation potential published between 2010 and 2022 (Supplementary Table 1). We illustrate the range of estimates for each of the major contributors to mitigation, i.e., CDR, emissions reduction, and emissions avoidance (Fig. 1). Some studies focus on a limited range of mitigation contributions, such as CDR only (e.g. Smith64). Some limit scope by focussing on one technology (e.g. Pratt and Moran71) or one feedstock (e.g. Roberts et al.72) or one farming system (e.g. Lenton73).

The highest estimate was 11 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, for technical potential including CDR, bioenergy and avoided N2O67, while the lowest estimate was 0.03 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 for economic potential74. Estimates of biochar’s global technical mitigation potential based only on CDR range from 0.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 68,75 to 4.9 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 67. As shown in Fig. 2, 13 out of 15 papers published since 2011 are not new analyses and of these, seven papers are based on Woolf et al.12 Since 2011, there are two essentially independent analyses of technical potential that have not relied on biomass data, biochar yields, or biochar persistence from Woolf et al.68,70.

The most comprehensive and widely cited study of biochar mitigation potential was conducted by Woolf et al. 12, who estimated ‘maximum sustainable technical potential’ of biochar systems, allowing for competition for non-waste biomass and applying safeguards to protect biodiversity and ensure food security. According to the definition in 'Definition of mitigation potential’, this aligns with sustainable potential (i.e., a sustainable subset of the technical maximum). Their estimate includes mitigation through carbon sequestered in biochar, avoided emissions of CH4 and N2O, and displaced fossil fuel emissions. Woolf et al.12 estimated global mitigation potential at 3.7–6.6 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 between 2010 and 2100, with peak rates reached after 60 to 100 years of adoption. Half of the mitigation is due to the carbon sequestered in biochar, 30 % to displacement of fossil-fuel energy and 20 % to avoided emissions of CH4 and N2O. Their higher estimate assumes biomass crops could be grown on 380 Mha of abandoned and degraded cropland and pasture that has not subsequently been converted to urban land or forest. The lower estimate includes biochar produced from available wastes and residues, together with 10% of the technical potential for agroforestry and 50% of the technical potential for biomass crops. Biochar-enhanced productivity on cropland was estimated to contribute 33–59 Pg CO2 equivalent to the cumulative avoided emissions over 100 years, assuming these additional crop residues were converted to biochar. The findings of Woolf et al.12 have been misquoted due to the confusing units used, viz. ‘Pg CO2 −C equivalent’, which has been misinterpreted as Pg CO2 equivalent, leading some papers to report Woolf’s estimate of maximum mitigation potential as 1.8 Pg CO2 equivalent (e.g., Paustian et al.76; Werner et al.70; Dumortier et al.77).

The study by Woolf et al.12 has been widely recognised and utilised in subsequent studies. Reflecting its impact, seven of the 19 global studies we reviewed derived their estimates from Woolf et al.12 Smith64 selected components of the mitigation assessed by Woolf et al.12., excluding displaced fossil fuel emissions. The mitigation potentials estimated by Dickie et al.78, through biochar application to croplands were based on assumptions and methods of Woolf et al.12, but restricted feedstocks to residues only for 2030. Lehmann et al.79 revised the estimate of Woolf et al.12, using the same model over a timeframe of 100 years but with updated equations for biochar persistence, emissions reduction and negative priming. Other studies have modified the values of Woolf et al.12 For instance, Lal et al.80 stated that their estimate is based on the gross rate of C sequestration of 1.28 Pg C y−1 from Woolf et al.12 with ‘corrections for the energy used in pyrolysis … and in restoration of degraded lands’, but the justification and derivation of these adjustments was not provided.

Other studies provide estimates of biochar mitigation potential derived from a synthesis of studies that include Woolf et al.12 and its derivates. For instance, Fuss et al.75 based their estimate on Woolf et al.12, Paustian et al.76, Lee and Day81, Roberts et al.72, Lomax et al.82, Pratt and Moran71, Griscom et al.68, Powell and Lenton67, and Smith64, deriving an ‘authors’ assessment’ of sustainable potential. Roe et al.74 reviewed largely the same range of studies, adding Fuss et al.75, and classified them as technical, sustainable or economic potentials (Fig. 2).

Besides Woolf et al.12, we have identified five independent groups of analyses to date. Three were published in 2010 and reported economic potential71,72 or technical potential73. The economic potential was derived either from bottom-up analysis of the costs and abatement potentials from large-scale and stove/kiln scale biochar projects for 2030 in developed and developing regions, respectively71, or LCA of a biochar system using only corn stover as feedstock72, producing estimates of 0.65 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 72 to 1.24 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 71. For the technical potential, Lenton73 estimated global CDR potential for 2050 through biochar produced from shifting cultivation biomass to be 0.9–1.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, based on shifting cultivation fires in 2010, that is, a narrow choice of feedstock and land use system. Lenton subsequently investigated the mitigation potential of biochar from biomass residues and included avoided N2O emissions from soil and bioenergy alongside CDR67, then collated values from several studies to estimate CDR through biochar systems at 2.75-4.95 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−183.

The fourth independent group is based on Griscom et al.68 who included biochar in their seminal review of ‘natural climate solutions’. They estimated the cost-effective (marginal abatement cost <100 USD tCO2 equivalent) CDR potential of biochar systems to be 0.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 and a ‘maximum potential with [environmental and social] safeguards’ (equivalent to sustainable potential in this review) of 1.1 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 in 2030. The potential is calculated based on unused crop residue only, from assessments of sustainable supply of biomass for bioenergy in 2030, biochar C persisting in soil for >100 years and excluding reduced or avoided emissions. Subsequently, Bossio et al.13 presented the estimate from Griscom et al.68, unchanged, in their review of soil-based natural climate solutions, while Mayer et al.84 averaged the values from Griscom et al.68 and Woolf et al.12, for CDR only for 2100. Roe et al.56 expanded the analysis from Griscom et al.68 using bottom-up estimates of available crop residues, based on FAOSTAT data, and including avoided fossil fuel and soil N2O and CH4 emissions in their estimate of global mitigation potential.

The fifth independent group is based on Werner et al.70 who considered the total demand for CDR until 2100 and assessed how this could be provided by biochar, utilising purpose-grown feedstocks (woody and grass crops), modelled using the process-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJmL). This demand-driven approach differs from most biochar potential studies that applied a supply-driven approach based on feedstock availability. The authors assessed a ‘basic biochar’ scenario (technical potential of biochar CDR) at the lower end of the negative emission demand up to year 2100, of 100 Pg C, which will deliver annual CDR of 4.58 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. However, this scenario would require land comparable to the area used for wheat production. The same authors65 then took a supply-driven approach to estimate sustainable CDR through biochar, again using LPJmL to model biomass production of purpose-grown crops in the tropics and subtropics, but constraining biomass crops such that no additional cropland was required and calorie production was maintained. They estimated sustainable CDR potential through biochar of 0.44 to 2.62 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, depending on the assumed yield response to biochar.

Our review reveals a wide range of estimates of biochar potential, from 0.03 to 11 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, with divergence largely due to differences in scope and assumed feedstock availability. Unsurprisingly, studies that limit feedstock to biomass residues and wastes, and consider CDR only, generally reach lower estimates than those that include purpose-grown biomass crops, and consider avoided or reduced GHG emissions in addition to CDR. Of the 19 studies reviewed, five are independent analyses, and while seven relied on the original study by Woolf et al.12, sometimes misquoted, misinterpreted or selectively extracted. The three most recent independent assessments56,65,79 estimate sustainable CDR potential at around 2.7 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 and total mitigation, including reduced and avoided emissions of up to 10.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. Thus, it is clear that biochar systems have substantial potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, including the vital challenge of CDR. Policy-makers should assess the barriers to adoption and upscaling of biochar in their jurisdictions, and introduce measures to facilitate biochar expansion, as part of their portfolio of mitigation strategies.

Most assessments reviewed have included only a subset of the mitigation contributions that can be delivered through biochar systems, with major emphasis on CDR. There is a clear need for new comprehensive assessments of global mitigation potential of biochar systems, that quantify reduced and avoided emissions as well as the CDR contribution to mitigation, incorporating the latest understanding of biochar persistence and impacts on GHG fluxes.

The potential for synergies rather than trade-offs between C sequestration and mitigation of non-CO2 GHG emissions make biochar preferable to other soil amendments and soil C sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy45. Future studies should simultaneously quantify the soil CH4 and N2O emissions and changes in soil organic C stocks due to priming, to represent the full impact of biochar systems on net GHG balance, and compare biochar with alternative organic amendments. However, there are challenges and obstacles for including these factors in global-scale assessments. As discussed in ‘Emissions reduction—non-CO2 GHG from soil and composting’, soil GHG emissions and priming are strongly influenced by soil types and environmental parameters, that widely differ around the globe. The value of applying mean values from meta-analyses is questionable. A granular approach to estimation of soil GHG emissions would require data on soil types and environmental factors to be collected or simulated in a consistent way at a global scale. Furthermore, long-term studies that simultaneously monitor changes in soil organic C stocks and effects on N2O emissions are needed, to inform estimates of mitigation potential.

To enable comprehensive holistic assessment, biochar should be included in the process-based IAMs85 that are used in scenario analyses to investigate global mitigation pathways, to inform climate policy development. Most pathways that limit global warming to less than 2 °C include large areas of biomass crops for bioenergy, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)2, because most IAM studies currently rely on CDR through BECCS and afforestation/reforestation to meet temperature targets86. The land allocated to bioenergy crops could potentially be used instead to grow biomass for biochar. To date, very few IAM studies have included biochar, but one recent study using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) found that global CO2 removals from biochar reach 0.2–0.3 Pg CO2 yr−1 in scenarios that limit warming to below 1.5 °C in 210087. Inclusion of biochar in IAMs will enable estimates of global mitigation potential that take into consideration competing land uses, impacts on food production and energy systems from the production of biomass for pyrolysis and utilisation of biochar as a soil amendment, and influences of carbon markets. Inclusion in IAMs will also facilitate comparison between alternative mitigation strategies, particularly between the use of biomass for biochar and for bioenergy and BECCS, as demonstrated by Fuhrman et al.87 The competition for biomass, land and financial resources between alternative mitigation strategies is likely to have a large impact on mitigation realised through biochar systems.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02228-x/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2228_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-04-04 01:56:50.334655

The warning comes after some airlines raised concerns in March about the slow production of the greener sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
“Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero by 2050, but this is a massive transition - one that airlines cannot accomplish alone,” an IATA spokesperson told Skift.
“Despite their pledges, major fuel producers have either stalled or abandoned investments in renewable fuel production, the IATA spokesperson said.
Slow Delivery of Newer and Greener Aircraft IATA pointed to another major hurdle: the slow delivery of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents most global airlines, told Skift that reaching “net zero” emissions by 2050 remains the goal, despite warnings on Wednesday that the targets may have to be delayed.

However, IATA warned that the sector is struggling to meet the target.

The warning comes after some airlines raised concerns in March about the slow production of the greener sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Without it, they say, they can’t meet their emissions targets.

“Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero by 2050, but this is a massive transition - one that airlines cannot accomplish alone,” an IATA spokesperson told Skift. “Unfortunately, we are being let down. Governments have failed to provide the necessary policy support and financial backing to scale up SAF production, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded.”

On Wednesday, Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general and former CEO of British Airways, said the sector is falling behind.

“We’re going to have to reevaluate the commitment to net zero in 2050 because we’re just not getting the support that airlines require,” he told Reuters.

IATA also blamed fuel producers and aircraft manufacturers for the slow progress.

“Despite their pledges, major fuel producers have either stalled or abandoned investments in renewable fuel production, the IATA spokesperson said.

The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, which represents most of the world's oil and gas companies, did not respond to Skift’s request for comment.

“Fuel companies are working hard to supply their obligations to meet the targets. We believe that the targets are realistic and can be met,” Fuel Industry UK, which represents major oilers such as BP and ExxonMobil, previously told Skift.

Slow Delivery of Newer and Greener Aircraft

IATA pointed to another major hurdle: the slow delivery of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.

These planes are estimated to be up to 20% more fuel efficient than older models. That could reduce emissions by the same amount.

“Manufacturers have struggled with supply chain and product issues, failing to deliver the aircraft airlines have ordered,” the IATA spokesperson said.

As of February, Airbus reported a backlog of 8,652 planes, while Boeing had 6,197, according to Forecast International.

The Aerospace Industries Association, which represents Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers, said the airline industry and other stakeholders need to recognize how complicated it is to build aircraft.

“We urge all stakeholders to recognize the complexity of meeting and exceeding the stringent safety requirements of the global aerospace industry, maximizing efficiencies, while also facing complex regulatory requirements, global economic headwinds, and ongoing supply chain challenges as airlines update their fleets,” Di Reimold, AIA’s Vice President of Civil Aviation, told Skift.

“AIA members prioritize the role of new aircraft in achieving long-term goals, with each generation of aircraft featuring state-of-the-art technologies, including engines that burn 15-20% less fuel than their predecessors. We are working towards a future that addresses demand in the most cost-efficient way possible.”

Many governments around the world say they are working to improve the production of SAF. The European Union has a policy to increase the production of SAF.

“The focus is now on their implementation, and we will offer support where needed. We will later this year present a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, which will also include aviation fuels,” an EU spokesperson told Skift.

Countries such as the United States, China, and the UK have also previously announced plans to support the production of SAF.

The meeting was held on Wednesday, April 2, at JB’s Sports Bar and Grill with many members from the community attending.

Updates on the highly anticipated DG Fuels sustainable aviation fuel plant, announced last fall, drew plenty of interest from the community. Julie Bushell, founder and CEO of Global Sustainability Developers (GSD), LLC, was the keynote speaker. GSD works with rural communities to bring in profitable projects through the Nebraska BioEconomy Initiative. Bushell has been heavily involved with PCDC and DG Fuels as the wait for the sustainable aviation fuel plant inches closer. Bushell spoke about her connection to rural communities and belief in bioeconomy’s future in strengthening the United States as a whole.

When DG Fuels announced their plans to build a plant in Phelps County, their initial investment was $5.5 billion. They have increased their total investment to $7 billion, a welcoming piece of news for the Phelps County economy. In addition to the increased investment, DG Fuels will also be giving farmers more opportunities to be a part of the plant’s operations. The plant will convert corn stover into sustainable aviation fuel, and farmers were already going to be able to sell the by-product to DG Fuels. The new financial opportunities for area farmers will come in the form of corn stover transportation and storage.

Another new development that was brought up was the implementation of an aquafer impact study. The study, led by Tri-Basin NRD, will research the potential impact the DG Fuel plant could have on the area’s groundwater.

Reducing the number of trips across the field, implementing minimal or no-till farming, and utilizing cover crops can significantly lower the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of corn used for SAF.

Justin Rahn, an Illinois corn farmer, recently went to the SAF conference, Illinois Future of Fuels: Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference, held by Illinois Manufacturers’ Association (IMA). Rahn spoke on a panel during this conference to talk about the conservation practices he partakes in and how they affect his farm. Attendees unfamiliar with farming practices were able to ask him questions about sustainable practices and learn their impacts directly from a farmer.

Reducing Carbon Intensity with Conservation Practices

""Fewer trips across the field, minimal tilling, and cover crops help reduce carbon emissions,"" Rahn explained. Some cover crops contribute by putting carbon directly into the soil, further improving sustainability by using crops as opposed to machines to implement carbon into the soil.

Precision Conservation Management Data Collection

Due to the requirements of SAF, farmers will need to track their conservation practices to have the opportunity to sell to SAF markets. ""I work with PCM [Precision Conservation Management], who collects and tracks everything I do on my farm. They meet with me twice a year to record what I planted, how much fertilizer I used, how many passes I made, and what inputs were applied to my fields. At the end of harvest, they track my yields, moisture levels, and transportation distances,"" Rahn shared.shared.

This data provides insights to farmers on the effectiveness of conservation practices and makes it easier for farmers to sell to SAF markets. These practices can be of great use to farmers, but they do come with challenges.

Challenges in Conservation

Farmers face several challenges when integrating conservation practices into their operations. ""Terminating cover crops at the right time can be difficult, especially when the weather doesn’t cooperate. Germination and growth in fall can be a struggle, particularly in dry soil conditions,"" Rahn explained.

Another issue is the high costs of using cover crops and the need for financial incentives. ""We need to be paid more for what we’re doing—cover crops cost money, and farmers need support to make it work,” Rahn expresses. He goes on to address that the companies who need the ethanol for SAF should be the ones to provide those incentives.

For conservation practices to be used by more farmers, they must have incentives. ""There is an incentive if the premium is high enough,"" Rahn stated. However, some farmers still rely on conventional methods like chisel plowing to manage soil compaction, highlighting the need for a balance between profitability and sustainability.

Advice for Farmers

For those considering conservation practices, Rahn suggests the best approach is to start small. ""Try it on a small scale first and work your way into it. Maybe start with half a field or one field before expanding,"" suggested Rahn. Proper care is essential to making cover crops effective, and smaller-scale experimenting can help determine what works best for individual operations.",https://www.ilcorn.org/image/3503/1000/IMA+SAS+031325-116_crop_796_354.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 20:57:00.980754

Motley Fool UK 2025","Cheap shares can power our portfolios forward. So, let’s have a look at two companies that could be fundamentally undervalued by the market and may experience supportive trends from the emerging macroeconomic environment.

Pawn shops

EZCORP (NASDAQ:EZPW) could be an intriguing investment opportunity. The company operates in the pawn industry, which typically performs well during economic uncertainty.

With Trump’s tariffs and recession risks potentially growing, demand for pawn services may rise as consumers seek alternative financing options. EZCORP’s strong fiscal 2024 performance, including record revenues and a 20% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), highlights its resilience and growth potential.

The stock appears to be priced attractively, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.7 times for 2024, dropping to an estimated 9.2 times by 2028. This is significantly lower than the index average, suggesting undervaluation.

In line with this, consensus EPS growth rates are solid, with a projected increase of 15.62% by September 2025 and steady growth thereafter. The company’s expansion into Latin America also provides diversification and growth opportunities.

However, like any investment, risks remain. EZCORP has a high net debt position, with $569.3m in total debt against $174.51m in cash. This leverage could limit financial flexibility.

For patient investors, EZCORP may offer a compelling mix of value and growth, especially during economic turbulence. It’s actually a stock I’ve recently added to my portfolio.

A cheap European airline

I keep banging on about Jet2 (LSE:JET2) at the moment. But I’m a big fan of the stock. It’s currently trading at an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortisation) ratio of 0.85, with some of its peers trading at a 400% premium to this. It’s got a lot of cash — £2.3bn in net cash — providing financial flexibility.

Of course, there are risks. The company faces rising costs, including higher wages, National Insurance contributions, and sustainable aviation fuel mandates, which could pressure margins. However, I’m willing to overlook some of these due to its incredibly strong relative valuation.

What’s more, I believe we may see some supportive trends in fuel prices. Aviation fuel typically represents around 25% of costs for airlines, and thankfully, fuel prices have retreated a lot from their highs. This impacts lower margin airlines and tour operators like Jet2 more than others. Brent crude prices sank after Trump’s tariffs. This may boost earnings slightly through the coming quarters — although the company does hedge this cost, like its peers.

Investors will want to keep an eye on its fleet transformation programme. Jet2 has committed to replacing older aircraft with up to 146 Airbus A321neo planes. This will offer increased operational efficiency. What’s more, the business plans to maintain annual capital expenditure at £833m. As a ratio, this sits below industry averages.

It’s a stock I’ve been topping up on. It might be low on momentum, but it’s my favourite UK stock right now.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

AVIATION

Turbulence – Global airlines have issued their strongest warning yet that the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is in jeopardy, with the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Willie Walsh, criticising other parts of the aviation sector and oil companies for failing to meet their commitments. Walsh said airline leaders are increasingly frustrated that the burden of decarbonisation is falling disproportionately on carriers, while others – such as airports, aircraft manufacturers, energy firms, and air traffic control – are not pulling their weight. He warned that pressure is growing to reassess the 2050 target if broader support does not materialise. Although IATA does not currently plan to revisit the target formally, Walsh acknowledged that calls to do so may arise at its upcoming annual meeting in June. He noted that the original commitment was based on the assumption that all stakeholders would contribute fairly. Airports and aerospace groups pushed back on Walsh’s remarks, with ACI Europe claiming airports are already doing more than their share, and manufacturers citing supply chain problems as a barrier. Walsh also criticised the long-delayed reform of European airspace and warned against allowing others to benefit reputationally from airlines’ efforts without matching their commitment. (Reuters)

The realisation of the bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) Stockholm project by way of Stockholm Exergi is an important step towards unlocking this potential, according to Bellona. First-mover projects like Northern Lights and Stockholm Exergi’s carbon capture operation are key for climate tech development, serving as proof of the economic, and operational viability of capturing, transporting, and sequestering CO2, and helping building confidence across emitters, investors, regulators, and the public.

State aid – The EU Commission has approved a €380 mln French scheme to support the production of renewable energy and decarbonisation equipment. The measure will back the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps, electrolysers, and equipment for carbon capture usage and storage, as well as for the production of their key components and the production or recovery of related critical raw materials. The aid will take the form of direct grants and repayable advances, until no later than Dec. 31, 2025.

Tax it higher – The OECD has called for higher carbon taxes, particularly on natural gas, in Israel, as well as more stringent green building codes and the potential of taxing carbon-emitting building materials. The report published Wednesday noted that Israel’s power generation uses the highest percentage of fossil fuels in the OECD, and said emissions from this sector are “strongly underpriced by international standards”. Only a tenth of these carbon emissions in 2021 were taxed at over €60/t, the price estimated as necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and a mid-range benchmark of current carbon costs in the OECD. Current carbon tax rates in Israel are too low, particularly on natural gas, where only a gradual increase to €18/t is planned by 2030, it said. Taxing natural gas at a rate consistent with other carbon sources will avoid over-investing in natural gas-based power generation, the OECD noted. (Times of Israel)

UK maritime emissions – The UK’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC), backed by £30 mln in its latest round, is inviting bids from UK-based organisations to develop low-emission maritime technologies. Applications are open until Apr. 16. The programme, delivered by Innovate UK for the Department for Transport’s UK SHORE initiative, supports innovation in areas such as alternative fuels, electrification, and green shipping corridors. Recent projects include the integration of a 20-metre autonomous wing sail on the UK-flagged Pacific Grebe aimed at reducing fuel use and CO₂ emissions.

ASIA PACIFIC

Electrifying – An Australian Coalition-led senate committee has published a report calling on federal and state governments to work together to promote and coordinate the update of home electrification, Renew Economy reports. The report finds that residential electrification is a significant measure for achieving better energy outcomes in Australia, which could help boost household energy efficiency and contribute to achieving emissions reduction targets. However, the report argued that it was important consumers be given “genuine choice” about the electrification upgrades they could make, which noted the need to maintain social licence in the shift to net zero emissions.

City-to-city partnerships – Japan’s environment ministry has selected 20 projects for its low-carbon city development programme, where Japanese local governments use technology and know-how to support decarbonisation in developing countries, according to a notice released this week. The implementation of the programme is conditional on the final FY2025 budget. To date, around 30 environmental infrastructure projects have been further realised through the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), based on the results of the city-to-city collaboration projects.

Renewables to gas switch – Australia’s Northern Territory has cancelled its 50% renewable energy plan, which the Country Liberal Party – who are conservatives – initially supported when they were in opposition. The target date was 2030. The nation has an 82% renewable target by the same date, which was legislated by Canberra after Labor took office in 2022. However, the ABC reported that the government has scrapped the plan after revealing it would cost A$5 billion ($3.14) when the NT has A$11 bln in net debt and the target is only 20% met. Instead, the party plans to use gas to meet generation needs. The A$5 bln figure has been disputed.

Offshore wind buy in – Japan’s Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) has invested in a Taiwanese offshore wind service company via a new share issue. NYK said Wednesday it had bought into IOG, which provides support such as marine survey, construction support and vessel chartering, at the end of last month. The two hope to work together on Japan’s offshore wind sector. The nation has little installed capacity but great potential.

Solar gold – AngloGold Ashanti will cut 65,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions from its Safeguard Mechanism-covered Tropicana gold mine in the West Australian outback via a 61 megawatt solar-wind power station. It will cut gas and diesel use by a reported 50% and 96%, respectively. When the gas system is incorporated, the mine’s total capacity is 115 MW. It was installed by remote power specialist Pacific Energy.

‘Neutered’ NVES – Australia’s conservative Coalition plans to drop fines from the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES) if it wins the May 3 election. This means car companies that breach emissions standards won’t face fines, infuriating environmentalist groups like Greenpeace which suggested the move would “neuter” the NVES and allow car importers to send their most polluting cars to Australia, a nation that is heavily car dependent. Criticism of the NVES is that it will drive up car prices.

AMERICAS

Rules rolled back – The US DOE rescinded a 2023 policy on Tuesday that imposed stricter conditions on LNG exporters seeking to extend their commencement deadlines for approved projects. The now-withdrawn policy required projects to be under construction and to prove delays were due to factors beyond their control before an extension would be considered. With the change, the DOE will return to a case-by-case review process for such requests.

Transportation talk – At a US Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works (EPW) hearing Wednesday, Sean Duffy, head of the Department of Transportation (DOT), fielded questions from both sides of the political aisle as lawmakers prepare to begin efforts to prepare the next Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill, which provides federal funding for transportation. During the hearing, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) said permitting reform for transportation projects should ensure protection against climate-related lawsuits from left-leaning and environmental groups to fulfil President Donald Trump’s day one executive order on unleashing American energy, while Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) questioned Duffy on the potential of efforts to scrub away a focus on climate to add bureaucracy to transportation projects and Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) said she hopes grants for sustainability mobility are not put under the chopping block. Secretary Duffy said the department would focus on developing projects faster while still protecting the environment. Earlier this year, the DOT dropped its defence of Biden-era highway emissions rules after Duffy announced he would rescind the regulations.

Nuclear option – Colorado Governor Jared Polis (D) signed House Bill 25-1040 (HB 25-1040) on Monday, which defines nuclear as a clean energy source, a status that determines which energy projects are eligible for clean energy project financing at the county and city level. This definition also dictates which energy resources may be used by a qualifying retail utility to meet the state’s 2050 clean energy targets.

Blending battle – A coalition of US oil and biofuel industry groups met with the US EPA on Tuesday to advocate for higher federal biomass diesel blending mandates, proposing an increase to between 5.5 and 5.75 bln gallons from 3.35 bln, Reuters reported. The meeting was seen as a potential step toward the EPA releasing updated Renewable Fuel Standard quotas, expected to cover two years. The group has agreed on maintaining corn-based ethanol mandates at 15 bln gallons. However, internal divisions have emerged, with groups such as the Fueling American Jobs Coalition opposing the proposed increases. The EPA has not commented on the matter.

Biodiesel boost – Illinois increased its required biodiesel blend to B17 from B14 on Tuesday, as part of a 2022 bipartisan law aimed at promoting cleaner fuel use. The law raises the minimum blend level eligible for a tax exemption, meaning 17% of each gallon of eligible diesel fuel must come from biodiesel, largely derived from soybean oil. The Illinois Soybean Association, which represents over 43,000 farmers, supported the measure, citing benefits for energy security, rural economies, and emissions reductions. In 2026, the blend requirement will rise further to B20. The initiative is backed by lawmakers from both parties and Gov. Pritzker (D).

Ferry good news – New York City has begun transitioning its ferry fleet to renewable diesel as part of a broader effort to reduce GHG emissions from municipal vessels. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services awarded the first tender for renewable diesel (RD) fuel, following an Oct. 2024 announcement to convert the Staten Island Ferry and other city ships. The initiative includes testing the fuel on the Marchi Staten Island Ferry and aims to replace ultra-low sulfur diesel with R99 RD, which does not require engine modifications. Additional plans include retrofitting 13 large NYC Ferry vessels to meet US EPA Tier 4 emissions standards. The city is also considering the feasibility of achieving zero-emission port operations by 2040.

See you in 2026 – A lawsuit led by trade group US Chamber of Commerce against California’s state climate disclosure laws could see trial in Nov. 2026, if a summary judgement is not made before then, according to docket filings. Both parties agreed that the case is “likely amenable to resolution” by summary judgement. However, if the court sees it necessary to put a trial date on calendar, they estimate the trial will last between 5-10 court days in Nov. 2026. Discovery will close in Feb. 2026, followed by a series of expert reports and discovery through Mar. 2026.

Disclosure deficit – A new analysis published Wednesday by the Governance and Accountability Institute, along with Ceres, Carbon Accountable, and Persefoni, argues that most of California’s top state suppliers are not currently disclosing key climate-related information, raising concerns about readiness for proposed legislation. The research comes as California introduces Senate Bill 755, which would require suppliers with more than $25 mln in state contracts to report climate-related financial risks and full-scope GHG emissions, and those with $5 to $25 mln in contracts to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The report suggests that mandated reporting could significantly improve transparency.

Biochar win – San Francisco-based climate strategy consultancy 3Degrees has listed the first biochar project on the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) registry. The project, by Arizona-based project developer, Southwest Biochar, scaled commercially in January.

Electric evolution – Conagra Brands, a major North American packaged food company, has signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with Bloom Energy, a provider of solid oxide fuel cell technology, to install about 6 MW of fuel cells at its Troy and Archbold, Ohio production sites. The combustion-free system is expected to supply 70-75% of the electricity needs at both facilities and reduce their GHG emissions by 19%.

AI, carbon collide – GEP Software, an AI firm out of New Jersey, is expanding its partnership with carbon disclosure platform, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The company said it would provide clients with real-time, data driven insights to track emissions with CPD’s comprehensive emissions database.

Agricultural aspirations – Brazilian grain and fibre company Amaggi and Anglo-Brazilian climate tech firm NaturAll Carbon announced Wednesday a joint renewable agriculture carbon credit project in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. The project will be developed in an area of 25,000 hectares, and is expected to be certified by Verra’s VM0042 methodology, the partners said. The project aims to develop CDR credits starting from a baseline comprised of degraded pastures and conventionally managed crops and regenerative practices such as the no-till system, crop rotation, and the use of cover crops. In March, the government of Rondonia signed an agreement with Portuguese technology organisation the Center for Engineering and Product Development (CEiiA) to map carbon stock in forest and rural prosperities in the state.

Comments welcome – Brazilian standard Tero Carbon opened public consultation on Version 2.0 of its carbon credit certification, methodology, and assets programmes, it announced Monday. The company said technical enhancements in Version 2.0 include some related to risk management, socio-environmental safeguards, risk mitigation flexibility, and software approval. VCM stakeholders can submit comments until Apr. 30. Earlier this month, Tero Carbon signed an MoU with Buenos Aires-based carbon project development platform and marketplace Forestblock to expand its foothold in Latin America, with an initial focus on Brazil and Argentina.

Come together – In Para, Brazil, State Secretary of Environment and Sustainability Raul Protazio Romao from the Semas agency met on Monday with State Attorney General Cesar Mattar Jr at the headquarters of the State Public Prosecutor’s Office (MPPA) to discuss Para’s jurisdictional REDD+ (J-REDD) programme (Agencia Para). The purpose of this visit was reportedly to “reinforce dialogue on the process”. Para’s high-profile J-REDD initiative, which is still under development, has been an ongoing point of contention between the two agencies. The J-REDD programme grabbed headlines in Sep. 2024 when Governor Helder Barbalho announced a R$1 bln ($180 mln) offtake deal with the LEAF Coalition public-private buyers’ club. This deal promptly provoked the ire of the MPPA, as well as the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office, on the grounds that there was insufficient transparency and public consultation with local stakeholders prior to signing the deal. The two penned a joint letter to Semas stating as much and demanding that SEMAS take steps to ensure that the deal align with a list of four legal requirements.

The one and only – The first auction for the Triunfo do Xingu concession in Para, Brazil concluded on Friday with only one bidder. Previously, Folha de Sao Paulo reported that some of Brazil’s largest project developers did not plan to participate, citing operational difficulties as the main factor in the companies’ withdrawal as well as a perceived lack of flexibility by the Para government. Systemica, a company with a minority stake in BTG Pactual Bank, won concession at the auction held by the B3 stock exchange (Diario do Para). Systemica’s competitor, Genuino Reflorestamento, was disqualified because it did not present all the required documentation and did not prove the legitimacy of its legal representative, according to text in the Official Gazette of Para. The Triunfo do Xingu restoration concession, valid for up to 40 years, is expected to generate R$1.2 bln ($214 mln) over the course of the contract but would also require an estimated investment of R$250 mln. Para has furthermore estimated that the winner of the bid would need to invest R$76 mln for the first seven years of the project until credit revenues are expected to become available in 2032.

Deadline for applications is Apr. 18. Winning teams will receive expert support from its climate team and they’re particularly looking for new projects that aren’t yet operational and haven’t already signed major offtakes. Apply here.

Carbon ratings transition – A transition study by carbon ratings agency BeZero found that 88% out of 379 carbon projects retained the same rating over the 2024 calendar year. Of the remainder, 3% (10 projects) were upgraded and 9% (33) were downgraded. Rating movements were minor, with most changes limited to a single notch and none exceeding two, according to the analysis. The ratings demonstrated a high degree of stability and low volatility, with figures broadly in line with one-year transition rates seen in financial sector credit ratings, BeZero said.

Gold star – Peer-reviewed research published last week by academics at the University of Toronto – Mississauga has analysed 675 VCM projects to isolate key determinants of a positive ‘gender inclusion scale’ score. These indicators include Gold Standard certification, recent vintage, household devices or carbon removal project types, and African or South American geographies. According to the study’s authors, the importance of embedding gender equality in the VCM is gaining recognition, but gender impacts are still not well understood because research typically studies specific projects or standards. To improve the baseline level of gender inclusion, the researchers proposed mandatory disclosure of gender impacts and collaboration with women-focused NGOs or local governments.

Fairmat funding – French startup Fairmat has raised €51.5 mln in a Series B funding round to accelerate the industrialisation of its next-generation carbon composite recycling materials and expand internationally. The round consists of €26.5 mln in equity and €25 mln in venture debt from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The round is led by Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund and Slate VC, with additional participation from Cape Capital and long-term investors Singular, Temasek, CNP, and Pictet Group. The additional funding should help the company scale its industrial operations and strengthen its US presence where demand for sustainable materials is growing. (Tech Funding News)

AND FINALLY…

Smart business – CEOs with high academic qualifications are more likely to pursue corporate decarbonisation than those who are lower qualified or educated, according to research by Durham University Business School. The study investigated company governance data between 2000 and 2021, as well as financial data, greenhouse gas emissions and the level of CEO compensation, and found that not only is education a key factor, but also that having board members from different countries and of different ages encourages CEOs to clamp down on carbon emissions more quickly. “The more power a CEO holds the more likely they are to tackle carbon emissions,” the study added. And it isn’t just knowledge or awareness, the researchers said: “CEOs with strong power over their organisations were focused on reducing carbon emissions due to the fact that their financial remuneration is closely linked to company performance.”",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-04-03 13:56:35.633568

Industry progress depends on policy shifts—governments must redirect fossil fuel subsidies to renewables.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has officially launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry under the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). This critical platform aims to drive the aviation industry toward net zero emissions by 2050.

The SAF Registry creates a verifiable, transparent market for sustainable fuel, ensuring airlines, corporate buyers, and regulators can accurately record and claim SAF transactions.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort. In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders. It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The Registry safeguards against double counting by recording environmental attributes of SAF purchases immutably. This step builds the foundation for a transparent and liquid global SAF market.

However, Thomsen stresses that the Registry alone cannot drive the SAF market forward without policy support.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay.”

This move marks a significant step toward advancing cleaner energy alternatives in the aviation sector. The company’s president, Ricardo Roa, disclosed the plans on Wednesday, emphasizing Ecopetrol’s commitment to sustainability and energy transition.

The SAF plant will be built at the Barrancabermeja refinery, one of Colombia’s key refining hubs. The project is expected to enter its development phase between late 2024 and early 2025. Roa stated that the plant is projected to begin operations by 2030, with an estimated production capacity of approximately 6,000 barrels of SAF per day. This development aligns with the global push for sustainable aviation solutions as the industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint and dependency on conventional fossil fuels.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is considered a crucial alternative to traditional jet fuel, as it significantly lowers greenhouse gas emissions. The production of SAF involves the use of renewable resources such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and other bio-based feedstocks. By investing in this technology, Ecopetrol aims to support Colombia’s broader sustainability goals while also contributing to global efforts in mitigating climate change.

The company has allocated an overall investment budget of $5.9 billion to $6.8 billion for 2024. A significant portion of this funding will be directed toward projects that align with energy transition strategies, including the SAF initiative. Ecopetrol plans to finance these investments primarily through its own cash reserves, which stood at $4.4 billion at the end of 2024.

Ecopetrol’s investment in SAF production positions Colombia as a key player in the development of alternative aviation fuels in Latin America. With increasing global demand for cleaner fuel options, the new plant could open opportunities for both domestic use and potential exports in the future. Additionally, the project aligns with international aviation policies that aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

By taking this initiative, Ecopetrol is not only reinforcing its role as a leader in Colombia’s energy sector but also demonstrating its commitment to adopting sustainable practices that align with the evolving demands of the global energy market.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) officially launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, which is now operational under the management of the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO).

The registry serves as a unified global system that allows airlines, fuel producers, corporate customers, and regulators to record and trace Sustainable Aviation Fuel transactions in a transparent and standardized manner. By connecting various players in the SAF value chain, the registry aims to support the development of a scalable and credible SAF market across the globe.

The system addresses one of the key challenges in aviation decarbonization: limited SAF availability. Currently produced in just a few locations, SAF has been difficult for many airlines to access. The registry bridges this gap by allowing environmental attributes of SAF to be recorded digitally and claimed, regardless of where the fuel is physically used. This gives all airlines equal access to SAF credits and ensures proper accounting for emissions reductions.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, emphasized the registry’s importance: “It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting.”

The SAF Registry is supported by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, which provides a harmonized framework for tracking environmental benefits. It is both feedstock and technology neutral, encouraging innovation and diversity in SAF production. It also allows for global harmonization while adapting to region-specific regulations, ensuring compatibility with national and international frameworks.

Over 30 early users are currently onboarding, including airlines, regulatory bodies, travel management firms, and fuel suppliers. By using this centralized platform, these stakeholders can avoid fragmentation in emissions reporting and create a more reliable structure for managing SAF transactions. Corporate customers also benefit by being able to fund and track in-sector emissions reductions as part of their sustainability goals.

The registry will remain free for participants until April 2027, after which it will operate on a cost-recovery basis. This initial free access period is designed to encourage adoption and establish a wide base of users across the industry.

Responsibility for the registry now rests with CADO, a not-for-profit organization founded in March 2025. Based in Montreal and created under Canadian law, CADO was established to maintain and operate the IATA-developed platform. IATA remains involved, providing ongoing technical and operational support to ensure smooth functionality and continued evolution of the registry.

CADO’s membership is open to all stakeholders in the SAF value chain, including fuel producers, airline associations, airport operators, and government agencies. With its neutral governance model and collaborative approach, CADO is expected to play a central role in the long-term development of a transparent and competitive SAF market.

The SAF Registry marks a pivotal advancement in aviation’s sustainability journey. While it is not a silver bullet, it provides the foundation for a global market in which SAF transactions can be verified, credited, and scaled. As the industry works toward climate goals, platforms like this are essential tools that bring structure, trust, and coordination to complex international systems.

As aviation continues to expand its environmental responsibilities, the global launch of the SAF Registry may signal the beginning of a new chapter in how airlines and their partners approach sustainability in the sky.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/airbus-a350-sustainable-aviation-fuel-saf-2025.webp,N,,2025-04-03 11:56:52.078718

Sao Paulo, 2 April (Argus) — Brazil's aviation industry is keeping an eye on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) regulations as the domestic market awaits the kickoff of local production to comply with the planned blend mandate and with potential for exports. The fuels of the future law envisages raising biofuel mix standards to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in domestic flights over a 10-year period starting in 2027, as Brazil has committed to applying a 10pc SAF mandate by 2037. The country's efforts to implement a SAF mandate runs in tandem with the guidelines from UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) program, which oversees GHG reduction in international flights. The program set up two phases until reduction targets are fully implemented, so airlines and producers adapt to changes efficiently. Airlines can voluntarily adhere between 2024-2026, followed by global compulsory targets from 2027-2035, prompting SAF usage or carbon credits compensation. The mandatory phase embraces all international flights, including those from and to non-voluntary countries, except for so-called underdeveloped countries and those with a low share of global air traffic flows. Brazil's SAF is a newborn industry that holds potential for feedstock supply , mostly for its traditional production pathways using soybean oil, corn and sugarcane ethanol, as well as widespread agricultural lands engaged in biomass production without practicing land-use change. Its variability also allows new projects to reuse degraded lands and existing agricultural assets to comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sustainability criteria related to land-use and soil health enhancement. SAF input in Brazil faces economic hurdles as high market volatility weighs on long-term investments, says A&M Infra's management consultant Filipe Bonaldo. But he also says that the political agenda will not hinder the energy transition as has happened in the US under President Donald Trump, since Brazil's economy is heavily based on agriculture its regulatory processes spur optimism. As an agricultural powerhouse, Brazil offers low-cost production and multiple sources to provide demand, both internally and offshore. Brazil is the third largest global exporter in agriculture and livestock markets, leading soy, orange juice and beef markets globally, according to agriculture and livestock confederation CAN. Debut in Rio Brazilian fuel distributor Vibra is the first to offer SAF in Brazil, before the blend mandate comes into effect. The company imported 550,000l (16,000bl) of SAF produced with used-cooking oil (UCO) from the port of Antwerp, in the Netherlands, in January. The biofuel is available for customers at Vibra's facility at the Rio de Janeiro international airport after a 10-month logistics plan was concluded. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) has secured all processes of the plan, from the supply chain of the product to distribution. Vibra operates in more than 90 airports in Brazil and accounts for 60pc of national aviation market share through its sector subsidiary BR Aviation, said executive vice-president of operations Marcelo Bragança. Why it took so long? The sector has long had doubts over the technical feasibility of admitting the use of biofuels in aviation , especially from a security point of view, said Anac's head of the environment and energy transition Marcela Anselmi. The agency, along with oil and biofuels regulator ANP, follow international regulations for SAF as it requires a physical and chemical resemblance to current fossil aviation fuels to ensure flight operations security. It is still not possible to use 100pc of SAF in aircraft motors, said Anselmi. There is a 50pc mix limit that inhibits worldwide adherence as there are technical restrictions yet to overcome. Recent engagement in the energy transition agenda is promoting biomass supply for aviation, as well as road and marine modalities, requiring new production pathways. For example, ATJ uses ethanol to convert it into SAF, which can be expensive to install and implies high capital expenditure. In a global context, Brazil stands in the vanguard of the SAF agenda as Europe and the US have only deployed legislation related to output and consumption over the past two years, Anselmi pointed out. Meanwhile, South America's planned SAF production capacity may reach 1.1mn l/yr in 2030, according to EPE.

US oil, farm groups push EPA for steep biofuel mandate

New York, 1 April (Argus) — The American Petroleum Institute and biofuel-supporting groups told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials at a meeting today that the agency should sharply raise advanced biofuel blend mandates for 2026. The coalition told EPA that it supported a biomass-based diesel mandate next year of 5.25bn USG, up from 3.35bn USG this year, and a broader advanced biofuel mandate, including the cellulosic category, at 10bn Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits, up from 7.33bn RINs this year, according to three different groups that attended the meeting. Both mandates would be record highs for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Soybean oil futures and RIN credit prices have risen sharply over the past week on optimism that oil and biofuel interests were working to coordinate volume mandate requests for consideration by President Donald Trump's administration. The coalition is also pushing the agency to set a total conventional volume requirement at 25bn RINs, which would keep an implied mandate for corn ethanol flat at 15bn USG. Ethanol groups had previously eyed a mandate even higher, but limits on the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline make much more-stringent requirements a tough sell to oil refiners. The coalition provided no specific request for the cellulosic biofuel subcategory, where most credit generation comes from biogas. Credits in that category are more expensive, but price concerns have been less potent recently given an EPA proposal to lower previously set cellulosic obligations, signaling that future volume requirements can be cut, too. EPA is aiming to finalize new RFS volume mandates by the end of the year if not earlier, people familiar with the administration's thinking have said. EPA officials signaled at the meeting they were working urgently on the rulemaking. ""The agency is intent on getting the RFS program back on the statutory timeline for issuing renewable volume obligation rules,"" EPA said, declining to comment further on its plans for the rule. The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy credits from those who do. Under the program's unique nesting structure, credits from blending lower-carbon biofuels can be used to meet obligations for other program categories. One gallon of corn ethanol generates 1 RIN, but more energy-dense fuels earn more RIN credits per gallon. Some disagreements persist While groups at the meeting were aligned around high-level mandates, how administration officials and courts treat small refinery requests for exemptions from RFS requirements could undercut those targets. Groups present were broadly aligned on asking EPA not to grant widespread exemptions, though there is still disagreement in the industry about how best to account for exempted volumes when deciding requirements for other refiners. Groups present at the meeting today included the American Petroleum Institute and representatives of biofuel producers and crop feedstock suppliers. Some groups that previously engaged with the coalition's efforts to project unity to the Trump administration were not present. And some groups more historically skeptical of the RFS and more supportive of small refinery exemptions — including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — have not been closely involved. Fuel marketer groups notably did not attend the meeting after a representative sparred with others in the coalition at an American Petroleum Institute meeting last month. Some retail groups, including the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, instead sent a letter to EPA today arguing that the groups pushing steep volumes are discounting potential headwinds to the sector from new tax credit policy. Some of the groups advocating for higher biofuel volumes have pointed to high production capacity and feedstock availability, but have preferred to ignore thornier issues like tax credits, lobbyists say. ""An overly aggressive increase in advanced biofuel blending mandates under the RFS will be punitive for American consumers"" without extending a long-running $1/USG tax credit for biomass-based diesel blenders, the retailers' letter said. That incentive expired last year and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" credit, which offers subsidies to producers instead of blenders and throttles benefits based on carbon intensity. Generally lower credit values for biomass-based diesel — coupled with the US government's delays setting final regulations on qualifying for the credit — have spurred a sharp drop in biofuel production to start the year. Without a blenders credit, the RFS volume mandates pushed by some groups could increase retail diesel prices by 30¢/USG, the fuel marketers estimate, a potential political headache for a president that ran on curbing consumer costs. Other biofuel groups say that extending the credit would be an uphill battle this year, with some lawmakers and lobbyists instead focused on legislatively tweaking the 45Z incentive's rules to benefit crop feedstocks instead of reverting wholesale to the prior tax policy.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures. Industry participants said yesterday that the EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids, and Biomass Fuels is drafting implementing regulations that would include a two-and-a-half year pause to obligatory acceptance of ISCC EU certification for waste-based biofuels. ""This action is said to be subject to further legal scrutiny and will need approval by member states,"" the ISCC said. Currently, member states accept EU-recognised voluntary scheme certification as proof that fuel or feedstocks are compliant with the bloc's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria. Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap. The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels and would seriously jeopardise the ability of the obligated parties to comply with blending mandates,"" the ISCC said. The ISCC has been singled out in a discriminatory way and has supported European Commission and member states' investigations into alleged fraud, it said. ""We are more than surprised by this step […and] are unable to see the rationale of the planned measure, which seems ad hoc and baseless,"" it added. Secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) Xavier Noyon told Argus that, if confirmed, the suspension would affect thousands of operators. ""At this time, member states are refusing to comment, and we call on the commission to urgently clarify any decisions of this nature that are on the table,"" he said. The EBB published its own proposed revision to the RED implementing legislation last month, which expanded the supervisory power of member states over voluntary schemes and certification bodies. The European Commission confirmed that the committee met on 26 March to discuss sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, avoidance of double counting, and alleged fraud. ""We are still working on our examination of this alleged fraud in biodiesel imports from China,"" said commission energy spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. But the commission has not taken any decision yet and cannot allude to ""possible"" scenarios, she said.

This milestone will represent a complete transition from fossil fuel-powered equipment to electric alternatives for all baggage and ramp tractors, belt loaders, power stows, container loaders and aircraft tractors.

This transition will eliminate Air Canada’s use of fossil fuel equipment in these key GSE categories at this station.

This is a step forward toward achieving Air Canada’s climate-related ambition that sets out mid-term targets in support of its long-term aspirational goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Those mid-term targets are 20 percent GHG net reductions from its air operations and 30 percent GHG net reductions from its ground operations, both compared to a 2019 baseline, by 2030.

“The focus of Earth Month 2025 is renewable energy and with Québec’s renewable hydroelectric power, it is fitting that the city of Québec is our first fully electric capable station. This project demonstrates the successful collaboration between Air Canada and the YQB airport authority in developing the necessary charging infrastructure to support the transition to a zero direct emission electric GSE (eGSE) fleet powered by Québec’s renewable energy grid,” said Michael Rousseau, president and CEO at Air Canada.

“Achieving the clean energy transition for aviation will require collaboration and efforts from all stakeholders. We accept our role as Canada’s flag carrier, and acknowledge that aviation plays a critical role in global connectivity and socio-economic growth. We are committed to a coordinated approach for this long-term energy transition as we operate within an ecosystem of manufacturers, suppliers, airports, and governments, all of whom play an integral part in this important initiative,” Rousseau continued.

“The electrification of Air Canada’s ground operations at YQB represents a concrete and significant step in reducing the impact of airport ground activities on the environment. This project was made possible thanks to close collaboration between our teams, and is perfectly in line with our commitment to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations, as well as to provide the support and tools necessary for our airline partners to achieve their GHG reduction objectives. We are proud that YQB is the first Air Canada station to take this important step towards environmental sustainability,” said Stéphane Poirier, president and CEO of YQB.

“Québec City is delighted with this initiative, which makes our airport the first Air Canada station in the country to electrify its main ground support equipment. This transition testifies to the commitment of our institutions and companies to innovate while taking into account current and future energy concerns. We are proud to see YQB, a strategic hub, support the evolution of the air transport industry and actively participate in initiatives aimed at reducing our environmental footprint,” said Bruno Marchand, mayor of Québec City.

Over the last several years, Air Canada has been progressively retiring and replacing older fossil-fuel powered ground equipment across Canada with more efficient electric ground equipment.

The airline now has more than 900 pieces of eGSE equipment, representing 35 percent of the GSE fleet across all categories. Air Canada’s ground fleet includes proven electric alternatives that support operational efficiency and emissions reductions.

While some operations still require fossil-fuel powered equipment, Air Canada continues to work closely with the manufacturers to evaluate emerging technologies that come to market.

The new eGSEs are designed to reduce direct emissions compared to internal combustion engine GSEs. They are expected to lower maintenance and spare part costs, and eliminate direct fuel costs, contributing to overall cost savings for Air Canada

This is where the Open Fan comes in.
Ali pointed to two wind tunnel tests in particular that simulated the integration of the Open Fan and the wing.","Last week, Airbus hosted its third Summit in Toulouse, France, to share its latest progress for the future of flight through innovative design, advanced technologies, and novel engineering.

Key to this vision is the development of Open Fan engine architecture, which could help power a next-generation single aisle aircraft that might also incorporate foldable wings and hybrid electric batteries. During the Summit’s “Pioneering Technology for Future Aircraft” session, Mohamed Ali, senior vice president and chief technology and operations officer at GE Aerospace, joined Frank Haselbach, senior vice president of propulsion engineering at Airbus, to discuss how Open Fan technology could lead to a step change in fuel efficiency and durability in commercial aviation.

Ali pointed out that over the past 70 years, huge strides have been made in the efficiency of commercial jet engines. “If you reflect on it, our current newest engine at CFM, the CFM LEAP, is 15% better in fuel burn than its iconic predecessor, the CFM56 engine. And then the CFM56 on its own has been 15% to 20% better than its predecessor,” he said.

Yet for all of the improvements in engine design that have led to these reductions in fuel burn, the shape of the commercial jet engine has changed little. As Haselbach noted, the industry is at something of a crossroads. It can do something evolutionary by developing more ultra-high-bypass-ratio ducted engines. “Or we can actually look at something which is much more rewarding, much more challenging, much more revolutionary,” he said. “Which is Open Fan.”

What Is Open Fan?

Open Fan is a style of engine architecture that aims to provide the same level of safety, speed, noise, and power as current jet engines while delivering a significant reduction in fuel usage and carbon emissions. How will it do this? By shedding the “ducts” that traditionally encase the engine.

CFM International, a 50-50 joint company between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, is developing Open Fan (aka unducted) engine architecture as part of the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) technology development and demonstration program. Unveiled in 2021, the RISE program is advancing technologies to support a future aircraft engine that aims to be 20% more fuel-efficient than current commercial engines while meeting customer expectations for durability and reliability.

The engineering teams working on Open Fan across CFM have high hopes for the step change this new architecture will bring for fuel efficiency while also being designed to work with alternative fuels like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hybrid electric systems, two other key initiatives currently being pursued by both companies to support the industry’s efforts to reduce flight emissions.

How Can Open Fan Change the Future of Flight?

“The next change, the next improvement in fuel burn to make it in that neighborhood of 20%, cannot happen without a fundamental change in the shape of the engine. And that’s just the laws of physics,” Ali said.

This is because of the “bypass ratio.” To improve fuel burn and efficiency, the approach has typically been to make the engine’s fan bigger. That fan scoops air and throws it to the back of the engine to generate greater thrust. But in that process, a portion of that air ends up burning with the fuel. Ideally, the amount of air that “bypasses” being burned with the fuel should be as high as possible to provide the thrust — the bypass ratio.

Seventy years ago, the bypass ratio for jet engines was about 2 to 1. Today it’s about 11 to 1. But as Ali noted, engineers can’t keep following the same formula to improve that ratio because of the ducts, which get bigger to support bigger fans, producing drag that eats at the fuel burn benefits. “There is a point that is not very far away from where we are today in which that duct is so big that it wipes out any gains that are coming from making the fan bigger,” he said.

This is where the Open Fan comes in. GE Aerospace’s current design aims to take the bypass ratio from 11 to 1 to 60 to 1. “That’s six-zero from where we are today,” Ali added. “That is the fuel burn opportunity that we are thrilled and excited about.”

Testing, Testing: Putting Open Fan Through the Paces

The RISE program has completed more than 250 critical field tests so far. Ali pointed to two wind tunnel tests in particular that simulated the integration of the Open Fan and the wing. The first 300-plus hours of tests were completed by Safran Aircraft Engines at a facility run by ONERA, the French national aerospace research center, in “the largest wind tunnel in the world,” using a one-fifth scale model of the Open Fan performing at cruising speed. This was followed by a second set of tests in collaboration with DNW in the Netherlands, performed at low speed to simulate an aircraft during takeoff, climb, and descent.

Ali called the results “extremely encouraging,” not only in terms of validating performance and noise but also the computational analysis that GE Aerospace has done with the help of Frontier, one of the world’s fastest supercomputers, maintained at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Last November, the company announced a new project it’s working on with Boeing, NASA, and Oak Ridge to use supercomputing to study the aerodynamics of an Open Fan architecture mounted on an aircraft wing in simulated flight conditions.

“Typically, when you get computational results and compare them to the wind tunnel [tests], there is a difference between the two. You spend a lot of time reconciling,” he said. But in this case, there was “no reconciliation.” He added: “These supercomputers’ capabilities are unprecedented in the ability to simulate the future.”

Next Steps for Open Fan

“We are in the middle of a lot of testing to validate durability, vibrations, endurance, and ingestion,” Ali explained. “And we’re doing all of these tests not just for the Open Fan, but there are lots of other technologies that are part of the RISE program that are behind the fan, whether it’s a more advanced core or hybrid electric.”

In fact, a lightweight compact core, which houses the engine’s compression, combustion, and high-pressure turbine modules, is being reengineered by the RISE program team to be smaller and optimize thermal efficiency, with an advanced cooling system and materials that can withstand extremely high temperatures. The core is being tested for compatibility with next-generation fuels, including unblended SAF and hydrogen, as well as with hybrid electric systems like the ones GE Aerospace is currently developing with NASA.

Flying Forward Together

The challenge of more efficient flight is not solved by one invention or company. It is about industry-wide innovation and collaboration.

“This is all leading up to the demonstration flight that we are going to be doing jointly with Airbus later in this decade,” said Ali.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions.
According to a recent IATA estimate, SAF production in 2024 reached 1 million tonnes, or 1.3 billion liters, roughly doubling production in 2023, but still accounting for only around 0.3% of global jet fuel production.
The IATA added that the registry is technology and feedstock neutral, supporting the emergence of diverse SAF production streams.
Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, said: “While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced today the launch of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a new tool aimed at facilitating a global market for sustainable aviation fuel by tracking SAF transactions and environmental benefits, and connecting buyers and sellers.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. According to a recent IATA estimate, SAF production in 2024 reached 1 million tonnes, or 1.3 billion liters, roughly doubling production in 2023, but still accounting for only around 0.3% of global jet fuel production.

Developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies, the new registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way, and will also record the environmental attributes of SAF as it moves across the value chain to enable claims against regulatory obligations and corporate climate goals, while also avoiding double counting.

According to the IATA, the new registry will help to solve the challenge of limited SAF supply by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location, and by giving airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions. The IATA added that the registry is technology and feedstock neutral, supporting the emergence of diverse SAF production streams.

The IATA said that 30 early users are currently in the process of onboarding the system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, said:

Researchers at the University of Surrey have introduced an innovative approach that combines carbon capture and conversion into one seamless process, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods.

This new method, known as the Dual-Function Material (DFM) process, has shown the potential to be both financially viable and scalable.

A recent study demonstrates that this technique could achieve carbon capture at a cost as low as $400 per tonne, making it a competitive option compared to existing commercial systems.

What are Dual-Function Materials (DFMs)?

At the heart of this innovative process is the use of Dual-Function Materials (DFMs) – a unique class of materials designed to both capture CO₂ and facilitate its conversion into useful products, such as methane.

Unlike conventional carbon capture technology that relies on separate systems for capture and conversion, DFMs integrate both functions into a single step.

DFMs work by absorbing CO₂ from the air and then, using catalysts and renewable hydrogen, converting it into synthetic fuels.

This eliminates the need for additional energy-intensive processing steps, making the entire system more efficient and cost-effective.

By embedding this technology into industrial operations, sectors that are difficult to decarbonise – such as steel manufacturing – can significantly reduce their emissions.

The role of superstructure optimisation

To refine the efficiency of this carbon capture system, the research team employed superstructure optimisation, an advanced modelling technique that tests various process configurations.

By analysing different system designs, they identified the most cost-effective method to capture 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year, a scale comparable to existing commercial solutions.

This level of optimisation ensures that the technology is not only scientifically sound but also economically feasible for large-scale deployment.

The ability to integrate DFMs with existing industrial infrastructure further enhances its appeal for widespread adoption.

Potential impact on carbon reduction and clean energy

The implications of this carbon capture technology extend beyond just cost savings. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has emphasised the need for large-scale CO₂ removal to meet global climate targets.

With a growing focus on Net Zero emissions, technologies like DFMs provide a practical pathway to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels while creating cleaner energy sources.

By utilising CO₂ directly from the atmosphere and converting it into synthetic fuels, industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing can transition towards greener alternatives.

The ability to produce methane and other fuels from captured carbon presents an opportunity for energy independence and the development of sustainable value chains.

The future of carbon capture technology

As material performance continues to improve and catalyst costs decrease, the potential for DFMs to be deployed on a larger scale increases.

With ongoing research and industrial collaboration, this technology could play a crucial role in achieving climate goals while providing an economically viable solution for carbon reduction.

Integrating carbon capture technology into various industries will be essential for tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

As advancements in DFMs continue, they could soon become a mainstream solution for sustainable energy and industrial decarbonisation.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2317075011.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 09:56:15.914717

We continue working to expand partnerships that bring concrete benefits to our country,” highlighted Brazil's minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Luciana Santos.
“Like Brazil, Vietnam understands that, without human resources trained to deal with the economy of the future, there will neither be growth nor sustainable development,” she concluded.
“With the signing of the memorandum, Brazil and Vietnam renew joint efforts to strengthen the partnership in economic and trade issues.
Silveira addressed the intention to expand partnerships in the field of ​​biofuels during the session that discussed energy cooperation.","President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s official visit to Hanoi, between Thursday (27) and Saturday (29) reinforced Brazil's partnerships with Vietnam. A delegation of ministers and government representatives accompanied Lula on the trip to expand relations between the countries in different areas.

Five acts were adopted at the meetings — among them the Action Plan for Implementation of the Strategic Partnership between Brazil and Vietnam for the period 2025-2030, covering the following priority areas: politics, defense, security and global challenges; economy, trade and investment; science, technology, and innovation; climate change and the environment; education, culture, sports, tourism, and connections between peoples; consular affairs and community support.

“Brazil and Vietnam share a path of growth and development, and this commitment reaffirms our intention of building bridges, fostering opportunities and deepening strategic ties. We continue working to expand partnerships that bring concrete benefits to our country,” highlighted Brazil's minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Luciana Santos.

SCIENCE COMMITTEE — During the Brazil-Vietnam Economic Forum on Saturday (29), the minister confirmed that the first meeting of the Brazil-Vietnam Joint Committee on Science, Technology, and Innovation will be held in Brazil in the second half of 2025. “For us, it will be an opportunity to define our cooperation priorities, plan actions, and begin their implementation,” stated Luciana Santos. The ministry is interested in establishing partnerships in areas such as semiconductors, Artificial Intelligence, quantum technologies, energy transition, biodiversity, food and nutritional security, and innovation environments.

TRAINING — The minister emphasized the agreements that had already been established with Vietnam as of 2023, regarding the training of specialized labor. “I want to reiterate the proposal we made in 2023 —and which we discussed last year between technical teams from both governments— to create a Brazil-Vietnam Center for semiconductors, to train and qualify human resources, in addition to research and development of components,” she said. Luciana Santos added that the ministry has the ambitious goal of training 50,000 specialists in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector, including engineers and hardware and software developers. “Like Brazil, Vietnam understands that, without human resources trained to deal with the economy of the future, there will neither be growth nor sustainable development,” she concluded.

MARKET OPENING — During his official visit, President Lula announced the opening of the Vietnamese market to Brazilian beef. The decision came after a series of meetings with Vietnamese government leaders. “We are working hard on the trade relationship between agricultural products and Vietnam, and President Lula’s presence was essential for this long-awaited reopening, granting the access of Brazilian beef to Vietnamese consumers,” declared Brazil’s Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, Carlos Fávaro.

Since the beginning of this administration, four new markets have been opened in Vietnam, and the trade of Brazilian leather has been facilitated. In 2025, Vietnam will already be the fourth largest destination for exports of Brazilian agricultural products, accounting for 3.2% of what was traded up to February, and only behind China, the European Union, and the United States.

TRADE AND INDUSTRY — Representing the Vice President of the Republic and Minister of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services (Ministério do Desenvolvimento, Indústria, Comércio e Serviços/MDIC) Geraldo Alckmin, Executive Secretary Márcio Elias Rosa participated in the signing of the memorandum of understanding that creates the Steering Group for Trade and Industrial Cooperation in Vietnam. The goal is to promote economic cooperation in priority areas for trade, and to create favorable conditions for the expansion of bilateral relations.

“With the signing of the memorandum, Brazil and Vietnam renew joint efforts to strengthen the partnership in economic and trade issues. We have extraordinary opportunities ahead to advance in strategic sectors, such as high technology, digital transformation, energy transition, biofuels, environmental protection, and climate change,” highlighted Alckmin from Brazil.

In addition to establishing a mechanism that enables the strengthening of trade and the improvement of the industrial capacity of Brazil and Vietnam, one of the responsibilities of the group created through the memorandum will be to identify opportunities and diversify trade between the two countries. Plans are in motion to promote studies, training programs, and information exchange are planned.

In Hanoi, the MDIC executive secretary said that the two countries already have a significant relationship with potential for expansion. “Vietnam is currently Brazil’s largest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Brazil is Vietnam’s main partner in South America. Based on this mission, the expectation is to expand this important cooperation in high value-added sectors, such as biotechnology, semiconductors, sustainable mobility, industrial digitalization, and artificial intelligence,” stated Márcio Elias Rosa.

GOAL — Recognizing economic collaboration as an essential pillar of bilateral relations and aware of the untapped potential for greater growth, Lula and the President of Vietnam Luong Cuong agreed to pursue a bilateral trade target of USD 15 billion by 2030. They also agreed to continue working to diversify trade between Brazil and Vietnam. In this sense, they noted with satisfaction the excellent business prospects in sectors such as animal protein and aircraft.

ENERGY — Also present at the Brazil-Vietnam Economic Forum, Brazil’s Minister of Mines and Energy Alexandre Silveira highlighted the possibilities for cooperation between the two countries. Silveira addressed the intention to expand partnerships in the field of ​​biofuels during the session that discussed energy cooperation. “As in Brazil, sugarcane production is relevant to Vietnam’s economy. This makes our countries very well positioned to advance in the biofuels agenda. We already have a strong commercial partnership, particularly in the case of dried distillery grains, used in the production of ethanol. But we can do more. Brazil can be Vietnam’s largest supplier of inputs for biofuels,” he stated.

The minister highlighted Brazil’s leading role with the Fuel of the Future Law (Lei do Combustível do Futuro) — a proposal by the Federal Government that improved the legal and regulatory framework for biofuels. “We are able to expand our partnerships in other areas, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine biofuels, and strategic minerals. We are open to sharing our experience with you, strengthening commercial partnerships and working together to decarbonize the planet's energy matrix, strengthening the new, green economy,” said Alexandre Silveira. He invited representatives from Vietnam to participate in the Global Planning Summit for the Energy Transition in June, in Rio de Janeiro, and in COP30, which will be held in November in Belém, Pará.

FURTHER ACTIONS — The governments of the two countries also signed agreements on the exercise of paid activities by employees of diplomatic missions, consular offices and permanent missions to International Organizations and on the exchange and mutual protection of classified information.

Nicole Mies, Head of Communications & Corporate Social Responsibility at Lufthansa Cargo, highlighted the airline’s progress, stating, “We want to take responsibility and drive forward our ambitious climate targets. In 2024, we worked closely with customers, partners, and researchers to explore new possibilities and make meaningful progress. We haven’t reached every goal yet, but we are continuously working towards a more efficient and innovative airfreight system.”

Investing in a greener fleet

Aircraft are the biggest contributors to an airline’s carbon footprint, and Lufthansa Cargo has been upgrading its fleet to tackle this issue. The company exclusively operates Boeing 777F freighters, which are among the most fuel-efficient cargo planes in the industry. In mid-2024, Lufthansa Cargo welcomed its 18th Boeing 777F to Frankfurt Airport, and by 2030, it expects to add seven more Boeing 777-8 freighters, which come with the latest fuel-saving technology. These new-generation aircraft use up to 30% less fuel than older models, significantly cutting emissions.

Sustainable fuel and smarter flying

One of the most impactful ways to reduce aviation emissions is through SAF, a fuel made from biogenic residues that has 80% lower carbon emissions than traditional kerosene. Lufthansa Cargo expanded its “Sustainable Choice” programme, allowing customers to support decarbonisation by opting for SAF-powered flights. In 2024, this initiative alone helped save approximately 8,500 tonnes of CO₂.

The airline also focused on optimising flight operations to improve fuel efficiency. By implementing smarter fuel planning methods and reducing unnecessary fuel reserves, Lufthansa Cargo saved 5,700 tonnes of kerosene last year, equivalent to cutting 18,000 tonnes of CO₂. One key initiative, Statistical Contingency Fuel (SCF), fine-tunes the amount of extra fuel needed for each flight by analysing historical data and real-time conditions.

Additionally, the airline improved ground fuel efficiency with techniques like “Reduced Engine during Taxi In” (RETI), which involves shutting down one engine during taxiing. This simple adjustment saved 400 tonnes of fuel and cut CO₂ emissions by 1,200 tonnes annually.

Sustainability beyond the skies

Lufthansa Cargo’s green efforts go beyond flight operations. On the ground, the company has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. One major step was switching its company car fleet at Frankfurt Airport to electric vehicles. The first batch of new EVs arrived in 2024, supported by the installation of six charging stations across two buildings.

The airline also tackled waste reduction by recycling old cargo belts in partnership with the Rhein-Main Association of Sheltered Workshops (WfB). The belts are repurposed into construction safety barriers and insulation panels, while the metal components are recycled. These efforts help reduce waste and support sustainability in ground operations.

Researching climate-friendly flight paths

In 2024, Lufthansa Cargo played a key role in a government-backed research initiative called the “100 Flights Programme.” The project, run in collaboration with Lufthansa Airlines and other German carriers, explored ways to reduce the environmental impact of condensation trails (contrails), which contribute to climate change.

The airline adjusted flight altitudes on 13 selected routes to test whether these changes could prevent contrail formation. Satellite data was used to monitor results, and findings from the study will help improve future flight planning to minimise climate impact.

A team effort for a sustainable future

Lufthansa Cargo knows that achieving long-term sustainability requires collaboration across industries. In 2024, the airline joined the Smart Freight Centre (SFC), a global non-profit focused on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in freight transport. The partnership aligns with Lufthansa Cargo’s mission to create a zero-emission logistics sector by 2050.

With a mix of technological advancements, operational improvements, and strategic partnerships, Lufthansa Cargo is steadily moving towards a more sustainable air cargo industry. While there’s still a long way to go, the company’s 2024 achievements mark a strong step in the right direction.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/03/80639-luftansa.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 13:56:55.706779

Steve Heapy said he has met the transport secretary Heidi Alexander and aviation minister Mike Kane to lobby on the issue – but nothing has yet happened.

“They both made positive noises about what they want to do in terms of airport expansion, the SAF mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism,” he told a Travel Weekly webcast.

“They just need to follow up words with action.

“I think a strong aviation sector is important to the economy. That’s something [chancellor] Rachel Reeves has said, so I hope that they will put in place the revenue certainty mechanism pretty soon.

“We have heard a lot of very positive statements, but we need action.

“We need people to build SAF plants in the UK, and the SAF companies won’t build SAF plants until there’s the revenue certainty mechanism.

“So, it follows that the quicker you get the revenue certainty mechanism in place, the quicker you have SAF plants. And SAF therefore should be cheaper.”

If this doesn’t happen, then he warned prices would continue to rise and demand would drop – affecting people on lower incomes the most.

“I think it is disgraceful that people at the lower end of the income scale will be the ones that won’t be able to fly to go on holiday. Everyone should have the opportunity to go on holiday,” he said.

“Heidi and Mike have certainly made good noises. They both seem very energetic.”

Asked if the mechanism could start this year, he commented: “I hope so. I am encouraged by them both. They are both very approachable people.

“They both seem very passionate about their sectors and their areas of responsibility, and I look forward to carrying on talking to them, and hopefully we’ll see some progress.”

Heapy also cautioned against further tax rises this year, adding: “An increase in taxes definitely means that people have less money to spend.

“I very much hope [the government] don’t increase taxes, but if they do, then we’ve got to hope that people still see holidays as an essential purchase and perhaps spend a bit less on discretionary things.”

Heapy was speaking to Travel Weekly while he was at Luton airport to see the launch of flights from the company’s 13th base.

Designed to accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050, the registry will help drive a global market for SAF.

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort,” said Marie Ownes Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, as she explained that the release of the SAF registry to CADO will benefit all stakeholders.

“It ensures all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environment attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting.”

She also noted that airlines, their customers and other stakeholders including fuel producers and regulatory bodies will be able to track and account for SAF transactions in a standardised global system.

Acknowledging that the registry is one step in the pathway to decarbonising aviation, Thomsen also warned that the registry “cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced.”

She called on governments to actively back the expansion of renewable energy, reallocating their direct support from fossil fuels to sustainable alternatives. “The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” she emphasised.

What is the SAF Registry?

Described by IATA as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way the SAF Registry was designed in collaboration with airlines, authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and corporate travel management companies. Technology and feedstock neutral, it ensures the environmental benefits for SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

By connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers no matter where they are located, the registry addresses the challenge of limited SAF supply. It also gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and ensures compatibility with other registries to support competition and open markets.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027 with more than 30 users, including Airbus, Boeing and various airlines across the globe already in the process of onboarding the system.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SAF-refuelling-at-London-Heathrow-2.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 08:56:17.587910

The prestigious investiture ceremony took place on Tuesday, 1 April at Windsor Castle.

James has long been a driving force in the green energy sector, leading the way for over 20 years in developing innovative sustainable fuel technologies aimed at reducing global carbon emissions.

Initially focused on sustainable road fuels, James has evolved to become a leading figure in the aviation industry’s green energy transition. His latest business has developed a way to make SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) from recycled sewage waste, a material currently spread on land in the UK.

This remarkable British innovation offers significant environmental and economic benefits to the UK. It puts huge quantities of sewage waste into beneficial use whilst also providing an affordable, waste-derived fuel. An asset that will help the UK to meet its SAF mandate without relying on imports.

Recently, the company announced plans to develop a commercial-scale facility in Harwich, Essex, where it will convert sewage biosolids into highly sustainable fuels.

The production centre is expected to be in commercial operation by 2029 and would be the first of its kind anywhere in the world.

HM King Charles III has long been an advocate of the innovative work being done by Firefly Green Fuels and its sister company, Green Fuels.

James said: ""I am incredibly humbled to receive this honour today. It is a reflection not just of my work, but of the tireless efforts of everyone I’ve worked with over the past 20 years. Together, we have pushed the boundaries of innovation and sustainability in the low carbon fuels sector.

“This achievement reflects all that hard work, and I am proud to work alongside such dedicated and passionate teams. I would like to thank my colleagues, partners, my family and all those who like me are dedicated to building a more sustainable future.""

What exactly is the SAF Registry?

The SAF Registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way.

It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

The Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location.

In addition, it gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.

UK’s Implementation of Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA)

Starting April 2, 2025, the United Kingdom introduced a significant policy change by extending its Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) requirement to nationals of European Union (EU) member states, the European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. This policy was initially aimed at travelers from countries outside the EU and has now been expanded to include European citizens, reflecting the UK’s growing focus on border security and immigration management post-Brexit. The ETA application involves travelers submitting personal and biometric data, including passport information and digital photographs. It has a processing fee of £10, which will rise to £16 on April 9, 2025. This new process aims to pre-screen travelers before they enter the UK, helping authorities identify potential security risks and illegal immigration attempts before arrival.

The ETA is valid for two years and allows multiple visits to the UK, with each stay limited to six months. This is a crucial change, especially for frequent travelers and business professionals who frequently visit the UK. However, Irish citizens are exempt from this new rule due to the Common Travel Area arrangement between Ireland and the UK. While the ETA system aims to streamline the entry process, it is expected to be met with some resistance from travelers who may find it an additional hurdle, particularly given the already complex travel documentation processes within Europe. Travelers must adjust to the new norms, making it essential for both leisure and business travelers to remain aware of these requirements.

Ryanair’s Route Adjustments Amid Tax Increases

Ryanair, one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers, has made notable route adjustments in response to increased taxation and low demand for certain services. The airline announced a reduction of flights to French airports by up to 5%, a move that has caught the attention of many in the travel industry. Ryanair has already suspended flights from Paris-Vatry and Bordeaux airports, and further cuts are being considered for the winter 2025-26 season and the spring/summer 2026 period. This strategic shift comes as a response to rising taxes imposed on the aviation industry in France, which could lead to increased ticket prices. Such hikes are a significant concern for low-cost carriers like Ryanair, whose business model relies on keeping fares as low as possible to maintain competitiveness.

The decision to cut routes to French airports is seen as a direct reaction to the growing tax burden on the airline industry, which has been exacerbated by local government policies in France. These policies include environmental taxes and airport-specific charges, which ultimately affect the airline’s ability to keep fares affordable for passengers. Ryanair’s business model thrives on providing no-frills services at competitive prices, but the increasing tax burden could undermine this model if it leads to higher operational costs. This adjustment could also influence future route planning and the airline’s ability to maintain its presence in the European market, especially in countries with higher operational costs. As the situation develops, it will be interesting to see whether Ryanair continues to adjust its network to cope with these financial pressures or if it seeks other strategies to maintain profitability.

Impact of New Authorization Systems on Tourism

The European Union is set to introduce the Entry/Exit System (EES) in October 2025, a new electronic system designed to monitor the border crossings of non-EU nationals. This system will replace traditional passport stamps with biometric data, including fingerprints and facial images, collected at the border entry points. The EES is being implemented to enhance border security and improve the efficiency of immigration processes. By automating border control procedures, the system is expected to reduce waiting times and improve the overall passenger experience for non-EU travelers, such as those from the United States and Asia.

For the tourism industry, the introduction of the EES is likely to have significant implications, particularly for travelers who frequently visit the EU. While the system aims to streamline entry procedures and enhance security, there are concerns that it may lead to longer processing times and additional bureaucratic hurdles for travelers, especially those who are not accustomed to biometric data collection. It will also raise questions about data privacy and the security of personal information. Despite these concerns, the system is expected to make border control more efficient, enabling travelers to cross into the EU more quickly and safely. For tourism operators, this may mean smoother operations, but they will also need to educate travelers on the new requirements to ensure a seamless travel experience. In the long term, the EES is expected to become a critical part of Europe’s border management strategy, impacting the flow of international visitors.

Shifts in European Travel Preferences

Recent data reveals a notable decline in the number of European tourists visiting the United States, with forward bookings for the summer 2025 season down by 25%. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including perceived travel restrictions, concerns over security at U.S. airports, and reports of detentions and lengthy border processes. As a result, travelers from Europe are increasingly opting for alternative destinations that are perceived to offer more seamless entry experiences and lower risks. Countries like Canada, South America, and Egypt are becoming increasingly popular for European tourists looking for new and exciting travel experiences.

The decline in European travel to the U.S. is a significant development for both tourism operators in Europe and their counterparts in the U.S. The drop in arrivals is also attributed to the complex visa application process and the perception that the U.S. has become less welcoming to international visitors. In contrast, destinations such as Canada, with its relaxed travel policies and welcoming reputation, are benefiting from this shift. Similarly, South America and Egypt have experienced a surge in European visitors due to their rich cultural offerings, lower travel costs, and growing accessibility. For European tourism professionals, this shift signals the need to adapt to changing consumer preferences and re-focus marketing efforts on promoting destinations that align with current traveler expectations. As this trend continues, it will reshape the tourism dynamics both in the U.S. and globally, with a growing emphasis on more accessible and culturally rich destinations.

The European travel industry is undergoing significant transformations as it navigates the complex interplay of policy reforms, technological advancements, and evolving consumer preferences. Stakeholders in the travel and transportation sectors, including airlines, high-speed rail companies, and tourism operators, must remain agile to respond to these changes effectively. The rise of new border control measures like the ETA and the EES, along with the increasing competition in the high-speed rail sector, will require both businesses and travelers to adapt quickly. Meanwhile, shifting travel preferences and an increased focus on sustainability will continue to shape the future of European tourism. To stay competitive in this rapidly changing environment, industry players must innovate, enhance customer experiences, and find ways to align with the growing demand for more efficient, secure, and eco-friendly travel options.

“To give the private sector confidence to invest, the UK government is introducing a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ for SAF.
The SAF Mandate starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.
Ideally, we want to move quicker as the UK government’s 10% SAF mandate for airlines will come into force in 2030,” Counsell said.
“To help meet this, we would need six or seven new SAF plants in the UK within the next five years.","International Airlines Group (IAG) is urging the UK government to accelerate its plans for a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ (RCM) to support the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), warning that delays could jeopardise the country’s aviation decarbonisation goals.

“To give the private sector confidence to invest, the UK government is introducing a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ for SAF. This is a way to guarantee future SAF prices that derisks investment – similar to the model already successfully used to build the UK’s offshore wind industry,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer.

“Price certainty gives investors confidence, and signals to international partners that the UK is an attractive place to build low carbon technologies.”

While welcoming the initiative, he stressed the need for further cost modelling and careful policy design. “We believe a revenue certainty mechanism is the right instrument to incentivise efficiency, balance priorities and offer value for money, but the important part will be in the detailed design which IAG will continue to support,” Counsell added.

The SAF Mandate starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

But IAG warns that significant investment is needed to meet this goal.

“Speed is a key factor. The Department for Transport is currently aiming to have the policy finalised by the end of 2026. Ideally, we want to move quicker as the UK government’s 10% SAF mandate for airlines will come into force in 2030,” Counsell said.

“To help meet this, we would need six or seven new SAF plants in the UK within the next five years. It’s a tight timescale and our suppliers need certainty, fast, if they are to start and finish construction on these advanced and complex facilities.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AdobeStock_786941246-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-04-03 05:57:03.683396

Sustainable aviation fuel production costs are still high, which discourages innovation and project development.
This doesn’t build a great case for investment in SAF.” To expand sustainable aviation fuel production, the industry needs long-term off-takes.","Sustainable aviation fuels have a problem: they’re taking far too long to develop, according to a new report released by the Boston Consulting Group.

Though production of sustainable aviation fuels has increased substantially in the past three years – with a massive uptick in 2024 – the numbers are actually quite small when compared to overall global jet fuel production. Current SAF production accounts for only 0.3% of total fuel production, according to the International Air Transport Association (AITA).

BCG Highlights Concerns Over Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production

BCG claims that sustainable aviation fuel production is now faltering and even shrinking. The announcement of new project facilities declined by 50% from 2022 to 2023, triggered by higher energy and operating costs as well as economic uncertainty, BCG reports.

All this is putting 2030 aviation decarbonization goals at risk, they say.

Neither of the two types of sustainable aviation fuel is close to meeting targets, BCG said, though they did not specify which targets they were referencing for this assessment.

One type of fuel, Bio-SAF, is produced from natural oils or biomass, and costs less to produce and has quicker project delivery estimates. These fuels are expected to miss 2030 production targets by 30%, BCG said.

The second type of fuel, called e-SAF, is produced from a thermochemical process. This process is more expensive than Bio-SAF, with yet-to-mature technologies. Production of this type of fuel is expected to miss 2030 targets by 45%, BCG said.

Exacerbating these fuel-production shortfalls is the less-than-stellar state of project approvals: Fewer than 30% of SAF projects reach a final investment decision, BCG noted.

Production has also taken a hit from delayed policy action, BCG said. The report points to the EU postponing a decision on sustainable aviation fuel eligibility criteria on the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which in turn caused a delay in companies announcing new projects.

This has also caused inertia among the main players in the sector, namely airports and airlines.

“Only a small subset of players has shown active leadership [in developing SAF stocks], and this trend is unlikely to shift without significant incentives or mandates,” the report said.

Part of this stasis is driven by the lack of a clear business case for developing sustainable aviation fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel production costs are still high, which discourages innovation and project development. This then results in high prices for produced SAF, because of their scarcity on the market.

The BCG report suggests carbon prices could spur production. This would not only increase demand for the fuel, but help airlines and aviation players meet sustainability targets, which in turn would create more opportunities for investment.

Industry Voices Support SAF Scale-Up – But Say Fossil Fuel Sector Must Step In

Haldane Dodd, who heads the pro-sustainability Air Transport Action Group from Geneva, supported the findings of the report, but urged fossil fuel producers to be more involved.

“The BCG analysis outlines he challenge in getting the nascent [SAF] industry off the ground,” he told Climate Insider.

“But I notice that it didn’t mention the role of traditional energy suppliers: the fossil fuel producers which have the financial resources, the expertise, and the distribution networks to really invest in SAF scale-up.”

He implored the aviation industry to see the development of the fuel beyond just an industry-specific lens.

“SAF should not be seen just as an aviation transition – it is an energy transition, and the traditional energy sector is not front and centre where it should be.”

He applauded airports, airlines, aerospace manufacturers and all companies operating in the sector for filling the gap left by the fossil fuel industry, but emphasized that these players should not have to go it alone.

For SkyNRG’s Tom Berg, who serves as Director of Policy and Sustainability, the BCG report “stirred up some discussion” among sector players.

When it comes to increasing production, some areas are doing much better than others, Berg said.

“In Europe, we have a very solid long-term investment framework built on SAF mandates” Berg said. “In the EU, SkyNRG has been every year producing a SAF market outlook since 2021, and we’re seeing announced capacities are increasing year on year on year.”

In the US, there’s no financial certainty for SAF development, he pointed out.

“The system [for supporting SAF production] is built on tax incentives, and these are pretty volatile from administration to administration,” Berg said. “The certainty on getting these tax incentives varies. This doesn’t build a great case for investment in SAF.”

To expand sustainable aviation fuel production, the industry needs long-term off-takes.

Mandates can help with this, he said. Any stable, regulatory market which creates a firm long-term demand to build a business case can help with SAF production, Berg said.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production Growth Through Consumer Demand

In addition to creating regulations to aid in SAF development, there needs to be ways to channel voluntary demand into spurring more production, Berg said.

“We have people willing to pay at the corporate level,” he said. These corporations are not able to buy batches of SAF, but they are willing to pay more for transport and then use these SAF-propelled flights for emissions-reduction certificates.

SkyNRG aggregates this demand for customers, and then links it to supply deals.

“These are novel, innovative frameworks that can help speed things up,” Berg said. “On their own, voluntary purchases cannot really trigger production. But if you aggregate, you can see real volume [in production].”

Consolidating consumer demand for sustainable aviation fuel use goes hand-in-hand with a solid regulatory regime, he noted.

Berg agrees that carbon pricing also has a role to play, he said.

“In regions where there’s already carbon pricing, like the EU, the best thing you can do is take revenues from the carbon pricing regime, and use that to fund the decarbonization in aviation,” Berg said.

“Earmarking these carbon pricing revenues means the [aviation] sector can pay for its own transition, and use these revenues to pay for SAF,” he said, noting measures need to be put in place to ensure all buyers are on the same playing field and first-movers aren’t economically penalized.

“Taking those carbon pricing revenues and putting it to good use, can actually do a lot,” he said.",https://climateinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_2025-04-02_132541311.png,N,,2025-04-03 08:56:50.574265

The Registry, now live under CADO management, will enable a global market for SAF that will accelerate the transition to net zero emissions by 2050.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort. In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders. It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting. Airlines, their corporate customers, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and all related organizations will be able to record and account for their SAF transactions in a global market for SAF. While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced.

Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

About the SAF Registry

The SAF Registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

The Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply —which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally —by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, it gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonization.

The SAF Registry is technology and feedstock neutral, favoring the emergence of diverse SAF production streams across the world. It will be able to accommodate specific regulations, while favoring global harmonization. Moreover, interoperability with other registries is an important feature of the Registry, supporting competition and open markets.

The Registry was developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies. With over 30 early users (see appendix) already in the process of onboarding and ready to use the system, the Registry is underpinned by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology which provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, regardless of location.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.

About CADO

The Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) was created in March 2025 to maintain and operate the IATA-developed SAF Registry. It is a not-for-profit organization established under Canadian Law with its headquarters in Montreal.

CADO’s founding member is the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which provides ongoing technical and operational support for the SAF Registry. Membership in CADO is open to international organizations and companies in the SAF value chain.

The European aviation industry must find a way to adopt these fuels cost-effectively, such as producing microalgae-based aviation fuels to make flying more environmentally friendly.
One way to make the aviation industry more sustainable is by relying on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) instead of conventional aviation fuel.
What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?
“The main source of sustainable aviation fuel at the moment is crops that have food uses and require agricultural land for cultivation.","Conventional fuels used in the aviation industry harm the environment. A recent EU regulation pushes for greener alternatives to conventional fuels to meet the neutrality goals set for 2050. However, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are costly, and Europe has limited production capacity for them. The European aviation industry must find a way to adopt these fuels cost-effectively, such as producing microalgae-based aviation fuels to make flying more environmentally friendly.

In the EU, civil aviation contributes over 13% of total CO2 emissions from transport, making it one of the sector’s largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. One way to make the aviation industry more sustainable is by relying on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) instead of conventional aviation fuel. This could lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions by as much as 80%.

In 2023, the European Parliament approved the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which aims to increase the use of SAF in line with the EU’s climate neutrality targets. According to the new rules, starting in 2025, a minimum of 2% of aviation fuels must be sustainable; this percentage will rise every five years, reaching 70% by 2050.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional aviation fuel, derived from plant or animal materials instead of fossil fuels. Various sources can be used to produce SAF, including cooking oil, animal waste fat, agricultural and forestry waste, and even algae. It is designed to be nearly identical to conventional fuel, which allows it to be used in existing planes. For now SAF still needs to be mixed with traditional aviation fuel, but there are hopes that airlines will be able to use 100% SAF by 2030.

The challenge is that SAF prices can be up to 10 times higher than conventional fuel, although they are expected to decrease significantly with new production technologies.

Ronald Halim, professor at the School of Biosystems and Food Engineering at University College Dublin and project coordinator of the SusAlgaeFuel Project, says that relying on food waste limits SAF supply.

“The main source of sustainable aviation fuel at the moment is crops that have food uses and require agricultural land for cultivation. These are second-generation crops, meaning they are generally waste products from other systems or processes, such as used cooking oil. These sources are either unsustainable or have limited availability. There is a need for an alternative approach to produce sustainable aviation fuel, and that’s where microalgae can potentially come in.”

What are the advantages and possible challenges of using algae-based fuels?

Algae-based fuel is gaining popularity in aviation due to its ability to grow in saltwater or wastewater, absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and produce oil with minimal land uses , which means it doesn’t affect food production. The European algae biofuel market is expected to expand to $1.97 billion by 2033 at an annual growth rate of 6.89%.

“Algae offers several benefits for fuel production. Firstly, they are very oil-rich, meaning they contain significantly more oil per gram compared to oil-rich crops like oil palm or canola. Secondly, they grow rapidly, allowing for a quicker turnover time than conventional crops. For instance, traditional crops may require up to a year before harvesting for oil production, while microalgae can be harvested every 1 to 2 weeks, enabling a shorter growth cycle. This could lead to increased production,” said Professor Halim.

One of the main obstacles to transitioning to algae biofuels is the high cost of converting microalgae lipids into aviation fuel. Algae require nutrients, a specific temperature, and water to grow. Once the algae biomass is obtained, processing it demands a significant amount of energy.

Professor Halim’s SusAlgaeFuel Project is developing approaches to lower the cost of growing and processing algae. This can make the resulting algae fuel cost-competitive with other types of sustainable aviation fuels, and make it available for local production in the EU.

Working towards a cost-effective and sustainable solution

The SusAlgaeFuel project brings together technology providers specializing in microalgal cultivation and AI-driven sensor technology, along with experts in biomass processing and aviation fuel synthesis from five European countries, all collaborating to make the aviation industry more environmentally friendly.

Their approach involves cultivating algae using wastewater from the anaerobic digestion sector rather than relying on expensive clean water and nutrients. Using waste nutrients can lower the cost of algae production while simultaneously treating waste. This creates a win-win situation: The anaerobic digestion industry can convert its waste into valuable biomass, and the aviation sector benefits from lower sustainable fuel costs.

“I sincerely hope we can generate innovative science that is beneficial to scientists and industries worldwide. I want our results to serve industry stakeholders and potentially be translated into commercial applications, perhaps not during the project but shortly after its completion. This way, we can have an impact beyond just scientific publications; we can influence actual commercialisation in the aviation and anaerobic digestion sectors in Ireland and the EU,” said Professor Halim.

In a notable step toward reshaping the carbon footprint of private aviation, six prominent European airports are preparing to introduce blended sustainable aviation fuel starting in 2025. This includes major hubs like Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Paris Le Bourget, East Midlands, and Manchester. These additions mark a growing trend of integrating sustainability deeper into aviation infrastructure and service delivery.

The inclusion of these airports raises the number of locations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa offering sustainable fuels to eight, and brings the total global count to thirty-three. It is a testament to growing momentum and operational readiness in transitioning to cleaner fuels across regions with high traffic volumes.

From Announcement to Impact

While the announcement itself might appear as just another milestone in corporate sustainability communications, its implications run deeper. These airports are not merely adding a product option; they are becoming catalysts of industry change. By facilitating access to cleaner fuel alternatives, they support operators in meeting regulatory requirements and voluntary climate goals more easily.

Each location selected plays a strategic role in private aviation, and expanding fuel access here allows for a broader shift in operational patterns and customer expectations.

The Infrastructure Behind the Commitment

Behind this initiative is one of the most robust sustainable fuel supply chains currently operating in aviation. Agreements signed with major suppliers will contribute over fifty million gallons of sustainable fuel to be distributed throughout 2025. This commitment reflects the growing confidence in both availability and distribution reliability—two critical factors that have historically hindered SAF adoption.

This level of supply coordination helps overcome one of the industry’s silent challenges: inconsistency in availability. By ensuring steady volumes across high-demand locations, these supply agreements aim to normalize the use of SAF rather than treat it as a premium or exclusive option.

Bridging Sustainability with Everyday Operations

A sustainable fuel option is not simply a sustainability win—it is an operational one too. It means aircraft operators can integrate sustainability into their routine without having to drastically alter routes, logistics, or fuel sourcing mechanisms. And when sustainability aligns with operational efficiency, adoption accelerates naturally.

For private aviation, which often faces scrutiny for its outsized emissions relative to passenger count, such steps provide a tangible path to offset environmental concerns without compromising service levels or flexibility.

The Road Ahead in 2025

The announcement hints at a cascade of developments planned for 2025, particularly within the Europe and Middle East region. One such advancement is the upcoming introduction of a fully electric refueler at the Nice airport, a symbolic and practical move that reflects how ground services are evolving to match decarbonisation narratives.

This signals that sustainability in aviation is no longer confined to the skies. Ground handling and refueling infrastructure are now being designed to ensure that carbon reduction efforts are integrated across the value chain.

Quiet Leadership Through Measurable Action

The organization driving these expansions has already achieved a significant milestone—crossing the threshold of fifty million gallons of sustainable fuel pumped. Recognition from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, in the form of a Green Power Leadership Award, underscores the alignment between their efforts and broader environmental goals.

These actions collectively reflect a model of quiet leadership—less about grand statements, and more about infrastructural change and measurable emissions reductions.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Future-Focused Aviation

This expansion is not just about making fuel available. It is about embedding sustainability into the very fabric of aviation services. It serves as a positive reminder that impactful progress often comes from logistical clarity, infrastructure readiness, and long-term supplier alignment.

By strengthening access to cleaner fuels at key locations, this initiative offers a blueprint for other regions and operators who wish to decarbonize effectively. The shift is no longer theoretical—it is quietly, steadily becoming a daily reality in aviation’s operational flow.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-04-03 08:57:04.319619

There have been calls for all industries to lower their carbon dioxide emissions (termed as their carbon footprint) in order to lower the global rise in temperature resulting in abnormal weather patterns around the world. As one can see therefore, there is a powerful impetus for change.

The aviation industry has responded to this.

At the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 77th Annual General Meeting in Boston in the United States on the 4th October 2021, a resolution was passed by IATA member airlines committing them to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This is a considerable commitment by an organisation representing 80% of the world’s airlines. There are a number of areas the IATA is targeting in order to meet this objective.

SAF

According to the IATA, it is estimated that 65% of the reduction in the industry’s carbon footprint centre around SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). SAF is a plant based fuel which produces 80% less carbon emissions when compared to traditional jet fuel. This fuel is made from a variety of plant-based sources including agricultural waste, waste oils and fats, as well as forestry residues and non food crops. It is considered sustainable as it does not compete with land needed for growing crops and does not result in deforestation or loss of biodiversity in clearing land for cultivation.

So far more than 40 countries around the world have announced SAF projects. Many airlines already use SAF such as Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Turkish Airlines. In 2024, 1.25 billion litres of SAF were produced. However in order for SAF to help meet the target of net zero by 2050, there has to be a massive increase in production. Nevertheless, the IATA feels that it is possible to replace almost all jet fuel with SAF by 2050.

New Technology, electric and hydrogen

13% of the reduction in carbon footprint is estimated to be achievable through the use of New Technology. In particular, the creation of hybrid electric and purely electric planes will help. Hybrid-electric planes, where an electric system works in conjunction with a traditional combustion engine, greatly reduces carbon emissions. The combustion engine only works in conjunction with the electric system during take off and the electric system takes over afterwards. Combustion engines would also be of lower weight, reducing overall fuel consumption. Whilst this is not ideal as traditional fuel is still needed, the production of hybrid planes paves the way for the production of electric planes. Fully electric planes have a much lower carbon footprint especially if renewable sources are used to produce electricity. At the moment, however, the batteries which power electric planes are far heavier than the equivalent fuel for traditional aircraft.

Hydrogen is a carbon free fuel and can operate with traditional combustion engines or as part of electric batteries. It is also three times lighter than traditional jet fuel but has 4 times the volume, which would necessitate fundamental changes in the fuel systems of aircraft. Nevertheless, hydrogen powered planes as well as hybrid and pure electric planes, have the potential to enter service in the 2030’s. There are also developments in making planes more aerodynamic which reduces wind resistance thereby reducing fuel consumption.

Offsets, Carbon Capture, And Operational Efficiencies

Offsets and carbon capture alone have the potential to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint by 19%. Offsetting involves forest conservation and rehabilitation of peat lands which help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon capture involves using large fans to filter through air using a chemical absorbent to absorb carbon dioxide which can then be stored and used for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Operational and Infrastructure improvements account for 3% of the potential reduction in carbon footprint for the aviation industry. These improvements include, for example, reducing delays at airports so that planes spend less fuel taxiing (which is essentially moving on route between the airport and runway). In addition, using lighter cabin equipment and automated systems to improve efficiency can also reduce fuel consumption and therefore improve the industry’s carbon footprint.

To conclude, therefore, there are a number of improvements that are taking place in the industry as a whole to reduce carbon emissions and the industry’s carbon footprint. We hope that the IATA’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions to net zero emissions by 2050 are realised but we will have to wait to see how this progresses.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/virgatlantic.jpg?fit=1440%2C1156&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-03 05:57:20.977194

That’s all part of the governor’s tax bill, HF2437, which is being carried by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and was presented to the House Taxes Committee on Wednesday.

The committee laid the bill over, as amended, and will consider its provisions for possible omnibus bill inclusion.

“In light of very tough budget times, this is a responsible and practical tax bill,” said Revenue Commissioner Paul Marquart. “It really looks to create a more fair and stable tax system while also creating new economic development and new jobs.”

In addition to changes it would make to individual income taxes, corporate franchise taxes, property taxes, and local government aids, the bill would make accounting services, banking and brokerage services, and legal services all subject to sales taxes. And it would lower the state’s effective general sales tax rate to 6.8% from its current 6.875%.

The bill would also:

expand the tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel;

repeal the option to assign a refund in advance of claiming the K-12 education credit on a tax return;

eliminate the political contribution refund;

make the research credit partially refundable;

modify transfer provisions for the short line railroad credit;

establish a specific tax levy for airlines;

clarify the definitions of electrical attachments and appurtenances for property taxes;

modify provisions for leased tax-exempt property;

reduce the appropriation for aquatic invasive species prevention aid by 50%;

reduce payment in lieu of tax amounts by 34% and clarify there are no cost-of-living adjustments;

modify provisions for certificates of rent paid;

reduce the annual per acre payment for land enrolled in the sustainable forest incentive program;

repeal local government cannabis aid and partial cannabis tax revenue dedication; and

repeal provisions related to tax filing modernization.

The Revenue Department estimates that if the provisions are adopted it would increase revenue by $60.7 million in fiscal year 2026, that number growing to $136.8 million in fiscal year 2027.

The expansion of taxes on accounting, banking, brokerage and legal services is projected to add $136.3 million to the General Fund in fiscal year 2026, while the reduction in the state’s general sales tax rate would reduce it by an estimated $61.9 million.

On approach to environmental targets in the aviation sector in 2025

Lauren Riley: There is no lack of change here in the United States, but it’s not just in the United States, it’s also in other regions around the world like the EU and the UK and elsewhere. They’re looking at adding different policies that address sustainability in aviation. Change is happening everywhere. Fundamental to United commitment to net zero by 2050 is that it’s anchored in our business strategy today.

Fuel is our number two operational cost right behind labor and we don’t hedge on fuel purchase…what’s interesting about sustainable aviation fuel and why we’re also anchored in investing in this space is that it gives us line of sight to be able to stabilize the cost of a very volatile cost to United’s operation…*

We do want to drive the emissions out of our supply chain. When we made our commitment to net zero a couple of years ago, we did it without relying on the use of carbon offsets. And really that was our declaration from a somewhat principled point of view that we have to focus on permanent reductions and that’s why we’re so bullish about sustainable aviation fuels...

Robert Horton: We’ve intentionally engineered externalities out of the equation. Last year we [Dallas Fort Worth International Airport] celebrated 50 years as an airport. That’s a few changes of administration, but the way that we frame environmental or sustainable goals is that it is the right thing to do. It is also good from a business perspective.

For example, if we look at the last 15 – 20 years, we’ve reduced our energy costs by almost 40% and our annual spending on energy by almost 40%. And that’s significant because as you reduce or engineer the waste out of your systems, you’re also reducing your environmental footprint.

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) conversation is a lot more challenging for us as an airport because airports don’t really purchase fuel. That’s mainly the airlines or consortiums, but we are intentional about supporting or enabling that. For example, we’ve done a lot of pilots with used cooking oil, collecting that, and then routing that to recyclers to refine and convert it into sustainable fuels…

On affordability and accessibility of SAF

Charlotte Lollar: Sustainable aviation fuel is very expensive. It’s also very necessary. When you ask a question about whose responsibility it is, it’s kind of the responsibility [of all of us]. There are a lot of players in this value chain and it’s a shared risk model. There is a premium associated with it. There is a necessary step change that has to happen in the technology in order to scale and make it more affordable.

I think we often have conversations about parity and we’re really kind of focused on the end costs and really it’s about affordability, but it’s also economies of scale and getting the tech there. And so it’s kind of a shared responsibility…

Adam Klauber: As a business, we have to sell where we get the highest price, however it makes most sense to reduce the logistics costs that’s associated. There are emissions there too. Even pipelines have emissions. Can we deliver to the closest, the nearest airport to our production capacity? That is really what makes sense.

In terms of another way for us to address some of the price premium is to be transparent with pricing. Our model is to have what we call a cost plus or contract for differences model where we have all the incentives stacked and we show our customers what they are, and we think that this is an important way to get buy-in. The customers understand there’s a fixed margin, but all the rest can fluctuate according to market conditions. They understand the market conditions.",https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/41/930534_BBGT_Market_D930534_BBGT_Market_Dialogues_Podcast_Campaign_Thumbnail_Artwork_3x2.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 18:56:36.799557

Governments, airways, and gas manufacturers are making an investment in SAF because of stricter emission suggestions and net-zero objectives. Growing technological advancements in feedstocks such as used cooking oil, biomass, and artificial fuels are boosting manufacturing potential. Airlines which includes United, Delta, and Airbus are integrating SAF into operations, growing demand. The SAF market is projected to broaden significantly, supported by means of the usage of incentives, carbon offset applications, and commitments to sustainable air tour.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Driver

Environmental Regulations Drive the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market

Governments and global bodies, inclusive of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the European Union (EU), are imposing stringent emission discount tips to fight weather change. These policies mandate lower carbon footprints for the aviation area, accelerating the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). Policies along with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative are pushing airways to integrate SAF into their gas mix. Incentives, subsidies, and penalties for high-emission fuels similarly strengthen SAF manufacturing and investment, making it a key solution for aviation decarbonization.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Restraint

High Production Costs Restraining the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market

The excessive manufacturing value of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains a major barrier to its sizeable adoption. SAF manufacturing is notably greater luxurious than traditional jet gasoline because of pricey feedstocks, complicated refining techniques, and constrained production infrastructure. The rate hollow makes it difficult for airways to completely transition to SAF without economic incentives. While government subsidies and technological improvements are assisting to lower charges, scalability remains a difficulty. Until production reaches economies of scale and fee parity with fossil-based completely fuels, the adoption of SAF will face monetary constraints, slowing down its effect on aviation decarbonization efforts.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures. Industry participants said yesterday that the EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids, and Biomass Fuels is drafting implementing regulations that would include a two-and-a-half year pause to obligatory acceptance of ISCC EU certification for waste-based biofuels. ""This action is said to be subject to further legal scrutiny and will need approval by member states,"" the ISCC said. Currently, member states accept EU-recognised voluntary scheme certification as proof that fuel or feedstocks are compliant with the bloc's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria. Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap. The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels and would seriously jeopardise the ability of the obligated parties to comply with blending mandates,"" the ISCC said. The ISCC has been singled out in a discriminatory way and has supported European Commission and member states' investigations into alleged fraud, it said. ""We are more than surprised by this step […and] are unable to see the rationale of the planned measure, which seems ad hoc and baseless,"" it added. Secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) Xavier Noyon told Argus that, if confirmed, the suspension would affect thousands of operators. ""At this time, member states are refusing to comment, and we call on the commission to urgently clarify any decisions of this nature that are on the table,"" he said. The EBB published its own proposed revision to the RED implementing legislation last month, which expanded the supervisory power of member states over voluntary schemes and certification bodies. The European Commission confirmed that the committee met on 26 March to discuss sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, avoidance of double counting, and alleged fraud. ""We are still working on our examination of this alleged fraud in biodiesel imports from China,"" said commission energy spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. But the commission has not taken any decision yet and cannot allude to ""possible"" scenarios, she said.

Oil, biofuel groups meet to align on RFS policy

New York, 27 March (Argus) — Energy and farm groups met last week at the American Petroleum Institute to negotiate a joint request for President Donald Trump's administration as it develops new biofuel blend mandates, according to five people familiar with the matter. The private meeting involved groups from across the supply chain, including representatives of feedstock suppliers, biofuel producers, fuel marketers, and oil refiners with Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) obligations. The groups coordinated earlier this year around a letter to the Trump administration on the need to update the RFS and are now seeking agreement on other program elements. According to the people familiar with the matter, the groups agree on pushing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set higher blend mandates under the program's D4 biomass-based diesel and D5 advanced biofuel categories. Groups support slightly different volume targets that are nevertheless all in ""a rounding number of each other"" in the D4 category, according to one lobbyist. But there is still disagreement about whether to ramp up mandates quickly in 2026 or provide a longer runway to higher volumes. Clean Fuels Alliance America and farm groups have publicly supported a biomass-based diesel mandate of at least 5.25bn USG starting next year, which could justify a broader advanced biofuel mandate above 9bn USG, according to the people familiar, though others worry about fuel cost impacts if mandates spike so quickly. The current mandate for 2025 is 7.33bn USG in the advanced biofuels category, including a 3.35bn USG mandate for the biomass-based diesel subcategory, so the volumes being pushed for future years would be a steep increase. The RFS, highly influential for fuel and commodity crop prices, requires oil refiners and importers to blend annual amounts of biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those who do. The idea behind the groups' coordination is that the Trump administration might more quickly finalize RFS updates if lobbyists with a history of sparring over biofuel policy can articulate a shared vision of the program's future. One person familiar said the effort comes after the Trump administration directed industry to align biofuel policy goals, though others said they understood the coordination as largely voluntary. EPA did not provide comment. There is less agreement around the program's D6 conventional biofuel category, which is mostly met by corn ethanol. Oil groups have in the past criticized EPA for setting the implied D6 mandate at 15bn USG, above the amount of ethanol that can feasibly be blended into gasoline, though excess biofuels from lower-carbon categories can be used to meet conventional obligations. Ethanol interests support setting the D6 mandate even higher than 15bn USG, which could be a tough sell. The discussions to date have not involved targets for D3 cellulosic biofuels, a relatively small part of the program. A proposal to lower 2024 volumes has hurt D3 credit prices, signaling that future mandates are effectively optional, according to frustrated biogas executives , and has reduced the salience of the issue for other groups. A proposal from President Joe Biden's administration to create a new category called ""eRINs"" to credit biogas used to power electric vehicles has similarly not come up. ""We're not expecting to see any attempt to include eRINs in this next [RFS] proposal,"" Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper told Argus earlier this month. The meeting last week was largely oriented around the RFS, though a National Association of Truck Stop Operators representative raised the issue of tax policy too. The group has been frustrated by the expiration of a long-running blenders credit and the introduction this year of a less generous credit for refiners, which is only partially implemented and has spurred a sharp decline in biomass-based diesel production. But others involved in negotiations, while they acknowledge tax uncertainty could hurt their case for strong mandates, are trying to avoid contentious topics and focus mostly on volumes. Republican lawmakers are separately weighing whether to keep, repeal, or adjust that credit to help out fuel from domestic crops, and there is no telling how long that debate might take to resolve. Another thorny issue discussed at the meeting is RFS exemptions for small refineries. Biofuel producers strongly oppose such waivers and say that exempted volumes should at least be reallocated among facilities that still have obligations. Oil groups have their own views, though it is unclear how involved the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — which represents some small refiners and has generally been more critical of the RFS than the American Petroleum Institute — are in discussions. EPA is aiming to finalize new volume mandates by the end of this year , people familiar with the administration's thinking have said, though timing for a proposal is still unclear. Future conversations among energy and farm groups to solidify points of unity — and strategize around how to downplay disagreements — are likely, lobbyists said. RIN prices rally Speculation over the trajectory of the RFS, and the potential for higher future volumes, supported soybean oil futures and widened the bean oil-heating oil (BOHO) spread. The BOHO spread maintains a positive correlation with D4 RIN prices as a widening value raises demand for D4 credits as biofuel producers look to offset higher production costs. Thursday's session ended with current-year ethanol D6 credits valued between 79¢/RIN and 82¢/RIN, while their D4 counterparts held at a premium and closed with a range of 84¢/RIN to 89¢/RIN. These gains each measured more than 5.5pc growth relative to Wednesday's values.

Promoting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production can help Pakistan boost national energy security, large-scale economic activity, and foreign direct investment while reducing crop waste and air pollution, economic and energy experts and environmental activists said.

They said that Pakistan is uniquely positioned to harness its abundant agricultural resources and establish itself as a key player in SAF production. By leveraging its vast agricultural base, the country can simultaneously address four critical challenges: enhancing national energy security, stimulating large-scale economic activity, attracting foreign direct investment, and mitigating crop waste and the air pollution caused by its burning.

Speaking with The Express Tribune, they said that globally, nations across various industrial sectors are striving to reduce emissions, and the aviation industry is no exception. As efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of air travel gain momentum, sustainable aviation fuel is emerging as a transformative solution.

They noted that with mandates in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), along with the United States' strategic initiatives driving SAF adoption, Pakistan can capitalise on SAF production while repurposing its crop residues. With global aviation fuel demand exceeding 250 million metric tonnes annually, the shift to SAF presents both a monumental challenge and a transformative opportunity.

SAF is a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from sustainable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food biomass.

Commercially, two key technologies dominate SAF production: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ). The selection of technology depends on the type of biomass available for SAF production. HEFA technology is utilised for lipid-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible vegetable oils, while ATJ technology is best suited for sugar-based feedstocks, such as wheat straw, rice husks, and bagasse waste.

SAF produced through these two technologies provides a ""drop-in"" fuel that is fully compatible with existing jet engines and infrastructure. An emerging and highly promising third technology involves utilising carbon dioxide as a feedstock, though it is not yet commercially available.

Eminent energy scientist and expert in a circular economy Dr Adeel Ghayur said that commercial SAF technologies offer production capacities ranging from 100,000 tonnes to as much as one million tonnes annually.

He explained that refineries on the higher end of this spectrum require multibillion-dollar investments but have the potential to generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs, boosting economic activity in their regions.

He noted that currently, SAF is priced at approximately $2,500 per metric tonne, significantly higher than conventional aviation fuel, which costs around $700 per metric tonne.

As the international community tightens its regulatory frameworks for sustainable aviation, Pakistan is presented with a unique window of opportunity that represents both an environmental imperative and a tremendous economic prospect.

Crop residues burned during both winter and summer in Pakistan represent an underutilised resource with immense potential for SAF production. In Punjab alone, it is estimated that millions of tonnes of rice residue are burned each winter to prepare fields for the next planting season. Furthermore, additional crop residues become available during the wheat harvest. Together, these biomass resources hold the capacity to support the establishment of multiple SAF refineries, transforming a major environmental challenge into an economic and ecological opportunity.

He said, ""The starting point for Pakistan's SAF transformation lies in developing a well-rounded, multipronged strategy focused on attracting foreign investment, equipping local industries with the necessary knowledge, infrastructure, and skills, and fostering the development of robust indigenous research and development (R&D) capabilities. Strengthening R&D is essential for Pakistan to remain competitive in the global SAF market, secure its position as a hub for innovation, and maintain leadership as SAF adoption rises across Asia. This comprehensive policy roadmap will serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst to propel Pakistan to the forefront of the global SAF revolution.""",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image-41743620911-0/image-41743620911-0.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 15:56:08.910128

That’s all part of the governor’s tax bill, HF2437, which is being carried by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and was presented to the House Taxes Committee on Wednesday.

The committee laid the bill over, as amended, and will consider its provisions for possible omnibus bill inclusion.

“In light of very tough budget times, this is a responsible and practical tax bill,” said Revenue Commissioner Paul Marquart. “It really looks to create a more fair and stable tax system while also creating new economic development and new jobs.”

In addition to changes it would make to individual income taxes, corporate franchise taxes, property taxes, and local government aids, the bill would make accounting services, banking and brokerage services, and legal services all subject to sales taxes. And it would lower the state’s effective general sales tax rate to 6.8% from its current 6.875%.

The bill would also:

expand the tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel;

repeal the option to assign a refund in advance of claiming the K-12 education credit on a tax return;

eliminate the political contribution refund;

make the research credit partially refundable;

modify transfer provisions for the short line railroad credit;

establish a specific tax levy for airlines;

clarify the definitions of electrical attachments and appurtenances for property taxes;

modify provisions for leased tax-exempt property;

reduce the appropriation for aquatic invasive species prevention aid by 50%;

reduce payment in lieu of tax amounts by 34% and clarify there are no cost-of-living adjustments;

modify provisions for certificates of rent paid;

reduce the annual per acre payment for land enrolled in the sustainable forest incentive program;

repeal local government cannabis aid and partial cannabis tax revenue dedication; and

repeal provisions related to tax filing modernization.

The Revenue Department estimates that if provisions are adopted it would increase revenue by $60.7 million in fiscal year 2026, that number growing to $136.8 million in fiscal year 2027.

The expansion of taxes on accounting, banking, brokerage and legal services is projected to add $136.3 million to the General Fund in fiscal year 2026, while the reduction in the state’s general sales tax rate would reduce it by an estimated $61.9 million.

The new performance standards for new cars and vans will allow manufacturers greater flexibility in meeting vehicle emission targets between 2025 and 2027.

This proposal, part of the Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector unveiled on March 5, 2025, seeks to balance sustainability goals with industry realities.

Commenting on the proposal, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Our highly innovative automotive industry is decarbonising to contribute to the fight against climate change, but also to maintain its competitive edge on the world markets.

With today’s initiative, we grant more flexibility to this key sector, and at the same time, we stay the course of our climate goals. Together, we want to prove that decarbonisation and competitiveness can go hand in hand.”

Three-year averaging to ease compliance burden

Under the new framework, automakers will be assessed on their vehicle CO2 emissions performance over a three-year period rather than annually.

This means that any excess emissions in one year can be offset by outperforming targets in subsequent years.

The goal is to provide the industry with stability while still adhering to the 2025 emission targets and keeping the transition to zero-emission mobility on track.

A strategic step towards 2050 zero-emission goals

The amendment stems from extensive industry consultation following the launch of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Industry by President von der Leyen on January 30, 2025.

This dialogue has been instrumental in shaping policies that consider both environmental imperatives and economic realities.

By maintaining long-term reductions in vehicle CO2 emissions, the EU aims to reinforce its position as a global leader in sustainable transport.

Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, added: “Since the launch of the Automotive Strategic Dialogue at the end of January, we have worked closely with the industry on the road to the sector’s clean transition.

“This additional compliance flexibility shows that we have listened, understood the concerns, and are taking action to address them while maintaining our zero-emission targets. Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments.”

Industry reaction: Flexibility welcomed, but more support needed

The automotive sector has largely welcomed the three-year averaging approach, viewing it as a pragmatic solution to ongoing market and geopolitical challenges.

However, industry leaders stress that regulatory flexibility must be paired with stronger incentives for electric vehicle adoption and enhanced charging infrastructure.

With battery electric vehicles (BEVs) currently making up just 15% of the market, additional measures will be crucial to accelerating the shift toward zero-emission transport.

Sigrid de Vries, Director General of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), explained: “We call on the European Parliament and Council to ensure the fast adoption of this amendment.

“The next important step is then to thoroughly assess the transformation’s overall progress, with a focus on refining the approach – not the end goal – where necessary.

“This is no less important for the commercial vehicles sector: with zero-emission trucks accounting for only 2% of all new registrations, this vehicle segment urgently needs an acceleration of the review of its CO2 standards to 2025, too, based on an assessment of the sectors’ enabling conditions.”

The Commission urges lawmakers to swiftly finalise the amendment, ensuring regulatory certainty for manufacturers and investors alike as the EU moves towards its ambitious 2050 climate goals.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2185012229.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 12:56:27.111692

Jeroen van Heiningen is the founder and managing director of 123Carbon. The company works with fuel suppliers and carriers to issue transparent and externally verified environmental attribute certificates, including SAF certificates, used by airlines and cargo operators to reduce their transport-related Scope 3 emissions.

Jeroen discusses the sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market, focusing on carbon insetting, the role of SAF registries, and the importance of transparency and standardization in the industry. He explains how carbon insetting differs from carbon offsetting, emphasizing the need for companies to invest in their value chain de-carbonization. The discussion also covers the digital certificate process, the collaboration between 123Carbon and IATA, and future trends in the SAF market.

123Carbon’s registry is integrated with other IT systems and allows an airline to upload documents and manage its inventory of digital certificates online. It’s a multi-modal agnostic platform that can be branded. With the use of sustainable bio-fuel growing in the land and sea modes of transportation, the accounting needs to be integrated with air.

123Carbon recently introduced Carboninsets.com, a free service for forwarders and cargo owners that connects them with issuers on the registry.

Jeroen set-up and led Accenture’s Sustainability Services Benelux and wrote the CDP NL 50 report in 2010. He has 15 years of experience with multi-modal carbon insetting programs, covering both Air (KLM corporate biofuels Program) and Marine (the GoodShipping Program). He holds a master’s in business administration from Tilburg University.

Takeaways:

Carbon insetting is a more effective long-term approach than offsetting.

Companies are increasingly linked to net-zero targets managed by SBTi. (Science Based Targets initiative)

Standardization in the SAF market is crucial for transparency.

Digital certificates are essential for tracking SAF transactions.

Collaboration between registries helps prevent double counting of SAF.

The SAF market is evolving with a focus on multimodal transportation.

Demand and supply must be connected to stabilize SAF prices.

New services like CarbonInsets.com facilitate connections between issuers and buyers.

The aviation industry is leading in SAF adoption compared to other transport modes.

Future initiatives will focus on integrating various transportation modalities.

Allied Pilots Association Urges Passage of the Safer Skies Act of 2025

The Allied Pilots Association (APA), representing 16,000 American Airlines pilots, supports the bipartisan Safer Skies Act of 2025. The Act is “aimed at closing critical security loopholes in airport security,” according to U.S. Representative Nick Langworthy (NY-23), who introduced the legislation.

Langworthy says, “The Safer Skies Act will close a loophole that has allowed certain operators, like ticketed charter flights, to bypass the rigorous screening requirements that ensure the safety of all passengers. It is vital for protecting our skies and the lives of passengers and crew alike.”

“Specifically, the Safer Skies Act would require the TSA to update its security screening requirements for Part 135 [charter flights, air taxi services, and medical evacuation flights] and Part 380 [public charter flights] operators that offer individual seats in advance, provide publicly available schedules, and operate passenger seat configurations of more than nine seats.” It would “ensure that these operators are held to the same security standards as any other scheduled commercial airline.”

This legislation has also received support from the Airline Pilots Association, Intl., National Air Carrier Association, Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Association of Flight Attendants, Air Line Pilots Association, Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, Transport Workers Union, and the NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots.

KC-135 Stratotanker Could Fly Past 100 Years in Service

The U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command has suggested their KC-135 Stratotanker fleet may serve beyond the 2050 stated retirement date with a life extension and upgrade program. About 376 KC-135s are still in service. All KC-135’s were converted from the original TF33 engine to CFM56 engines. The Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS) is considering the possibility of a stealthy tanker design.

Airbus touts open-fan engines and folding wing designs for next narrowbody jet

During the 2025 Airbus Summit, the airframer hinted at what a new narrowbody delivered in the second half of the 2030s might look like. Artistic renderings show a conventional tube-and-wing design with open-fan engines under the low wings. Airbus is targeting a 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared with the A320neo-family aircraft. Airbus also mentioned long wingspan folding wings and biomimicry.

Mid-Air Collision Alarm Leaves Passengers With Broken Back And Ankle As Pilots Of United Airlines Flight To San Francisco Suddenly Pitched Up

The NTSB published its final report of a September 19, 2024, incident where the pilots of a United Airlines B757 flight had to take evasive action to avoid hitting an aircraft. As a result of the maneuver, two passengers sustained injuries. The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), also known as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), sounded on United Flight 2428 due to an aircraft passing 1,500 feet below them. The FO disengaged the autopilot and pitched the plane upward.

ACI Europe, which represents airports, said they were doing ""more than their fair share"" in decarbonising aviation and accused IATA of shifting responsibility.","By Tim Hepher and Joanna Plucinska

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -Global airlines have issued their bluntest warning yet that efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 are sliding off course, as the head of their main trade body accused oil firms and the rest of the aviation sector of dragging their feet.

Airlines agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). But cracks have appeared as airlines clash with airports, manufacturers, air traffic control agencies and energy companies.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told Reuters in an interview that airline bosses are increasingly alarmed at the unbalanced burden of the target.

""We don't see others playing their part. In fact, they're behind where they should be and moving in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""They're all committed, so long as we pay the bill. And that's just unacceptable.""

The outspoken former British Airways boss doubled down on recent comments, reported by Aviation Week, in which he predicted increasing pressure to reassess the target.

That marks a shift in tone from an IATA gathering just 10 months ago when Walsh described the target as ""existential not optional"" and hailed a ""fundamental consensus"" in aviation.

""We're going to have to reevaluate the commitment to net zero in 2050, because we're just not getting the support that the airlines require,"" he said.

""What I'm seeing now is more and more concern being expressed by airline CEOs that more is expected of the industry, which is going to cost even more than the eye-watering estimates that we've had.""

The next test could be IATA's annual meeting in New Delhi in June.

""It's not our intention to formally revisit (the target),"" he said. ""But it would not surprise me if we get calls from member airlines to look again at that commitment, because (it) was made on the basis that everybody would play their part.""

'PLAYING THEIR PART'

Walsh also dismissed an interim goal by governments to reduce emissions 5% by 2030 through the use of low-carbon fuels. IATA opposes interim targets, given there is enough SAF available for only 1% of today's fuel needs.

Walsh criticised fuel companies as the ""cause of the problem"", saying they had ignored their own SAF supply promises.

""They've got to start playing their part,"" he said, adding that airlines would spend an additional $3.8 billion on fuel this year due to government mandates and broader carbon emissions pledges.

FuelsEurope, which represents conventional and renewable energy firms, did not respond to a request for comment.

Airlines would also take stock of delays in new aircraft deliveries, Walsh said.

""It would be foolish for us not to flag these issues and foolish of us to believe that we are on track,"" he said.

Groups representing the aerospace industry in Brussels and Washington said manufacturers remain committed to supplying efficient new jets but face persistent supply chain issues.

Walsh also blamed airports and a stalled two-decade effort to reform airspace in Europe.

""These guys can't try and benefit from the halo effect of what the airlines are doing, if they're not prepared to commit to supporting the industry,"" he said.

ACI Europe, which represents airports, said they were doing ""more than their fair share"" in decarbonising aviation and accused IATA of shifting responsibility. CANSO, an air traffic control umbrella group, could not immediately be reached.

Walsh said airlines were not interested in a ""blame game"", but that, if net-zero goals were to be met, the entire sector needed to understand the state of play.

""It's reality. We're highlighting the nature (and) scale of the challenge,"" he said.

Expected to be formalized within the next two months, this initiative aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts while lowering clean energy costs in India and helping Japan meet its climate commitments.

Under the JCM, Japanese companies will invest in and deploy advanced carbon-reduction technologies in India.

In return, Japan will receive carbon credits that can offset its emissions or be traded within its national carbon market.

The initiative falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, ensuring internationally recognized and verifiable emissions reductions.

A wide range of sectors—including solar thermal energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—are expected to benefit from JCM investments.

Relevant: India To Launch Carbon Market In 2026, Says Power Minister

India can strategically direct these funds toward underdeveloped clean energy sectors, leveraging Japanese expertise to accelerate its transition to a low-carbon economy.

Japan has already established similar agreements with 11 other countries, including Indonesia, Kenya, and Vietnam.

However, negotiations with India have been ongoing since 2014, reflecting the complexity of such high-stakes climate agreements.

While the JCM promises significant environmental and economic benefits, challenges remain. Ensuring that emissions reductions are not double-counted will be critical to maintaining the mechanism’s credibility.

Additionally, India must develop the capacity to sustain and expand these technologies independently over time.

“We will accelerate gas production in the next five years,” Vice President He Jiangchuan told the briefing.
Top refiner Sinopec, which already operates the nation’s largest shale gas field, recently announced a major shale oil discovery in Shandong province.
It’s developed the Bohai Sea into the nation’s largest oil and gas field, and is moving into the trickier deeper waters of the South China Sea.
Souring Oil The gas boom is needed to replace the industry’s traditional oil business, which is struggling as China rapidly adopts EVs.","China’s energy giants are increasingly pivoting to natural gas to raise production, as demand for oil slows and global trade tensions heighten the risks of relying too heavily on imports.

The nation’s gas output is poised to surpass that of crude oil for the first time this year, with each of the three state-owned majors — PetroChina Co., Cnooc Ltd. and Sinopec — setting higher production targets for the cleaner-burning fuel. To deliver that growth, the firms are expanding into technically challenging areas including unconventional shale fields and deep-water reserves.

The shift to gas has been underway for years, initially spurred on by the government’s desire to clear the coal-fired smog that used to choke its megacities. But the transition has become more urgent as the electric-vehicle boom slams the brakes on oil consumption, leaving gas as the only upstream growth market for drillers.

“Buyers will take all the gas we produce — there’s tremendous growth potential,” Cnooc President Yan Hongtao said last week at the company’s annual earnings briefing.

The production push in the world’s largest gas importer threatens to add to a coming wave of global supply, led by new liquefied natural gas export plants that are due to come online in places like Qatar and the US over the next few years. More gas is also being piped overland from Central Asia and Russia, China’s strategic partner since the invasion of Ukraine.

With economic growth constrained by the slowdown in the real estate sector, Chinese energy firms are being forced to resell unneeded cargoes of the fuel to other buyers in Europe and Asia. Domestic gas prices in China are already showing signs of weakness. China produces enough gas to meet about 60% of its own consumption.

Difficult Drilling

Still, gas proved a major driver of record profits last year at PetroChina, the nation’s largest supplier of the fuel. Gas now accounts for 54% of the firm’s total output, Chairman Dai Houliang said at a briefing on Monday. Despite planned spending cuts this year, the firm intends to accelerate shale development, LNG terminal construction and pipeline expansion to support the boom.

“We will accelerate gas production in the next five years,” Vice President He Jiangchuan told the briefing. Output from shale could grow 31% in the next five years, while production from coal-rock formations could double this year, he said.

The focus on new, more technically challenging formations comes amid declining output from aging onshore wells that have been the industry’s mainstay for decades. Top refiner Sinopec, which already operates the nation’s largest shale gas field, recently announced a major shale oil discovery in Shandong province.

Meanwhile, offshore driller Cnooc is poised to lead production gains among the big three this year and next. It’s developed the Bohai Sea into the nation’s largest oil and gas field, and is moving into the trickier deeper waters of the South China Sea.

Souring Oil

The gas boom is needed to replace the industry’s traditional oil business, which is struggling as China rapidly adopts EVs. Refining profits last year were battered after overall oil consumption dropped 1.2% compared to a 7.3% rise in gas demand.

That shift has been particularly painful for Sinopec, the nation’s largest fuel maker, and the only one of the three majors to see net income shrink in 2024. That’s one reason the company pledged to keep domestic output stable this year despite cutting capital spending.

“We will not back down on upstream expansion,” Sinopec Vice Chairman Zhao Dong said at a briefing last week.

On the Wire

China’s steel exports could drop 9-14% this year, the first fall since 2020, as more trading partners step up anti-dumping controls, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

China’s rising manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, to a March reading of 50.5, signals Beijing’s stimulus is delivering, with an incipient recovery in energy demand setting the tone, BI said.

Ships are the backbone of global trade, and Donald Trump is unhappy that most of them are made in China.

,,2025-04-02 10:51:23+00:00,www.consultancy.eu,Self-driving wheelchairs at Schiphol Airport: Behind the scenes with Arlande,"Consultancy.eu, www.consultancy.eu",,,,,https://www.consultancy.eu/news/11548/self-driving-wheelchairs-at-schiphol-airport-behind-the-scenes-with-arlande,"Schiphol made the headlines last year with the launch of a new pilot for self-driving wheelchairs, helping passengers with reduced mobility to their gate.
“The idea of self-driving wheelchairs came from the service owner of PRM.
“You have airlines, of course, who are responsible for requesting assistance for their passengers,” Wildenberg explains.
The technology has been provided by a Japanese company which already has experience with self-driving wheelchairs at other airports, including Tokyo, Miami and Los Angeles.
The first results of the pilot have been positive: passengers rated the self-driving wheelchairs with a score of 4.2 on a 5-point scale.","Schiphol made the headlines last year with the launch of a new pilot for self-driving wheelchairs, helping passengers with reduced mobility to their gate. Jasper Wildenberg, market lead for Aviation at Arlande, was responsible for the implementation of this innovation project from the start – we spoke with him on the project’s background, the challenges and Arlande’s role.

In 2024, 66.8 million people flew from, via or to Schiphol, making it the world’s fifth busiest airport. An increasing number of passengers require mobility support, and in order to better serve passengers with reduced mobility (PRM in aviation jargon), the airport set out to improve its services to this group of passengers.

“The question arose as to how we could improve our service for passengers who have difficulty walking and the long distances at Schiphol, and how autonomous and independent travel could be provided,” says Jasper Wildenberg. “The idea of self-driving wheelchairs came from the service owner of PRM. So the idea was already there, but there was no clear business case. Research was also needed into the technical feasibility.”

Wildenberg came on board the project as a consultant, just after the intention to test self-driving wheelchairs had been expressed.

Complex stakeholder landscape

One of the biggest challenges was the crowded stakeholder landscape at Schiphol. “You have airlines, of course, who are responsible for requesting assistance for their passengers,” Wildenberg explains. “The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management was also involved because of legislation and regulations. In addition, internal stakeholders, such as fire safety experts, also joined in due to the increasing number of batteries being charged in the terminal.”

Within this complex field of stakeholders, Wildenberg played a pivotal role. His task was to ensure that the project maintained momentum amid the complexity of operational interests at hand – keeping everyone well-informed, and rowing in the same direction with regards to the autonomous wheelchair pilot.

Focus on the passenger experience

With a robust and broadly supported plan, the project team managed to bring all parties on board. A crucial element of buy-in was the fact that the project was worth the investment because it contributes to a better experience for passengers with reduced mobility. They can still opt for personal support from the airport, but now also have an additional option of choosing to travel autonomous.

“They are always ready,” says Wildenberg. “Passengers can now be helped in the way they prefer. Due to this approach, Schiphol’s management ultimately chose for the importance of individual passenger experience and needs. Quality is the most important driver and that is what sets Schiphol apart from other airports, which are often more focused on efficiency.”

The pilot phase

During the pilot phase, 10 self-driving wheelchairs have been deployed across Schiphol. The technology has been provided by a Japanese company which already has experience with self-driving wheelchairs at other airports, including Tokyo, Miami and Los Angeles. “We went to Japan to see how the wheelchairs work and react to passengers there,” says Wildenberg.

The first results of the pilot have been positive: passengers rated the self-driving wheelchairs with a score of 4.2 on a 5-point scale. “Despite raising a few eyebrows among bystanders, when they drive back empty after a passenger has been dropped off at a gate”, highlights Wildenberg.

Also the airlines have reacted positive to the innovation. Passengers who have some form of disability, visible or invisible, are provided a better service.

The project has meanwhile caught the public imagination beyond the airport, too, featuring in a number of national news stories. Encouraged by the good reception, Schiphol is fully promoting its innovation, including through press releases and social media.

The next steps

As the pilot draws to a successful close, Wildenberg has drawn some important lessons from the experience. Most important, he says, is that it is “crucial to remain flexible” when implementing new ideas.

He expands, “If a stakeholder does not cooperate, you have to switch: either you have to adjust your goals, or you have to see if the project is still effective and feasible if such a stakeholder drops out.”

For Wildenberg, this is almost the end of his role. Reflecting on his contribution, he says he is proud to have worked on such an impactful project – because “as a consultant, you naturally want to make a difference”. Now thousands of passengers with reduces mobility will in the foreseeable future be able to enjoy a better travel experience.",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-04-02-104735247-2025-03-25-075027803-Zelfrijdende_rolstoelen_op_Schiphol-_Een_blik_achter_de_schermen_met_Arlande_spotlight.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 11:56:34.633220

The initiative aims to establish a robust supply chain for SAF feedstock derived from waste cooking oil. This collaboration is a key step towards decarbonizing Thailand’s aviation sector and supporting the nation’s broader renewable energy objectives, reports Reccessary.

The Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM), under the MOI, hosted a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signing ceremony with the participating industry players on March 31st.

A significant aspect of this partnership is that many of the involved companies generate substantial quantities of waste cooking oil as a byproduct of their regular operations. This provides a “cost-effective and readily available source of raw material for SAF production.” Currently, high SAF prices are partly attributed to limited feedstock availability, making waste cooking oil a particularly “viable option to help bring down costs.”

The six major companies joining forces with the Thai government in this endeavor are Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Minister of Industry Akanat Promphan stated that “discussions regarding potential collaboration with Bangchak Corporation have already commenced.” The envisioned plan involves utilizing the collected waste cooking oil to produce SAF while simultaneously promoting the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model. According to the Minister, “this approach will enhance the value of waste, reduce carbon emissions from industries, and contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change.”

Beyond establishing a system for sourcing waste cooking oil, the initiative also aims to increase public awareness and encourage participation through various “campaigns, educational programs, and network-building efforts,” ultimately guiding the economy towards a low-carbon and sustainable future.

Bangchak CEO Chaiwat Kovavisarach offered two crucial recommendations to the government. These include “expanding the range of suitable feedstocks for SAF production” and “establishing clear and consistent regulations regarding SAF blending mandates, coupled with investment incentives.” Mr. Kovavisarach believes that these measures will significantly boost investor confidence, attract long-term investments in the sector, and solidify Thailand’s position as a regional leader in the clean aviation fuel market.

As a pioneering force in Thailand’s SAF development, Bangchak is on track to commence production at its facility in Bangkok during the second quarter of 2025. The estimated daily output is expected to be around 1 million liters. The company has already secured confirmed customers, including Shell Eastern Trading in Singapore and Japan’s Cosmo Oil.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 08:56:29.857403

The growing demand for sustainable fuel in the aviation sector is driving the global need for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The adoption of SAF plays a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. Governments worldwide are increasingly promoting sustainable development across various industries, which is expected to further accelerate the use of sustainable fuels in the coming years. An increase in investment in renewable energy, coupled with the implementation of stricter energy regulations, is anticipated to support the growth of the global SAF market. Leading SAF companies are shifting from crude oil processing to renewable fuels to expand their revenue streams and investing in carbon-neutral jet fuels to capture a larger market share.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable or waste-derived fuel that meets sustainability standards. It can be produced from various sustainable resources such as agricultural and forestry waste, cooking oils, carbon captured from the atmosphere, and green hydrogen. SAF can be mixed with traditional jet fuel to reduce emissions and is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it can be used without requiring changes to aircraft or infrastructure. High-quality SAF plays a crucial role in cutting carbon dioxide emissions, with its emissions throughout production, distribution, transportation, and combustion being about 75% lower than those of fossil-based jet fuels. The potential for oil & gas refineries to integrate SAF technologies is vast, as SAF reduces harmful particulate and sulfur emissions by up to 90% and 100%, respectively.

Climate Change Concerns Driving the Demand for SAF

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, requiring collective efforts across governments, societies, and industries to address it. Aviation, along with sectors like cement, steel, plastics, trucking, and shipping, contributes to approximately 30% of global annual carbon emissions. The rise in aviation emissions is linked to the increase in air travel. Projections suggest that air passenger journeys could exceed 10 billion by 2050, and the aviation sector is expected to return to its pre-COVID share of about 3% of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Under a “business as usual” scenario, emissions could reach 21.2 gigatons of CO2 from 2021 to 2050.

Governments worldwide are adopting sustainable fuels and carbon capture technologies to reduce CO2 emissions, and the growing adoption of SAF is expected to help mitigate aviation sector emissions. SAF could reduce emissions by approximately 65%, helping the aviation industry reach its net-zero emissions target by 2050. The use of sustainable jet fuel is projected to increase in the 2030s as global policies support SAF and it becomes more competitive with fossil kerosene.

Expansion of SAF Deployment

Aviation companies are committed to reducing their net CO2 emissions by 2050. In October 2021, IATA member airlines pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 during the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in Boston. This commitment aligns the air transport sector with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Several countries are introducing energy regulations aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. However, the aviation sector is considered one of the most challenging to decarbonize, making SAF adoption one of the largest opportunities to help meet and exceed the industry’s 2050 goals. The sector is expected to require around 450-500 million tons of renewable jet fuel annually by 2050 to meet these targets.

Strong government support to channel feedstocks toward aviation, rather than other transport sectors, is expected to help address challenges in scaling up SAF use. In 2020, SAF cost $1.10 per liter compared to $0.50 per liter for conventional jet fuel. However, conventional jet fuel prices are projected to rise in the coming years, while SAF prices are expected to decrease. Market players are also likely to invest in the research and development of diverse feedstocks, including non-food crops, waste sources, and power-to-liquid fuels derived from recycled or directly captured CO2.

The Surge in Biofuel Adoption

The global sustainable aviation fuel market is divided into biofuels, power-to-liquid, and gas-to-liquid fuel types. The biofuel segment held the largest market share of 95.7% in 2021 and is expected to maintain dominance throughout the forecast period. Biofuels are derived directly or indirectly from organic materials, such as plant materials and animal waste. These fuels can deliver similar performance to petroleum-based jet fuels with a significantly lower carbon footprint. They can be produced from crops, forestry, agricultural waste, fishery products, or municipal waste.

The Growing Demand for HEFA-SPK Technology

The global SAF market is classified based on technology, including HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, HFS-SIP, ATJ-SPK, and power-to-liquid. The HEFA-SPK segment dominated the market in 2021, accounting for 95.3% of the market share. The HEFA-SPK process uses fatty feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and waste fats, which undergo an oxygenation reaction followed by hydrogen addition to break down the fatty compounds into hydrocarbons. These compounds are then refined into various liquid fuels, which can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

A notable transformation is underway in the global aviation sector. The formation of a new not-for-profit body, the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization based in Montreal, marks a significant step toward harmonizing and scaling the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel across the globe.

Establishing Trust with a Global SAF Registry

At the heart of this initiative is the upcoming launch of the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Registry. Designed to document and validate transactions of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, the registry aims to ensure transparency, traceability, and environmental credibility. The initiative emerges at a time when the industry demands infrastructure that not only supports compliance but also incentivizes cross-border collaboration.

From Infrastructure to Market Confidence

The registry addresses a longstanding issue: the highly fragmented supply and consumption patterns of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. By enabling the environmental attributes of the fuel to be claimed regardless of geographic limitations, the registry enhances flexibility and expands market participation. In this way, it does not merely serve as a technical solution but becomes a cornerstone for market liquidity and investor confidence.

A Platform for Collaboration

One of the most significant features of this initiative is its inclusivity. The governing body is open to participation from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This includes producers, airlines, regulators, and even state actors. By doing so, it paves the way for an open, global dialogue that may eventually help unify principles across other regional and national registries.

Beyond Compliance Toward a Collective Goal

The establishment of this body reflects a broader mindset shift within aviation. No longer is the focus solely on compliance; the direction is now one of proactive alignment with climate goals. By separating the governance of the registry from its creators, the initiative builds a framework of accountability and neutrality, which is vital for fostering international trust.

Incentivizing Corporate Responsibility

In addition to helping airlines meet regulatory targets, the registry opens doors for corporate customers. Businesses that are eager to reduce their aviation-related emissions can now claim verified reductions in their own sustainability reports. This model aligns with voluntary decarbonization mechanisms and encourages joint investment into cleaner fuels.

A Forward-Thinking Economic Model

Participation in the registry is free until April of twenty twenty seven. Afterward, it will operate on a cost recovery basis. This approach ensures early adoption without financial barriers, while creating a path toward financial sustainability. It is a reminder that effective climate solutions do not always require profits at the outset—they require scale, credibility, and collective benefit.

Reimagining the Aviation Value Chain

With this initiative, aviation moves from a siloed model to an interconnected ecosystem. Fuel producers, airlines, freight operators, and governments now have a shared platform to record, verify, and exchange data. Such synergy helps reduce emissions across the value chain while making it easier for downstream customers to participate in aviation decarbonization.

Building the Foundations for Harmonization

While different countries and regions have begun creating their own registries and policies for cleaner fuels, the introduction of a global standard lays the groundwork for harmonization. A unified registry allows for better interoperability and reduces friction between regulatory frameworks. This contributes to market efficiency, simplifies compliance, and encourages innovation.

Conclusion

This development is more than the launch of a digital ledger. It is a visionary leap in how the aviation industry collaborates, innovates, and accelerates toward climate resilience. By providing structure to a sector that is often challenged by supply constraints and regulatory complexity, this registry becomes a powerful symbol of transformation. It demonstrates how operational transparency and stakeholder collaboration can unlock scalable, inclusive, and lasting change in aviation.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-10-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-02 06:56:26.031394

This year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released the 2024 reference prices for aviation fuels under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation. More than a routine update, this pricing reveals a deeper narrative: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is no longer a future ambition—it is the present directive. As the EU’s SAF blending mandate kicks off with a 2 percent requirement, these reference prices are not just numbers. They are indicators of the complex interplay between policy, production, and market maturity.

More Than Market Trends

The reference prices extend beyond conventional fuels. While jet fuel and aviation biofuels are pegged to market rates, the new-generation fuels—synthetic, hydrogen-based, and recycled carbon—are benchmarked against estimated production costs. These include feedstock sourcing, energy input, and technological application. The price signals suggest progress in scale, yet underline the continued financial gap compared to fossil-based alternatives.

Notably, average prices for conventional fuels and biofuels have dropped. Conventional aviation fuel is down by 10 percent from last year, and aviation biofuels by a more substantial 25 percent. However, for newer SAF variants, costs are up across the board—recycled carbon fuels, advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, and renewable hydrogen all saw increased estimated production costs for 2024.

Signals of Systemic Change

EASA’s pricing guide is more than economic insight—it forms a regulatory cornerstone. These estimates will shape penalties for non-compliance and influence subsidy allocation under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). As blending mandates tighten over the decades, price transparency becomes critical to fostering investment and supply chain confidence.

The 2024 update serves as a precursor to EASA’s full technical report due in September. That document will offer a comprehensive view of compliance among fuel suppliers, airports, and airlines—and provide a detailed account of SAF development across EU member states.

Navigating the SAF Transition

What makes the current moment especially noteworthy is the differentiated pricing for synthetic aviation fuels based on carbon sourcing. Fuel produced from atmospheric CO2 carries the highest cost—€8,470 per tonne—over eleven times the price of conventional fuel. Meanwhile, synthetic fuels sourced from industrial or biogenic CO2 remain marginally less expensive. These distinctions will matter increasingly as the sub-mandate for synthetic SAFs takes effect in 2030, starting at 1.2 percent and rising to 35 percent by 2050.

For renewable hydrogen, the picture is mixed. While its aviation-specific production cost rose to €7,520 per tonne, low-carbon hydrogen saw a marginal cost decrease. Such data points hint at potential efficiency gains or improved technological integration in select value chains.

Beyond Compliance: Strategy and Momentum

The progression of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and its annual pricing reviews represents a structural shift in how Europe approaches aviation decarbonisation. With rising cost transparency, the groundwork is being laid for smarter procurement, long-term offtake agreements, and incentive structuring.

For operators, this means more than meeting compliance—it means planning investments and partnerships that match the pace of regulation. It also invites questions around procurement strategies: How can airlines hedge against rising SAF production costs? How can airports support supply chain readiness?

Conclusion

The 2024 EASA reference prices reflect both opportunity and challenge. They demonstrate that while conventional and biofuels are becoming slightly more affordable, new fuels remain on a steep pricing curve. But that curve is not a dead end—it is a blueprint.

Policy is working to accelerate the economics of SAF. The groundwork being laid today, in price-setting and compliance mechanisms, is a crucial enabler for reaching 70 percent SAF use by 2050. As EASA’s full report nears, stakeholders across the value chain will need to remain agile, informed, and ready to translate compliance into competitive advantage.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-5-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-02 06:56:36.595195

As the global aviation industry seeks greener alternatives, India’s unique attributes are positioning it to become a powerhouse in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Promise of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a revolutionary shift in how airlines can reduce their carbon footprint. Unlike traditional fossil fuels, SAF is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass waste, used cooking oil, and even municipal solid waste. This fuel not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also offers a pathway to cleaner air—a benefit that resonates strongly with cities battling pollution.

Turning Agricultural Waste into a Green Resource

India is blessed with an abundance of agricultural by-products. Every year, vast quantities of rice and wheat straws are burned, significantly contributing to air pollution, particularly in major cities like Delhi. However, these straws, along with other biomass wastes, can be transformed into a valuable feedstock for SAF production. This innovative approach not only mitigates environmental harm but also adds economic value to what was once considered waste.

India’s Strategic Advantages

Rich Feedstock Availability

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR Development at Airbus, highlights India's enormous potential:

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer. The first one is the availability of feedstock; there is a lot of biomass waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste that can be recovered.""

From rice straws to wheat straws, India’s vast agricultural landscape provides an ideal raw material base for sustainable fuel production. This plentiful supply of feedstock offers a dual advantage—reducing harmful air pollution from open burning and creating a sustainable energy resource.

A Thriving Petrochemicals Industry

India's robust petrochemicals industry, combined with a strong network of refineries and engineering capabilities, creates a fertile ground for scaling up SAF production. These established industries can integrate with innovative fuel technologies, paving the way for a seamless transition from traditional fuels to greener alternatives.

Pioneering Partnerships: Airbus and IIP

Airbus, a global leader in aerospace, has been actively driving the transition towards sustainable aviation. Recognizing India's potential, Airbus has partnered with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) in Dehradun to explore new methods of SAF production. This collaboration aims to overcome technical hurdles and fast-track regulatory approvals, ensuring that India is not left behind in the race towards greener aviation.

Stimulating Global Demand

While Europe currently leads in SAF demand, Airbus is keen on expanding the market globally. By harnessing India's abundant resources, the partnership could significantly boost SAF production, making the fuel more competitive against conventional crude oil. This global shift is essential, as economies of scale can help reduce costs and drive widespread adoption.

Looking to the Future: Policy and Mass Scale Production

Despite its potential, SAF remains more expensive than traditional jet fuel. To truly unlock its benefits, governments worldwide—India included—must implement supportive policies. Whether through mandates or production incentives, policy frameworks will play a crucial role in achieving mass-scale production. Manhes envisions a future where, by 2040 or 2050, India could be producing close to 100 million tonnes of SAF, marking a significant leap forward in sustainable aviation.

The Road Ahead for India

With its fast-growing aviation market and proactive approach to sustainability, India stands at a pivotal juncture. By investing in renewable technologies and crafting forward-thinking policies, India can transition from being a major consumer of fossil fuels to a leading producer of green energy. This transformation holds the promise of cleaner skies, reduced pollution, and a more sustainable future for all.

Conclusion: Taking Flight Toward a Greener Tomorrow

India’s journey towards becoming a global SAF producer is not just about embracing a new technology—it’s about redefining an entire industry. The convergence of abundant agricultural waste, industrial expertise, and strategic international partnerships creates an inspiring blueprint for sustainable development. As policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators collaborate, the prospect of greener aviation isn’t just a dream—it’s a flight path toward a cleaner, brighter future.

With Inputs from Reuters

IndiGo’s parent company, InterGlobe Aviation Limited, has recently found itself at the center of a tax controversy that is stirring up conversations among investors and industry watchers alike. The Income Tax Department has slapped a hefty penalty of Rs 944.20 crore for the assessment year 2021-22 under Section 270A of the Income Tax Act. But what exactly lies beneath this colossal figure?

The Penalty Breakdown

The penalty order is not based on a conventional mistake or oversight—it hinges on what IndiGo describes as an ""erroneous understanding"" by the tax authorities. According to the airline, the department mistakenly presumed that its appeal against a previous assessment order had been dismissed. However, the reality is quite different: the appeal is still pending before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals).

“The order for said penalty under Income Tax has been passed on the basis of an erroneous understanding that the appeal filed by the Company before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) against the Assessment Order under Section 143(3) has been dismissed, whereas the same is still alive and pending adjudication,” stated an IndiGo spokesperson.

A Battle of Interpretations

The Tax Authority's Perspective

From the tax department’s standpoint, the order was issued under strict adherence to Section 270A, which deals with penalties on underreported income. The authorities appear to have interpreted the status of the pending appeal as a dismissal, thus triggering the penalty.

IndiGo’s Counter-Argument

On the flip side, IndiGo is standing its ground by labeling the penalty as “erroneous and frivolous.” The company is not taking this allegation lightly—it plans to contest the ruling through legal channels. For IndiGo, the penalty is a product of misinterpretation rather than a justified punitive measure. This dispute not only reflects the complexities of tax regulations but also highlights the need for clarity in legal interpretations, especially in cases involving high-stake financial figures.

Impact on Business: More Hype Than Hindrance

Despite the sensational headline of a nearly Rs 944.20 crore penalty, IndiGo is quick to reassure its stakeholders. The company maintains that the ruling will not have a significant impact on its financials, operations, or overall business activities. The robust financial management and operational resilience of IndiGo continue to set a benchmark in the aviation industry, even as legal skirmishes emerge off the runway.

What’s Next in the Legal Arena?

The forthcoming legal battle is expected to be closely watched by both the industry and investors. As the case progresses, it will be interesting to see how the nuances of tax law are interpreted by the judicial system. The outcome could set a precedent for how pending appeals are treated in similar cases, thereby influencing future interactions between large corporations and tax authorities.

Final Thoughts: Navigating the Turbulence

While the tax penalty makes for a captivating headline, the situation serves as a reminder of the intricate dance between regulatory authorities and corporate entities. IndiGo’s confident approach in addressing what it deems an administrative misinterpretation underscores its readiness to navigate through regulatory turbulence. As the legal proceedings unfold, one can only watch with bated breath to see whether this will be a misadventure in bureaucratic oversight or a strategic maneuver by the tax department.

Founded by visionary Pramod Chaudhari, the company now offers cutting-edge sustainable marine and aviation fuel as part of its green product portfolio.

As Executive Chair, Chaudhari envisions more breakthroughs in the green energy space with innovations like biohydrogen and renewable polymers on the horizon. He acknowledges Praj’s impact on India’s bioenergy space is committed to sustaining that footprint.

In fact, he is particular about this. “For Praj, one parameter of success is definitely related to the legacy we leave for others to follow and to get inspired from,” he says.

Propelling progress

Chaudhari’s inspiration to set foot in the bioenergy industry came from Brazil.

“Brazil was the first country to go for biofuels after the first fuel crisis of 1973 hit the world,” Chaudhari explains. “India had a good sugarcane industry like Brazil, and we could learn from them.”

That led to the formation of Praj’s first ethanol plant. The ethanol plant was beneficial in more ways than one. It offered a solution to reduce the country’s dependence on fuel imports for one. It also caught on as a remunerative option for farmers.

Chaudhari explains another reason to push for biofuels that started emerging after the turn of the millennium was climate change.

“Ethanol blending is a good solution to control the climate because we are using carbon-neutral fuel,” he says.

This led Praj to expand its product base and start its research center to offer sustainable energy solutions. Among the co-products, it offers compressed biogas, bio-bitumen, biofertilizers and a range of proteins.

The latest in Praj’s portfolio is sustainable aviation fuel, a major milestone in the country’s push for biofuel.

“We partnered with Indian Oil Corporation Limited to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for a commercial flight operated by Air Asia,” Chaudhari reveals.

For the future, he sees sustainable marine fuels and biohydrogen as part of Praj’s products.

He also talks about exciting prospects in producing renewable polymers.

“There are two types of bioplastics – polylactic and polyhydroxyalkanoates. Then, there are paints, varnishes, and surface treatment solutions, which can be used to produce safe toys,” he says.

“The prospects are unlimited.”

Achieving Net Zero

Chaudhari emphasizes the need to create circular economies for a truly sustainable future.

“Climate is going to rule the whole gamut of businesses in the future. So, it makes sense to promote circular economies wherever possible,” he explains. “It is important to sensitize people about that.”

That is why net zero is taken very seriously at Praj.

“We talk about net zero in terms of climate, but we can have net zero for every aspect from water usage, steam usage and having zero defects in our designs and equipment. Zero should be our focus in all walks of life,” he says.

“I am not exaggerating when I say most of our departments are busy with zero. Really, Praj is obsessed with zero.”

As an initiative to promote awareness, Praj has also adopted a village to implement and demonstrate net zero practices.

“When you visit Pune, we’d be proud to take you to two places – the first would be our R&D center, while the second would be our net zero village,” Chaudhari says.

Praj includes suppliers in the circular economy, ensuring a green supply chain.

“We get our suppliers certified for a green supply chain. We rope them in to achieve a community effect that benefits them and us, and the community,” he explains.

‘Delight’ is a key word for the company, according to Chaudhari.

“Customer-centricity is key to Praj. We foster a warm and friendly atmosphere for our employees, who are our pride,” he says.

“We ensure delight for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.”",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/02144922/Pramod-Chaudhari_PRAJ-INDUSTRIES_Sharing-1100x578.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 09:56:26.581329

The SBTi’s consultation survey on the Draft Standard is open until 1 June 2025.","Consultation on the Draft Standard

The SBTi first published its Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021. It has stated that this latest update was made to “align with the latest science and emerging best practice, and in response to stakeholder feedback”.

The Draft Standard contains the following key revisions:

Use of EACs (including carbon credits)

The Draft Standard contains updated provisions on the use of EACs. The approach as set out in the Draft Standard can be summarised as follows:

Scope 2

As in the existing standard, reporting entities will be able to use energy EACs to substantiate direct mitigation for scope 2 market-based targets. Now however, the Draft Standard proposes that entities must “procure contractual instruments conveying a zero-carbon electricity attribute [ie zero-carbon energy certificates] that match their operational electricity use both in time and geographic location”. This approach, linking the scope 2 emissions and energy EAC temporally and spatially, has been taken to increase the effectiveness of permissible EACs.

Scope 3

The Draft Standard proposes a more “nuanced approach” to scope 3 emissions mitigation to address traceability issues (see point 5). Where scope 3 emissions cannot be mitigated directly or via an “activity pool”, entities may use effective indirect mitigation measures on an interim basis. The SBTi’s guidance suggests this refers to energy and commodity certificates, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates.

If indirect mitigation measures are used, these must be reported separately from direct mitigation, and entities will be required to develop and implement policies to increase emissions mitigation within their value chain.

Residual emissions

Whilst the existing standard requires mitigation of residual emissions in the net zero year (and beyond), the Draft Standard proposes that companies address their scope 1 residual emissions in the years up to their net zero year.

The SBTi suggests three options for doing so which each involve carbon dioxide removals:

Requiring near-term and long-term removals targets up to the net zero year (the option currently included in the Draft Standard).

Recognising (but not requiring) near- term and long-term removals targets up to the net zero year.

A more flexible combination of removals and additional emissions mitigation, beyond that required by its 1.5oC aligned targets.

For these purposes, removals may be from pools and sinks within the reporting entity’s value chain or by purchasing removals credits from entities situated beyond the value chain of the company. Where companies use removal credits, these will need to be reported according to the removals project types.

The Draft Standard also introduces the concept of a “durability threshold” for removals targets, which can be applied using two options:

A like-for-like approach in which the specific greenhouse gases emitted by the entity are matched with removals projects whose durability aligns with the atmospheric lifetime of that greenhouse gas.

A gradual transition from less permanent removals (such as nature-based solutions), to more permanent removals (like carbon capture and storage).

Beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM)

The existing standard recommends that companies undertake BVCM to take responsibility for emissions released whilst a company is decarbonising. The Draft Standard seeks to provide additional recognition for companies that take this step (referred to in the Draft Standard as addressing “ongoing emissions”), by enabling them to publicly report on these actions.

As with the existing SBTi guidance on BVCM, the Draft Standard permits the use of “high-integrity carbon credits” for these purposes. As an interesting development, if an entity does use carbon credits for BVCM, the Draft Standard recommends the entity should aim to address 100 per cent of its ongoing emissions.

In relation to the above, the SBTi has explicitly reiterated that offsetting is still not permitted. It defines offsetting as purchasing carbon credits that do not originate from activities in the entity’s value chain to meet emission reduction targets.

Tailored requirements depending on company size and location

There will be two categories of companies under the Draft Standard:

Category A companies (large companies in all geographies, and medium-sized companies in higher income geographies).

Category B companies (medium-sized companies in lower income geographies and all small companies).

The proposed thresholds to categorise ‘large’, ‘medium’ and ‘small’ companies are as follows:

Company size Emissions Balance sheet* Net turnover worldwide* Number of employees Large

Satisfies at least one of the following thresholds. >450m

>1,000

Medium

Satisfies at least two of the following thresholds. >25m

50-450m 250-1,000

Small

Satisfies the emissions threshold and at least two other thresholds. <10,000 tCO2-e (scope1-2)

<25m

<50m

<250

*The currency for these thresholds is either US Dollars or Euros.

Category A companies will continue to be subject to the SBTi’s full criteria, however some elements of these requirements will be optional for Category B companies, in recognition of their size, resources and operating context. For example, Category B companies will not need to set scope 3 near-term targets.

Tougher initial commitment criteria

Under the current standard, as a first step, companies provide a private “commitment letter” to the SBTi in which they pledge to set science-based targets within 24 months.

The Draft Standard instead proposes that companies will need to publicly commit to being net zero by 2050 (or sooner). Category A companies then have 12 months to set their science-backed targets, whilst Category B companies will have 24 months to do this.

Improved accountability mechanisms

The Draft Standard proposes new mechanisms to recognise progress being made towards emissions reduction targets. This will involve more regular assessments, such as “renewal validations” when new targets are set at the end of a 5-year target cycle, and “spot checks”, which might be performed at any time.

Further, Category A companies will now need to obtain third-party assurance on their base year emissions inventory.

More flexible arrangements for setting scope 3 targets

While the current standard requires companies to adopt fixed scope 3 targets (67 per cent for the near-term and 90 per cent for the long-term), the Draft Standard “explicitly incentivizes companies to prioritize action on the most relevant sources of emissions in their value chain”. This means a shift away from rigid targets so that companies will have more freedom to set their own targets.

Moreover, while companies will need to continue reporting all scope 1 and 2 emissions on an annual basis, only “relevant” scope 3 emissions will need to be reported annually. Relevant scope 3 emissions are defined as: emissions sources representing more than 5 per cent of total scope 3 emissions; and emissions-intensive activities representing at least 1 per cent or 10,000 tCO2-e of the entity’s scope 3 emissions.

A more “nuanced approach” to substantiating emissions reduction progress

Although the Draft Standard requires companies to continue prioritising direct mitigation, it permits entities to rely on emissions data and interventions at the “activity pool” level, where it is not possible to identify specific emission sources along a value chain.

The SBTi provides that an “activity pool” represents a set of emissions sources that may physically serve the reporting entity but lack specific traceability to individual sources. For example, a “downstream activity pool” could be the electricity grid powering the products that a company brings to market, where it does not have the actual data on these emissions.

As above, where traceability barriers persist, indirect mitigation measures (such as energy and commodity certificates) will be permitted.

The SBTi’s consultation survey on the Draft Standard is open until 1 June 2025.

We anticipate that further amendments will be made before an additional consultation period and, eventually, final approval. It is intended that reporting entities will use the updated standard from 2027 to set their science-based targets.",https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/-/media/images/nrf/hero/carbon-neutral-concept.jpeg?revision=c8acd80f-1ff4-47eb-9caf-e1a812c7dcee&revision=5250476894507387904,N,,2025-04-02 06:56:50.475537

Paris, March 31, 2025 – The ongoing conversion of the Grandpuits refinery is entering a key phase. Over 1,200 people are working on the project, which includes the launch of an advanced plastics recycling unit, the first in France to use this particular technology, and the construction of a biorefinery for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). Once completed, this vast project will be the Company’s first zero-crude platform.

The complex construction operation, for which as much of the site's equipment as possible is reused, requires the mobilization and expertise of all the employees who know the Grandpuits site. Some projects due to arrive in the second phase — biogas and mechanical recycling — have been suspended and the employees who were to join them are assigned, with their agreement, to the success of the first two major projects. In line with its plans at the outset of the project in 2020, TotalEnergies confirms that 250 jobs will be maintained at Grandpuits following the conversion.

Within a few months, Grandpuits will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year of pyrolysis oil from recycled plastic, and from the beginning of 2026, up to 230,000 tons a year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

This collaboration aims to help decarbonize Thailand’s aviation sector and support the country’s renewable energy goals.

Thailand targets feedstock supply to boost SAF growth

Thailand’s Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM) held a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signing event with industry players on March 31.

Many of these companies generate significant amounts of waste cooking oil as a byproduct of their operations, providing a cost-effective and readily available feedstock for SAF production. High SAF prices are partly due to limited supply, and waste cooking oil is seen as one of the most viable raw materials to help lower costs.

The six companies partnering with the Thai government in this initiative are Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Minister of Industry Akanat Promphan stated that discussions with Bangchak Corporation on potential cooperation have already begun. The plan is to use collected waste cooking oil to produce SAF while promoting the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model. This approach enhances waste value, reduces industrial carbon emissions, and supports climate change mitigation efforts.

Bangchak CEO urges feedstock expansion and clear regulations

Beyond setting up a waste cooking oil supply system, the initiative also seeks to raise public awareness and participation through campaigns, education and network-building, steering the economy toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.

Bangchak CEO Chaiwat Kovavisarach proposed two key recommendations to the government: expanding the variety of SAF feedstocks and establishing clear regulations on SAF blending mandates along with investment incentives. He believes these measures will boost investor confidence, attract long-term investments, and strengthen Thailand’s position as a regional leader in clean aviation fuel.

The Biden administration intends to issue regulations for the tax credits, worth up to $1.75 a gallon, before leaving office in January, Vilsack told a biofuels group. ""I'm confident that we're going to get her done.""

Lucrative tax credits of up to $1.25 a gallon should be available only for low-carbon fuels made from U.S.-grown feedstocks, four farm groups told the Biden administration on Wednesday.

CEO Patrick Gruber discussed the company’s proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in South Dakota during a fourth quarter earnings call, held March 27, indicating financial close could be achieved by year-end.

The 60 MMgy proposed SAF project, planned for development near Lake Preston, South Dakota, received a conditional commitment for the U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee last year. Gruber said Gevo continues to collaborate with the DOE loan office as the company moves forward to achieve the financial goals for the project.

According to Gruber, the company wants to see what Summit Carbon Solutions does regarding its planned CO2 pipeline project before it finalizes economics for the proposed SAF plant. South Dakota recently enacted a low prohibiting the use of eminent domain in the development of CO2 pipeline projects in the state, prompting Summit to ask the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission to pause its pending pipeline permit application. Lawmakers in Iowa are working to implement a similar law banning the use of eminent domain on agricultural lands for CO2 pipeline projects. Despite those setbacks, Gruber said Summit has told Gevo the company still strongly believes “that the pipeline is going to get done.”

Gruber also stressed the proposed SAF project could move forward without the Summit pipeline. Gevo’s recently acquired ethanol plant in North Dakota has its own CO2 sequestration site, which could take in CO2 generated at the proposed SAF plant. “If we went this route, the project returns for [the] South Dakota plant would still be attractive,” Gruber said. Financial close for the South Dakota is currently targeted for year-end, Gruber added.

Engineering work is also underway for the development of SAF capacity at the recently acquired North Dakota ethanol plant. Gruber said development of that project can be expedited by levering work already done for the South Dakota facility.

Gevo also has several other business segments, including a renewable natural gas (RNG) project in Iowa. The company sold 366,557 MMBtu of RNG last year. On a standalone basis, the RNG subsidiary generated $15.8 million in revenue last year. This reflects an increase of $300,000 compared to the previous year, primarily due to higher sales of environmental attributes from the RNG project. Gevo expects to receive a final pathway approval under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program in early 2025, which will allow the company to capitalize on a lower carbon intensity (CI) score.

For the fourth quarter, Gevo reported $8.9 million in combined operating revenue and investment income. Loss from operations was $19.6 million. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $11.3 million.

From 2040, medium-haul aircraft (100 to 250 seats) could use hydrogen on flights lasting 60 to 150 minutes.","At this week’s Hysky conference in Marseille, Airbus’ long-time rival Boeing presented its vision for hydrogen and its derivatives. Instead of tuning in to Airbus’ own online event, the Airbus Summit, attendees had the opportunity to hear about Boeing’s roadmap.

Representing the American aircraft manufacturer was Steven Gillard, who oversees sustainability efforts in Europe. He highlighted Boeing’s long-standing experience with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), noting that the company conducted its first SAF test flight in 2008 with Virgin Atlantic. In 2010, a blend of SAF and kerosene was tested on a US Navy F/A-18 fighter jet. More recently, Boeing supported the first commercial SAF-powered flight in 2018, operated by FedEx.

A Longstanding Commitment to SAF

In 2021, Boeing pledged to make all its aircraft 100% SAF-compatible by 2030—a goal similar to Airbus’. By 2024, the company had purchased a total of 23.8 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel. Boeing is also engaged in research on SAF’s atmospheric impact alongside NASA, the FAA, and DLR. Additionally, it has partnered with European and Middle Eastern entities, including Masdar and Zero Petroleum, to advance SAF production. The company is also investing in biofuels through agreements with firms like SkyNRG and Wagner.

Boeing’s Experience with Hydrogen

Beyond SAF, Boeing has a history with hydrogen, particularly from its work in rocketry. However, its involvement in hydrogen-powered aviation also dates back several years. In 2008, it tested fuel cells in a two-seater aircraft, followed by their integration as auxiliary power units aboard a 737. In 2012, Boeing flew its Phantom Eye aircraft using liquid hydrogen. It later incorporated hydrogen-powered batteries into drones in 2015 and 2020. More recently, in 2021, the company developed a cryogenic hydrogen tank for the aerospace sector.

At Hysky, Steven Gillard commented on Airbus’ timeline for hydrogen aviation, saying he was unsurprised by the projected delays. He noted that significant challenges remain in scaling hydrogen from the demonstrator phase to commercially viable aircraft—particularly regarding hydrogen production.

Long-Haul Hydrogen Flights After 2050?

A slide shared with the audience outlined Boeing’s hydrogen timeline, based on industry projections from the ATAG Waypoint report. According to this estimate:

Hydrogen could begin powering small commuter aircraft (9 to 50 seats) on flights under an hour from 2025.

From 2030, it could be used in regional aircraft (50 to 100 seats) on flights lasting 30 to 90 minutes.

By 2035, hydrogen might be viable for short-haul flights (100 to 150 seats) lasting 45 to 120 minutes.

From 2040, medium-haul aircraft (100 to 250 seats) could use hydrogen on flights lasting 60 to 150 minutes.

However, for long-haul flights in 2045 and 2050, hydrogen was notably absent from Boeing’s projections. Instead, SAF remains the primary candidate for decarbonising long-distance air travel.

Steven Gillard did not provide further details on Boeing’s long-term plans for hydrogen aviation.

Airbus is collaborating with CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran, to develop the open fan engine.

""The fuel consumption characteristics of the open fan are more promising than those of ducted fans,"" explained Christian Scherer, head of plane-making division, Airbus. The company is considering multiple engine placement configurations, either on the aircraft wing or at its rear, and is also in discussions with Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney, CFM International’s main competitors, regarding alternative solutions.

The open fan initiative is part of the aviation industry's broader effort to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The sector, which accounts for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, aims to meet this goal through alternative fuels, new technologies, and aerodynamic improvements, such as longer and lighter wings. Analysts suggest that any new single-aisle aircraft must be at least 20-30% more fuel-efficient than current models and capable of operating solely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

Airbus also reaffirmed its commitment to developing a hydrogen-powered aircraft but did not provide a revised launch date. The company recently postponed its plan to introduce a 100-seat hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035.

How It Works

The photothermocatalytic reactor uses a specialized solar absorber (silicon, germanium, gold, and silver) to capture sunlight and generate heat (120–249°C) without fossil fuels or electricity. This heat drives an ethylene oligomerization process, transforming simple hydrocarbons into long-chain molecules ideal for jet fuel. Unlike traditional methods, the system operates on atmospheric CO₂-derived feedstocks, creating a closed carbon loop.

Scalability Advantages

- Modular design ensures temperature uniformity at scale.

- No solar tracking reduces costs and complexity vs. concentrated solar.

- Compatible with existing fuel infrastructure, easing adoption.

Environmental Impact

Trials show SAF can slash aviation’s climate footprint by:

- 26% reduction in contrail warming effect

- 100% lower CO₂ emissions (when using captured carbon)

- Reduced soot and sulfur pollutants

This innovation complements large-scale solar fuel projects like ETH Zurich’s solar tower but targets regions where concentrated solar farms aren’t feasible.

The Road Ahead

While challenges remain in scaling production, the reactor marks a critical step toward net-zero aviation.

Recent IATA data suggests a similar pattern, with December air cargo rates from Asia to the U.S. rising 8%.
The question is not whether air cargo needs can navigate the current environment, but how quickly it can adapt to new global realities.","Air cargo was a standout performer in 2024, growing 11.3%—outpacing passenger demand. E-commerce expansion and disruptions in sea shipping kept demand high, with yields 39% above 2019 levels. Looking ahead, 2025 is set for another 5.8% growth, but challenges loom: geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, and potential U.S. policy shifts, including new tariffs.

These pressing issues will take center stage at the IATA World Cargo Symposium (WCS) 2025 in Dubai from the 15-17 April. Industry leaders will explore how air cargo can navigate an increasingly complex global trade environment. The symposium will feature plenary sessions, specialized tracks, workshops, and executive summits, addressing:

Digitalization: The role of AI and automation in the future of air cargo.

Sustainability: Strategies for decarbonization, reducing single-use plastics and ESG reporting.

Risk & Resilience: Navigating geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory shifts, and supply chain disruptions.

Digitalization: The Future of Air Cargo

The strength of e-commerce will represent a growing portion of air cargo business. Currently, e-commerce averages about 20% of cargo business industry wide, but it is expected to grow to at least a third of all cargo shipments. Given that, by 2027, e-commerce is expected to be an $8 trillion market segment, the sector stands to reap a significant reward if it can get its product correct.

The Digitalization Stream at WCS will explore how digital solutions are adapting to meet this demand and reshape the industry. Executives will open discussions with keynotes on implementing digital strategies, followed by a fireside chat on IATA’s Digitalization Leadership Charter, which was established to accelerate and sustain the industry's digital transformation. As of December 2024, 17 organizations had signed on.

In addition, a panel will explore the challenges and opportunities as the industry moves towards its target for the adoption deadline for ONE Record by January 1, 2026—a major milestone in data standardization. Spotlight sessions will highlight the power of data transparency, workflow optimization and AI-driven innovations to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Sustainability: Building a Greener Air Cargo Industry

Digitalization and sustainability go hand in hand. With half of all air cargo traveling on passenger aircraft, sustainability efforts will significantly impact the industry's environmental goals. Reducing paper usage, optimizing cargo space and minimizing single-use plastics are priorities. Circularity initiatives—such as recycling Unit Load Devices (ULDs) and increasing the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—are critical to reducing air cargo’s carbon footprint.

WCS 2025 will feature:

A keynote on accelerating SAF adoption.

A panel discussion on CO₂ reduction strategies.

Sessions on mitigating supply chain sustainability risks, leveraging data and innovation, and promoting circularity in operations.

A dedicated spotlight on sustainable pharmaceutical logistics, addressing trends, challenges, and best practices.

The day will conclude with real-world case studies, providing actionable insights into enhancing transparency in environmental reporting and social impacts.

Risk & Resilience: Navigating Global Uncertainty

Geopolitical risks remain a wildcard for air cargo. Potential U.S. tariffs could create short-term spikes in demand—just as seen during the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade war when businesses rushed to move goods before new duties took effect. Recent IATA data suggests a similar pattern, with December air cargo rates from Asia to the U.S. rising 8%.

However, the long-term effects could be more disruptive. Higher costs may weaken demand, drive regional sourcing or push volumes toward ocean freight. Stricter e-commerce regulations, including changes to de minimis exemptions, could further complicate cross-border trade.

At WCS 2025, industry experts will discuss strategies to enhance resilience—from adapting to shifting trade policies and regulatory environments to strengthening supply chain security in an evolving threat landscape.

Workshops

To support the industry’s goals, WCS will also feature workshops on key industry topics, including:

Future Talent: Developing the next generation of air cargo leaders at the Future Air Cargo Executives Summit (FACES).

Competency-Based Training: Enhancing workplace safety and performance through IATA’s CBTA Center.

Market Performance: Optimizing key segments with IATA CEIV programs (Pharma, Live Animals, Lithium Batteries, Fresh).

Cargo Solutions: Leveraging IATA tools for better decision-making, compliance, and efficiency.

E-Commerce Forum: Improving visibility between e-retailers and cargo operators to boost efficiency.

ULD Forum: Exploring ULD design, AI applications, and sustainability data collection.

The Road Ahead: Collaboration is Key

The future of air cargo depends on collaboration across the ecosystem—airlines, logistics providers, technology firms, regulators, and shippers. Dubai, with its world-class logistics infrastructure and strategic position at the crossroads of global trade, offers the ideal setting for these crucial discussions.

As IATA, Emirates SkyCargo and dnata welcome industry stakeholders to WCS 2025, the focus will be on driving innovation, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring air cargo remains a pillar of global trade.

WCS 2025 is more than just an industry event—it’s a call to action. The discussions in Dubai will shape the industry’s trajectory for years to come. The question is not whether air cargo needs can navigate the current environment, but how quickly it can adapt to new global realities.

Gas safety considerations Gas safety is a key safety consideration relating to SAF and is a useful example to explore to better illustrate and understand the challenges involved.
Pathways to sustainable aviation fuel There are three recognised pathways to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","The topic of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been garnering increasing attention over recent years. Currently used as a partial replacement for conventional jet fuel, it is a form of biofuel made from waste products, such as used cooking oil, algae, biowaste and other forms of municipal waste, and which offers significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

SAF was brought into sharp focus at the beginning of the year following the introduction of the UK Government’s SAF Mandate, which came into effect on 1 January. The Mandate requires greater use of sustainable aviation fuels to secure a growing demand for SAF by:

Obligating the supply of an increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix; and

Incentivising SAF supply through the award of tradeable certificates with a cash value.

Over the coming years, the percentage of SAF as a total of UK jet fuel will steadily increase, starting at two per cent this year, reaching 10 per cent by 2030 and increasing to 22 per cent by 2040. It is hoped that the use of SAF could deliver up to 6.3 mega tonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

This is a significant development for UK industry, affecting not just the fuel and aviation sector, but those industries further down the supply chain, such as those involved in the production, processing and storage of biomass and biowaste. In many instances, SAF innovation will rely on novel applications of existing processes, but it will also involve new and lesser-known processes and innovation, leading to a variety of safety challenges across the industry.

The Government’s new Mandate makes it clear that safety standards must not be compromised when introducing new decarbonisation technologies, and this is an important baseline premise.

The importance of safety keeping pace in the broader energy transition is a topic that Dräger has highlighted for some time now, and it applies to many areas of new energy innovation, from SAF and energy from waste to use of hydrogen as a biofuel. Furthermore, ambitious timescales mean that it is all the more imperative that safety is built in at an early stage to ensure the industry gets safety right first time.

Gas safety considerations

Gas safety is a key safety consideration relating to SAF and is a useful example to explore to better illustrate and understand the challenges involved.

It is perhaps inevitable that there will be unknowns and uncertainties in the early stages of new innovations, but in some respects, many of the gas safety considerations related to SAF are not dissimilar to those seen elsewhere in wider industry. For example, good gas detection and monitoring has been a cornerstone of safe operations in industries such as wastewater treatment or chemical processing for decades.

The Government’s new mandate makes it clear that safety standards must not be compromised when introducing new decarbonisation technologies. Photograph: Draeger

The key difference when it comes to SAF is the combination of new applications, new processes, frequently new people working in an early-stage industry, and the creation of new safety processes and protocols. In emerging industries, it’s vital that the knowledge and experience gained through more established sectors (such as oil and gas or the chemical industries) is borne in mind and applied wisely wherever appropriate.

Pathways to sustainable aviation fuel

There are three recognised pathways to produce sustainable aviation fuel. These are:

1. HEFA (hydro-processed esters and fatty acids), which is a fuel developed from oils or fats, such as used cooking oil.

2. Non–HEFA – which includes several different methods of making advanced fuels from wastes and residues, such as fuel made from municipal solid waste.

3. Power to liquid – this is a relatively new technique which provides a promising and scalable fuel for the future. The process combines carbon dioxide, water and renewable energy to produce SAF with properties that are similar to conventional jet fuel. The three major steps that comprise this pathway are carbon capture, hydrogen production and hydrocarbons synthesis.

HEFA and Non–HEFA

These techniques are the most widely adopted and currently provide the only commercially viable technology, and it is believed that this will enable the UK to reach the first 2030 threshold for SAF.

However, there is a lack of aromatics in HEFA feedstocks. These aromatics are reactive molecules which are needed for maintaining seal compatibility. Fuel-seal compatibility is, unsurprisingly, an important consideration for SAF certification and blending limits so it is not advisable to use more than 50 per cent HEFA SAF to maintain the required fuel characteristics and maintain the long-term health of the aircraft engine.

The production of HEFA SAF involves the hydrotreatment of organic feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, fats and greases, in order to create a fuel that is compatible with existing aviation infrastructure and aircraft technologies.

Megan Hine: ""We are already working closely with companies developing new SAF technologies.""

The good news is that many of the risks are well understood in processing heavy hydrocarbons. The supply chain is sufficiently mature to provide comprehensive safety solutions for application of hydrocarbon substances and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These solutions include flame and gas detection systems, as well as personal protective and detection equipment, such as respiratory protection or personal portable gas monitors.

There will however be changes to how we handle this kind of waste and the touch points in industry. There will need to be consideration given to how much of the waste is processed on the waste generating site, or whether it will be transported, unprocessed, to a different site for the refining process to begin.

If new plant and equipment is installed as part of the process, associated fire and gas detection will need to meet current safety guidelines, such as BS (British Standard) 60080:2020, which may not have existed when the original plant was built.

Meanwhile, non-HEFA technology converts waste material which, as is the case with landfill sites, carries the risk of exposure to methane gas. This technology also relies on the use of biomass waste which has significant fire and explosive gas hazards, as well as hazards from exposure to nitrogen and carbon dioxide. In addition, oxygen depletion in confined spaces is a particular issue with biomass storage.

A further safety concern, which is well known to areas of industry dealing with biomass storage, but potentially not so well known to new market entrants looking at SAF feedstock, are the hazards associated with carbon monoxide.

For example, Hydrotreated Depolymerised Cellulosic Jet Fuel (HDCJ) is one of a number of innovative pathways which are being explored, in addition to the main SAF technologies, in a bid to diversify SAF production. HDCJ uses lignocellulosic biomass (wood residues, crop waste) broken down through pyrolysis, the chemical decomposition of organic (carbon-based) materials through the application of heat, or hydrothermal liquefaction, a process using heat and pressure, to produce bio-oil.

If you have large scale storage of, for example, crop waste or sawmill waste, significant volumes of this feedstock can create a thermal reaction deep within the mound. This heat can be sufficient to begin inefficient combustion of the feedstock, producing carbon monoxide, an acutely toxic gas.

As these examples illustrate, it is important to understand the specific hazards of each SAF process and respond accordingly with the correct safety technology – particularly gas and flame detection technology. Such systems are vital safety considerations in the production of these fuels.

Power to liquid

There have been advances in the use of hydrogen in aviation in recent years, with some promising results on a small scale. Hydrogen tanks are lighter than those required for HEFA and non-HEFA fuels, and the indications are, significantly, that 100 per cent of hydrogen could be used. There is some way to go before this is a reality – particularly for long haul flights – but it is thought that this form of SAF will be easier to scale.

Clearly, the hazards in relation to hydrogen usage are becoming better known as hydrogen technology advances, and there is work being carried out currently at the University of Aberdeen looking at the transport of hydrogen, a research project which Dräger is supporting by advising on the safety aspect. This will look at a wider transport distribution network but the project’s research into structural integrity when in contact with hydrogen and preventing hydrogen leakage will be essential in hydrogen applications, including SAF.

As is the case with all renewable energy, there is a sense of the unknown when it comes to safety. However, providers like ourselves are very experienced in a range of relevant safety issues, such as gas detection, in a wide range of different scenarios and will be able to use our knowledge to address safety in this sector as it develops.

Ensuring the success of SAF is not only about meeting targets; it’s also about embedding safety from the ground up. We are already working closely with companies developing new SAF technologies, and these partnerships will be essential in bridging the gap between innovation and safety, ensuring the industry continues to grow – safely and sustainably – to 2030 and beyond.

While alternatives depend heavily on critical minerals and are susceptible to weather variation, fossil fuels like gas offer a consistent energy supply, particularly during periods of low renewable energy generation, he said.

S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates that demand for gasoline A, or gasoline before the mandatory anhydrous ethanol blend, will rise by 2.17% on the year in 2025, hitting 566,531 b/d, then jump by 3.68% to 587,391 b/d in 2026, according to the Latin America Short-Term Outlook report for refined products.

Demand for diesel A, also unblended, is expected to grow by 1.90% in 2025, reaching 1.19 million b/d, and then increase by 2.01% in 2026, to 1.22 million b/d.

Garibaldi also expressed optimism about the future, advocating for natural gas and nuclear energy as pivotal players in the transition away from oil.

One significant challenge is the lack of coordinated action among Latin American countries to optimize the use of their abundant resources. Brazil, with its energy oversupply and potential for renewable integration, could lead the charge if it strengthens its multi-lateral relationships, according to Thiago Guilherme Ferreira Prado, president of Brazil's Energetic Research Company.

Reliance on S500, S1800 diesel

In Brazil, private refiner Acelen is making strides in sustainable energy by investing in macaúba palm oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel. Macaúba is a species of palm native in Latin America, mostly south of Mexico.

Matheus Soares Matos, director at private refineries association Refina Brasil, noted that while the biorefinery project is still in its engineering phases, it aims to position Brazil as a value-added product exporter rather than merely a commodities supplier. This aligns with the regulatory push for biofuels, driven by mandatory fossil fuel-biofuel blends.

Despite these advancements, the Brazilian energy landscape remains heavily reliant on S500 (500 ppm of sulfur) and S1800 (1,800 ppm) diesel for thermal power plants. The recent logistical adjustments to manage fuel supply have led to significant price increases, impacting all fuel consumers.

Seasonal droughts in Brazil, exacerbated by climate change and the El Niño phenomenon, pose additional challenges to energy supply and demand. While Brazil's Aneel national power agency indicates that diesel demand is generally stable, the growing interest in gas and renewable energy sources suggests a potential shift in the energy landscape.

Bruno Stukart, an energy research analyst at the Brazilian government's Energy Research Company, forecasts a decrease in diesel demand as interconnected systems expand, although isolated systems in the Amazon region will continue to rely on thermal power.

Looking ahead, the Brazilian National Gas and Oil Agency has proposed a phased-out plan for S500 and S1800 diesel, aiming to transition to S10 by the end of 2024. Mandelli cautions that the implementation of this plan may not occur as quickly as anticipated, given the need to balance environmental concerns, supply security, and social implications.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-01 17:56:20.236186
