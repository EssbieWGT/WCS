With the EU's binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.
The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport.
By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

With the EU's binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonise, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

""The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,"" said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU's multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

""Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

""Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,"" A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission's plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,"" Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only ""detract from"" commitments to e-fuels.

""It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production"", T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission's plan was a ""promising first step"" to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.

""WSC is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers. Without this, production and uptake will stall despite significant fleet investments already made by the liner shipping sector,"" read the statement.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/53/87/05/1200x675_cmsv2_86fb2647-d2d8-52f0-8a98-383d27de5ca4-9538705.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 10:16:29.137029

Advancing the science of aviation fuel

Harris studies zeolites, a class of microporous crystalline oxides typically comprised of silicon and aluminum. Zeolites have a rigid, porous structure that can host active sites that enable chemical reactions necessary to transform ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel.

Harris plans to work with researchers from Johns Hopkins University to computationally model yttrium’s structure and compare it to his data on how it behaves in experiments. Understanding why and how yttrium-containing zeolites behave the way they do — and how we can take advantage of them — will help advance the catalysis science necessary for production of sustainable aviation fuel.

A senior IATA official warned that mandates for blending sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without incentives are a ""no-go area"" that would harm airlines. India aims for 1% SAF blending by 2027, but IATA advocates for incentives to boost SAF production before imposing mandates. The government is developing a SAF policy to reduce oil imports and create green jobs.

Mandates for blending sustainable aviation fuel with jet fuel without incentives are a ""no-go area"" and such a situation would hurt airlines, a senior IATA official said on Thursday amid authorities pushing ahead with efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

The government has set a target to have 1 per cent blending of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and with the availability of feedstock, the country also has significant potential for producing SAF.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Tuhin Sen, Head Sustainability India at IATA, said IATA would prefer to have incentives for a technological push for producing SAF to precede the mandate for the use of SAF.

Mandates for blending of SAF without incentives are a ""no-go area"" and will have unintended consequences as airlines are also enablers for connectivity and growth, he noted.

Live Events

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) represents around 350 airlines, including Indian carriers, worldwide that account for more than 80 per cent of the global air traffic.

Participating in a panel discussion as part of the 'India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit' that was organised in the national capital on Thursday, Sen also mentioned that for airlines, currently, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) accounts for around 44 per cent of the overall operating costs while the quantum is around 34 per cent globally.

At the panel discussion, Asangba Chuba Ao, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation, emphasised the need for a multi-pronged approach and that there was no ""silver bullet"" to address the issues.

The government is open to suggestions, he said with respect to developing the SAF ecosystem.

Earlier in the day,Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said the government will very soon come out with a policy on SAF, which can help reduce crude oil imports, increase farmers' income and create more green jobs.

""From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that (those) frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement (on SAF),"" Naidu said.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

The global aviation safety watchdog International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) aims to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030, and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. India too has set targets to blend SAF into its international flights, starting with a 1% blend by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, and reaching 5% by 2030 under ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) programme.

Addressing a FICCI event, the Minister said that today the global requirement of SAF stood at 2 million tonne which by 2040 would rise to 183 million tonne. “As an agricultural powerhouse with over 750 million tonne of available biomass, India has the capacity to become the global leader in SAF production”.

India has a surplus of 213 million tonne of agricultural residue along with adequate manufacturing capacity, the Minister stated. To achieve 1% blending of SAF by 2027, India will require 30 million litre, while the 2% target for 2028 translates to 62 million litre. Domestic oil manufacturing companies collectively have an annual production capacity of 70 million litre.

“We are well on course to meet the domestic demand and even emerge as a global production player in SAF”.

In order to encourage innovation in this field, European aerospace major Airbus and Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya (GSV) signed a Joint Study Agreement (JSA) to launch a research and development programme focused on converting municipal solid waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Sweden’s aviation rulebook is being reimagined for a carbon-free future.","Sweden is changing the flight game. In a bold move to lead the world into a cleaner aviation era, the country is now aiming to eliminate fossil fuels from its airspace. Hybrid-powered jets, built to run entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are being developed with a goal to end fossil fuel dependency in flights. The real game-changer? Sweden’s ES-30 — a 30-seater hybrid-electric plane that blends electric and SAF tech to fly into a greener future.

Commitment

Sweden isn’t just flirting with the idea of clean aviation — it’s all in. The country has laid out a clear path toward replacing fossil jet fuel with 100% SAF for all domestic flights within the next decade. This move ties directly into Sweden’s broader climate target of becoming net-zero by 2045.

Aviation, traditionally a heavy polluter, has long lagged behind in sustainability. Sweden is flipping that script with its SAF initiative. Unlike regular jet fuel, SAF is made from renewable sources like used cooking oils, agricultural residues, and even captured carbon dioxide. It’s not just a cleaner option — it’s a smarter one.

Innovation

At the center of Sweden’s clean aviation mission is the ES-30. Developed by Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, the ES-30 is a hybrid-electric aircraft that seats 30 passengers. It’s tailor-made for regional travel, especially suited for short routes like those connecting remote regions with major cities.

This jet is designed to operate on a full-electric range of 32 km, and up to 200 km using its hybrid SAF engine. It’s ideal for daily essential flights to islands like Gotland, which rely on consistent air travel to the mainland.

Partnerships

Sweden is building a full ecosystem around its green aviation dream. Airports like Säve in Gothenburg are upgrading facilities to support electric and SAF-powered planes. We’re talking about charging stations, battery safety zones, and SAF blending hubs — all ready to go.

Meanwhile, authorities are fast-tracking new regulatory frameworks. The current aviation certification systems, still tied to fossil-fueled aircraft, are being overhauled to meet the needs of electric aviation. It’s a ground-up rebuild of how flight is done.

Infrastructure

To pull off a national shift to clean aviation, infrastructure is everything. Sweden knows that it’s not just about the aircraft — it’s about the full supply chain. The country is working closely with airlines, airport operators, energy providers, and tech startups to ensure SAF can be produced, delivered, and refueled at scale.

In fact, agreements have already been signed with companies like Elfly Group, and airfields are getting equipped with all the tools needed to support hybrid-electric jets.

Here’s a look at how the aviation upgrade is shaping up:

Regulation

To make this dream fly, Sweden is rewriting aviation laws. Outdated certifications don’t support SAF and electric aircraft. That’s why Sweden’s transport and environmental regulators are partnering with research institutions and private aviation players to develop fast-track approval systems.

Over 100 projects are underway — from SAF testing to air taxi development. Sweden’s aviation rulebook is being reimagined for a carbon-free future.

Vision

This isn’t just about reducing carbon — it’s about eliminating fossil fuels altogether. Sweden wants to be the first country where commercial flights operate without burning a single drop of fossil jet fuel. And with SAF that’s proven to be cleaner, easier to produce, and more practical than hydrogen or all-electric propulsion, that future feels within reach.

Gotland, one of Sweden’s more remote areas, is already leading the charge, proving that even the most isolated regions can plug into this new system. The journey to the skies now comes with a lighter footprint.

With this SAF revolution, Sweden is setting a powerful example for the world. The vision is clear: sustainable skies, clean engines, and fossil-free flying. This isn’t a pipe dream. It’s already taking off.

Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).
Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration.
This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel.
Leveling the Playing Field Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been “extraordinarily active” in 2025, making three significant changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that are poised to reshape the biomass-based diesel market.

University of Illinois, Todd Gleason spoke to agricultural economists Dr. Todd Hubbs of Oklahoma State University and Dr. Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois, who outlined how these complex rulings create strong incentives for domestic soybean oil and other feedstocks.

“It has been something this year,” Hubbs said, detailing the EPA’s recent actions.

The changes, which are the focus of a new series of articles by Hubbs and Irwin, include:

June: The EPA finalized the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027.

July: The agency released a comprehensive ruling on Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) that had been pending since 2018.

September: The EPA established a new framework for reallocating those SREs.

The Mandate is Growing

Host Todd Gleason clarified that these changes do not impact the 15-billion-gallon component of the RFS, which is generally met by corn-based ethanol. Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).

The mandate for this category is set for a 40% increase, rising from 5.36 billion gallons annually to 7.5 billion gallons by 2027.

A “Messy” Solution to Small Refinery Exemptions

A major part of the EPA’s recent action was resolving the backlog of SREs, which allow small refineries to get out of the RFS mandate.

Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration. For the exemptions it did grant (covering 2018-2022), the agency returned “worthless” RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers, or credits) from those past years, rather than current, valuable RINs. This effectively removed those credits from the marketplace.

“That’s a mess,” Hubbs said, summarizing the complex situation.

Crucially, the EPA’s new “reallocation” policy means that the exempted gallons will be added back into the RFS, making other, non-exempt obligated parties responsible for making up the difference in 2026 and 2027.

This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel. Hubbs projects the mandate could jump from 5.5 billion RIN gallons in 2025 to over 7.23 billion in 2026.

“Half-RIN” Policy Favors Domestic Production

Perhaps the most significant change, according to Hubbs, was the introduction of a “half-RIN policy” in June, which he described as “unheard of previously.”

Under this new rule, any imported fuel or imported feedstock used to make fuel will only receive half the RIN value.

“Well, that sort of totally favors it, right?” Gleason asked.

Hubbs agreed, noting the policy “sort of favors domestic feedstock and domestic production” and has “big implications” for U.S. producers.

Leveling the Playing Field

Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.

The agency lowered the RIN value for non-ester renewable diesel (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF) from 1.7 RINs per gallon down to 1.6. This brings it closer to traditional FAME (soy diesel), which has a 1.5 RINs-per-gallon value.

Hubbs and Irwin plan to release additional articles detailing the implications of these changes for feedstock prices as they continue to analyze the new RFS playbook.

Further, the report mentioned the government-mandated blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030.

The report emphasised the economic and ecological advantages, such as decreased fuel imports saving billions, job creation in green sectors, and enhanced income for rural communities.

India is well-positioned to supply SAF to premium markets like the EU, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East, it added.

Anish De, Global Head, Energy Natural Resources & Chemicals, KPMG in India, emphasised the need for a coordinated systems approach that aligns policy, finance, technology, and offtake commitments.

“India’s SAF journey will be built on the intelligent use of our abundant feedstock base – from agricultural residues and municipal solid waste to press-mud and used cooking oil,” said Vivek Rahi, Partner and National Head – Oil & Gas, KPMG in India.

The key to success will be establishing viable supply chains and long-term offtake frameworks involving airlines, OMCs, and technology providers, he added.

Steps towards the net-zero future Starting the decarbonisation journey means realising that every significant transformation begins with a first step.","For organisations beginning their decarbonisation journey, a strong start is vital to build lasting momentum. Carolina Paes, Climate Consultant at Nexio Projects, shares five key tips to help spark ambition and set initiatives firmly on the right path.

1. Measure from the start

No decarbonisation strategy can advance without a clear picture of today’s emissions. A full carbon footprint measurement, covering Scope 1, Scope 2, and relevant parts of Scope 3, will reveal where the biggest impacts lie.

Scope 3 is where many businesses find unexpected challenges. Upstream suppliers, distribution networks, and product lifecycles often account for most emissions. Tackling these early, even with high-level estimates, ensures action plans are grounded in reality and not assumption.

This step forms the backbone of carbon accounting and builds credibility with stakeholders who expect reliable disclosure.

2. Build a coalition of stakeholders

Effective decarbonisation requires collective engagement – achieving net zero is rarely achieved in isolation. Stakeholder mapping allows you to identify champions and potential blockers.

Invest time to understand:

Who influences strategic decision-making

Which departments drive the largest emissions

Which suppliers or customers are critical in shaping carbon outcomes

This coalition-building is not about bureaucracy; it is about positioning sustainability at the centre of organisational DNA. When stakeholders feel informed and involved, carbon reduction targets move from paper commitments to cultural practice.

Source: Nexio Projects

3. Set ambitious yet achievable targets

Targets give direction, but they must be credible. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) provides a framework to ensure emissions targets are science-aligned rather than arbitrary. A decarbonisation strategy that adopts the SBTi communicates a clear message to investors and employees: “Our ambition is real, not symbolic.”

The most effective targets are structured in layers:

Near-term achievable milestones, such as energy efficiency and low-carbon procurement

Longer-term net-zero sustainability goals, covering full value chains

This journey of ambition, supported by data, enables organisations to build a resilient reputation on climate leadership.

4. Integrate risk management into decisions

Climate-related risks are no longer abstract. They translate into tangible financial, operational, and legal consequences. By embedding risk management into the decarbonisation journey, businesses can identify vulnerabilities early.

For example, energy price volatility can amplify costs for carbon-intensive operations, while shifting regulations such as carbon taxes impose new liabilities. Mapping these risks during the early stages allows leaders to develop a proactive, future-proof decarbonisation strategy.

With these foresight mechanisms, organisations protect both their operations and their credibility.

5. Celebrate momentum through tangible action

The worst mistake at the beginning is to wait for a perfect plan. Decarbonisation gains momentum through tangible first steps, not elaborate strategies that never leave the page.

Introduce immediate actions such as:

Switching to renewable electricity contracts

Improving building energy efficiency

Revisiting staff travel policies

Every action reinforces internal belief and builds external trust. These early achievements serve as proof points that cultivating carbon neutrality goes beyond the theoretical – and can be achieved starting today.

Steps towards the net-zero future

Starting the decarbonisation journey means realising that every significant transformation begins with a first step. By measuring emissions, building coalitions, setting science-based targets, embedding risk management, and acting with immediacy, organisations lay the foundation for credible climate leadership.

The evidence-based review, titled Oil-Based Cover Crops for Aviation Fuel in Scotland – Question and Answer Report, assesses the feasibility of cultivating oil-producing crops for biofuel production.
“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland,” said Dr. Tracy Valentine, Project Lead and Senior Research Scientist.
“This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland.
Beyond its potential as a renewable fuel source, camelina oil is also gaining popularity as a cooking oil.","Scientists from The James Hutton Institute and SRUC have produced a new report for the Scottish Government examining the potential for oilseed cover crops grown in Scotland to serve as feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

The evidence-based review, titled Oil-Based Cover Crops for Aviation Fuel in Scotland – Question and Answer Report, assesses the feasibility of cultivating oil-producing crops for biofuel production. The work follows a key recommendation from the recent Project Willow report — a joint UK and Scottish Government study exploring low-carbon industrial opportunities for Scotland’s Grangemouth site.

The report identifies camelina as the leading candidate crop. Already cultivated in several countries for aviation fuel production and in the UK for the health food market, camelina is considered a strong option due to the quality and suitability of its oil, according to a press release.

Next, researchers will launch field trials to study how camelina performs under Scottish growing conditions and how it might integrate into local crop rotations. The project will also assess potential environmental impacts — both positive and negative — to better understand camelina’s role in Scotland’s transition to sustainable agriculture and low-carbon fuel production.

“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland,” said Dr. Tracy Valentine, Project Lead and Senior Research Scientist. “By growing over winter, we hope to fit in with the main spring cropping season. Initially we will be looking at frost tolerance, growth rates, pests and fertiliser requirements, and ease of crop agronomy for farmers.

“This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland. Camelina is an oil seed plant, similar to oil seed rape and is part of the Brassicaceae (commonly known as mustard) plant family. It is widely grown across north America and Europe and is used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production due to its high oil content and ultra-low carbon intensity compared to other alternative crops.”

One tonne of camelina seeds can yield roughly 200 to 230 litres of aviation fuel, though the exact output depends on the seed’s oil content, which typically ranges from 38% to 47%. For comparison, a light aircraft consumes an average of 22 to 45 litres of fuel per hour.

Beyond its potential as a renewable fuel source, camelina oil is also gaining popularity as a cooking oil. Naturally rich in vitamin E and omega fatty acids, it offers both nutritional benefits and a higher smoke point than many conventional oils, making it suitable for a range of culinary uses.

The James Hutton Institute provides world-leading research and innovation to address the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.

While this momentum enhances global access and mobility, it also drives up fuel consumption and significantly increases carbon emissions, intensifying environmental challenges. Without effective mitigation, aviation’s environmental footprint could undermine global climate objectives, underscoring the urgent need for industry-wide decarbonisation.

Among the various approaches to decarbonise aviation, the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is recognised as one of the most promising solutions. It is projected to contribute approximately 65 per cent of the total emissions reductions for the sector to achieve net-zero by 2050. SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable feedstocks such as agricultural residue and municipal waste. Although its hydrocarbon structure closely resembles that of conventional fossil fuel, resulting in similar tailpipe emissions, the key difference lies in its origin.

India holds a strategic edge in SAF production due to its abundant bio-based feedstocks, producing nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus biomass.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/in/images/2025/11/fuelling-a-cleaner-sky-indias-opportunity-in-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 09:01:31.292508

With aviation responsible for nearly 2.5 per cent of global CO₂ emissions and passenger volumes continuing to rise, decarbonisation has become central to the sector’s long-term viability. Within this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most practical, immediate, and scalable solution. SAF not only delivers substantial lifecycle carbon reductions, but also integrates seamlessly into existing aircraft engines, fuel supply chains, and airport infrastructure, thus enabling transition without disruption.

For India, this transition represents both an imperative and an opportunity. It is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world crossing ~239 million passengers in FY 2024-25, and on the path to become the third largest. Fleet expansions by leading carriers, supported by record aircraft orders exceeding 1,500, reflect confidence in India’s long-term economic fundamentals. Further, the firm order for widebody aircraft illustrates a new phase of ambition to connect to long-haul international markets. The progress achieved in India’s aviation sector is a direct outcome of deliberate policy foresight and sustained institutional commitment. This expansion has already pushed ATF consumption from 6.3 MMTPA in FY2015-16 to 8.98 MMTPA in FY2024-25, with volumes expected to more than double by 2040. Despite newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, every capacity addition increases fuel demand, intensifying environmental pressures.

India faces rising fuel demand but also possesses the assets to lead - abundant feedstock, deep refining capacity, proven bioenergy experience, and a strong policy focus on energy transition. The resources, infrastructure, and policy intent are already in place. The real challenge and the strategic opportunity lies in orchestrating them into an integrated value chain that translates potential into measurable climate and competitiveness gains. The development of a domestic SAF industry can deliver multiple dividends: reduced crude import dependence, enhanced rural income, new technology value chains, and green job creation.

The transition to SAF is more than a technological shift, it is a test of strategic intent. India stands at the threshold of redefining its aviation sector not merely as a consumer of cleaner fuel, but as a producer, innovator, and global supplier of it. India’s airlines, airports, regulators, and innovators together represent a confident ecosystem ready to shape the next phase of green aviation. By aligning policy ambition with industrial execution, and pairing domestic feedstock strength with global collaboration, India can chart a flight path where economic growth and climate responsibility move in tandem.

In technical parlance, SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that adheres to sustainability criteria.

“All industry players will be consulted before the policy is officially rolled out,” Naidu told businessline on the sidelines of an industry event here.

“Not just public sector refiners but also private ones will be consulted. Their participation in the SAF ecosystem is important if India is to emerge as a major exporter of SAF.”

businessline was the first to report that India is in the process of framing a comprehensive policy to promote both the production and utilisation of SAF.

In September 2025, Naidu emphasised that India holds a natural advantage in this segment in terms of geography, which allows it to become an exporter, and the massive availability of feedstock.

At present, India has over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

Besides, India’s cost advantage in skilled labour and manufacturing will ensure that SAF is produced at a far more competitive rate compared to any other region in the world.

Nevertheless, one of the current challenges is price competitiveness.

Presently, industry estimates that the price of SAF is two to four times higher than that of traditional jet fuel.

Moreover, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

This scheme is being implemented in three phases, with participation voluntary between 2021 and 2026.

India has chosen not to participate in the voluntary phases. However, offsetting requirements under CORSIA for Indian carriers will begin in 2027.

The scheme applies to international flights originating in one country and landing in another.

The Centre plans to implement the scheme with indicative targets of a one per cent SAF blend in ATF starting in 2027, increasing it to two per cent in 2028, and eventually reaching five per cent by 2030.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery. This certification, a prerequisite for commercial SAF production, marks a significant step forward in India’s ability to produce, certify and distribute SAF at scale.

A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) policy is imminent, aiming to boost farmers' incomes and create green jobs while reducing crude oil imports. India targets significant SAF blending by 2030, leveraging abundant biomass and agricultural residue. This initiative promises to balance aviation growth with sustainability goals.

The government will soon unveil a policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which could help reduce crude oil imports, boost farmers’ incomes, and generate more green jobs, reported PTI quoting Civil Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu on Thursday.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit 2025 in the national capital, Naidu said adopting SAF would require greater innovation, investment, and international collaboration.

“From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that those frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement,” he said.

India aims for 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030. The fuel can be used as a drop-in substitute in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

The minister urged private players to participate in SAF production alongside oil companies. Globally, the demand for SAF is projected at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Live Events

Highlighting India’s potential, Naidu said the country has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

The government plans to release its SAF policy shortly. Naidu noted that SAF could raise farmers’ incomes by 10-15 per cent, reduce crude oil import bills by USD 5-7 billion annually, and create more than 1 million green jobs along the SAF value chain.

“While global SAF production is currently very low, India can produce SAF at highly competitive rates, helping balance growth with sustainability,” he said.

India is among the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets, with domestic carriers having placed orders for over 1,700 planes.

Fluor Corporation, a prominent player in the engineering and construction industry, has been awarded the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) contract for LanzaJet, Inc.’s Speedbird project, a commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility in Teesside, UK. This partnership aims to produce over 90,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel annually, significantly contributing to carbon emissions reduction. The project is expected to cut British Airways' CO₂ emissions by approximately 230,000 tons per year, equivalent to the emissions of 26,000 domestic flights. This initiative aligns with Fluor's commitment to sustainable practices and positions the company at the forefront of the burgeoning market for alternative fuels.

The Speedbird project emphasizes the critical role of collaboration in advancing sustainable technologies. LanzaJet's CEO, Jimmy Samartzis, highlights the significance of this project in scaling their innovative approach to fuel production, utilizing patented Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. Fluor's Group President, Mike Alexander, reiterates the importance of such projects in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The partnership not only seeks to address climate change but also aims to create numerous jobs during the construction and operational phases, thereby contributing to local economic development in Northeast England. Additionally, the UK government has committed £10 million ($13 million) in funding from its Advanced Fuels Fund, underscoring the project’s potential impact.

Fluor's involvement in the Speedbird project signifies a strategic move toward sustainable engineering solutions in an era of increasing environmental awareness. By leading the engineering efforts for this innovative SAF facility, Fluor enhances its portfolio while supporting the aviation industry's transition to greener fuels. This project exemplifies the company's capability to integrate advanced technologies and sustainable practices, positioning Fluor as a leader in the evolving landscape of energy solutions.

In related news, Fluor faces scrutiny from multiple law firms conducting investigations into potential securities law violations following its disappointing financial disclosures. Allegations suggest that the company misrepresented its financial health concerning significant infrastructure projects, leading to a substantial drop in its stock price. These legal challenges highlight the complexities Fluor encounters as it navigates both the demands of current market conditions and its commitments to sustainable development.

Fluor's recent contract with LanzaJet represents a forward-thinking approach to energy production, while the legal investigations serve as a reminder of the intricate landscape within which the company operates. The outcome of these developments may significantly impact Fluor’s reputation and strategic direction as it balances sustainability initiatives with financial transparency.

The legal actions follow Fluor’s acknowledgment of increased costs and weaker customer spending, which put pressure on its Q2 2025 performance and future outlook.

Recent weeks have brought a flurry of headlines for Fluor, from securing a lead role in a major sustainable aviation fuel project in the UK to a wave of class action lawsuits following its lowered guidance and Q2 2025 missteps. Against this backdrop, Fluor’s share price has been volatile, with a recent dip and rebound culminating in a 1-year total shareholder return of -19%. While momentum clearly faded this year, its 3-year total return remains an impressive 48%, so the long-run trajectory is still positive for those who held through the turbulence.

If Fluor's ups and downs have you wondering what else is worth watching, this could be the perfect time to discover

The big question now, after a year of sharp swings and mixed signals, is whether Fluor is trading at a bargain due to short-term troubles or if the market has already taken the company’s growth prospects into account.

Most Popular Narrative: 5% Undervalued

According to the most widely tracked narrative, Fluor's fair value sits at $49.89, while the last close was $47.41. This suggests the shares are still trading below what analysts expect. Even after a turbulent year and recent guidance issues, this valuation hints that the market may be overlooking Fluor's resilience and future catalysts.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $49.889 for Fluor based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $57.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $40.0.

Want to know what bold projections are driving that upside? The heart of the narrative is a rapid shift in earnings, razor-thin future profit margins, and a price multiple typically reserved for market leaders. Curious what numbers underpin these optimistic assumptions? Click in to see why this fair value could be within reach.

Result: Fair Value of $49.89 (UNDERVALUED)

However, project delays and a decline in cash flow could quickly challenge the current outlook. These are key watchpoints for any narrative optimism.

Another View: SWS DCF Model Offers a Cautious Signal

While analysts see Fluor as undervalued based on earnings trajectories, our SWS DCF model offers a more reserved take. According to its calculations, Fluor is trading modestly above its fair value at this time. This suggests that recent market optimism may have already priced in the upside potential. Could alternative scenarios still play out?

""From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that (those) frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement (on SAF),"" Naidu said.
The minister was speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit 2025 organised by the civil aviation ministry and industry body Ficci.","New Delhi, Nov 6 (PTI) The government will very soon come out with a policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can help reduce crude oil imports, increase farmers' income and create more green jobs, Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said on Thursday.

Addressing a summit in the national capital, the minister stressed that adoption of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) demands more innovation, investment and a collective international collaboration.

India aims to have 1 per cent blending of SAF in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent blending by 2028 and 5 per cent blending by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in fuel in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

The minister said that private players should also be part of SAF production besides the oil companies.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

""From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that (those) frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement (on SAF),"" Naidu said.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

Naidu said the government will very soon come out with a SAF policy.

Apart from reducing carbon emissions, the minister said SAF can empower farmers by increasing their incomes by 10-15 per cent.

Along with reducing our crude oil import bill by USD 5-7 billion every year, SAF production can also help create over 1 million green jobs across the SAF value chain, Naidu said.

At present, global SAF is very less.

Naidu said that the country can produce SAF at highly competitive rates and the fuel can also help address challenge of growth versus sustainability.

India is one of the world's fastest growing civil aviation markets and domestic carriers have placed orders for more than 1,700 planes.

Airbus India chief Jurgen Westermeier proposed integrating corporate spending on airlines' voluntary Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programs into the government's CSR framework. This move aims to unlock new capital for SAF demand, fostering a green energy future and enhancing India's energy security and sovereignty by developing a domestic SAF industry.

To promote sustainability, Airbus India chief Jurgen Westermeier on Thursday pitched for bringing corporates' spending on airlines' voluntary sustainable aviation fuel programmes under the government's CSR framework.

Under the companies law, certain class of profitable entities are required to shell out at least two per cent of their annual profit towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in a financial year.

The President and Managing Director for India and South Asia said that the voluntary corporate SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) programmes launched by airlines represent a direct, measurable investment in climate change mitigation.

""We urge the government to recognise the funds spent by corporates on voluntary SAF contributions as a valid expenditure under their mandatory CSR obligations.

""Such an inclusion would immediately unlock a substantial, new pool of capital to support SAF demand, instantly turning a compliance requirement into a powerful engine for a green and sovereign energy future"" he said in the national capital.

Live Events

India, one of the world's fastest growing civil aviation markets, has significant potential for producing SAF.

According to him, SAF can also be a powerful economic enabler.

He also stressed on the need for unprecedented collaboration across all stakeholders -- government, industry and academia.

""By developing a domestic SAF industry, India can immediately and effectively enhance its energy security and sovereignty over its fuel supply chain,"" Westermeier said and added that the SAF industry will require significant investments.

Citing projections, he said 1.1-1.4 million jobs could be created across the entire SAF value chain while also productively utilising an estimated 230 million tonne of surplus agricultural residue.

Detailed Catalyst Analysis

#1: Strategic Private Aviation Partnership Unlocks $17B Premium Market

The Game-Changing Impact Jets MOU

On November 3, 2025, XCF Global announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Impact Jets, LLC to accelerate SAF adoption across the private jet market through a ""Powered by XCF SAF"" program. Together with its existing supply and offtake agreement with Phillips 66, a Fortune 50 energy company, XCF is poised to capitalize on both commercial and private aviation markets.

Why This Matters:

- Market Access: Immediate access to Impact Jets' network of ~130 operators representing a fleet of ~1,400 aircraft

- Premium Segment: U.S. private aviation represents a $17 billion market with 3+ million flights annually and burning 5.5 million gallons of fuel per day

- High Visibility: Private jet clients are early adopters of best-in-class, reputation-enhancing technologies

- Price Premium: Private aviation clients are less price-sensitive and willing to pay for verified, traceable SAF

- Scalable Model: Success in private aviation would validate XCF's direct-to-customer model for commercial expansion

The Numbers:

- 3 million+ private flights in U.S. in 2024 (40% of global private jet activity)

- ~2 billion gallons of jet fuel consumed annually by U.S. private aviation

- General aviation accounts for 8% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption (~5.5M gallons/day)

- A largely untapped market for SAF with significant growth potential

CEO Mihir Dange commented:

""Private aviation is an emerging frontier for SAF demand, a premium segment combining strong visibility with significant commercial potential. We're not just delivering cleaner fuel; we're transforming the experience of private flight into one of leadership in sustainability.""

#2: Deeply Oversold Technicals Signal Potential Reversal

Multiple technical indicators suggest SAFX may be approaching a near-term reversal from deeply oversold conditions:

- RSI (14): 20.18 (deep oversold territory, well below 30 threshold)

- Stochastic Oscillator: 8.78 (extreme oversold, well below 20)

- CCI (14): -104.67 (oversold signal, below -100)

- Technical Signals: 8 Buy signals, 7 Sell signals, 2 Neutral (per recent analysis)

What Is a Technical Reversal?

According to Investopedia: ""A reversal is a change in the price direction of an asset. Following a downtrend, a reversal would be to the upside. Reversals are based on overall price direction and are not typically based on one or two periods/bars on a chart.""

When multiple indicators simultaneously reach oversold extremes, it often signals that selling pressure may be exhausted and a technical bounce could be approaching. Combined with fundamental catalysts like the Impact Jets MOU and operational production milestones, this technical setup presents an interesting entry point for technical traders.

Note: Technical indicators should never be used in isolation. They are most valuable when combined with fundamental analysis and catalyst timing. Past technical patterns do not guarantee future performance.

#3: Riding The Massive SAF Market Wave (57.5% CAGR)

XCF Global is strategically positioned to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing markets in the entire energy sector. The SAF market's projected 57.5% compound annual growth rate through 2034 represents an extraordinary expansion trajectory driven by regulatory mandates, corporate commitments, and technological maturity.

Market Drivers Creating Structural Tailwinds:

Expansion Pipeline:

XCF has announced plans for three additional U.S. sites including a second production facility next to the existing New Rise Reno facility which would double capacity and expand market reach, plus international expansion through licensing partnerships in Australia and potentially other markets. The company's strategic plan includes an investment of ~$300 million; expected to begin construction of New Rise Reno 2 in 2026 . This multi-facility strategy provides geographic diversification and significant scalability.

#5: Government Mandates & Tax Credits Creating Structural Demand

Perhaps the most powerful catalyst: regulatory and financial support creating guaranteed demand for SAF producers like XCF.

U.S. Government Support:

- Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit: Federal tax credits for SAF production

- Inflation Reduction Act: Enhanced tax credits for clean fuel production

- SAF Grand Challenge: USDA/DOE/DOT initiative targeting 3B gallons/year by 2030

- Bipartisan Support: SAF development enjoys rare political consensus

International Mandates:

- EU ReFuelEU Aviation: Mandatory blending starting 2% (2025), rising to 70% (2050)

- UK Mandate: Progressive SAF requirements beginning 2025

- ICAO CORSIA: International carbon offsetting scheme creating SAF demand

What This Means for XCF:

These mandates don't just create demand; they create GUARANTEED demand that airlines must fulfill regardless of price premiums. As one of the few U.S.-based producers, XCF is strategically positioned to capture significant value from both regulatory requirements and government incentives that improve production economics. The combination of mandated blending requirements and favorable tax treatment creates a structural tailwind that should support industry growth through 2050.

Investment Considerations & Risk Factors

Investment Opportunities:

- Early-mover operational advantage in rapidly scaling SAF market

- Multiple near-term catalysts including partnership formalization and production milestones

- 57.5% market CAGR creates rising tide for established producers

- Government support creating structural tailwinds through 2050

Singapore Airlines will lead with a 1% SAF requirement by 2026, scaling to 3–5% by 2030, backed by a SAF levy for procurement. Malaysia Airlines partners with FatHopes Energy for SAF production from used cooking oil, contributing to net-zero aviation by 2050. Garuda Indonesia aligns with Indonesia’s SAF regulations, while Thai Airways adopts national SAF standards. Philippine Airlines, targeting net-zero by 2050, explores SAF use by 2030. Government blueprints and amendments across the region shape these policies, driving fleet modernization, SAF use, and carbon reduction goals. These regulations are part of a broader regional effort to reduce aviation emissions, with governments implementing market-based measures to foster green aviation.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) – Singapore

Government requirements

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate and SAF levy – Singapore’s Ministry of Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) require all flights departing Singapore to use SAF starting in 2026 with a 1 % SAF target, increasing to 3–5 % by 2030[1]. To implement the SAF mandate, the CAAS (Amendment) Bill (Sept 2025) authorises CAAS to collect a SAF levy and centralise procurement; the levy will provide cost certainty and fund a centralised SAF fund[2]. The bill emphasises that a centralised procurement approach will aggregate demand and secure better commercial terms for airlines[3].

Establishment of SAFCo – In Oct 2025, CAAS announced the creation of Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd (SAFCo) to procure SAF and manage the SAF levy. SAFCo will aggregate voluntary demand, contract with suppliers and help achieve the 1 % SAF target in 2026 and 3–5 % by 2030[4]. The company will support the development of a scalable SAF ecosystem[5].

Operational and airport initiatives – Singapore’s 2024 Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint commits to improving air‑traffic management, deploying energy‑efficient operations at Changi Airport, expanding solar power and electrifying all new airside vehicles by 2025 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050[1].

Impact on Singapore Airlines’ policies

Commitment to net‑zero and fleet modernisation – The SIA Group aims to be net‑zero by 2050. It has a young fleet (average age about 7 years) consisting of fuel‑efficient Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 aircraft, with upcoming Boeing 777‑9 and A350F freighters. The fleet modernisation is aligned with the government’s decarbonisation blueprint[6].

SAF procurement and initiatives – SIA trialled sustainable fuel with CAAS and GenZero, purchasing 1 000 tonnes of neat SAF that reduced ~2 500 tonnes of CO₂. The trial showed voluntary demand alone is insufficient, leading to the mandated SAF requirement[7]. SIA’s FY2024/25 sustainability report states the group purchased 2 000 tonnes of neat SAF and signed an MoU with Aether Fuels to explore SAF derived from carbon feedstock; SIA also joined the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines pledge to replace 5 % of fuel consumption with SAF by 2030[8][9]. As SAF is integrated via SAFCo, SIA will need to plan its fuel procurement and pricing under the government’s levy system.

Operational efficiency and air‑traffic management – The blueprint’s Long Range Air Traffic Flow Management trial with SIA aims to reduce holding times and unnecessary fuel burn, with implementation planned for 2026[10]. SIA also implements weight‑reduction measures and optimised flight plans to save fuel[6].

Garuda Indonesia – Indonesia

Government initiatives

Decarbonisation commitment – Indonesia’s Ministry of Transportation (Directorate General of Air Transportation) commits to reducing greenhouse‑gas emissions from aviation to support the Paris Agreement and the country’s 2060 net‑zero goal. A July 2025 Antara News report (state‑run) states that the ministry’s programme includes monitoring emissions, encouraging SAF implementation, carbon offsetting under CORSIA, improving energy efficiency of airport operations and flights, and ensuring transparent emission reporting[11].

Accelerating SAF regulations – An October 2025 Antara article quotes the ministry’s Director of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations, Sokhib Al Rokhman, saying that Indonesia is strengthening the SAF roadmap, developing monitoring‑reporting mechanisms and implementing CORSIA standards. With proper certification and incentives, the ministry expects domestic SAF adoption to reduce emissions without disrupting operations[12].

Implications for Garuda Indonesia

SAF adoption and compliance – As the national flag carrier, Garuda Indonesia will need to comply with the Ministry of Transportation’s SAF roadmap and the CORSIA reporting requirements. The government’s focus on MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) and certification suggests that airlines will be required to adopt SAF blends and report emissions, which will shape Garuda’s fuel procurement and fleet‑planning strategies.

Operational efficiency – Improvements in energy efficiency at airports and flights, as outlined by the ministry, may require Garuda to invest in newer aircraft, upgrade air‑traffic management procedures, and participate in carbon‑offset programmes. Garuda is also expected to participate in stakeholder collaborations to align operations with national decarbonisation targets.

Thai Airways – Thailand

Government direction

Support for SAF and multi‑sector cooperation – A July 2025 article from the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) (official website) reports on the SEA SAF Forum 2025. CAAT director Air Chief Marshal Manat Chuanpraphrue participated in a session on the “Role of SAF in Aviation Transport Decarbonization.” The article highlights Thailand’s commitment to promoting the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel to reduce greenhouse‑gas emissions and emphasises that cooperation between government, private sector and academia is needed to drive a concrete transition[13].

Regional SAF roadmap – According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Thai Ministry of Energy aimed to finalise guidelines for SAF use by the end of 2024 and there are planned SAF production facilities (e.g., Bangchak’s Phra Khanong plant) expected to start producing SAF in 2025[14]. Although this is an intergovernmental report, it shows that Thai authorities recognise SAF as key to decarbonising aviation.

Impact on Thai Airways

Policy alignment – Thai Airways, as the national flag carrier, is expected to align with Thailand’s emerging SAF guidelines and collaborate with CAAT and energy agencies. Participation in forums indicates the government’s expectation that the airline will adopt SAF when domestic production becomes available.

Fleet and route optimisation – Thailand’s policy environment encourages airlines to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions through fleet renewal and optimised operations. Thai Airways will need to incorporate these requirements into its post‑pandemic restructuring, which includes modernising its fleet and exploring partnerships for SAF supply as domestic production scales up.

Malaysia Airlines – Malaysia

Government policies

Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) – Launched in 2024, the MADB aims for net‑zero aviation emissions by 2050. The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia’s Waypoint document explains that the blueprint sets four strategies: reducing emissions via aircraft technology (18 % contribution), operational improvements (5 %), adoption of SAF (46 %), and market‑based measures such as carbon offsetting (31 %)[15]. The plan calls for integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain, investing in airport infrastructure for next‑generation fuels, electrifying ground vehicles, improving energy efficiency and waste management, and updating environmental management plans[16].

Investment in SAF production – The same document notes that Petronas and partners are building a biorefinery in Johor to produce SAF and other biofuels by 2028[17], indicating a national commitment to local SAF production.

Policy coordination – Implementation involves cross‑ministerial cooperation: the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities will lead the national SAF blending mandate, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability will develop a national carbon‑market policy, and the Ministry of Transport chairs a steering committee to monitor progress[16].

Influence on Malaysia Airlines’ policies

Net‑zero commitment and SAF partnerships – Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), parent of Malaysia Airlines, supports the MADB. In February 2025, MAG signed an MoU with FatHopes Energy to explore using used cooking oil (UCO) as feedstock for SAF. The partnership aims to collect UCO sustainably and convert it to neat SAF, assess scalability and economic feasibility, and build a local SAF ecosystem, supporting Malaysia’s net‑zero aviation ambitions[18]. This initiative positions Malaysia Airlines to integrate domestic SAF into its operations once production is available.

Passenger engagement and carbon fees – The Waypoint document mentions that Malaysia Airlines offers passengers the option to contribute to carbon‑offset and SAF initiatives, while low‑cost carrier AirAsia may impose a mandatory carbon fee to fund SAF and other sustainability programs[19]. Such mechanisms reflect how environmental policies influence fare structures and customer engagement.

Fleet efficiency and ground operations – The MADB’s call for operational improvements implies that Malaysia Airlines will continue to modernise its fleet and implement fuel‑efficiency programs. Electrification of ground vehicles and energy‑efficient airport operations may require investments in infrastructure at its hubs.

Philippine Airlines – Philippines

Government efforts

Commitment to SAF production – In February 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced plans to partner with Boeing to produce and use Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The department said the Philippines has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to meet its jet‑fuel needs and possibly export SAF. It emphasised that SAF could reduce aviation emissions by up to 80 % and that innovation and partnerships would create jobs and make the Philippines a leader in SAF production[20].

Global aviation engagement – The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) noted in December 2023 that Philippine delegations to ICAO’s Third Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels aimed to support sustainable aviation fuel development and that sustainability would be a key theme at the 59th DGCA conference, which the Philippines planned to host in 2024[21].

State‑run news agency reports – A 2023 Philippine News Agency article reported that Philippine Airlines (PAL) aims to achieve net‑zero carbon emissions by 2050. PAL has a holistic carbon‑reduction programme covering flight and ground operations, uses renewable energy in its offices, is exploring SAF, and applies fuel‑efficiency measures such as single‑engine taxiing[22]. Another PNA report from November 2023 quotes a PAL spokesperson stating that the airline is exploring SAF with the aim of using it by 2030; the airline is working with stakeholders to make SAF more affordable and available[23].

Effects on Philippine Airlines’ policies

Net‑zero target and carbon‑reduction programme – PAL’s net‑zero commitment aligns with DOTr’s ambition to make the Philippines a leader in SAF production. PAL has begun renewable energy use in its offices and adopted fuel‑efficiency initiatives (single‑engine taxiing, reduced acceleration altitude)[22].

SAF exploration and timelines – PAL’s plan to start using SAF by 2030 supports the government’s strategy to develop local SAF production. The DOTr–Boeing partnership indicates that feedstock availability and private‑public collaboration will help accelerate SAF use[20].

International collaboration – Participation in ICAO’s alternative‑fuels conferences and the DGCA meeting underscores the Philippines’ commitment to aligning its policies with global decarbonisation goals. PAL will need to comply with future SAF mandates and carbon‑offset schemes resulting from these engagements.

Conclusion

In 2024‑2025, Southeast Asian governments intensified efforts to decarbonise aviation. Singapore legislated a SAF mandate and levy, established a central procurement company, and required improvements in air‑traffic management and airport operations. Indonesia’s transportation ministry accelerated SAF regulations and emphasised CORSIA compliance. Thailand promoted SAF adoption through regulatory guidance and multi‑sector cooperation, while Malaysia launched a comprehensive decarbonisation blueprint prioritising SAF and invested in domestic bio‑refineries. The Philippines pursued SAF partnerships and planned to harness agricultural waste for fuel, while emphasising net‑zero targets and international collaboration.

These policies directly influence airline strategies. Singapore Airlines must procure SAF through the new levy and centralised system, invest in fleet modernisation and participate in operational efficiency trials. Garuda Indonesia will need to comply with SAF roadmaps and reporting requirements. Thai Airways must prepare for SAF adoption and optimize operations as national guidelines solidify. Malaysia Airlines is exploring used‑cooking‑oil‑based SAF and offering passengers carbon‑offset options, aligning with the government’s blueprint. Philippine Airlines pursues a net‑zero target by 2050, exploring SAF with a 2030 timeline and engaging in government‑led partnerships. Together, these actions illustrate how environmental impact and carbon‑emission concerns are reshaping airline policies across Southeast Asia.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-10-31-085959-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 03:17:10.107863

This means sustainability is becoming not just an environmental imperative but also a competitive one.","With limited access to affordable sustainable aviation fuel, DANX Group is reengineering supply chains using new technologies like cargo drones, electric ground power units, and HVO-fuelled equipment to cut emissions while maintaining efficiency.

Scaling green logistics solutions requires active government intervention, fair regulation, and investment in renewable fuel and electricity production to ensure environmental progress remains financially viable.

Data-driven emissions tracking, stronger collaboration across the supply chain, and customer demand for verified sustainability credentials are making decarbonisation a strategic advantage rather than a compliance exercise.

The industry has long been seen as one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonise, caught between the urgency of global supply chains and the need to cut emissions. With sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in short supply and often prohibitively expensive, stakeholders are rethinking how to keep critical shipments moving while reducing environmental impact.

In the face of limited access to affordable SAF, players are searching for solutions that don’t just wait for greener fuels to arrive. “In the absence of a consistent and affordable supply of sustainable aviation fuel, we believe the industry needs to reengineer supply chains through new technologies and alternative flight capabilities for the distribution of urgent and critical shipments,” said Val Karren, Director of Sustainability at DANX Group.

One example is the use of drones as a supplement to the traditional hub-and-spoke flight pattern. For time-sensitive shipments, this model promises not only efficiency but also a measurable reduction in carbon emissions. “Drones capable of carrying 300–350 kilograms can extend service beyond the immediate hub areas while lowering the intensity ratio of kgCO₂e per tonne-kilometre,” Karren explained.

Creative initiatives beyond carbon reduction

Sustainability is not only about flight operations. On the ground, new approaches are reducing the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels and minimising waste. “We have already replaced ground power units with electric versions, which provide aircraft power during loading, unloading, and start-up without the need for hours of diesel engine use,” said Karren.

Where diesel equipment is still necessary, alternatives are emerging. “HVO is already being used as a replacement fuel to limit CO₂ emissions from fork lift trucks and belt loaders,” he noted. Recycling efforts also play a part: “Full recycling of handling materials, from wood to plastic wraps, provides a small financial return from waste companies.”

Scaling green technologies

Even the most innovative technologies face a fundamental challenge: scaling. “Scaling these solutions will only be possible with continued government intervention,” Karren emphasised. He argued that mandates around SAF adoption must be “backed by fair regulation of how suppliers pass on costs to customers,” otherwise compliance risks becoming “prohibitively expensive for end users.”

The same applies to other alternatives such as HVO and renewable electricity. “We need governments and policymakers to actively stimulate production and storage capacity,” Karren said. Without it, he warned, “scaling will remain slow.”

Speed, cost, and environmental responsibility

For an industry built on speed, sustainability introduces inevitable trade-offs. Electric vehicles, for example, are promising but bring their own challenges. “Their limited battery capacity introduces both logistical and cost challenges,” said Karren. “Careful evaluation of which routes are suitable for EVs is important as the charging infrastructure has to be in place, and charging times can cause delays if not properly planned.”

Costs are another hurdle. “Having to dispatch two EVs to deliver what one diesel powered van or truck could deliver of course creates costs that are hard to carry without direct customer contribution,” he explained. Yet there are encouraging signs. “HVO in a few of our most important markets is at parity—or very close to—with diesel. As we see supply and availability of HVO grow, this provides a great savings of CO₂ emissions vs. diesel without causing pressure on financial margins.”

Measuring, collaborating, and looking ahead

Data is becoming the foundation for sustainability strategies. “Accurate measurement of Scope 3 emissions in a shared logistics network is simply too complex to be managed with traditional tools like spreadsheets,” said Karren. Instead, digital tools are enabling more precise allocation of emissions to customers and helping to build “reduction strategies that align with service level agreements instead of undermining them.”

Collaboration is equally vital. Karren pointed to challenges such as “shared costs, uncoordinated timelines and goals, and a lack of enforcement of industry best practices.” Without stronger alignment between airlines, forwarders, and ground handlers, progress risks being piecemeal.

Yet customer expectations are already driving change. This means sustainability is becoming not just an environmental imperative but also a competitive one. “OEM shippers are increasingly demanding demonstrable ‘green credentials’ from their logistics partners before allowing them to even participate in RFQs,” Karren said.

Looking ahead, he sees major opportunities in next-generation solutions. “One of the most exciting possibilities is the rise of autonomous cargo drones capable of transporting hundreds of kilograms over thousands of kilometres using biofuels or renewable electricity,” Karren concluded.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Page-20-Val-Kerran-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 20:00:17.543759

In the letter to Commissioner Bisignano, the senators expressed concerns regarding the legality of his dual role as Social Security Administration (SSA) commissioner and the newly created chief executive officer (CEO) of the IRS. They questioned the statutory authority for the IRS CEO position, noting that it bypasses Senate confirmation and raised doubts about his capacity to manage two large federal agencies effectively, especially as they are headquartered in different cities amid significant workforce reductions and operational challenges.

In the letter to Secretary Bessent, the senators raised legal and operational concerns about the appointment of Commissioner Bisignano as “Chief Executive Officer” of the IRS. They argue that this dual role conflicts with Bisignano’s existing duties at the SSA and undermines the need for a full-time, Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner, especially ahead of the 2026 filing season. They questioned the legal basis for delegating IRS commissioner duties to Commissioner Bisignano, the compliance of this arrangement with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, potential conflicts of interest given ongoing SSA-IRS litigation and requested detailed explanations of the delegation of authority and oversight mechanisms.

Taxpayers Revive IRS Dispute Resolution Program: Last year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expanded its alternative dispute resolution (ADR) resources to encourage taxpayers to resolve disputes before litigation. Recently, the programs saw a 25% increase in usage by companies and individuals in fiscal year (FY) 2024 and is maintaining that upturn in FY2025. In early October, the IRS announced modifications to its post-appeals mediation (PAM) program, now assigning unresolved cases to Office of Appeals teams with no prior involvement in the case for an expedited, unbiased review. Earlier this year, the IRS relaxed eligibility rules for its Fast Track Settlement program, allowing cases with some ineligible issues still to participate and enabling more taxpayers, especially small businesses/self-employed, to join after points at which such cases have traditionally been excluded from the program, for example, the issuance of a 30-day letter or filing a protest with the Office of Appeals.

ERC Claim Processing Impacted by Government Shutdown: The shutdown is worsening existing difficulties that taxpayers face in claiming the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) for businesses.

EU Countries Raise Concerns Over U.S. Global Tax Deal: Last week, the United States reportedly moved closer to a deal on coexistence with the OECD’s Pillar Two framework. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Estonia, have voiced skepticism, expressing concern that the United States might undercut Europe’s tax regime. Although the framework is intended to curb harmful tax practices and ensure multinational corporations pay a sufficient amount of tax, negotiations over U.S. exemptions risk weakening international support. OECD officials remain hopeful that a “side-by-side system” could preserve U.S. participation, but the path to a final agreement remains uncertain.

French DST Proposal Draws More Backlash from Congress: Last week, French lawmakers approved an amendment to increase the digital services tax on American technology companies from 3% to 6%. Sen.

The move signals a potential escalation in trade tensions between the two nations, especially as the EU continues to finalize a broad-based trade agreement with the United States.

Asia Trade Deals Include DST Concessions: Last week, the Trump administration signed new trade agreements and frameworks with several Asian countries, including Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand.

The French National Assembly has overwhelmingly rejected a provision in the 2026 finance bill that aimed to reduce the tax advantages of E85 ethanol and B100 biodiesel. The proposal sought to eliminate the preferential tax rate on B100, which is primarily used by transporters, and gradually reduce the tax advantage for E85 compared to conventional fuels.

The amendment put forward by Richard Ramos, a deputy from the MoDem party, was approved by 147 votes to 43, after receiving broad support from lawmakers across different political parties. Opponents of the measure included left-wing MPs, as well as those from right-wing and centrist parties. The opposition was primarily driven by concerns over the negative impact on the French agricultural sector, which supplies the raw materials used in these fuels.

A Unified Political Front Against the Reform

The agricultural sector’s mobilization played a key role in the rejection of the measure. The National Federation of Farmers’ Unions (FNSEA), which represents beet and rapeseed producers, strongly opposed the reform, highlighting the negative effects it would have on outlets for farmers’ produce. E85 and B100 biofuels represent crucial markets for agricultural raw materials, with approximately 1% of France’s usable agricultural land currently allocated to these crops.

Deputy Daniel Labaronne (Renaissance) emphasized the need to maintain these tax advantages to “preserve French industries” and avoid greater reliance on imported fossil fuels. He noted that nearly 120,000 French farmers are engaged in producing these biofuels.

Disagreements Over the Definition of Biofuels

The ecologist group, which voted against the amendment for its repeal, questioned the very definition of “biofuel” for products such as E85 and B100. Deputy Benoît Biteau, representing the ecologists, criticized the use of fossil fuel-based fertilizers in the production of these biofuel raw materials. He argued that these agrofuels do not meet ecological criteria and are far from being sustainable alternatives.

On the majority side, Public Accounts Minister Amélie de Montchalin had supported an interim solution that would have phased in the tax increase on B100 over two years, without revisiting the increase on E85. However, this amendment could not be debated before the repeal amendments, due to the order in which votes were held.

La France Insoumise abstained from voting, while the RN group defended the argument that the tax increase would have unfairly penalized motorists using these alternative fuels.

Use data to show progress against carbon neutrality or net zero goals, and to highlight where attention is still needed.","Just like we need graphs to help us believe that 2025 has really been the hottest year on record, or to track the much-needed slowdown in global warming that could help us avoid irreversible tipping points, businesses too need to see data first-hand to believe it – data that shows their carbon emissions clearly and helps them set realistic goals towards their sustainability targets.

Recently, I was reviewing carbon data with a client who was considering switching to enhanced CO₂e reporting. When we compared two different data sets, there was an “ah-ha” moment. The numbers showed that this company – a business with a high volume of corporate and events-related travel – had been over-investing in carbon offsetting. The travel manager realised that the savings from more accurate reporting would more than pay for the enhanced service. A simple example, but it demonstrates how better data doesn’t just improve credibility, it makes financial sense too.

Seeing is believing. When we see data presented in graphs or tables, it becomes tangible. There’s a source, a structure, something we can trust. In contrast, words are easy to say but they’re not always validated. That’s why, in sustainability, the story only matters if the numbers back it up.

“When we see data presented in graphs or tables, it becomes tangible”

Yet when companies suddenly find themselves under pressure to demonstrate sustainability action, the instinct is often to act fast rather than act accurately. Without robust data, knee-jerk decisions can lead to unintended consequences, such as cutting travel altogether. That might reduce emissions, but at what cost to sales, relationships, or growth? Good data gives you options. It can highlight opportunities to switch suppliers, move shorter flights to rail, or combine trips more efficiently, all while keeping the business moving.

Enhanced carbon reporting is still relatively new. For years, most organisations relied on standard DEFRA calculations. Now, as businesses demand more detailed insight, reporting tools are becoming more dynamic and accurate. The shift is clear: investing in good data upfront delivers benefits that far outweigh the cost financially, operationally, and reputationally.

There’s little point investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, carbon offsets, or removal projects if you can’t explain what those actions equate to. Let the numbers tell the story. Use data to show progress against carbon neutrality or net zero goals, and to highlight where attention is still needed. This year’s reductions or offsets only count for this year. Next year, the process begins again. Budgeting based on real data ensures that businesses are investing the right amount in the right places.

“When we compared two different data sets, there was an ‘ah-ha’ moment”

For travel and event managers, this is where sustainability becomes real. Numbers speak for themselves. If aviation emissions have dropped, the data will prove it. If the goal was to shift 20% of air travel to rail, the evidence is right there. Tracking progress throughout the year allows teams to adapt, refine and demonstrate impact, not just intention.

Good data doesn’t just measure progress. It drives it. And it won’t cost the earth (excuse the pun!).",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tbtm-3-1024x614.png,N,,2025-11-05 16:16:35.528217

Converting Waste into Drop-In Renewable Fuels

Honeywell has launched a new technology that turns agricultural and forestry waste into ready-to-use renewable fuels for carbon-intensive sectors, including shipping and aviation. The Biocrude Upgrading process produces low-carbon marine fuel, gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from widely available biomass such as wood chips and crop residues.

The innovation targets one of the most stubborn challenges in global decarbonisation: replacing heavy fuel oil in the maritime industry. These “drop-in” renewable fuels can be used directly in existing engines without costly retrofits, while offering a higher energy density than many biofuel alternatives—extending vessel range and operational efficiency.

Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said the company’s technology aligns with growing demand for scalable, cost-effective alternatives. “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from installation through to refining and use,” West said.

Decentralized Production, Central Refining

The Biocrude Upgrading process begins with converting biomass waste into a biocrude at collection sites, minimising transportation emissions and costs. The resulting feedstock is then refined at larger industrial facilities to produce fuels with performance comparable to conventional options.

By allowing biocrude conversion closer to the source and refining at scale, Honeywell’s model addresses one of the key logistical barriers to biomass-based fuels—costly feedstock transport and low energy yield.

The modular design further accelerates deployment by reducing construction timelines. Prefabricated plants can be installed faster than traditional facilities, offering a route to commercial-scale renewable fuel production with lower upfront risk.

Maritime Decarbonization Pressures Mount

The technology arrives as the global shipping industry faces intensifying regulatory and market pressure to curb emissions. Since the 1960s, heavy fuel oil—derived from the residues of gasoline and diesel refining—has powered most of the world’s merchant fleet, contributing roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Decarbonizing shipping remains a major technical and financial challenge. Alternative fuels like green methanol and ammonia are advancing but face infrastructure, storage, and safety constraints. Honeywell’s renewable marine fuel option could serve as a near-term transition pathway, leveraging existing port and vessel systems while reducing lifecycle emissions.

RELATED ARTICLE: Honeywell Launches Environmental Sustainability Index Showing Sustainability Leaders’ Sentiment

Expanding Honeywell’s Renewable Fuels Portfolio

The Biocrude Upgrading technology complements Honeywell’s expanding portfolio of renewable and synthetic fuel solutions. Over the past decade, the company has developed multiple pathways, including Ecofining™ for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) fuels, Ethanol to Jet (ETJ) for alcohol-based SAF production, Fischer-Tropsch Unicracking™ for advanced syngas conversion, and UOP eFining™—a system that turns green hydrogen and captured CO₂ into e-fuels.

Together, these systems reflect Honeywell’s integrated approach to low-carbon fuel production, spanning feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and carbon intensity reduction.

Implications for Investors and Policymakers

For investors and policymakers, Honeywell’s move highlights the accelerating convergence between industrial innovation and climate policy. As regulators tighten emissions standards and corporate customers demand cleaner logistics, scalable waste-to-fuel technologies are gaining strategic importance.

Beyond maritime transport, the modular biocrude model could influence how future SAF and renewable gasoline supply chains are structured—shifting production closer to agricultural hubs and aligning with circular economy principles.

With shipping responsible for nearly a billion tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, solutions that blend compatibility, scalability, and affordability are likely to shape the next phase of energy transition in transport. Honeywell’s latest technology positions it squarely within that shift—where waste becomes feedstock, and decarbonisation becomes practical.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Honeywell-Launches-Biomass-Conversion-Technology-to-Produce-Renewable-Marine-and-Aviation-Fuels.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 17:16:31.747408

Competitiveness and sustainability are the guiding principles of this package, which aims to make the EU transport system more efficient, interconnected, accessible, clean and resilient, according to the commission.

The measures presented Nov. 4 cover two key areas—rail, where Europe already leads on sustainability, and fuels, where Europe must now accelerate investments for its energy transition.

Faster, more connected rail across Europe

The new High-Speed Rail Action Plan sets out the steps needed to create a faster, more interoperable and better-connected European network by 2040.

It aims to cut journey times and make rail a more attractive alternative to short-haul air travel, thus increasing passenger numbers and boosting regional economies and tourism.

Building on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), the plan foresees to connect major nodes at speeds of 200 kilometers (124 miles) per hour and above.

Passengers will be able to travel from Berlin, Germany, to Copenhagen, Denmark, in four hours instead of the current seven, and from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, in six hours instead of the current 13 hours and 40 minutes.

New cross-border links will also enable faster and simpler journeys such as Paris–Lisbon via Madrid and improved connectivity between the Baltic capitals.

To deliver this vision, the commission proposes four key strands of action:

Removing cross-border bottlenecks through binding timelines to be set by 2027 and the identification of options for higher speeds, including well-above 250 kilometers (155 miles) per hour when economically viable.

Developing a coordinated financing strategy, including a strategic dialogue with member states, industry and financiers leading to a high-speed rail deal to mobilize the required investment.

Improving the conditions for the rail industry and rail operators to invest, develop innovative solutions and operate competitively, including through a more attractive regulatory environment, by enhancing cross-border ticketing and booking systems, supporting a second-hand market for rolling stock, accelerating the deployment of the EU digital-management systems, and fostering R&D and cooperation on scalable solutions.

Strengthening EU-level governance, requiring infrastructure managers to coordinate on capacity for cross-border long-distance services, and facilitating standardizations and authorizations.

Beyond shorter travel times, the plan will ease congestion and free up capacity on conventional lines, facilitating night trains, freight transport and military mobility, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness in tourism and industry.

Scaling up investment in renewable, low-carbon fuels

The second initiative adopted today—the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan—sets out a common approach to boost investment in renewable and low-carbon fuels focusing on aviation and waterborne transport.

To meet the RefuelEU aviation and FuelEU maritime targets, around 20 million metric tons of sustainable fuels (biofuels and eFuels) will be needed by 2035.

Achieving this will require an estimated 100-billion euros (USD$115 billion) in investment.

The STIP sends a clear signal to investors that Europe’s targets remain in place and that the commission will support the transition to a climate-neutral economy.

By accelerating domestic production of biological and nonbiological fuels, Europe can reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, enhance the competitiveness of its industries and lead the clean-energy transition globally.

Key investment measures aiming to mobilize at least 2.9-billion euros (USD$3.33 billion) through EU instruments by 2027 include:

At least 2-billion euros (USD$2.3 billion) for sustainable alternative fuels under InvestEU.

300-million euros (USD$344.6 million) through the European Hydrogen Bank to support hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and shipping.

446-million euros (USD$512.4 million) for synthetic aviation fuel and maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

133.5-million euros (USD$153.3 million) in fuels-related research and innovation under Horizon Europe.

On the top of these measures, the commission with the member states is preparing to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project by the end of 2025, aiming to mobilize at least 500-million euros (USD$574.2 million) for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

The commission will also work to strengthen the enabling conditions for market investments to bridge the investment gap.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_bfea5ec244fc4f19a2c3695e11bd2805~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_850,h_458,al_c,q_85/80995f_bfea5ec244fc4f19a2c3695e11bd2805~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-05 18:56:22.808807

AFBF’s key priorities include fair, enforceable trade agreements that protect market access; expanded support for biofuels such as ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel; and restoring whole milk options in schools to strengthen nutrition and dairy demand.

Newton also highlights the need to safeguard interstate commerce from conflicting state-level mandates, investigate pricing imbalances in fertilizer and equipment markets, and prioritize American-grown fruits and vegetables in federal purchasing. Each measure, he says, helps rebuild a dependable marketplace for producers.

News that Delta is now launching a new direct route between Atlanta and Riyadh is an exciting development. For the Saudi economy, the U.S. carrier’s entry is about more than just passenger travel. It enables tighter links to North America, stronger logistics flows, and the transfer of operational know-how that supports Vision 2030’s goals for smart mobility and diversified growth. The airline’s arrival in the Kingdom is set to add scale, reliability, and crucially, sustainability discipline at a critical moment.

The General Authority of Civil Aviation’s (GACA) Saudi Aviation Strategy puts environmental sustainability on par with safety and customer experience. The regulator launched the Civil Aviation Environmental Sustainability Program (CAESP) to guide operational improvements and the use of innovative fuels. Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport has also joined an ACI-led Net Zero roadmap. Together, these steps create a strong foundation for Delta’s technology transfer.

At the national level, the Saudi Green Initiative targets net-zero emissions by 2060, framing aviation decarbonization as part of a broader energy transition. Bringing in a U.S. carrier like Delta Air Lines with demonstrable progress on fuel efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and ground service equipment electrification fits the Vision 2030 push to make the Kingdom a leader in green aviation and smart mobility.

Delta’s sustainability strategy aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Its roadmap emphasizes three levers: what it flies (newer, more efficient aircraft), how it flies (operational efficiencies), and the fuel it uses (scaling sustainable aviation fuel).

The airline has also created a cross-divisional “Carbon Council” which focuses on driving fuel-saving measures such as weight reduction, optimized procedures and engine-wash programs. Earlier this year, the airline reported cumulative jet fuel savings of 45 million gallons,* becoming the first U.S. airline to hit its near-term fuel-savings goal through operational improvements alone.

Delta’s strategy also calls for increasing SAF usage, supported by offtake agreements with several producers and by coalition work to localize SAF value chains (e.g., the Minnesota SAF Hub). These are the kinds of commercial and policy interventions Saudi stakeholders want to cultivate as they map a domestic SAF ecosystem.

Delta’s new partnership with Riyadh Air, announced in 2024, will enable collaboration on important areas including aircraft maintenance, ground handling, staff training and digital transformation once approved. This gives the Saudi aviation sector a direct channel to the operational know-how and sustainability toolkits of one of the world’s most reliable carriers.

The partnership can bring global best practices in efficiency to Saudi aviation such as advancing SAF, electrified ground operations, and next-gen technology in alignment with GACA’s CAESP framework and the Saudi Green Initiative. This will enable Riyadh to grow as a smart, low-carbon hub connecting the Kingdom to the world and accelerating Vision 2030.

The opening of a two-day program on Wednesday was attended by top IATA management executives and the chair of Turkish Airlines, Ahmet Bolat.
In its Türkiye report, the IATA also underscored the aviation sector's crucial role in enabling the development of dynamic and efficient supply chains and in driving the growth in e-commerce.","The top global aviation body highlighted in a new report Türkiye's strong global standing in the air transport sector and its contributions to the economy, while also describing key priorities to continue generating benefits from it.

""Türkiye is a global aviation powerhouse. International passenger departures have surged by nearly 70% over the past decade, making Türkiye the world’s seventh-largest market by passenger departures,"" said the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The association released ""The Value of Air Transport for Türkiye"" study at the IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and World Passenger Symposium (WPS) held in Istanbul this week. The event organized by IATA is hosted by Türkiye's flag carrier, Turkish Airlines (THY).

The opening of a two-day program on Wednesday was attended by top IATA management executives and the chair of Turkish Airlines, Ahmet Bolat.

The report published by IATA quantifies the substantial benefits that aviation, including aviation-related tourism, generates in terms of jobs and economic activity in Türkiye, based on 2023 data.

Highlights from 2023 data show that aviation supports and facilitates $82.4 billion of economic activity, when total impact, including wider supply chain, employee spending and tourism activities, is included, which equals 7.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), IATA said.

It also cited that the sector provides 2 million jobs indirectly, when wider supply chain and tourism activities are included, 53,000 of which are directly employed by airlines.

The aviation sector in Türkiye enjoyed a strong boom in recent decades and strong investment in infrastructure, which is visible in the opening of new air hubs as well as the expansion of existing ones, has propelled it to new heights. The opening of Istanbul Airport, the new runway at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, the push to boost connectivity of the capital Ankara and new terminals at Antalya Airport serve as some of the examples of the aim for boosting connectivity and the country's position in aviation globally.

Key priorities

""Continued prioritization of aviation as a strategic sector anchored in competitive costs, sufficient capacity, and leveraging the opportunities that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers will be vital to sustaining Türkiye’s leadership in global air transport,"" said Nick Careen, IATA senior vice president of operations, safety and security.

Answering a question by Daily Sabah on the feasibility of bolstering passenger volumes and if low-cost carriers could play a role in this, Careen said that ""there is room for everyone.""

Citing as an example Turkish Airlines' launch of its low-cost subsidiary AJet, he noted there ""would be room for all types of models, (and) Türkiye won't be any different than that.""

""There is competition and that's healthy,"" he added.

""Tourism supported by aviation contributes $49.6 billion to the country’s GDP and employs 1.2 million people,"" the IATA survey also said.

Moreover, it also identified three key priorities for the country to continue generating benefits, including infrastructure, capacity-building and sustainability.

""As Türkiye makes significant investments in airport infrastructure and digitalization, it is critical to work with the industry to ensure cost competitiveness,"" it said. It also suggested that ensuring a skilled workforce across all areas of aviation will enable Türkiye to fulfill its ambitious growth strategy.

At the same time, on the sustainability side, it pointed out that leveraging the opportunities that SAF offers ""will be key to achieving Türkiye’s decarbonization goals.""

Türkiye's civil aviation authority announced earlier this year that the country will set mandates for airlines and jet fuel suppliers to enhance uptake of SAF, with a goal of curbing aviation emissions by 5% by 2030. The move is aimed at complying with the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization's emission reduction scheme that will become mandatory in 2027.

In its Türkiye report, the IATA also underscored the aviation sector's crucial role in enabling the development of dynamic and efficient supply chains and in driving the growth in e-commerce. It also noted that 1.7 million tons of air cargo were transported through airports in Türkiye in 2023, supporting the country’s total import and export volumes.

Türkiye sits at a crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa, and its flag carrier boasts a wide network – being the airline flying to more nations than any competitor. Turkish Airlines also aims to further expand its fleet and have more than 800 planes as part of its 2033 strategy.

Global air travel and demand have largely recovered in 2024 following COVID-19-related disruptions, and the IATA considers the sector will still continue to thrive ""despite noise which exists everywhere,"" as noted by Careen.

In a separate report, IATA released the results of its 2025 Global Passenger Survey (GPS), highlighting two key trends that are redefining the passenger travel experience – mobile reliance is rising and biometric adoption is accelerating.

""Travelers are increasingly using their smartphones to book flights, manage payments and loyalty programs, and handle check-in, immigration, boarding and baggage processes. Enthusiasm for mobile-enabled travel is higher than ever,"" it said.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2025/11/05/thumbs/800x531/410117.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:00:52.361393

Meeting the combined requirements of both regulations will demand around 20 million tons of sustainable alternative fuels by 2035, including 13.2 Mt of biofuels and 6.8 Mt of e-fuels. The Commission estimates that reaching these levels will require approximately €100 billion ($115 billion) in investment over the next decade.

Early Financing Measures to Bridge Market Gaps

To provide clarity for developers and investors, the Commission emphasized that regulatory targets will remain stable and that STIP is intended to de-risk early projects. EU-level measures under the plan are expected to mobilize at least €2.9 billion ($3.33 billion) through 2027, spanning multiple funding mechanisms.

Key financial actions include the mobilization of €2 billion ($2.3 billion) through InvestEU to support sustainable fuel production, alongside €300 million ($345 million) through the European Hydrogen Bank for hydrogen-based aviation and maritime fuels.

Additional support includes €133 million ($153 million) for research and innovation via Horizon Europe, plus €446 million ($513 million) from the Innovation Fund for synthetic fuel – aviation and maritime applications.

The Commission will also launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition by year-end, working with participating Member States to mobilize at least €500 million ($575 million) for early synthetic SAF production.

Looking beyond 2027, the Commission plans to develop an intermediary market mechanism that links fuel producers and buyers, offering revenue certainty to catalyze private investment. STIP also aims to reduce administrative burdens for airlines and shipping operators and to enhance international cooperation to safeguard EU industrial interests and maintain fair competition.

Industry organizations like the SASHA Coalition welcomed the new plan, however, with some criticism. “An extension of the ETS is still missing, and without it, we won’t generate the revenues needed to truly accelerate decarbonisation in aviation and maritime,” said Aurelia Leeuw, Director of EU Policy at the SASHA Coalition.

“And while it’s positive to see recognition of zero-emission aircraft and hydrogen’s role, support for zero-emission technologies across the board remains limited.”",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-pixabay-262353-1024x683.png,N,,2025-11-05 09:56:25.149321

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia - alongside China - could supply about 240M tonnes, which would be 15% of total global biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.
The report estimated that around 1,580M tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300M tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.
Walsh said Asia would play a world leading role in the transition to net zero by 2050.
IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen also highlighted the Southeast Asia as a key region for the sector.","The region had vast feedstock potential and Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were well-positioned to develop feedstocks that could be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector, Walsh said in the 21 October report.

“There’s an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil and create a positive outcome for the environment as well,” Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.

According to IATA’s ‘Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production – Outlook to 2050 ’ report, the world could produce up to 400M tonnes of SAF by 2050, a major increase from the estimated 2M tonnes in 2025 but still below the 500M tonnes required for the industry to reach net zero carbon emissions.

The IATA report highlighted Southeast Asia as one of the most promising regions for feedstock availability due to its agricultural residues, palm oil mill effluent (POME) and municipal solid waste that could be processed into SAF.

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia - alongside China - could supply about 240M tonnes, which would be 15% of total global biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.

Biomass feedstock potential was projected to exceed 12,000M tonnes by 2050 globally, but less than 35% of that would realistically be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing needs in other industries.

The report estimated that around 1,580M tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300M tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.

Walsh said Asia would play a world leading role in the transition to net zero by 2050.

He added that Cathay Pacific was a world leader in sustainability due to its commitment to helping the industry transition to net zero.

IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen also highlighted the Southeast Asia as a key region for the sector.

“This region is the main generator of the solutions we need for airlines’ decarbonisation over the coming decades.”

However, she added that while optimism remained high, the industry still needed to progress.

Recent ICCT research highlights why these advanced fuels—particularly synthetic fuels—are essential for decarbonizing both maritime shipping and aviation. However, it also identifies that high upfront capital costs and market uncertainties continue to delay final investment decisions. For example, our recent report on SAFs found these to be the main barriers still holding back fuel production. Without targeted support, Europe risks falling short of its 0.7% synthetic SAF target by 2030.these to be the main barriers still holding back fuel production. Without targeted support, Europe risks falling short of its 0.7% synthetic SAF target by 2030.

With the STIP, the Commission aims to tackle investment barriers with revenue certainty measures. To understand what’s at stake—and how far these measures might go—it’s worth revisiting the scale of the challenge.

E-fuels are necessary for long-term aviation and marine decarbonization

Synthetic fuels, which include e-fuels made from renewable electricity, water, and carbon dioxide, are a key focus of aviation and marine decarbonization efforts. This is due in part to a lack of viable alternatives. Second-generation biofuels produced from solid waste or cellulosic feedstocks can have very low GHG emissions, but their long-term contribution is constrained by resource availability. For aviation, hydrogen and battery powered aircraft face significant technology barriers and will be slow to displace aircraft used for the long-haul flights that generate the bulk of emissions from the sector. In contrast, e-fuels are scalable solutions, in the form of e-kerosene for the aviation sector and e-ammonia or e-methanol for the marine sector.

So, why do so many e-fuel and second-generation biofuel projects in Europe struggle to reach final investment decisions despite clear demand signals through the EU’s FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations?

Let’s take a look at the aviation sector’s challenge with synthetic SAF, or e-kerosene, to understand.

The case of e-kerosene

Despite numerous project announcements, the largest e-kerosene plant operating in Europe produces approximately 2,000 tonnes of SAF per year, only 0.4% of what will be required in 2030 by EU and UK policies. Other projects have been cancelled or postponed, highlighting the challenge of going from project announcement to steel in the ground.

Our report helps explain why. Despite the synthetic fuel sub-mandates and significant non-compliance penalties, the future market price for synthetic SAF is difficult to predict. And with e-kerosene facilities requiring US$1–2 billion in construction costs, it may take decades to break even. Thus, the risk that pioneering facilities fail to cover costs due to policy shifts or low market prices is too high for most investors, particularly providers of debt capital.

To mitigate these risks, project developers typically turn to offtake contracts with airlines, but these are no panacea. Airlines with famously thin margins are in no hurry to lock in high fuel costs when competitors might be able to secure synthetic SAF at a lower cost in the future.

It’s a similar story for shippers. Bunker fuels are usually purchased on short contracts. But without these contracts, most synthetic fuel projects cannot raise money for preliminary engineering studies, let alone construction. And if construction doesn’t begin in a timely manner, there might not be enough synthetic fuel to meet ReFuelEU’s 2030 requirements, forcing policymakers into the uncomfortable position of penalizing jet fuel providers for not supplying fuel that doesn’t exist.

How the STIP can help

Luckily, there is a policy option. ICCT’s research shows that revenue certainty mechanisms—which allow the government to set a fixed long-term price, offering producers the predictability needed to secure investment—are the most effective way to unlock financing for first-of-a-kind fuel producers. Such mechanisms have been highly successful in the case of offshore wind projects, which face similar challenges of long payback periods and high levels of capital investment.

The STIP signals that the Commission recognizes the need for revenue certainty. In the case of SAF specifically, the STIP states that the Commission could extend the SAF allowances mechanism within the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which covers a certain percentage of the price gap between SAF and fossil jet fuel. While such a measure would reduce the cost of SAF for airlines, ICCT’s research suggests that additional revenue certainty benefiting SAF producers directly would also be key to bringing new production online.

Thus, the STIP proposes additional measures to support low-GHG marine and aviation fuels. The Commission will launch pilot projects, including one that sets up a double-sided auction for e-SAF. This double-sided auction will establish a “market intermediary” that connects SAF suppliers and consumers, offering long-term contracts to provide revenue certainty to fuel producers as well as short-term contracts on the offtake side. The Commission also commits to assessing the feasibility of an EU-wide double auction to support both aviation and marine sustainable fuels. If designed and implemented quickly, such measures could provide the certainty needed to get today’s advanced SAF and marine fuel projects off the ground and accelerate progress toward fulfilling ReFuelEU and FuelEU Maritime targets.

LanzaJet has secured ten million pounds from the United Kingdom Advanced Fuels Fund to advance Project Speedbird, an ethanol to SAF facility planned for Teesside. Fluor has now been appointed to perform the front end engineering and design FEED, the activity that converts conceptual sketches into a construction ready blueprint. Together, public finance and experienced engineering dramatically increase the likelihood that the plant will pass a final investment decision within the next eighteen months.

Community and Economic Benefits

The project expects to deliver more than ninety thousand tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel plus renewable diesel every year. Airlines will benefit directly, yet the ripple effects are equally notable. Hundreds of skilled positions will be needed during construction and operation, supporting local training providers and suppliers across the North East. By valorising waste derived ethanol, Project Speedbird also opens a new demand centre for agricultural residues, offering farmers an additional revenue stream without changing crop patterns.

An Overlooked Financial Advantage

One insight that often escapes attention is the revenue flexibility created by producing both SAF and road ready renewable diesel in a single plant. This product split lets the operator respond quickly to price signals in either market, smoothing cash flow and reducing exposure to any single offtake agreement. Financial institutions commonly view such optionality as a hedge, which can translate into more favourable lending terms and therefore lower overall project cost.

Conclusion

With government funding secured and Fluor advancing detailed design, Project Speedbird is converting vision into credible infrastructure.

Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative to understand how smarter use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could help reduce the climate impact of contrails, the thin clouds of ice crystals that often trail behind aircraft.

The project, titled Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport.

It is co-funded by the Non-CO₂ Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), in partnership with the Department for Business and Trade and Innovate UK.

While SAF’s role in cutting carbon emissions is well established, scientists believe its benefits could go further. Flight tests have shown that using SAF can reduce the number of ice crystals formed in contrails, thereby lowering their contribution to global warming.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said the company wants to unlock the wider environmental potential of SAF.

“SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO₂ emissions,” he said. “This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF, which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO₂ climate effects as well.”

How targeted use of SAF could reduce contrail warming

Because the current supply of SAF is limited, QRITOS will explore how best to deploy it.

Rather than blending small quantities across all flights, the team will examine whether prioritising aircraft most likely to produce persistent contrails could deliver greater environmental gains.

Constantly changing weather conditions mean that only a small proportion of flights are responsible for most of aviation’s contrail-related warming.

The project will combine British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling, and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation when SAF is used strategically.

Project manager Marcin Dutka from Rolls-Royce said early measurements show clear promise.

“Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties,” he said. “This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

Rolls-Royce leads UK aviation project to cut non-CO₂ emissions

UK Industry Minister Chris McDonald said QRITOS shows how collaboration between government, academia, and business can accelerate sustainable innovation.

“This is government and business working together at its best,” he said. “I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.”

The two-year project, due to conclude in April 2027, will also improve forecasting methods and enhance contrail modelling using satellite data.

Tom Byrne, British Airways’ Head of Net Zero and Environment, said the airline sees SAF as central to the future of flight.

“Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails,” he said. “By combining research, satellite data, and real-world flight trials, we’re working to unlock smarter, more targeted use of SAF — ensuring that every drop delivers maximum benefit.”

Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy at Heathrow, said the airport is proud to support research into practical ways to cut non-CO₂ emissions.

“As SAF continues to scale, it’s important to examine how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit,” he said.

Imperial College London’s Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham added that the project will advance both scientific understanding and technical tools.

“We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques,” he said. “This is a great opportunity to learn about the potential benefits of targeted SAF use and to improve our ability to detect and analyse contrails.”

What are contrails and how do they affect climate change?

Contrails — short for condensation trails — form when aircraft engines emit water vapour, soot, and other particles into cold, humid air at high altitude. The vapour condenses around these particles, creating tiny ice crystals that appear as white streaks across the sky.

Most contrails disappear quickly, but some linger and spread into thin cirrus clouds that trap heat escaping from the Earth’s surface. These persistent contrails can have a measurable warming effect on the atmosphere.

Studies suggest that while contrails last only a few hours, their short-term warming impact can exceed that of the CO₂ released by the same flight.

At night, when no sunlight is reflected back into space, contrails act like a blanket, trapping heat and amplifying warming. During the day, they have a dual effect, reflecting some sunlight while still retaining heat.

Scientists estimate that fewer than 3% of global flights produce around 80% of contrail-related warming. This concentration means that targeting specific flights or routes, through smart SAF deployment or route adjustments, could substantially reduce aviation’s non-CO₂ climate footprint.

Tackling aviation’s CO₂ and non-CO₂ climate impact

Aviation contributes roughly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, but its total warming impact is significantly higher once non-CO₂ effects such as contrails are included.

Despite remaining uncertainties over their precise impact, experts agree that contrails significantly amplify aviation’s climate footprint.

The QRITOS project represents a new step in addressing that challenge, not by replacing decarbonisation efforts, but by complementing them with improved atmospheric understanding and smarter fuel use.

As Eastham noted, enhancing the ability to predict and measure contrails will be vital to ensuring new technologies deliver genuine climate benefits.

Istanbul - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released the Value of Air Transport study for the Republic of Türkiye, at the IATA World Financial Symposium and World Passenger Symposium in Istanbul hosted by Turkish Airlines. The report (pdf) quantifies the substantial benefits that aviation (including aviation-related tourism) generates in terms of jobs and economic activity in the country. Highlights from 2023 data show that aviation supports and facilitates:

USD 82.4 billion of economic activity (total impact including wider supply chain, employee spending, and tourism activities), equal to 7.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

2 million jobs (total impact including wider supply chain, employee spending, and tourism activities), 53,000 of which are directly employed by airlines

7 million tonnes of air cargo

“Türkiye is a global aviation powerhouse. International passenger departures have surged by nearly 70% over the past decade, making Türkiye the world’s seventh-largest market by passenger departures. Its airlines are driving regional and international connectivity, strengthening trade, tourism, and economic opportunity. Aviation already supports over 2 million jobs and contributes 7.4% to the nation’s GDP. Continued prioritization of aviation as a strategic sector anchored in competitive costs, sufficient capacity, and leveraging the opportunities that Sustainable Aviation Fuel offers will be vital to sustaining Türkiye’s leadership in global air transport,” said Nick Careen, IATA Senior Vice President, Operations, Safety and Security.

Key priorities for Türkiye

To continue generating benefits from aviation, IATA outlines three key priorities for the country:

Infrastructure: As Türkiye makes significant investments in airport infrastructure and digitalization, it is critical to work with the industry to ensure cost competitiveness.

Capacity-Building: Ensuring a skilled workforce across all areas of aviation will enable Türkiye to fulfill its ambitious growth strategy.

Sustainability: Leveraging the opportunities that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers will be key to achieving Türkiye’s decarbonization goals. An IATA study highlights the potential to scale up sustainable biomass resources and invest in local SAF production to meet national targets and capture growing regional demand.

The world’s attention will be focused on COP30 in Brazil over the coming two weeks. As with all COPs, it’s an important opportunity to take stock of where we are at regarding the efforts to decarbonize air transport.

But first, let’s clarify who does what in that domain. Domestic air transport falls under the responsibility of national governments and is relevant to the UNFCCC COP process as States need to report on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). International aviation has been under the responsibility of the UN special agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for 80 years.

It’s been almost a decade since ICAO member States agreed in 2016 to establish a globally harmonized scheme called CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) to tackle CO2 emissions from international air transport. Early last month, the ICAO Assembly reviewed its progress, looking at how well CORSIA is working. When fully operational, aviation’s international carbon emissions should be stabilized at 85% of 2019 levels.

The significance of CORSIA should not be underestimated in the effort to decarbonize flying. CORSIA is the first and only global agreement to manage CO2 emissions of an industrial sector. Governments have agreed that it will be the only economic measure applied to international aviation, preserving fairness. This principle was reaffirmed at the recent ICAO 42nd Assembly. Thanks to ICAO’s quality criteria for CORSIA carbon credits, they are the most sought-after in the carbon credit market. A fully developed, transparent, liquid, and trusted carbon market will be able to raise money from all kinds of global investors for projects in mostly developing countries that generate certified CO2 emissions reductions. What is there not to love?

Over CORSIA’s lifetime until 2035, airlines will likely pay between USD 30-60 billion to be compliant with their obligations under CORSIA, and voluntary demand for credits has great potential. However, countries that have eligible projects may choose to use their credits for other purposes than for air transport, or they might find the necessary administrative and other procedures too difficult to overcome. This has resulted in an acutely under-supplied market where Guyana is currently the only State that has made credits available in the market. It is a most perplexing paradox that the UN Member States in ICAO put an obligation on airlines to buy CORSIA credits, but the same UN Member States under COP are not obliged to make the credits available to airlines.

In that light, it is both exasperating and disappointing that many States are putting forward proposals that undermine CORSIA. That includes the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, which was initiated at COP28 to investigate novel sources of funding for climate action, as well as the EU’s so far failed attempts to impose its ETS extra-territorially. Such initiatives completely ignore the commitment the same States made at ICAO - that CORSIA should be the single, one and only solution for charging international airlines for their CO2 emissions.

Of course, carbon credits are only one part of air transport’s decarbonization. The major contribution to our industry’s emissions reductions will be from replacing fossil-based jet fuel with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Today though, there is only enough SAF in the world to cover less than 1% of our energy needs. Why? Fundamentally because government incentives continue to favor fossil fuels, making these energies a much more lucrative investment than renewable fuels.

There is a common message for governments emanating from the current state of play regarding both SAF and CORSIA. It can be summed up in one word—clarity.

CORSIA is a great mechanism and achievement. Governments must unambiguously support its success and refrain from undermining it by introducing competing and duplicative taxes and charges.

SAF is the game changer for decarbonizing aviation and a vector for growth in its own right. Governments must support the production ramp-up of SAF with incentives and policies that clearly make it a winning investment - and one that will benefit all users of renewable fuels, of which market air transport only represents around 10%.

At the 42nd ICAO Assembly governments gave us assurances of this clarity. Over the three years until the next Assembly, we need to see this materializing in real policies and initiatives. And over the next weeks at COP30, we count on those same governments to demonstrate their will to enact policies that are consistent with their goals, provide the clarity that investors need, and take advantage of the opportunities that come in its wake.

Domestic airlines in producing countries would enter long-term offtake agreements at Jet fuel prices and become the enablers of this bilateral book and claim system under Article 6.","The global aviation industry stands at a defining crossroads. It is caught between the reality of its high carbon emissions, expected demand growth and the barriers to scaling and adopting the complex array of emerging sustainable and technological innovations. Although accounting for a relatively low share of global emissions relative to other sectors, it is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise which represents a huge challenge. This is particularly critical in Latin America, where aviation serves as a fundamental enabler of connectivity, territorial cohesion and economic development in ways that differ markedly from more mature markets in Europe, Asia and the United States.

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is ambitious. Emerging markets passengers generally travel less, and increasingly in newer, more efficient aircraft which also tend to carry more passengers per flight leading to lower emissions intensity per seat flown. In line with the UNFCCC common but differentiated responsibilities principles, the realities of developing countries with relatively smaller environmental footprints and urgent economic needs must be considered. Our industry must collaborate globally, and quickly, to unlock and optimize the decarbonization solutions available today and those needed for the future across all regions.

SAF scaleup challenges

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF could deliver as much as two-thirds of the sector’s global emissions reductions by 2050. Yet today, SAF makes up less than 1 percent of global aviation fuel use. This gap must be closed – with haste but also in a truly sustainable and just manner. Global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach more than 400mn tons by 2050. SAF demand from developed countries with limited feedstocks is expected to surge particularly in the EU, UK, Japan and Singapore. Developing countries with existing renewable fuels infrastructure and feedstock availability such as Brazil can seize the opportunity to become SAF exporters at scale but face significant challenges:

Financing for SAF projects is limited due to the lack of long-term off-take agreements from airlines. High domestic fuel prices, regulatory complexity, and economic uncertainty are holding investment back.

Fuel costs represent around 40% of Brazilian airlines operating costs and regional customer demand is highly sensitive to price.

In 2023, the Brazilian Airlines Association (ABEAR) found that Brazilian jet fuel was as much as 50 percent more expensive than in the United States – driven by domestic pricing policies, taxes, and currency volatility.

Based on current global market developments, the cost of SAF could be over 4 times higher than the average price of conventional jet fuel

At these price points, it will not be feasible for countries to scale SAF adoption without ticket prices increasing materially, sacrificing customer affordability, territorial connectivity and economic development in their domestic markets. There is simply no realistic economic model for SAF without support for the end customer and limited leeway from developing country governments with numerous other priorities to provide it.

Moreover, there are multiple pathways to producing SAF – including waste oils like used cooking oil, biomass including agricultural residues, oils from agricultural crops, municipal solid waste, algae and other advanced bio-based materials. Despite the variety, not all feedstocks deliver the right climate benefits, and some raise serious concerns around land use and nature impact in relation to biodiversity and water at systems level.

A blueprint for collaborative financing

At ABRA Group – one of Latin America’s largest airline groups owning Avianca, a Colombian airline, Gol the second largest Brazilian airline as well as Wamos, a wet lease company, we lead in terms of operational efficiencies and seek to identify solutions which are pragmatic, workable and rely on existing mechanisms and frameworks which can be adapted to solve some of the intractable challenges for our industry. We believe SAF can be one of the long-term solutions available to aviation if it complies with two key sustainability principles:

Financial sustainability across the value chain and regional markets

Environmental sustainability: protecting against unintended consequences by focusing beyond carbon emissions reductions. Any solutions must also consider potential impacts on nature (understood as water & biodiversity at landscape and systems level)

Developing countries with SAF production capabilities such as Brazil, can and should supply the world with the SAF needed, but the investment model does not work due to the relative cost of SAF vs jet, the financial reality of regional airlines and potential resulting impact on connectivity and economic development. Currently, the key barrier to investment in SAF projects is ultimately price; and without resolving the issue of demand, SAF projects are not securing the financing needed.

We believe collaborative solutions, where advanced economies support the development of the industry in developing countries, are the future and will provide credibility to unlock financing, reduce implementation costs for all involved and provide assurance for the true environmental sustainability of SAF. Through our active participation in regional SAF policy conversations and established network across multiple Latin American countries, we are uniquely positioned to help shape these collaborative frameworks.

Today, we are proposing leveraging the Article 6 framework of the Paris Agreement to channel investment from developed economies with limited SAF feedstocks to developing countries with SAF production potential via bilateral Book and Claim agreements. Such arrangements would have three key benefits:

Unlock financing to produce SAF in the most cost-efficient locations

Consolidate SAF production under international norms and standards to avoid damaging domestic-only policies

Protect the sustainability of SAF at scale by enabling the highest environmental standards as required by developed economies and passengers with the ability to pay

Proposal: leverage Article 6 bilateral agreements to enable collaborative financing of SAF

SAF importer countries, for example Japan or Singapore, can unlock financing of SAF projects in developing producer countries by entering into long-term offtake agreements for the emissions reductions delivered by SAF in the form of SAFc (Scope 1) certificates. A portion of such emissions reductions would be contributed back by the developed country to the producing country for the latter to achieve its own objectives under its NDCs –therefore avoiding double counting. Domestic airlines in producing countries would enter long-term offtake agreements at Jet fuel prices and become the enablers of this bilateral book and claim system under Article 6. Other third parties such as multilateral agencies can also provide additional temporary support until the price of SAF reaches long term sustainable levels for all.

The motivation for developed countries to do this can stem from various factors:

The desire to ensure energy security through bilateral agreements in a multilateral world, support key allies or national champions with access to feedstocks at scale

As a strategy to reach its own NDCs via the use of carbon credits in the form of SAFc’s while supporting renewable energy markets

As a strategy to enable more cost – and emissions-efficient SAF for its domestic airlines to reach their own NDC targets (since neither SAF or its feedstocks need to be transported under this mechanism and SAF can be produced in more cost-effective jurisdictions)

Other third parties can eventually also be involved in this collaborative cost sharing arrangement such as multilateral agencies who can support Revenue Assurance mechanisms for a period of time and airline customers who can contribute through payments for their Scope 3 emissions reductions generated by this system.

All parties benefit

We believe this system addresses key challenges but also distributes the benefits fairly and across all participants. Governments of developed markets achieve their emissions reductions and energy objectives, developing countries unlock financing to build renewable energy industries, increase employment and knowledge sharing, while their airlines can continue to provide the essential connectivity needed to support economic development. Developed country airlines potentially benefit from access to high quality, cost effective SAF to complement that produced domestically, and SAF producers can access financing needed by demonstrating secure long term offtake agreements under Article 6 therefore unlocking production of SAF at scale around the world to serve the needs of the airline industry.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey. However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios. However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

Constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights. This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails. The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports. It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

The project aims to show that we can prioritise particular flights for SAF, focusing on where it can deliver the greatest environmental benefit and maximise the effectiveness of the current levels of supply.

The Non-CO2 Programme focuses on addressing challenges with reducing non-CO2 emissions from aircraft, as outlined in the ATI’s Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. The funding programme is delivered by the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and Innovate UK, in partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

“We’re bolstering our support for the aerospace industry through our modern Industrial Strategy – giving business the confidence it needs to invest in UK advanced manufacturing and delivering on growth as part of our Plan for Change.”

Project milestones and implementation

Over the past year, MENA Biofuels has secured land adjacent to MENA Terminals from the Government of Fujairah, completed feasibility, topographic and hydrological studies, and appointed Dynatron FZE as project manager.

It has also selected a technology provider for converting waste feedstocks into SAF and commissioned MUC Engineering, Fujairah Branch to conduct the Environmental Impact Assessment and oversee NOC requirements.

The company has contracted Robert Wright, former CEO of the European Biofuels Association, to advise on policy and regulation.

The project aligns with the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 strategy, offering airlines a domestic supply route for certified SAF rather than relying solely on imports.

At ADIPEC 2025, MENA Biofuels signed a strategic offtake MoU with Emarat in the presence of Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. A similar agreement is expected to be signed at the Dubai Airshow, formalising early demand ahead of commercial production.

Ali Khalifa Al Shamsi, Chief Executive Officer of Emarat, said that the project requires “investors, technology and distributors pulling in one direction.”

Further stating that the agreement aims to accelerate locally produced, certified SAF volumes from Fujairah, “twelve months from concept to implementation sends a clear signal that the UAE is serious about sustainable aviation fuel.”

EPCC tendering and next steps

MENA Biofuels has launched the first of two Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) tenders, covering receiving, storage and distribution facilities for feedstock, SAF and by-products.

The package forms the logistical backbone of the project. A second tender for the refinery process units and associated infrastructure is scheduled for Q1 2026.

Captain Salem Al Afkham, Director of FOIZ, described the project as “a defining milestone for the UAE and Fujairah,” saying it supports the emirate’s ambition to diversify its energy mix and move into cleaner, higher-value fuels, positioning FOIZ beyond its traditional role as a storage and bunkering hub.

In Afkham’s words, FOIZ is evolving into “a fully integrated energy ecosystem” capable of converting feedstocks into sustainable fuels, reinforcing the UAE’s clean-energy agenda.

It will ultimately help transition the company from demonstration to full-scale operations.

The team will explore how the fuel, produced with OXCCU's novel iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, can potentially reduce the warming associated with burning hydrocarbon fuel in a jet turbine.

The focus will include soot particles, which can cause cloud formation at altitude and therefore impact global warming – though the amount of warming these particles cause is dependent on conditions and subject to ongoing research.

It comes as the UK pushes for 10 per cent of jet fuel to use SAF by 2030.

JC Chemical's management recently met with Malaysia's Minister of Investment and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz to discuss the construction of a used cooking oil (UCO) processing plant in Malaysia, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Malaysia said in a statement on Nov. 4.

""This discussion aligns with Malaysia's National Energy Transition Roadmap and the New Industrial Master Plan 2030,"" Aziz said during the meeting, adding that the goal is to accelerate the transition to a sustainable and high-value industrial economy, according to the South Korean embassy statement.

JC Chemical's investment in Malaysia could serve as a case study for other South Korean companies aiming to enter the overseas SAF production market, with many seeking opportunities in Southeast Asia, a senior market research analyst at Seoul-based Korea International Trade Association told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Asia is emerging as a major region for SAF production, given its abundant resources like palm oil and used cooking oil, coupled with a rapidly growing aviation market. The synergy between South Korean technology and Malaysia's raw materials and geographical advantages could yield significant benefits, the KITA analyst said.

JC Chemical has recently succeeded in exporting SAF raw materials using its proprietary technology, strengthening its position in the global market. The company completed the expansion of its bio-feedstock pretreatment (PTU) process, setting the foundation to boost the supply chain for sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks for major local and international refiners, Platts reported previously.

The successful expansion of the PTU process enabled the bio-feedstock output capacity of the JC Chemical plant in Ulsan to double from 60,000 metric tons/year to 120,000 mt/year, the company spokesperson said on Oct. 27.

JC Chemical's expansion will enable the company to secure PTU volumes that will directly support SAF conversion projects for both domestic and international refiners. The company has already signed a SAF raw material supply contract with SK Energy and is close to finalizing a long-term supply agreement with a major US refiner, though the specific refiner has not been disclosed, Platts reported previously.

SAF, jet fuel dual focus

Meanwhile, sales traders and supply managers at two major South Korean refiners based in Seoul and trading offices in Singapore told Platts over Nov. 3-5 that the companies are committed to both sustainability and core operations in conventional jet fuel production and sales.

South Korea is the world's leading exporter and supplier of jet fuel, with the country's four major refiners—SK Energy, Hyundai Oilbank, S-Oil, and GS Caltex—selling 8.8 million barrels of the middle distillate in international markets in September, a 1.7% increase from 8.65 million barrels a year earlier, according to the latest data from state-run Korea National Oil Corp.

""While SAF is set to become a core future business, it is essential not to overlook the need to provide Asia-Oceania customers with a stable supply of conventional jet fuel,"" a sales and trading manager at a South Korean refiner operating in Singapore told Platts on Nov. 5.

SK Energy's co-processing technology enables the simultaneous production of both SAF and traditional jet fuel, boosting operational flexibility and competitiveness, supply and distribution planner Yang Hong-suk said in the company's analysis report.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-05 08:17:48.955235

Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just a fuel, it’s a bridge that connects economic growth with environmental stewardship.","Every generation faces a defining challenge. Ours is the climate crisis. But within this challenge, lies the greatest opportunity of our lifetime – to redesign how we live, move and grow in balance with the planet.

At LanzaJet, we see this as an invitation to reimagine energy systems for a world that works with, not against, our environment. We were founded on a simple but powerful premise: That technology, innovation and collaboration can decarbonise flight, and in doing so, unlock prosperity that is shared, sustained and regenerative.

With that effect, our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not just a cleaner drop-in replacement for fossil jet fuel, but represents a rethinking of the fuel economy itself. One that aligns the wellbeing of people, planet and industry.

Steering towards a net zero future for aviation

Aviation connects the world. It supports 65 million jobs globally and underpins nearly 4% of the world’s GDP. Yet, aviation also accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions, and its climate impact extends beyond that, through non-CO2 effects like contrails, the thin white lines behind high-flying aircraft that may look harmless but contribute to climate warming.

The unfortunate truth is that if aviation were a country, it would rank among the world’s top 10 emitters. But we believe this sector that brings humanity closer together, can also help lead in bringing us back in balance with the planet.

LanzaJet’s mission is to enable the aviation industry’s net-zero transition through scalable, affordable and sustainable fuel solutions. Our Ethanol-to-Jet (EtJ) technology converts low-carbon ethanol into a drop-in fuel, compatible with existing aircraft. That means airlines don’t need to build new engines or redesign planes. Instead, they can start cutting emissions immediately by using this sustainable fuel in place of conventional jet fuel – making the transition to cleaner flight faster, cheaper and more scalable.

And the impact is significant. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF from LanzaJet can deliver around 80% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle.

To make this tangible, using LanzaJet SAF on a single long-haul flight can save roughly 80 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the annual energy use of 10 average US households. Scaled to an industry level, those savings turn into gigaton-level impacts, comparable to the emissions of entire economies.

This is no longer just about compliance. It’s about opportunity creation. A future where flying supports, rather than undermines, climate and community resilience.

The process from waste to fuel

The way we produce and use energy is being rewritten. LanzaJet’s approach epitomises the circular economy in action, converting low-value and waste-derived feedstocks such as agricultural and woody residues, municipal solid waste and regenerative crops, into high-value sustainable aviation fuel.

Instead of pulling carbon from underground, we recycle the carbon already in circulation. Each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel displaces a gallon of fossil-derived jet fuel, reducing the need for new crude extraction.

Our technology, originally pioneered at the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, was designed to operate at commercial scale, bridging lab innovation and real-world deployment. The process demonstrates that sustainability and profitability can coexist, when we value circularity and resource efficiency. In every geography, this enables the creation of futureproofed, local value chains and shared benefit.

The ecological, biodiversity and social impact of sustainable aviation fuel

Ecological impact:

Each tonne of sustainable aviation fuel used prevents around 3 tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere. Consequently, replacing 10% of total aviation fuel demand with SAF could help avoid emissions equivalent to the annual output of 25 million cars.

Biodiversity:

By prioritising regenerative, waste or residue-based feedstocks, we minimise new land use, prevent deforestation and biodiversity loss. This helps to ensure that every gallon of fuel is traceable, sustainable and capable of delivering measurable co-benefits beyond carbon savings, to the likes of soil health, water and air quality and biodiversity.

Social and economic inclusion:

The transition to sustainable aviation fuel is not just about reducing emissions, it’s also about building a wellbeing economy. One that creates green jobs, revitalises rural communities and fosters equitable growth.

At our Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial Ethanol-to-Jet plant, we’ve created hundreds of new direct and indirect jobs. The site also serves as a living laboratory, documenting process data, operational learnings and workforce development strategies that will accelerate replication worldwide.

Scaling to meet aviation’s 2050 net zero goal

Freedom Pines is just the beginning. LanzaJet’s global pipeline spans partnerships across the world, with pre-2030 developments underway across the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Australia and Kazakhstan.

By 2030, we aim to enable more than 1 billion gallons of SAF production capacity annually, a critical milestone toward aviation’s 2050 net-zero target. Each new facility will integrate the learnings from Freedom Pines, driving down costs, improving efficiency and shortening the time from concept to commercial operation.

Looking further ahead, the opportunity is profound. Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just a fuel, it’s a bridge that connects economic growth with environmental stewardship. In transforming waste into flight, we’re proving that climate action has become a business advantage, in addition to a moral imperative.

The climate crisis demands courage, creativity and collective action.

It asks us to look beyond incremental change and toward transformation; to see decarbonisation not as a constraint, but as the Opportunity of a Lifetime.

At LanzaJet, we’re answering that call. Pioneering a future where aviation uplifts not just people in the air, but the planet we share below.

2025 is a critical year for the Paris Agreement. Ten years on, we need to rethink how we frame the challenge. And seeing challenges differently is what business and we are all about.

ICC is committed to securing what businesses need at the upcoming climate negotiations, COP30, in Belém, Brazil. Learn more about our Opportunity of a Lifetime climate campaign and how to get involved.

Complete Interview with Mr. Jimmy Samartzis

Q: Please provide an overview of your professional journey and leadership experience in sustainable fuels, and how these experiences have influenced your vision and approach as CEO of LanzaJet in pioneering next-generation aviation fuel solutions.

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: I often reflect upon the idea that the evolution of sustainable aviation fuel has mirrored my own professional journey. My career started in government and policy with a front row seat at the highest levels of the US government, including at The White House, witnessing the complexities of international affairs. My early career was spent in strategy consulting, helping organizations undergo complex transformations in the oil and gas, aviation, and national security industries. When I joined United Airlines, I had the opportunity to apply this background of working across the public and private sectors to a global stage, leading efforts that combined business strategy, sustainability, corporate responsibility, and innovation across one of the world’s largest and most operationally complex companies.

As an executive at United, I often took on the role of an intrapreneur, advancing innovation across the airline and the industry. I experienced the challenges and the promise of sustainable aviation fuel first-hand. In the first decade of the 21st century, when most people thought alternative fuels were just a dream, I was fortunate to help lead early initiatives that proved SAF could work technically, commercially, and operationally. That experience fundamentally shaped my perspective. I learned that advancing this sector requires technology that would reshape an 80-year-old fossil jet fuel industry, alongside persistence, partnerships, new supply chains, and global alignment.

In turn, I had the unique opportunity to join LanzaJet as its Founding CEO, shaping the company from the ground up, spanning our business strategy, culture and relationships, complementing the technology development previously conducted. LanzaJet allowed me to bring my full skillset built over two decades from government policy and business strategy to technology development and operations. I was able to carry forward the momentum that started from my time at United, into an opportunity allowing me to seek out global impact and scale.

I carry forward the lessons of those early days: collaboration and alignment across our global industry is key; sustainability must be a shared responsibility and anchored in financial viability; and impact only matters when it’s measurable, equitable, and lasting.

Q: Could you outline LanzaJet’s current strategic priorities, particularly in the context of your collaboration with KazMunayGas (KMG) to develop Kazakhstan’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility? How important are such international partnerships in driving regional and global SAF adoption?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: Our focus is on using ethanol as a feedstock and deploying our proprietary and industry leading technology to transform ethanol into a drop-in renewable transportation fuel – both SAF and renewable diesel. Ethanol is a terrific building block molecule that allows us to using existing supply, enable it to be created from many waste sources and energy crops, and pivot it from a declining need in road transportation due to electrification to aviation as a promising, long-term market. This work allows us to build rural economies, support energy security needs, achieve decarbonization goals, and in some countries, further national security objectives.

Our partnership with KazMunayGas (KMG) is a milestone not just for Kazakhstan, but for the global SAF industry. Together, we’re developing the country’s and the Central Asia region’s first SAF facility, leveraging our LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology and KMG’s regional strength to create a model of local innovation serving global goals.

This partnership embodies our broader strategy to scale SAF production, build regional capacity and the local economy, and foster meaningful international collaboration. The future of sustainable fuels depends on this kind of cross-border partnership, where technology, resources, and ambition intersect.

Kazakhstan has the opportunity to lead Central Asia in clean energy innovation. By combining KMG’s energy expertise with LanzaJet’s proven SAF platform and industry-building expertise, we’re not just engineering a biorefinery, we’re building a foundation for regional energy security, agricultural development, industrial diversification, and long-term climate impact.

Q: How is the global demand for sustainable aviation fuel evolving, and how does LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology address these market dynamics while reducing carbon emissions?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: The demand for sustainable aviation fuel has moved from aspiration to urgency. Airlines, cargo operators, private aviation, and even corporate travel programs are setting aggressive SAF targets. Yet, supply still trails far behind. To put it in perspective, the aviation industry has set goals to achieve net zero by 2050 and with today’s jet fuel demand of more than 100 billion gallons, SAF production available today only accounts for less than 0.5%. The industry has a long way to go to achieve interim targets of 5%, 10%, and ultimately net zero, particularly with continued expansion and growth of the aviation industry.

This is exactly why LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology is essential. It converts ethanol, which is already produced on a massive global scale, into drop-in jet fuel that can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Because ethanol can come from a variety of sources, from waste-based and cellulosic materials to low-carbon feedstocks and energy crops, ATJ offers unparalleled flexibility that is relevant to every continent in the world.

This adaptability allows us to build projects where feedstock, infrastructure and demand already exist, helping accelerate SAF availability worldwide. In essence, ATJ bridges the gap between today’s ethanol economy and tomorrow’s sustainable aviation industry.

Q: Beyond airlines, sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and energy security are key enablers for SAF. How does LanzaJet integrate these cross-sector linkages into its project design and long-term strategy to maximize impact?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: One of the most important lessons I’ve learned over the years is that sustainability doesn’t happen in silos. Aviation’s decarbonization depends on agriculture, logistics and energy systems evolving together, in tandem with the worlds of finance and policy.

At LanzaJet, we design every project as part of a wider ecosystem. We work with farmers to develop sustainable biomass and waste-based feedstocks, creating new value streams in rural economies. We partner with logistics providers to integrate existing infrastructure for ethanol and jet fuel transport, minimizing new emissions. And we collaborate with governments and energy companies to strengthen local energy independence through SAF production.

This systems-level approach ensures our projects do more than reduce emissions; they build resilience, prosperity, and inclusion. Our work with KMG reflects that. It’s as much about national strategy and regional cooperation as it is about aviation fuel.

Q: What are the most critical operational, financial, or innovation-related challenges currently facing LanzaJet as it scales SAF production globally, and how are you navigating them?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: Scaling a new global energy sector is never simple. The challenges and risk span technology, financing, feedstock availability, policy frameworks, and many others. But the most pressing challenge right now is speed; meeting rapidly growing demand while ensuring projects remain both economically and environmentally sustainable.

We’re addressing that by focusing on replicable project models that reduce design and engineering time, strengthening partnerships that balance risk and investing in R&D to improve yield and lower production costs.

Our LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale ATJ plant, is a proof point. It demonstrates our technology, but that it can deliver scale and real carbon reductions. Every project we build now benefits from that experience and the de-risking we have invested in for our customers and partners, allowing us to move faster and smarter.

Q: Looking ahead, what major milestones does LanzaJet aim to achieve over the next year, particularly in terms of project deployment, technology advancement?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: The year ahead will be transformational for LanzaJet. We’ll continue learning from our Georgia facility and its operations, progress the KMG collaboration into early engineering and project development, and advance projects already underway in the UK and emerging markets like Australia, India and Japan.

Equally important is deepening our partnerships with airlines, investors, and governments, in order to create the enabling conditions for SAF to thrive. On the technology side, we’re pushing forward on process enhancements, innovations, and expanding our feedstock platform, to further improve carbon intensity and cost.

Each of these milestones moves us closer to a world where SAF isn’t the exception, but the norm.

Q: Innovation is not just about technology but also about leadership and culture. How do you foster a culture of innovation at LanzaJet, and what guiding principles help you lead the company in such a transformative sector?

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: For me, innovation starts with people, not products. It’s about creating an environment where ideas can surface freely, where experimentation is encouraged, where diverse talents of people come together, and where failure is treated as learning.

At LanzaJet, we anchor our culture around a shared mission, accelerating the clean energy transition for aviation so that future generations can continue to fly and thrive through the benefits that travel brings to our economy and society. That mission gives our teams a sense of purpose and unity, even in the face of uncertainty. We emphasize transparency, collaboration, and accountability, values that not only define how we work but also how we lead.

Leading a company requires flexibility, especially given an ever-evolving geopolitical landscape, changing business strategies in both aviation and the oil and gas industries, as well as the uncertainty of capital. We work to shape these industries and global outcomes, but they are complex. We build capability and muscle to navigate uncertainty and risk, and I often spend time helping my team understand these complexities and work to succeed through them.

As CEO, my role is to keep our mission alive, to remind everyone why their work matters, and how we’re succeeding in unchartered waters. When people feel connected to purpose, innovation and execution excellence follows naturally!

Q: Please share your insights on emerging trends and opportunities shaping the future of sustainable fuels—from SAF and hydrogen integration to synthetic fuels—and where you see LanzaJet’s most exciting growth opportunities over the next decade.

Mr. Jimmy Samartzis: The next decade will redefine the energy and aviation landscape. We’re seeing rapid progress in hydrogen, e-fuels, and carbon capture, and I believe the future will be one of convergence, where these technologies complement rather than compete.

For LanzaJet, that could mean expanding beyond bio-based SAF production. To that effect, our ATJ technology platform can integrate with renewable power, captured carbon and green hydrogen, in order to create a Power-to-Liquid SAF from e-Ethanol, capable of delivering even lower emissions.

Overall, what excites me most is that the world is no longer asking if SAF can scale, but rather how fast this can take place. We know there is a $1 Trillion total addressable market, underpinned by aviation’s need for up to 400-500 million metric Tonnes of SAF by 2050, in order to meet its Net Zero 2050 target. LanzaJet’s role is to help make that scale real, and we’re doing all the right things to help our company and industry both succeed!

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased by 391M gallons (1.48bn litres)/year in 2024, less than one-third of the growth in 2022 and 2023.

In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to produce exclusively biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield, the report said.

Following its completed conversion, the Rodeo plant had a capacity of 767M gallons (2.9bn litres)/year, up from 180M gallons (681M litres)/year in the EIA’s report last year.

The increase made it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the USA, after Diamond Green Diesel’s 982M gallons (3.7bn litres)/year plant in Norco, Louisiana.

US capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138M gallons (522M litres)/year Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities, according to the report.

Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively, while Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

“The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020,” the EIA said.

Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements.

“At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.”

A notable shift in 2024 was an increased focus on SAF, the report said.

Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant could switch around 150M gallons (568M litres)/year of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel could switch about 235M gallons (890M litres)/year to SAF.

Africa has the resources to fuel a greener future. Furkan Özdemir, Aviation Lecturer at Atilim University, explores how local innovation and smart policy could help the continent turn waste into sustainable aviation fuel.

One thing is becoming increasingly evident when discussing the future of aviation: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is no longer an option; it is a necessity. Airlines worldwide are under increasing pressure to reduce their carbon emissions. SAF has become a viable option for reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. The story gets more complicated when it comes to Africa, though.

Is it realistic for a continent with little money, poor infrastructure and big economic differences to take part in this green revolution? The answer is complicated, but hopeful.

The cost conundrum

Let’s start with the numbers. Making SAF is still expensive. Biofuel-based SAF costs about €1,461 per tonne in Europe, while e-fuels can cost up to €7,695 per tonne, which is three to five times more than regular jet fuel. Things are even more complex in Africa. Prices increase further due to higher financing costs, as well as taxes, logistics and import costs. Waste-based SAF can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and synthetic fuels produced through carbon capture technologies can cost six to ten times as much.

The cost barrier isn’t just a money problem; it’s also a strategic one. African airlines that fly to other countries must follow rules that are becoming increasingly stringent regarding the reduction of carbon emissions. If you don’t do this, you may not be able to access profitable international routes and partnerships. This is not a threat that is far away; it is happening right now. Airlines that fail to prioritise SAF could fall behind as the world transitions to more environmentally friendly flying.

The untapped potential of Africa

The good news is that Africa is not without chances. Several countries are well-positioned to produce SAF by utilising local feedstocks and other agricultural resources they already possess.

South Africa could produce between 3.2 and 4.5 billion litres of biofuels annually from leftover sugarcane and biomass from invasive plants. This potential could turn South Africa into a regional SAF hub, serving both the domestic and international aviation markets.

Kenya aims to increase its SAF blend to 10% by 2030, positioning it as a leader in sustainable aviation in East Africa. Ethiopia and Nigeria are exploring pilot projects that utilise local feedstocks to incorporate SAF into their national aviation plans.

Africa has an advantage because it has a significant amount of biomass and can produce SAF with minimal adverse environmental impacts. Unlike regions that rely heavily on energy-intensive synthetic fuels, Africa can produce SAF from materials that are already available, often considered waste, thereby reducing both carbon emissions and production costs.

The function of policy and funding

Potential by itself is not enough. SAF projects require funding – and borrowing money in Africa costs approximately 30% more than it does in other parts of the world. This makes SAF less appealing to investors from a financial perspective. Private sector initiatives may fail to grow if there are no policies in place to support them.

SAF projects require funding – and borrowing money in Africa costs approximately 30% more than it does in other parts of the world.

This is where carbon markets and public private partnerships (PPPs) play a crucial role. Carbon credits from using SAF can help offset production costs, making it more appealing for both investors and airlines to get involved. There are also international climate finance programmes, such as the Green Climate Fund or the World Bank’s sustainability initiatives, that can help you secure funding.

Policymakers can also utilise tax breaks, subsidies and blending mandates to encourage people to produce and utilise SAF. Governments show that SAF is a priority by making clear rules for both domestic and international stakeholders. This is more than just an environmental policy; it’s an economic strategy. Countries that act quickly can become SAF leaders in their region.

Suggestions for strategy

What should Africa do next? The plan needs to be phased, thought out and realistic:

Start small: Begin with pilot projects using low percentage SAF blends to assess their effectiveness and refine the production process.

Utilise local feedstocks: Utilise inexpensive, abundant materials such as agricultural waste, sugarcane byproducts, and invasive plant species.

Invest in infrastructure: Build refineries, storage facilities and distribution networks that can effectively handle SAF.

Engage carbon markets: Utilise carbon credits to generate revenue from reducing emissions and make SAF more competitive.

Encourage international co-operation: Collaborate with airlines, investors and technical experts to exchange information and secure funding.

Following these steps will help Africa slowly adopt SAF, making it a scalable and profitable option.

Why Africa needs to act now

Time is running out. The aviation industry is working hard to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Airlines that don’t use SAF could lose access to international routes, partnerships and revenue streams.

For Africa, acting early has many advantages:

Environmental leadership: By reducing carbon emissions, Africa is taking an active role in global efforts to protect the environment.

Economic opportunity: Building SAF infrastructure can create jobs, boost local economies, and set up a supply chain in the area.

Strategic advantage: Countries that start producing SAF can sell it to international airlines, which will generate revenue and establish them as key partners in green aviation.

Africa’s unique strengths, including its large biomass reserves, relatively untapped resources, and growing aviation market, mean that the continent could set a new standard for sustainable aviation.

Conclusion

For Africa, sustainable aviation fuel presents both opportunities and challenges. It’s challenging to obtain money, and the cost of production is high. Africa can turn these problems into competitive advantages however, with careful planning, effective policies, and collaboration with other countries.

African countries can not only make their skies greener, but they can also become leaders in the global SAF market by starting small, utilising local resources, and incorporating carbon markets into the mix. It won’t be easy to get there. It will take money, vision and determination. But for Africa, the sky isn’t the limit; it’s the opportunity.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2412643141.png,N,,2025-11-05 03:16:38.692817

Called QRITOS, the initiative was revealed on 4 November as one of the three initial projects funded by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) through its Non-CO2 programme.

Unveiling the projects’ selection at its annual conference in Newport, South Wales, ATI chief executive Gary Elliott says they will “reduce uncertainty in the fundamental science and deliver technology solutions to which will mitiagte or prevent non-CO2 emissions during flight.”

While the carbon-reduction benefits of SAF are well documented, studies have also shown the fuel’s potential to reduce the formation of contrails, which also have a strong impact on global warming.

QRITOS, also involving Imperial College London and Heathrow Airport, will attempt to demonstrate that the targeted deployment of SAF – only on those flights where there is a high likelihood that contrails will be produced – is a better use of what remains a scarce resource.

It will, says Alan Newby, director of research and technology at Rolls-Royce, help airlines to “maximise the bang for their buck” from SAF-powered operations.

“In theory it is quite simple, but first you need to work out which flights and then how to allocate your fuel,” he tells FlightGlobal.

Carrie Harris, BA director of sustainability, says the current plan calls for two weeks of test flights during the first quarter of 2026, with learnings from that phase supporting a second two-week campaign at the back end of the year.

BA already knows the routes that are most prone to contrail formation, says Harris, although declines to reveal detail at this stage.

“CO2 is well understood and there is an effective path across the whole sector to tackle it, but that is not the case for non-CO2 and options to mitigate it are still being debated,” she says.

“By using SAF there is an opportunity to get a double-whammy win out of it – we are trying to verify that theory.”

Both short- and long-haul flights be studied, with the work not reliant on an aircraft involved being equipped with Rolls-Royce engines. Initial logistical set-up work is already underway, she says.

Data from the flight trials will be combined with advanced modelling and satellite observations from Imperial College to monitor contrail formation following the targeted SAF usage.

Imperial College is hopeful the tests will allow it to develop predictive tools and a means of performing near real-time assessment “of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction,” says Sebastian Eastham, associate Professor in Sustainable Aviation at Imperial College.

QRITOS will run until April 2027, and includes the initial set-up, testing and analysis. Air bp will provide SAF technical expertise to the project team.

Glocal Green has already signed an MOU with Real Carbon Tech for future production of green methanol.","If CapCO2 Solutions’ approach to green methanol production from waste CO2 works at its first ethanol plant—in Luverne, Minnesota—the technology could become a lighthouse for the industry, according to Jeff Bonar, CEO of the green methanol developer.

The 18 MMgy facility started as an ethanol plant, pivoted to other biobased products under the ownership and direction of Gevo Inc., was purchased by AgriEnergy Innovation in May and will now house the CapCO2 Solutions technology. The plant has been idle since 2022.

Central to CapCO2’s modularized green methanol conversion process will be Bosch’s water-based electrolyzer that produces hydrogen for combination with CO2 to produce green methanol. Bosch says technologies like this will help the world ramp up hydrogen use and potentially generate revenues in the billions by 2030.

Proven Starting Point

CapCO2 and AgriEnergy, led by longtime industry veteran David Kolsrud, will partner with Methylennium Energy, which will provide a methanol synthesis approach it has developed to integrate with renewable power and water electrolysis. To ensure the project remains achievable, CapCO2 has added an experienced ethanol engineer who spent years with the industry’s top builder. Doug Edwards, now vice president of engineering and construction at CapCO2, will provide oversight of engineering, procurement and construction in Luverne.

“I was involved in the design of 20-plus ethanol plants,” Edwards says. “I’m a nuts-and-bolts guy. I’m a project manager and work to get projects built.”

Maxim Lyubovsky, president and CEO of Methylennium Energy, has been a chemical engineer in the fuel reforming and hydrogen industries for more than 25 years and has worked with fuel cells and skid-mounted methanol projects in the oil and gas sector. The patented technology Lyubovsky’s team will deploy in Luverne has been in use for more than 15 years.

The Luverne project is in a detailed design phase with plans for operation in 2027.

In August, all of the parties involved in the project gathered in Minnesota at the AgriEnergy plant to launch their work. It was the first time the chemical engineers, plant management team and other stakeholders from the multi-party group were able to meet in person. Nearly 100 people attended the introduction event, including mayors and Midwestern ag leaders. Kolsrud provided context on the Luverne plant’s latest transformation, telling those in attendance that the facility was a leader 30 years ago when it launched and will soon be a leading innovator in the next-generation biofuels space again. His vision is to use the plant as a launching point for innovative technologies, he said.

AgriEnergy Innovation acquired the plant for $7 million from Gevo. Gevo retained certain isobutanol production-related assets and a portion of some vacant land near the plant. At the time of the transaction, Kolsrud described the Luverne site as being well suited for the practical scale-up of new technologies.

“We were looking for a site that was smart, quick and easy to build,” Bonar says of Luverne.

Technology Detailed

Although the system in Luverne will not be the largest or most advanced green methanol facility, it will allow the industry a chance to “kick the tires,” Bonar says.

The modularized setup can potentially use wind or solar to power electrolysis to create hydrogen. The hydrogen is then combined with waste CO2 in methanol synthesis to produce green methanol that can be used as a feedstock for several products, including sustainable aviation fuel or maritime applications.

The Bosch electrolyzer uses ultrapure water flows around a proton exchange membrane, according to the company. The membrane is located between an anode and a cathode. Electric voltage is applied and the anode produces oxygen, free ions and hydrogen. Then, the ions all pass through the membrane, combine with electrodes from the cathode and form pure hydrogen gas. The hydrogen can be stored, used in fuel cells or converted through other processes, such as the CapCO2 process.

As the national grid continues to face power supply issues, areas across the U.S. will continue to see power shortages, blackouts and rising power costs. The Luverne system, designed to run independent of the grid when necessary, will be able to remain flexible during intermittent power and pull its heaviest load during off-peak hours and when other electrical users in the area are operating at lower capacity.

“In past lives, I’ve had the chance to look at other technologies from other providers,” Edwards says. “A lot of technology people show up with big hopes and dreams. Too often they shoot for the moon. In Luverne, we’ll be smart and practical and up and running as soon as possible.”

Bonar says their work will help create a blueprint for a system that can be expanded in multiple ways. The Luverne location could also help CapCO2 show how its system works in conjunction with wind power, which is abundant in the region.

“There is a lot of wind there and a lot of the turbines get turned off at night,” Bonar says. “They call that curtailed electricity and we’ll happily buy that from them.”

The team hopes to source as much renewable electricity to power the electrolysis stack as possible. Projected numbers provided by CapCO2 indicate the system can reduce an ethanol plant’s carbon intensity score by 25 points.

To date, there have been no issues with equipment sourcing for the project. Everything is commercially available in the U.S. And, because the CO2 stream produced in ethanol is so pure, added scrubbing and clean-up technology is not required, Lyubovsky says.

Field, Fleet, Flight

Sally Hart, vice president of communications and outreach for CapCO2, says the team is already looking at additional projects while work is underway at the Luverne plant. There is interest in green methanol, she says, due to large-scale end-users in air and sea. In addition to its potential as a feedstock for SAF production, large maritime shippers remain committed to finding a green hydrogen or methanol solution to power their global fleets, according to Hart and Lyubovsky.

In Luverne, CapCO2 will pay for the equipment, install it on the plant site and then create a revenue-sharing model with the ethanol plant. CapCO2 will also place personnel on-site if necessary.

“We are open to different frameworks as well,” Bonar says.

The CapCO2 Solutions team is currently raising funds for additional plants and has talked with investment groups in the agriculture sector.

“There is real opportunity here,” Edwards says. “Is the heyday of ethanol going to happen again? I hope so, especially with a lot of the lessons learned about how you make a smart design. Our job is to come up with a design that can be duplicated.”

Edwards believes the designs will remain modularized, space-efficient and utilize a construction process that includes several portions of the design system built off-site.

Once built, the green methanol operation will be CapCO2’s first in the Midwest. Adkins Energy out of Lena, Illinois, is also working on a green methanol production process that utilizes waste CO2 from its ethanol and biodiesel production facility. Adkins is working with Norwegian-based company Real Carbon Tech on a demonstration project expected to produce 800 to 1,000 tons per year. The pilot plant could morph into a commercial producer of 123,000 tons per year of green methanol, along with renewable dimethyl ether (DME). The renewable DME is of interest to Glocal Green AS, a supplier of green methanol to maritime and industrial clients in Norway and Europe. Glocal Green has already signed an MOU with Real Carbon Tech for future production of green methanol.

Red River Energy near Rosholt, South Dakota, has been in talks with CarbonSink to develop a different version of the green methanol production process using the ethanol plant’s fermentation CO2. The last update on that project was released in 2023.

“CO2 is incredibly valuable,” Bonar says. “CO2 is not something that should be thrown away.”

The EPA on Oct. 29 published a new notice in the Federal Register announcing it will re-open the comment period for an additional 30 days, through the end of Nov. 28. Information posted the Regulations.gov website indicates no public comments were filed during the initial 60-day comment period.

A biointermediate is produced from a renewable biomass feedstock at a biointermediate production facility and is not itself a renewable fuel. Rather, the biointermediate is processed into renewable fuel at a subsequent renewable fuel production facility. Provisions governing the treatment of biointermediates under the RFS were finalized as part of the EPA’s rule to set 2010, 2021 and 2022 RFS renewable volume obligations.

That rule, published in July 2022, included includes specific provisions for the use of biocrude, free fatty acid (FFA) feedstock, and undenatured ethanol used as biointermediates. It also addressed the use of biomass-based sugars, digestate, glycerin and other biointermediate feedstocks.

In the April 28 notice, the EPA indicated it originally anticipated that as many as 60 parties would register as biointermediate producers under the RFS. However, far fewer than 10 biointermediate producers had done so, according to the agency. Similarly, the EPA anticipated that as many as 90 parties would register as renewable identification number (RIN) generators related to biointermediates. As of April 28, fewer than 10 parties had completed that registration.

A full copy of the Oct. 29 notice is available on the Federal Register website.

What the Study Found Without any carbon payments, farmers largely avoided growing risky crops like miscanthus, even though it offers the greatest carbon mitigation potential.
Under no carbon payment, adoption was sparse, with production limited to areas where biomass prices or yields were naturally higher.
Under annual payments, corn stover and switchgrass dominated much of the Midwest, indicating farmers favored safer feedstocks when given stable incentives.
Under upfront payments, miscanthus adoption increased notably, especially in regions where long-term profitability outweighed early cost barriers.","A new study from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has taken a deep dive into how different types of carbon payment policies can influence American farmers’ willingness to grow crops for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The research, published in Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy (2025), explores how payment timing, risk aversion, and regional factors could determine whether SAF can truly take off as a large-scale, low-carbon energy solution.

Why Aviation Needs a Biofuel Boost

The aviation sector is one of the toughest to decarbonize. Planes can’t simply plug into batteries the way electric cars do. Instead, the industry is banking on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, made from biological sources such as corn stover, switchgrass, and miscanthus.

SAF has the potential to cut carbon emissions by as much as 70% compared to fossil jet fuel. However, scaling up production is not as easy as planting a few new crops. Many of the plants suitable for bioenergy—like miscanthus, a tall, high-yielding grass—come with high upfront costs and uncertain returns. Farmers, who already juggle risks from weather and markets, may not see these crops as a safe bet.

This is where the new Illinois study steps in: by asking what kind of financial incentives can actually persuade risk-averse, credit-constrained, or present-biased farmers to make the leap into bioenergy production.

What the Researchers Did

The study was conducted by Fahd Majeed, Manoj Khanna, and Ruichuan Miao at the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI). Their team created a spatially detailed economic model that simulates how different types of farmers across the U.S. rainfed region might respond to SAF incentives.

The model included county-level variations in both crop yield and price risk, allowing the researchers to capture real-world conditions rather than assume uniform productivity across regions. They compared three main bioenergy feedstocks:

Corn stover (the leftover stalks and leaves from corn harvests)

Switchgrass (a hardy perennial that grows on marginal land)

Miscanthus (a high-yield but riskier perennial)

Farmers were divided into categories based on their behavioral tendencies: those who are risk-averse, credit-constrained, or present-biased (preferring immediate rewards over future gains).

The researchers then modeled three carbon payment scenarios to see how farmers would respond:

No carbon payment (baseline)

Annual carbon payments (smaller, ongoing payments each year)

Upfront carbon payments (a lump sum at the start)

The analysis also examined how these payment designs interact with biomass prices, using a baseline of $60 per metric ton—roughly equivalent to $1.25 per liter of SAF.

What the Study Found

Without any carbon payments, farmers largely avoided growing risky crops like miscanthus, even though it offers the greatest carbon mitigation potential. Instead, they leaned toward safer, lower-yield options like switchgrass and corn stover.

The results showed that risk-averse farmers tend to prioritize stability over potential profit. This means that even if miscanthus could earn them more in the long run, its upfront cost and uncertain yield made it unattractive.

When annual carbon payments were introduced, farmers became more willing to produce feedstocks like corn stover and switchgrass, resulting in a higher total SAF output. These yearly payments helped offset risk because they provided a predictable, recurring income stream.

However, when the incentive was shifted to upfront payments, the dynamic changed. Lump-sum payments encouraged more farmers to take on the risk of planting miscanthus, the crop that produces lower-carbon-intensity fuel but requires higher initial investment.

In other words:

Annual payments = more overall SAF volume from low-risk crops

Upfront payments = less total volume, but greater carbon reduction per liter of fuel

This tradeoff suggests that the design of carbon payments can be fine-tuned depending on what policymakers value more—quantity (more fuel) or quality (greater carbon savings).

How Location Shapes the Results

Because the model considered regional differences, the researchers could map out county-level adoption patterns for each feedstock under different payment schemes.

Under no carbon payment, adoption was sparse, with production limited to areas where biomass prices or yields were naturally higher.

Under annual payments, corn stover and switchgrass dominated much of the Midwest, indicating farmers favored safer feedstocks when given stable incentives.

Under upfront payments, miscanthus adoption increased notably, especially in regions where long-term profitability outweighed early cost barriers.

This spatial analysis helps policymakers visualize where different payment strategies would be most effective—crucial for regional planning and biofuel supply chain development.

Implications for Policy and Industry

The study’s key takeaway is that one-size-fits-all incentives won’t work. Farmers aren’t identical, and their responses to incentives depend heavily on risk tolerance, access to credit, and how much they value immediate versus delayed returns.

If governments or industries want to boost SAF feedstock production, they need to match payment design to farmer behavior:

Annual payments may suit risk-averse or credit-limited farmers who need consistent income.

Upfront payments could attract those willing to invest in higher-risk, higher-reward crops like miscanthus.

The research also highlights that simply increasing biomass prices isn’t enough. Without addressing risk and financing barriers, many farmers will continue to avoid high-potential energy crops.

These findings can help shape smarter carbon payment programs under federal or state climate initiatives, potentially guiding the U.S. toward cost-effective and scalable SAF production.

Why This Matters Beyond Farming

SAF is one of the most promising tools for decarbonizing aviation, a sector responsible for about 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions. While electric planes and hydrogen-powered aircraft are still in development, bio-based fuels can be used in existing engines today.

However, feedstock availability remains the biggest constraint. Producing enough SAF to meet aviation demand would require millions of hectares of dedicated crops—something that can’t happen unless farmers are properly incentivized.

By understanding how risk, behavior, and payment structure affect adoption, this study gives policymakers the data they need to design realistic, farmer-friendly climate programs that make bioenergy both profitable and sustainable.

A Broader Look at Bioenergy Crops

To appreciate the study’s importance, it helps to know a bit more about the three feedstocks analyzed:

Corn stover is already widely available as a byproduct of corn harvests. It’s low-risk but limited in quantity. Removing too much stover can also reduce soil health, so sustainability practices matter.

Switchgrass is a perennial that grows well on marginal land. It doesn’t need intensive fertilizers and provides habitat for wildlife, making it a strong candidate for eco-friendly biofuel production.

Miscanthus, though expensive to establish, can yield two to three times more biomass per hectare than switchgrass and sequesters more carbon in its roots and soil. Its main challenge is that it takes several years to reach full productivity, which tests farmers’ patience and financial endurance.

Each crop has tradeoffs, and the study demonstrates how incentive design can help balance those tradeoffs to meet both economic and environmental goals.

Limitations and Future Outlook

Like any model, this one simplifies reality. It assumes that farmers behave consistently within certain risk categories and that markets for biomass and SAF remain stable. It also doesn’t directly tackle logistics, land-use competition, or conversion technology costs, which are crucial in the real world.

Still, the research provides a valuable foundation for designing targeted, efficient incentives that recognize how farmers actually think and operate. The authors note that future studies could expand to include irrigated regions, regional cooperatives, or even international applications.

As countries ramp up their commitments to net-zero aviation, understanding the human side of bioenergy adoption will be just as important as perfecting the technology itself.",https://edutalktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-smiling-farmer-in-plaid-flannel-enjoys-a-sunny-day-on-a-lush-green-hillside.-1482101-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 22:56:08.922922

It just needs rules and regulations.” From Field to Flight Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights.
Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.
“That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels.","Ethanol’s next chapter could power the planes of tomorrow — but only if carbon-smart farming and flexible policy take off together.

Corn may soon fuel more than cars. With airlines under pressure to decarbonize, ethanol is emerging as a promising source for sustainable aviation fuel. The technology is ready, the chemistry is proven, and the market potential is massive — but policy and timing could determine whether American farmers lead or get left behind.

The Inflation Reduction Act created the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit to reward fuels with low carbon intensity (CI) scores. The lower the score, the greater the credit. That simple equation could spark a new carbon race across agriculture, with every decision — from seed selection to nitrogen efficiency — influencing a farmer’s bottom line.

Kansas Corn’s director of policy and economics Taylor Williamson recently spoke on the topic at the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) Forage, Turf and Conservation Seed Conference in Kansas City. He explains that race is already underway, but the rules are still unclear. He says the government’s delay in finalizing the 45Z regulations is putting growers at a disadvantage.

“If Treasury doesn’t get these rules out soon, it’ll be too late for the 2026 crop,” Williamson says. “Once the seed is in the ground, it’s too late to change your CI score.”

He believes the program could be a powerful tool to inject dollars into the ag economy if it’s rolled out in time for farmers to respond.

“This is one way to put cash into the ag economy during a time of really bad prices,” he says. “The program already exists. It just needs rules and regulations.”

From Field to Flight

Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights. Even a small percentage of global jet fuel made from ethanol would have ripple effects across the grain economy.

Williamson breaks it down simply. If SAF could become 1% of the world’s aviation fuel, and 1%of that came from ethanol-based SAF, that would use about 5.6 million bushels of corn — roughly 10% of Kansas’ annual production. Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.

“If an airport like Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport converted half its jet fuel to SAF made from ethanol, that’s 389 million bushels,” he says. “That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels. But when we talk about a scenario like DFW, we’re assuming a full 50% SAF made purely from ethanol.”

He says the potential for ethanol-to-jet-fuel production not only strengthens corn markets but creates a symbiotic relationship with the livestock industry. Ethanol’s byproduct remains feed grain, keeping value cycling through rural economies.

“There’s not enough used cooking oil in the world to fuel every plane,” Williamson says. “If we want real sustainable aviation fuel, ethanol has to be part of the solution.”

Flexibility Over Mandates

To qualify for the highest 45Z credits, farmers may need to meet specific carbon-reduction standards based on production practices. That could include adopting no-till, planting cover crops, or switching to enhanced nitrogen fertilizers. Williamson says the intent is good, but the approach risks being too rigid.

“Don’t tell us exactly how to do it,” he says. “Just give us a number, give us the data, and we’ll go do it.”

He says although Kansas is known as The Wheat State, its plentiful corn farmers know better than anyone that what works in one field may fail in another. Eastern Kansas often benefits from cover crops that improve soil health and water retention. Western Kansas, with half the rainfall, can’t often afford to sacrifice moisture to a cover crop stand.

“Cover crops work in some places and not in others — and that’s okay,” he says. “Not all farmers, especially in Kansas, farm the same way.”

Williamson argues that flexibility, not prescription, will determine whether the program succeeds.

“You can’t accomplish your goal unless farmers can make it work for their bottom line,” he says.

Seeds of a Low-Carbon Future

The carbon-intensity push is already influencing conversations far beyond ethanol. Seed developers are exploring hybrids with better nitrogen efficiency and improved residue management. Agronomy teams are looking at how microbial products, stabilizers, and data analytics can cut emissions. Ethanol plants are developing traceability systems to verify the carbon profile of each bushel they buy.

Williamson sees this as a defining moment for the seed value chain — a chance to link genetics, agronomy, and markets in a measurable way. He believes farmers are ready to adapt, as long as risk and reward are balanced.

“Farmers aren’t afraid to innovate,” he says. “They just need to know a government program won’t put them out of business if they take a chance.”

For now, he says everyone is waiting on Washington. The potential for ethanol to power the planes of tomorrow — and for farmers to get paid for lowering carbon — hinges on clarity that hasn’t yet landed.",https://www.seedworld.com/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_1614423625-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 16:01:10.079556

The North Yorkshire SAF production site is strategically positioned to enhance the region’s natural beauty and rich history. The Minor British investment in the site’s LanzaJetHub aims to source the SAF from second generation agricultural and timber waste bioethanol. The Alcohol-to-Jet technology developed by LanzaJet aims to SAF remarkably lower the emissions of CO2 to be SAF-equivalent and convert conventional fuel from jet apocalyptic primitive waters areas plated to SAF. British Airways are predicted to serve the fully British fleet in a positive way by avoiding over 230,000 tons of CO2 emissions a year.

A Step Towards Sustainable Aviation

The construction of the SAF hub marks a pivotal moment in the UK’s efforts to decarbonise the aviation industry. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, the facility will contribute to the UK government’s broader climate goals, aligning with its 2050 Net Zero target. With sustainable aviation fuels emerging as a key solution to curbing aviation’s environmental impact, Project Speedbird will not only help meet these climate objectives but will also drive the growth of green technology in the UK.

This platform is not merely about producing SAF at one location. It is about creating a scalable, capital-efficient model that can be replicated globally while generating multiple revenue streams: fuel sales, equity stakes in joint ventures, and licensing fees from partners around the world.

The Market Opportunity: Why SAF Matters Now

The global aviation industry faces an existential challenge. Aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, and unlike other transportation sectors, aviation cannot easily transition to battery-electric solutions. According to McKinsey and Company, SAF represents the most viable pathway to decarbonize the aviation industry for the foreseeable future.

Market Fundamentals:

- Current Market Size: The global SAF market is expected to reach $2.06 billion in 2025

- Projected Growth: By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 65%

- Production Gap: Current global SAF production is less than 0.3% of total jet fuel demand, highlighting massive room for growth

- Long-Term Vision: According to IATA, airlines will need 500 million tons (approximately 165 billion gallons) of SAF annually by 2050, encompassing both biomass and power-to-liquid sources, to achieve net zero carbon emissions. IATA reported that 2024 SAF production reached 1 million tons (approximately 330 million gallons) of SAF, requiring an approximately 27% annual growth rate to meet the 2050 target. Given the potential for even more countries to announce targets or for blending to occur even in countries without targets in place, this estimated growth requirement could be conservative

- Regulatory Tailwinds: More than 2 billion people live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives; this number is projected to exceed 4 billion by 2030

Key Regulatory Drivers:

- European Union: ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires 2% SAF by 2025, scaling to 70% by 2050

- United States: 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit provides up to $1.75 per gallon for qualifying SAF

- United Kingdom: SAF mandate requiring 10% by 2030

- Australia: Strong government support for SAF infrastructure development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund to realize net-zero targets

This regulatory framework creates not just demand, but guaranteed demand with attractive economics. Airlines face compliance requirements and corporate sustainability commitments that make SAF adoption inevitable rather than optional.

“Needless to say, I’m unaccustomed to being on a list with the Pope and the King of England, let alone Samuel Jackson,” Robinhood wrote in a LinkedIn post.

TIME highlights the PDX Next project, a $2 billion project aimed at renovating the Portland International Airport with a focus on sustainability, which saw its first phase completed last year. The second phase is anticipated to be completed early next year.

Robinhood cited the airport is continuing to increase the amount of sustainable aviation fuel for all planes, noting a signed joint decarbonization agreement with Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. airports.

“This shift not only supports our local and global climate goals but also encourages airlines to adopt greener practices,” he said in a statement.

With the PDX renovations, Robinhood said they are doubling the airport’s size while cutting its energy use in half by utilizing local, sustainably-sourced designs and upgrades.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/07/14d49132845851bf6b0ad4ac24e9be31.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:01:22.740265

""Sustainable aviation fuel, especially aviation in general, is expected to continue to grow over the next two decades.","By Michelle Pelletier Marshall, Women in Agribusiness Media (November 4, 2025)

This was the SAF Panel: Its official title was the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Panel, but we are going to take advantage of the ambiguity of an acronym and also label it the “Super Ag Females (SAF) Panel” based on the knowledgeable, talented, accomplished speakers featured in this key session at Women in Agribusiness Summit 2025 in Orlando.

SAF has been a buzzword for some time now and has quietly been making strides behind the scenes, especially in unexpected partnership among divergent companies such as was highlighted in this WIA session featuring Delta Air Lines, Gevo and Syngenta. The companies signed an agreement in 2022 where Gevo is to supply Delta with 75 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year for seven years. And where does Syngenta come in? They are involved in the production of feedstocks (like corn and other agricultural materials) used to produce the SAF that Gevo, a low carbon chemicals and fuels producer, supplies to Delta.

As an overall goal, this partnership is part of Delta's broader commitment to using SAF, aiming to incorporate at least 10 percent SAF in its operations by 2030. Delta needs to secure 400 million gallons of SAF annually by 2030 to reach its goal. For Gevo’s part, they have signed an agreement with Future Energy Global (FEG) where FEG will acquire carbon abatement credits from Gevo's alcohol-to-jet (ATJ-60) facility. This will help airlines and other companies reduce their CO2 emissions through SAF.

But before we get too technical and speak in acronym soup, here’s a bit more on SAF.

SAF represents a key solution in the aviation industry's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to more sustainable operations. It is quickly becoming an influential factor in agriculture and biofuels markets.

It is produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, municipal waste, or synthetic sources using green hydrogen and captured CO₂. It offers up to 80 percent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

The SAF landscape is evolving rapidly, driven by a mix of market demand, government policies and technological advancements, yet today represents only a small fraction of total aviation fuel consumption. According to a study by MarketsandMarkets, the global demand for SAF is going to see significant growth in the decades to come and could be a $7 billion market by 2030. By 2050, it expected to comprise 12 percent of the global aviation energy demand, with significant potential for more.

Liz Hunt, head, North American Sustainability, Syngenta, noted“Sustainable aviation fuel is the single largest lever that aviation has to decarbonize in what we call a ‘hard to decarbonize’ sector. And that need is ultimately going to continue to increase when you look at the fact that in the next 10, 20-plus years, you're going to continue to see an expansion in flying and the global emissions of aviation are going to continue to grow and will grow proportionately greater than those other sectors that have an easier pathway to decarbonize.”

Jacqui Fatka, moderator of the panel and lead economist for farm supply and biofuels at CoBank, added, “There’s a lot of excitement surrounding SAF, but we are still just a drop in the bucket for worldwide use. In 2023, we were at 0.17% worldwide use of SAF and last year we were at 0.3%.” Fatka noted that the EU implemented a 2% mandate this year for SAF use which is helping to push higher inclusion rates.

With farmers looking for alternatives for their renewable waste, SAF fits the bill. “I’m excited about everything that brings opportunity to rural America and SAF is one pathway that will continue to keep those communities alive,” added Hunt.

Key to this was the extension this summer of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which was included in the new U.S. administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This federal tax credit for producers of clean transportation fuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, incentivizes production, said Hunt.

Fatka cautioned, “The extension for 45Z actually decreased the SAF tax credit down to just a dollar tax credit and made it on par with 45Z that would qualify for on-road fuels.” She explained that a renewable diesel plant is the decision-maker about whether it wants to run SAF or renewable diesel based on the tax credit revenue potential.

Challenges for the SAF Market

Speakers on the panel addressed the challenges for SAF producers: having the capital to build the infrastructure, the facilities to produce it, access to adequate feedstock, and a way to get the product to the customer from a processor's perspective. “If you look at the total target for how much fuel we need to meet global reduction targets, carbon reduction targets, we need agricultural feedstocks to meet about a third to a half of that total demand. And when I say agricultural feedstocks, I'm really talking mostly about corn and soybeans. Yes, there'll be some sugarcane in the mix, and there'll be some vanilla and other things. But practically speaking, we're talking about a volume of feedstock that is needed to hit global demand,” said Hunt.

Erin Heitkamp, vice president of supply chain development for Gevo, provided further background on carbon reduction opportunities through a project they have managed under its USDA climate-smart agriculture grant. This project assists farmers with carbon monitoring through the adoption of a Gevo software system that tracks and traces all farm practices, providing an account for the carbon that is a part of each farmers’ value chain. Gevo also provided agronomic support and financial incentives to farmers in this program.

Heitkamp explained, “We found that we had 100% retention of the farmers who enrolled. When we measured the carbon value that they were generating, we would compensate them for that. In total, at the end of that program, we had about 430,000 acres enrolled. So we're not talking about a small-scale pilot, and on average, the farmers were making a little over $24 an acre, and that equated to about $56 per ton of carbon sequestration.” She noted that on average, the farmers saw a 9% yield increase, and so overall, it was a highly successful endeavor.

""Sustainable aviation fuel, especially aviation in general, is expected to continue to grow over the next two decades. It's the single largest lever that aviation has to decarbonize,” added Yvonne Domeier, sustainability consulting for Delta Air Lines.

Thanks to the in-depth knowledge of this speaker panel, WIA attendees left with a deeper understanding of the broadening SAF sector and the significant potential for it to reduce aviation emissions and revitalize rural economies through increased demand for agricultural feedstocks. Key to this was being cognizant of how challenges, such as high production costs and uncertain policy environments, require diligent collaborative efforts across industries and government organizations to realize SAF's economic and environmental benefits.

by Marianne Stein (ACES News/University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) ... Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

...

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

...

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said. READ MORE

The results were unveiled during the official visit of Vietnam’s General Secretary To Lam to the U.K.

The project, led by Professor Myles Allen, Director of Oxford Net Zero, focuses on Geological Balance Fuel—an innovative form of aviation fuel where carbon emissions are offset through the long-term geological storage of CO2.

Initial findings suggest that GBF could provide a practical pathway for the aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.

The key advantage of this breakthrough lies in its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with existing global fuel-supply systems, minimizing disruption and additional costs to current energy and fuel industries.

Beyond technological innovation, the project also promotes educational and human capital collaboration between Vietnam and the U.K., including the establishment of research fellowships and post-doctoral programs at Oxford Net Zero.

This initiative forms part of Vietjet’s “Fly Green” campaign—the airline’s long-term sustainability strategy for “a green future under a blue sky.”

Through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), carbon-offset mechanisms, reforestation programs, investments in renewable energy and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven operational efficiencies, Vietjet said it has successfully reduced average emissions per passenger by 38 percent compared with previous-generation aircraft.

“My warmest congratulations to Professor Allen,” said Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, chairwoman of Vietjet. “I deeply value this collaboration with the University of Oxford as we work together to advance green innovation—connecting knowledge, technology and compassion.

“This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”","Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK project to find smarter ways of using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The engineering giant, which has its civil aerospace division at Sinfin, Derby, has embarked on the project in an effort to increase the fuel’s effectiveness and role in reducing non-CO2 emissions.

Co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme, the Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS) project brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London and Heathrow.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey.

However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

Alan Newby, research and technology director at Rolls-Royce, said: “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions.

“This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements.

It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios.

However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate, which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

According to Roll-Royce, constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights.

This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails.

The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports.

It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

Concluding in April 2027, the two-year project will also enhance forecasting methods, advance understanding and modelling of contrail formation, and develop verification methods based on satellite data.

“It’s very disappointing that the U.S. was unable to use President Trump’s tariff leverage to push past Japan’s protectionism and finally open this valuable market,” council CEO Kam Quarles said.

In talks between USDA and Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries earlier in October, Japan did not provide a timeline for concluding the request, which dates back about 30 years.

“Despite this disappointment, we were pleased by U.S. chief agriculture negotiator nominee Julie Callahan’s comments (Oct. 29) before the Senate Finance Committee, where she acknowledged Japan’s delaying strategy is a non-tariff trade barrier,” Quarles said. “This has been stated by our industry for years, and we very much appreciate Dr. Callahan’s clear assessment and focused intent to open this market to benefit family farms across the U.S.”

With low commodity prices and increased input costs this year, the potato sector and specialty crops in general are facing a “major economic crisis,” according to the NPC release.

“The loss of this opportunity in Japan deepens this crisis and increases the imperative for the administration and Congress to provide meaningful economic relief to U.S. specialty crop growers,” said Idaho grower Dean Gibson, NPC vice president of legislative affairs.

Should the U.S. be successful in achieving access, Japan’s market for U.S. fresh potato exports is estimated at $150 million annually, according to the council, which said lack of access puts increased pressure on positive outcomes on tariffs and non-tariff barriers for potato products in other valuable export markets for the U.S.

Japan already allows U.S. processing and chipping potatoes. For U.S. fresh, table-stock potatoes, phytosanitary issues have been a sticking point in annual negotiations since 2019.

This project, called Project Speedbird, is a partnership between LanzaJet and British Airways. This project is a significant step in the aviation industry’s adoption of sustainable aviation fuels. Using advanced technologies, the SAF to be produced here is expected to minimize the carbon footprint of air travel significantly.

Combining Fluor’s engineering capabilities with LanzaJet’s sustainable aviation fuel production technology will be a game-changer in the aviation industry’s battle to decarbonize aviation. The SAF production facility is to be built in Teesside, which is expected to meet the UK’s environmental and economic development objectives due to its advanced economic infrastructure and skilled workforce.

The Role of Fluor in Project Speedbird

Fluor Corporation is a leading engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company, and it has been selected to design and engineer the SAF production hub for Project Speedbird. Fluor’s assignment in this project extension comes in a year when the aviation industry is expected to further boost the pace of its decarbonization and sustainable energy transition.

Fluor will concentrate on engineering and designing an appropriate solution that will handle the requirements of engineering a safe production of SAF using LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology developed LanzaJet. Ethanol comes from agricultural wastes and wood. This will allow the process of sustainable aviation fuel creation that will significantly reduce the dependence on fossil fuel in the aviation in its commercial use. The aviation commercially will benefit from clean aviation fuel.

The sustainable fuel hub required the management of large-scale projects. This project continues to support development and solve the LanzaJet(or LanzaJet).

LanzaJet SAF Technology

LanzaJet, the technology provider, has been in SAF production and has the leading advance in developing sustainable fuel technologies. The aviation fuel LanzaJet has developed the Acoho-to-Jet technology that can convert renewable agricultural feedstock, such as agricultural waste and fuel ,into sustainable aviation fuel. This can be sustainable aviation fuel. This technology serves as a great strategic solution to the challenges that the aviation industry faces in fuel decarbonization. The use of this fuel will lower the aviation industry’s fuel decarbonization challenges. The introduction of this technology will significantly reduce aviation fuel decarbonization challenges.

The planned facility for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) in Teesside will be one of the largest commercially scaled SAF production centers in the world. LanzaJet’s partnership with Fluor and British Airways represents a significant commitment to the worldwide increase of SAF production. This facility will be crucial in British Airways’ goal to SAF production and renewable diesel production will exceed 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) annually, and will be essential in the estimated 230,000 tonne carbon emission reduction British Airways hopes to realize every year.

Project Speedbird will be another demonstration of the value LanzaJet will bring to the industry by showcasing the sustainable growth of SAF technologies and the achievable goal of producing SAF at a commercial level. Upon the successful completion of Project Speedbird, LanzaJet will be positioned to build and establish the remaining commercial SAF production sites in the industry, thereby encouraging faster adoption of the low-carbon technologies in the aviation fuel industry.

British Airways, one of the UK’s largest airlines, has for some time now been actively trying to improve its sustainability. This SAF production facility is projected to increase British Airways’ capacity to SAF and diesel by 90,000 tonnes annually. This reduction will exceed 230,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually, and is expected to reach international climate goals.

British Airways expects to see an annual reduction of about 230,000 tonnes of carbon emissions due to the SAF produced at the new facility. This is comparable to the emissions produced by 26,000 domestic flights. This step is a notable advancement towards British Airways’ goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Collaborating with LanzaJet is also an important milestone in British Airways’ objective of climate change mitigation and sustainable operations in a more holistic sense.

The Environmental and Economic Impact of Project Speedbird

The new SAF production hub in Teeside is set to provide important economic and environmental benefits. Environmentally, the facility is aligned with the. The UK’s strategy is to lower greenhouse gas emissions and expand its use of renewable energy. While the site decarbonizes the aviation industry, the SAF produced there also completes the industry’s climate goal.

The project is expected to generate several jobs, assisting in the local economy and the local green economy. Being in the Teesside region, the facility will have access to advanced infrastructure, a qualified professional community, and renewable stock, making it a perfect location for the bulk manufacture of SAF.

The project is in line with the global purpose of implementing sustainable fuel technologies. These technologies are pivotal in lowering the carbon emissions of especially challenging sectors to decarbonize, such as aviation. With the successful implementation of Project Speedbird, similar projects are likely to emerge across the globe, fostering the use of SAF and helping the aviation sector to decarbonize.

Conclusion

Fluor Corporation’s engineering and design competency, coupled with LanzaJet’s SAF technology and British Airways’ environmental stewardship, makes this project a potential transformational endeavor for the aviation industry and the future of flight as a whole. Teesside’s facility will be integral to the production of sustainable aviation fuel at a commercially viable level.

This funding allows us to accelerate the development of our SAF production capabilities, expand our partnerships, and move closer to the day when every Canadian flight can be powered by clean fuel.""

INSAT's third wave of funding, delivered by Strix, supports Canadian innovators accelerating the transition to low-emission aviation technologies. The initiative recognizes SAF as the most immediate and scalable pathway to achieving net-zero aviation by 2050.

""As Canada works to reduce emissions in aviation, the development and adoption of sustainable aviation fuels will be essential,"" said Michel Dion, CEO of Strix. ""Initiatives like BioFlight's SAF Flight School contribute to building the domestic expertise and infrastructure we need to support this transition.""

The SAF Flight School project directly supports Canada's net-zero commitments by advancing renewable energy innovation and creating new economic opportunities across the clean fuels and aerospace sectors. Upon completion, BioFlight's technology is expected to achieve meaningful GHG emission reductions compared to conventional jet fuel.

BioFlight's first commercial SAF facility - Terminal 1 in Sarnia, Ontario - is now under development. The plant will convert renewable natural gas (RNG) from municipal and agricultural sources into certified drop-in aviation fuel. Terminal 1 is expected to produce over 15 million kilograms of Neat-SAF annually, as well as other by-products like renewable Naphtha.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/newsmediawire_165/f201777fe1452265db9dab2dc5b0823c,N,,2025-11-04 12:03:29.808053

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said: “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.","Rolls-Royce is leading a new project to find smarter ways of using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to increase its effectiveness and role in reducing non-CO2 emissions, specifically those associated with contrail formation.

Co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme, part of the ATI Programme, the Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS) project brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London and Heathrow.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey. However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios. However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

Constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights. This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails. The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports. It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

The project aims to show that we can prioritise particular flights for SAF, focusing on where it can deliver the greatest environmental benefit and maximise the effectiveness of the current levels of supply.

The Non-CO2 Programme focuses on addressing challenges with reducing non-CO2 emissions from aircraft, as outlined in the ATI’s Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. The funding programme is delivered by the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and Innovate UK, in partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said: “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.

“We’re bolstering our support for the aerospace industry through our modern Industrial Strategy – giving business the confidence it needs to invest in UK advanced manufacturing and delivering on growth as part of our Plan for Change.”

The fund forms a key component of Microsoft's wider sustainability strategy, which includes commitments to become a carbon-negative, water-positive, net-zero organisation by 2030.

It employs what Microsoft describes as a ""market development flywheel"" approach which combines corporate investment with technology support and crucially procurement commitments.

According to a newly-published report on the fund’s first five years, this strategy has attracted US$12bn in follow-on capital across its portfolio companies.

Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft, says: ""Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in bold ideas and scalable technologies that drive real impact"".

Procurement in hard-to-abate sectors

A large portion of the fund has been directed towards industries where low-carbon alternatives are either scarce or not yet commercially viable.

Steel production is a primary example. Microsoft invested in Stegra's commercial-scale facility in Sweden, which utilises green hydrogen-based direct reduced iron technology.

The facility aims to produce steel with emission reductions of up to 95% compared to conventional blast furnaces. Microsoft has supplemented this equity investment with multi-year purchase agreements for its suppliers to procure Stegra steel for data centre equipment.

Another focus is the aviation sector, where the fund has supported research and development around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Investments include Twelve’s carbon transformation technology and LanzaJet’s alcohol-to-jet scheme.

In the same sector, Microsoft also invested in a book-and-claim accounting model with Alaska Airlines enabling Microsoft to report lower emissions from SAF use without needing physical delivery to specific aircraft.

First-of-a-kind project financing

The fund has also dedicated more than US$100m to what it calls ""first-of-a-kind"" projects.

As the rubric suggests, these are nascent climate technologies that have been caught in limbo, facing financing challenges too large for venture capital but too risky for traditional infrastructure investors. The team at Microsoft estimates that this gap typically ranges between US$100m-US$180m per project.

As part of this initiative, Microsoft provided project finance for Climeworks' Orca plant the world's first commercial direct air capture (DAC) facility. This was supported by a 10-year offtake agreement for 10,000 tonnes of CO₂.

In another project, the fund supported Konexa in Nigeria to construct renewable energy infrastructure that connects Heineken’s operations to clean power. That project, which is now commissioned, intends to create a replicable model for the country's renewable power sector.

The role of AI in climate innovation

As Microsoft has become more deeply involved in AI, the fund has increasingly integrated the technology into its investment strategy, describing it as an ""innovation amplifier"".

Investments in this area include Vibrant Planet, a company using AI-powered geospatial analytics to detect and mitigate wildfire risks. Another is Terradot, a startup applying AI to enhanced rock weathering, which is a novel carbon removal method.

These investments reflect Microsoft's belief that AI's capacity to measure, predict and optimise complex systems will be essential in addressing climate change. However, Microsoft acknowledges that AI is currently the fastest-growing source of carbon emissions within its value chain.

The Oxford, England-based company is the first fuel producer to receive funding through the ATI Non-CO2 Programme. The program is delivered in partnership with the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade and Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation.

The total project cost of £3 million (US$3.9 million) includes co-investment between industry and government through the Department for Business and Trade. The project runs from July 2025 to June 2027, focusing on understanding how to minimize non-CO2 effects of OXFUEL.

“This ATI Programme funding not only enables us to advance our technology but also supports our ambition to lead the industry in producing cleaner aviation fuels with a reduced contribution to global warming,” said Andrew Symes, chief executive at OXCCU. “Non-CO2 effects are an area of emerging science that could have substantial implications for climate strategy in aviation.”

The project will explore how OXFUEL produced with OXCCU’s iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst can reduce warming associated with non-CO2 effects of burning hydrocarbon fuel in jet turbines. The focus includes soot particles, which can cause cloud formation at altitude and impact global warming.

According to OXCCU, the catalyst works directly with carbon dioxide and has high selectivity for producing jet fuel range hydrocarbon syncrude in a single exothermic step. The process requires fewer steps and less hydrogen input per amount of jet fuel compared to other methods.

The ATI Non-CO2 Programme builds on the UK Aviation Non-CO2 Programme, managed by the Department for Business and Trade, Department for Transport and Natural Environment Research Council. The program seeks to accelerate industrial investment in technologies that can reduce non-CO2 emissions across the aerospace sector.

OXCCU validated its technology at the OX1 demonstration plant at Oxford Airport in 2024. The company focuses on direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, eliminating the reverse water-gas shift step or multiple stages associated with methanol production.

The funding supports stakeholder engagement, accreditation efforts and commercial partnerships.

The fund supports emerging technologies and early-stage ventures focused on cutting carbon emissions and building scalable solutions, particularly in sectors where alternatives are not yet widely available.

The fund, launched in 2020, aligns with Microsoft’s commitments to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030. It combines financial backing with procurement agreements and technical support: a strategy the company refers to as its “market development flywheel.” This approach has already attracted US$12bn in follow-on capital for portfolio companies, according to a new report detailing the fund’s first five years.

Brad Smith, Microsoft’s Vice Chair and President, says: “Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in bold ideas and scalable technologies that drive real impact.”

Targeting complex industries with emerging solutions

A large portion of the Climate Innovation Fund’s capital goes into industries where low-carbon options are limited or still under development. These include steel production, aviation and infrastructure-scale carbon removal.

In Sweden, Microsoft has invested in Stegra’s commercial facility that uses green hydrogen in place of traditional blast furnaces. The process, known as direct reduced iron technology, aims to cut emissions by up to 95 percent. Microsoft pairs this equity investment with long-term purchase agreements for the steel, which it intends to use in data centre equipment.

In aviation, Microsoft supports projects aimed at producing and adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The fund has backed Twelve, a company using carbon transformation and LanzaJet, which is developing alcohol-to-jet technology. LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Georgia is the first commercial SAF facility of its kind to use ethanol.

Microsoft also participates in book-and-claim systems, a form of emissions accounting that allows companies to report the use of SAF without the fuel physically powering specific flights. One such deal is with Alaska Airlines.

Funding climate tech where others hesitate

The fund allocates more than US$100m to first-of-a-kind projects, technologies too large for venture capital but still too risky for conventional infrastructure investors. Microsoft estimates this financing gap ranges between US$100m and US$180m per project.

It has provided project finance for Climeworks’ Orca facility in Iceland, the world’s first commercial direct air capture (DAC) plant. Alongside the investment, Microsoft has signed a 10-year offtake agreement to remove 10,000 tons of CO₂.

In Nigeria, Microsoft funds Konexa’s renewable infrastructure that now links Heineken’s facilities to clean power. The project is already commissioned and is designed as a model for similar efforts across the country’s energy sector.

Microsoft evaluates the climate impact of these projects through a framework developed with Rhodium Group. This system measures both direct emissions reductions and the potential for broader market change—known as catalysed reductions. In technologies like low-carbon steel and DAC, catalysed benefits can surpass those achieved directly by early-stage installations.

The company acknowledges that dollar-for-dollar, these early investments currently deliver lower emissions savings than mature technologies such as solar or wind. Still, Microsoft argues they are essential to establishing future markets.

Lillian Barnard, Microsoft’s Chief of Enterprise Partners for the Middle East and Africa, says: “Our goal isn’t just to become more sustainable but also to help every organisation in Africa and the world to do the same.”

Investments closer to Microsoft’s home in Washington State have also been part of the fund. Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer, adds: “It’s inspiring to see the Climate Innovation Fund driving real impact across Washington state and beyond.”

She continues: “As a WA resident, it’s especially meaningful to see how these investments are supporting local entrepreneurs and helping scale climate solutions in our communities.”

Microsoft’s investment strategy increasingly includes the deployment of AI, which the company sees as critical to future climate progress. Described as an “innovation amplifier,” AI features in newer investments such as Vibrant Planet, which uses geospatial data to manage wildfire risks and Terradot, a start-up using AI to improve carbon removal through enhanced rock weathering.

Despite AI’s growing carbon footprint (it is currently the fastest-growing emissions source in Microsoft’s value chain), the company believes the long-term benefits will outweigh this short-term impact.

“The force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence,” Melanie says. “This is not hyperbole.”

The Non-CO2 Programme is delivered in partnership by the ATI, the Department for Business & Trade and Innovate UK. The funding programme was launched last year in partnership with a broader research programme from the Department for Transport and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Recognising that non-CO2 atmospheric emissions could potentially make a greater contribution to the climate than aviation CO2 itself, the ATI also published a pioneering Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. This set out the aerospace sector’s collective ambition to improve understanding of non-CO2 aircraft emissions and the technology advancements needed to address their climate impact.

The projects announced today have a total project value of £9.98 million, supported by £5.9 million of ATI Programme funding. These are expected to be the first in a portfolio of non-CO2 projects.

The TRACE project led by Airbus UK with input from Imperial College, aims to deploy several approaches to addressing the effects of contrails. It includes developing critical contrail modelling & analysis capabilities, together with sensor technology to better permit operational contrail avoidance. In this way, the project aligns with the Fuel Characteristics, Aircraft Systems and Knowledge, Data and Ops streams in the ATI Non-CO2 Technology Roadmap.

The QRITOS project, led by Rolls-Royce with inputs from British Airways, Imperial College London and Heathrow, is examining smarter ways of using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is therefore typically deployed at very low blend ratios. The project aims to better understand how best to target this scarce SAF towards the very small proportion of flights that drive the majority of climate impact.

In a third project, Oxford-based OXCCU will explore how their innovative new SAF fuel reduces soot and particulate emissions, a major driver for persistent warming contrails. OXCCU’s SAF, marketed under the brand OXFUEL, uses a novel iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst to convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen directly into SAF. The objective of this project is to fully understand the potential of this single-step process to produce jet fuel with improved combustion and non-CO2 characteristics.

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said: “The race to Jet Zero is only going to be won through strong partnership between Government and Industry and that’s why we are proud to announce funding for three promising Non-CO2 sustainable aviation projects today.

“We’re also bolstering our support for the aerospace industry through our modern Industrial Strategy – giving business the confidence it needs to invest in UK advanced manufacturing and delivering on growth as part of our Plan for Change.”

Gary Elliott, CEO, Aerospace Technology Institute, said: “When the ATI published the Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap and announced funding for related projects, non-CO2 became the fourth pillar of our UK Aerospace Technology Strategy. In responding rapidly with these three exciting technology projects, UK industry and academia have affirmed their world-class strengths in this important area of making aviation more sustainable.”

Lizzie Garratt, Head of Research - Atmospheric and SRO for the non-CO2 aviation research investment at NERC, said: “In parallel with the ATI’s non-CO2 technology focus, the Natural Environment Research Council with the Department for Transport announced £10 million of research funding into how aircraft non-CO2 emissions interact with climate over time, and how best to mitigate any adverse effects. A broad range of emission types was included, focused on technology readiness levels 1-4. This fundamental research programme complements the associated industrial research supported by the ATI and demonstrated in this first batch of projects announced today. We look forward to further research funded under both streams to be announced in the future.”

The Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) is an independent organization that develops the national technology strategy for the UK’s civil aerospace sector. It provides funding for research projects that align with the strategy through a joint government-industry programme and promotes innovation to ensure the UK remains competitive in the global aerospace market.

*Disclaimer: The content of this article may not reflect the official views of the International Chamber of Commerce.","Climate change is the defining issue of our time. It affects the environment in many different ways, from sea level rise and permafrost impacts, high temperatures to flooding caused by stronger storms and coastal erosion. Every industry is rethinking its own operations and is forced to innovate and act decisively. For aviation, a sector that not only connects more than 4 billion people every year and accounts for almost 4% of global economic activity, but also contributes roughly 2% of global carbon emissions, the need to decarbonise is even more urgent.

This is why the global air transport sector is working towards achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Yes, decarbonising a sector so heavily reliant on fossil fuels is a monumental challenge, but it also poses an opportunity as it allows us to reimagine the way we travel in the not-so-distant future: aircraft will be powered by new propulsion systems which reduce fuel use or rely on more electric architectures, while sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will need to fuel the majority of flights taking off around the world.

At the same time, smarter and more efficient airspace management and airport infrastructure and operations will transform air travel. The challenge of our lifetime to reach net zero carbon emissions, is the opportunity of our lifetime to create the next generation of air transport!

Turning opportunity into reality

This is not just an ambition. Aviation’s net zero transformation is already underway – governments under the umbrella of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), support the sector’s 2050 goal. Airlines, airports, manufacturers, air navigation providers and the entire air transport value chain are taking action to lower carbon emissions.

But the way to get there is difficult, requiring enormous efforts by all stakeholders. There is no silver bullet to get to net zero and different stakeholders and regions in the world will contribute in different ways. Some will lead through large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, while others will pioneer hydrogen, hybrid and electric propulsion systems. Together, these efforts are converging into one shared journey: transforming the vision of tomorrow’s flight into today’s reality.

At the heart of this transformation lies the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. Sustainable aviation fuel, which can be produced from feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, algae or even captured carbon, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the challenge is to scale it: this fuel currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel use. To meet 2050 targets, production must increase exponentially, requiring the creation of an entirely new energy ecosystem. That means new refineries and supply chains as well as harmonised regulations around the globe and investment and financial frameworks.

Building the ecosystem for transformation

Air Transport Action Group(ATAG) is supporting the industry in reaching its net zero goals. Our member organisations share a vision of ensuring air transport can continue to connect the world and support economic and social development in the decades to come, while respecting the commitment to climate action. The case studies highlighted in this newsletter by organisations such as the Airports Council International and sustainable aviation fuel producers LanzaJet and World Energy demonstrate how the aviation industry is collaborating across the aisle, working with sustainable aviation fuel producers to move us closer to our target.

It shows that our common effort is by no means only limited to the aviation industry. We cannot decarbonise in a vacuum but need to work with the business community outside the aviation sector to create opportunities for climate impact. Apart from financial and energy industries this also includes businesses in the technology and construction industries, as well startups and research partners to innovate and help us scale new solutions.

The next five years will define the future of flight

One thing is clear: we have the opportunity to create a net zero future for air transport, but time is short. The next five years will be decisive, and each year of delay makes net zero harder and more costly to achieve. Now is the time to collectively take on this opportunity and scale the production of sustainable aviation fuel globally, continue to implement market-based mechanisms and financing tools, deploy fuel-efficient aircraft faster into the fleet and continue research and development for new propulsion technologies.

We must continue to modernise air traffic management systems and accelerate the development and scaling of carbon removals. Doing so is essential not only for the planet, but also for protecting aviation’s role as a driver of global connectivity, trade, tourism and economic opportunity for communities around the world.

The decarbonisation of aviation can be a symbol of what multi-stakeholder cooperation and innovation can accomplish when the world works together towards a common goal. This is not just a challenge. It truly is the opportunity of a lifetime, to redefine how air transport connects the world and help safeguard the planet for generations to come.

2025 is a critical year for the Paris Agreement. Ten years on, we need to rethink how we frame the challenge. And seeing challenges differently is what business and we are all about.

ICC is committed to securing what businesses need at the upcoming climate negotiations, COP30, in Belém, Brazil. Learn more about our Opportunity of a Lifetime climate campaign and how to get involved.

They focused on how to scale production while maintaining commercial viability, with a mixture of policies to build a new SAF market at scale.

Middle East’s potential needs policy push

Noura Al Nuaimi, VP Retail Aviation, ADNOC, brought perspective on the current situation in the Middle East, its comparison with other world regions and its real potential for SAF production and use.

“Europe has firm targets of reaching 70 % of SAF by 2050,” she said. “Asia is following with firm mandates as well with private investment to really strive and upscale SAF production.”

“If we look at the Middle East as a hub, we are leading in investments and financing,” she continued. “However, we do not see demand and policies to pick up the demand.”

Despite the lack of mandates in the region, there are approaches that can work to spur demand in the region. Al Nuaimi outlined several approaches.

“The potential is great,” she said.

Electrons are key

Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech, pointed to the important connection of clean power to sustainable aviation fuel.

“Clean power is absolutely the key to conversion,” she said. “The electrons are how we are going to convert CO2 because that's how we also make hydrogen.”

“Electrons are the key to the future of molecules,” she added.

Holmgren emphasised that is it very important to just begin to deploy new fuels.

“At the end of the day, you've got to build, that's how you make it reliable and available - you just build,” she said.

“And that means we have to have permits go faster, we have to have people taking long-term PPAs, and we have to just increase our investment.”

Complementary tech

Horst H. Mahmoudi, CEO & Executive Chairman, Smartenergy, spoke about the importance of partnerships to launch a nascent industry.

“Nowadays as we see volumes are still very low,” he said. “And I think the only way to push it forward is through real partnerships.”

“Alliances that are also able to overcome certain periods, like for example less attractive periods for sustainable fuels.”

Steve Kelly, President and GM, 1PointFive International, discussed the importance of direct air capture as an important complement to SAF.

“As a capture developer, what we offer is a range of solutions that are complementary to the decarbonisation of an industry like aviation,” he said. “It's a full range,” he continued.

“We can deal with the residual emissions that exist with the SAF that's being used.” He said that the various roadmaps to get to net zero aviation shows that there will be something from 500 to 800 million tonnes of residual emissions to deal with.

His company is focused on that while also building a sustainable feedstock for e-fuel, in the form of a sustainable supply of CO2 that's atmospherically sourced from the use of any fuel.

Optimistic outlook

Dr. Steven Griffiths, Professor and Vice Chancellor for Research, American University of Sharjah, emphasised the important of development in the research and development for SAF.

“I always get asked about R & D and I always tell people that, in an area like SAF, we talk about R & D & D & D - research, development, demonstration, and deployment,” he said.

“Because really it's the demonstration and deployment that matters.”

Griffiths said that when he’s working with organisations he brings focus on several concerns. One is the feedstock, as the availability and sustainability of the feedstock are critically important. Likewise, the scalability of the technologies to convert the feedstock has to be thought about, such that developers are able to convert feedstocks through various technologies.

Griffiths and the other panellists conveyed optimism about the future of SAF, with the current global push and mandates in various parts of the world. The exciting part is figuring out the mixture of technologies and forms of fuel that will eventually take hold.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/w2cnzr3e/bridging-supply-demand-gap-airline-energy-sector-strategies-saf-adoption-day-2-full-page.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134067162823970000,N,,2025-11-04 03:56:50.977901

Located next to Epic Energy’s 46-MWp solar plant, the Mannum project will strengthen grid stability in South Australia and support the regional energy transition. It uses E-Storage’s proprietary SolBank technology. With a 41% gain to €17.96, Canadian Solar was the top performer in the RENIXX last week.

Bloom EnergyUS energy pioneer Bloom Energy reported its Q3 2025 results, including record revenues. The strong data and prospects for further fuel cell deals for AI data centers boosted investor confidence, sending the stock up sharply. At week’s end, Bloom Energy shares closed 21.4% higher at €113.88.

First SolarFirst Solar reported record shipments but slightly lowered its guidance. In Q3, the US solar module maker posted net revenue of USD 1.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of USD 4.24. Shipments reached a record 5.3 GW. Net cash increased to USD 1.5 billion, supported by prepayments and improved cash flow. For 2025, the company expects revenue between USD 4.95 - 5.20 billion (previously 4.90 - 5.70) and EPS between USD 14.00 - 15.00 (previously 13.50 - 16.50). The stock rose 16.8% to €231.35.

NordexWind turbine manufacturer Nordex raised its EBITDA margin forecast for 2025 significantly to 7.5 - 8.5% (previously 5.0 - 7.0%). The improved guidance was attributed to strong operational execution in both project and service segments, as well as a stable macroeconomic environment. Asset manager BlackRock increased its stake in Nordex to 4.35% (3.17% direct, 1.18% via instruments). The stock rose 13% to €25.52.

Plug PowerHydrogen specialist Plug Power is expanding into renewable fuels production. Together with Edgewood Renewables, the company plans to build a state-of-the-art facility in North Las Vegas (Nevada) that will convert biogenic waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel (RD), and biomethanol. The plant will use renewable natural gas (RNG) and low-carbon hydrogen for process energy. All end products can serve as drop-in fuels, usable in existing aircraft, truck, and ship engines. The project aims to cut CO? emissions in the transport and industrial sectors. However, the stock fell 8.3% to €2.23.

Enphase EnergyEnphase beat expectations for Q3 but issued a weak outlook for Q4 due to countervailing duties. Q4 revenue is expected between USD 310 - 350 million, with the upper end about USD 60 million below Q3 levels. The gross margin is projected at 40.0 - 43.0% (GAAP) and 42.0 - 45.0% (non-GAAP), about 5 percentage points lower due to tariffs. The stock dropped 15.6% to €26.43.

RENIXX Starts the Week on a Positive NoteThe RENIXX continued its upward trend yesterday, rising 2.8% to 1,224.75 points, reaching a new yearly high.

SAF is THE preferred, only(? )Pathway to Net Zero Carbon Emissions. Indeed it is the primary focus of ICAO, IATA[1], EASA/EU and FAA/DoT[2]. AIN has published a credible article, titled, Report Sees Minimal Role for SAF in Cutting Emissions, suggesting that SAF may not be what it is cracked up to be.

CarbonTracker (CT), the source of this strong opinion, is widely regarded as a credible and influential think tank in climate finance. This non-profit think tank was founded in London by UK fund manager Mark Campanale—

CT has focused on the intersection of climate science and financial markets. Its stature derives, in part, from the collaboration work with respected institutions like the International Energy Agency[3] (IEA) and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, grounding its work in robust climate modeling and financial analysis.

More bona fides:

Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which used Carbon Tracker’s analysis to justify divestment from fossil fuels.

Its Unburnable Carbon (2011, 2013)reports—are considered foundational in climate finance discourse.

Carbon Tracker’s reports are known for quantitative rigor, using asset-level financial modeling (e.g., CTI-PALEM) to assess transition risks in sectors like oil, gas, steel, and power generation.

Their work is often cited in financial audits, investor briefings, and regulatory discussions, including responses submitted jointly with organizations like Ceres and the Climate Accounting Project.

With that background, here are Fuel Disclosure’s major conclusions—

Near-term shortfall: By 2030, potential Alternative jet fuels (AJF) supply covers only a small share of total jet fuel consumption and fails to offset its growth.

Sustainability criteria: Not all “SAF” is sustainable – several pathways carry risks to nature and climate.

Seven hurdles to scale:

Costs and price premiums;

regulatory uncertainty;

lack of long-term offtake;

weak bankability;

feedstock availability;

feedstock sustainability;

opportunity costs.

Right-sizing roles: AJF has a role, but a smaller one, mostly in long-haul flight; short-haul decarbonisation can proceed sooner with zero-emission and hybrid-electric aircraft, alongside operational measures.

These major premises are supported by the following two charts:

So much of what surrounds this technological, developmental and environmental sector is hard to take for granted; debate/review MUST ADDRESS TC’s analysis. If the think tank’s conclusions are valid, then ICAO CORSIA MUST review the degree to which SAF is relied upon as its primary pathway. A reference library for such a policy discussion might include the following reports:

Contrails

ICAO #42 report says CONTRAIL policies may avoid >90% of aviation-induced warming by 2050 From EPA Acid Rain lesson time to review CORSIA

IATA’s STUDY of Contrails is MOST INSTRUCTIVE

SAF may be the solution to CONTRAILS

Scourge of CONTRAILs being attacked by EASA and FAA

Can Civil Aviation decrease CONTRAILS now???

Reports/Assessments

2050 Zero Net Emissions; EU’s Clean Aviation And The Us- How Are They Doing?

Conflicting Developments in the Hydrogen Aviation Power Race

News about a new “breakthrough” in SAF poses the question of how these worthwhile efforts are being coordinated

Hydrogen Option(S)

Solid Hydrogen as power source in an eVTOL- a real advance??

UK says H2 has a positive prospect; France is delaying its H2 efforts- COOPERATE???

UPDATE ON H2 PROGRESS TOWARD ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS

Redesign Of Traditional Powerplants

RISE’s innovative patent: Green Positive?

SAF Alternatives

Swiss Alchemy creates SAF with the SUN ???

Big announcement of major investment on GREEN SAF, is it the ONE?

Operational Alternatives

Emirates’ Green Operating Procedures start with the Cockpit

Initial environmental efforts are not always successful. Acid Rain, for example, was caused by the use of tall smokestacks to disperse their emissions. It was later found that “actually tall stacks generally disperse pollutants over greater distances than shorter stacks and provide pollutants greater time to react in the atmosphere to form ozone and particulate matter.” Statutes and EPA rules moved to scrubbers to control SO2 and post-combustion controls to capture NOx emissions.

Perhaps it is time for ICAO and the world’s aviation community to review options based on the CT Fuel Disclosure report. Since the discussions and vote setting Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), BILLIONS of dollars have been invested in a plethora of potential CO2 solutions some of which do not depend on SAF, in whole or in part. Perhaps it is time for the global aviation community to return to Montreal and ASSESS WHAT OPTION(S) MAY HAVE THE MOST LIKELY RESULTS IN ATTAINING NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS 2050.

Report Sees Minimal Role for SAF in Cutting Emissions

October 31, 2025

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) will make only a marginal contribution to reducing aircraft emissions before 2030, according to a new report published yesterday by Carbon Tracker. The UK-based independent financial think tank’s “Fuel Disclosure” report concluded that alternatives to jet-A are “unlikely to make a significant dent” in emissions this decade.

The group’s analysts concluded that high costs and limited feedstocks will curtail the impact of SAF. “EVEN IF ALL EXISTING, UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND ANNOUNCED PROJECTS OPERATE AT FULL CAPACITY, [SAF] PRODUCTION WOULD ONLY SUPPLY AROUND 5% OF GLOBAL JET FUEL DEMAND AND MEET LESS THAN HALF OF THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN TOTAL JET FUEL CONSUMPTION,” Carbon Tracker concluded.

Apart from high production and distribution costs for SAF, the report said that perceived technology, feedstock, and policy risks are constraining funding for the sector, which the report defines as “weak bankability.” Other factors identified as hurdles to progress include regulatory uncertainty, competition for feedstocks with other sectors, and uncertainty over how much SAF aircraft operators will buy, resulting in revenue uncertainty for producers.

“On top of high costs, offtaker hesitation, and financing constraints, most alternative jet fuels are also saddled with a handful of environmental downsides,” commented Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, lead author for the report. “These fuels may someday have a larger role in decarbonizing aviation, but the burden of proof is on the industry to show that it can find a pathway that will deliver alternative jet fuel that’s at once sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

CARBON TRACKER IS URGING COMPANIES TO “RIGHT-SIZE” THE ROLE OF SAF IN THEIR BUSINESSES, PRIORITIZING “PATHWAYS WITH ROBUST SUSTAINABILITY CREDENTIALS AND CLEARER COST TRAJECTORIES” WHILE AVOIDING “OPTIONS WITH WEAK LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE OR MATERIAL NATURE/FOOD SECURITY RISKS.” The company argued that for flights on routes of less than 500 kilometers (270 nm), THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE ON INVESTING IN BATTERY-ELECTRIC, HYDROGEN-ELECTRIC, AND HYBRID-ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT.

Sustainability specialists like 4Air are focused on helping aircraft operators, airports and other stakeholders to pursue multiple components towards decarbonization. According to 4Air, in addition to SAF, these will include carbon offsets, the introduction of new aircraft and propulsion technology (fleet renewal and electrification), and improvements to infrastructure and operational efficiencies (including air traffic management).

[1] IATA projects that SAF will likely deliver around 65–80% of the aviation sector’s CO₂ cuts by 2050. However, IATA also supports complementary strategies like operational efficiency and new propulsion technologies.

At lower temperatures, byproducts such as methane are formed, which decreases carbon monoxide productivity.
When using traditional copper catalysts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen first react to form formate intermediates, which are then converted into carbon monoxide.
In contrast, the new catalyst was found to directly convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface without generating intermediates.
The study was supported by the KIER’s R&D project, ‘Development of e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production technology from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.","A research team led by Dr. Kee Young Koo from the Hydrogen Research Department at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (President Yi Chang-Keun, hereafter referred to as KIER) has developed a world-class catalyst for the reverse water–gas shift reaction, transforming carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, into a key building block for eco-friendly fuels.

The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a technology that converts carbon dioxide (CO₂) into carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H₂O) by reacting it with hydrogen (H₂) in a reactor. The resulting carbon monoxide can be combined with the remaining hydrogen to produce syngas, which serves as a building block for synthetic fuels such as e-fuels* and methanol. This makes the RWGS reaction a promising technology for driving the eco-friendly fuel industry.

* E-Fuels are synthetic fuels produced by combining green hydrogen, generated with renewable electricity, and captured CO₂ from the atmosphere or sustainable biomass. They are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels, especially for hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as aviation and shipping.

The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction achieves higher carbon dioxide conversion at temperatures above 800 °C, and thus nickel-based catalysts, known for their superior thermal stability compared to other metals, are typically employed. However, prolonged exposure to such high temperatures causes particle agglomeration, leading to reduced catalytic activity. At lower temperatures, byproducts such as methane are formed, which decreases carbon monoxide productivity. Therefore, current research is focusing on developing catalysts that maintain high activity even under low-temperature conditions, in order to reduce process costs and improve efficiency.

The KIER research team has overcome the limitations of conventional catalysts by developing a cost-effective and abundant copper-based catalyst. Their newly developed copper–magnesium–iron mixed oxide catalyst successfully produced carbon monoxide 1.7 times faster and with 1.5 times higher yield than commercial copper catalysts at 400 °C.

Unlike nickel catalysts, copper-based catalysts can selectively produce only carbon monoxide at temperatures below 400 °C without generating byproducts such as methane. The challenge, however, is that copper’s thermal stability decreases significantly at around 400 °C. Reduced thermal stability leads to particle agglomeration, which markedly diminishes the overall stability of the catalyst.

To address this issue, the research team implemented a layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure. This structure has a sandwich-like form, where water molecules and anions are intercalated between thin metal layers, and by adjusting the types and ratios of metal ions, various physical and chemical properties can be achieved. By incorporating iron and magnesium, the team was able to fill the spaces between copper particles, preventing particle agglomeration and thereby enhancing thermal stability.

Through real-time infrared analysis and reaction experiments, the researchers identified why the newly developed catalyst outperforms conventional ones. When using traditional copper catalysts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen first react to form formate intermediates, which are then converted into carbon monoxide. In contrast, the new catalyst was found to directly convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface without generating intermediates. Because it avoids producing unnecessary intermediates or methane byproducts, the catalyst maintains high activity even at the relatively low temperature of 400 °C.

The catalyst developed by the research team achieved a carbon monoxide yield of 33.4% and a formation rate of 223.7 micromoles per gram of catalyst per second (μmol·gcat⁻¹·s⁻¹) at 400 °C, while operating stably for more than 100 hours. This performance represents over a 1.7-fold increase in carbon monoxide formation rate and a 1.5-fold increase in yield compared to commercial copper catalysts. Furthermore, when compared to noble metal catalysts such as platinum, which exhibit high activity at low temperatures, the new catalyst demonstrated a 2.2-fold higher formation rate and a 1.8-fold higher yield, marking it as one of the best-performing catalysts worldwide.

Dr. Kee Young Koo, the lead researcher, stated, “The low-temperature CO₂ hydrogenation catalyst technology is a breakthrough achievement that enables the efficient production of carbon monoxide using inexpensive and abundant metals. It can be directly applied to the production of key feedstocks for sustainable synthetic fuels. Moving forward, we will continue our research to expand its application to real industrial settings, thereby contributing to the realization of carbon neutrality and the commercialization of sustainable synthetic fuel production technologies.

The research findings were published online in May 2025 in Applied Catalysis B: Environmental and Energy (Impact Factor: 21.1), a leading journal in the field of energy and environmental catalysis.

(Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials) RSB’s Sustainability Framework Drives Measurable Impact in Landmark European Aviation Project -- ALIGHT final conference at Copenhagen Airport celebrates five years of collaboration delivering practical tools and emissions reductions

On 1st October, partners and stakeholders gathered at Copenhagen Airport for the final conference of the ALIGHT (Airport-centred, Life cycle-based, Integrated, Green-House gas reduction Technology) project, marking the successful conclusion of a five-year Horizon 2020-funded collaboration that has delivered tangible environmental improvements for aviation.

The conference celebrated the project’s systems-level collaboration’s ability to deliver genuine progress: a 30% reduction in taxiing emissions through sustainable aviation fuel implementation, deployment of smart energy infrastructure, and creation of practical tools that airports across Europe can now use to accelerate their sustainability transitions.

For RSB, ALIGHT provided an opportunity to demonstrate how our comprehensive sustainability framework translates into measurable impact in complex, high-stakes sectors.

Five Years of Collaboration: What ALIGHT Delivered

The project brought together 17 leading airports, airlines, technology providers, and universities to develop solutions for sustainable airport operations. Key achievements showcased at the final conference included:

30% emissions reduction during taxing using 34% SAF blends

Battery energy storage and smart energy management systems deployed at partner airports

Infrastructure guidance for airports preparing for electric and hydrogen aircraft

Replication Toolbox enabling airports across Europe to implement proven solutions

European network built through collaboration with Green Deal sister projects OLGA, Stargate, and TULIPS

These outcomes demonstrate that the airport of the future can be greener, smarter, and more resilient when industry, research, and sustainability expertise work together.

RSB’s Strategic Contribution: Beyond Carbon

RSB’s role in ALIGHT exemplified how our organisation’s capabilities extend beyond certification to encompass strategic partnership and sector-specific application of comprehensive sustainability principles.

Click to learn more RSB’s involvement in the ALIGHT project.

.Sustainable Airport Platform

RSB developed the Sustainable Airport Platform, a collaborative space facilitating knowledge sharing and coordinated action across European airports. The platform embodies RSB’s own multi-stakeholder governance model, providing airports with validated tools, peer networks, and frameworks for measuring sustainability performance.

Holistic Sustainability Tools

Drawing on RSB’s globally recognised Principles & Criteria—covering environmental, social, management, and legal dimensions—RSB contributed tools that help airports assess and improve operations holistically. This reflects a critical insight emphasised at the final conference: genuine aviation sustainability requires looking beyond carbon emissions to consider water stewardship, biodiversity protection, air quality, labour rights, and community impacts.

Key Insights for Aviation Sustainability

The ALIGHT final conference reinforced several critical principles: systems thinking is essential for sustainable airports; collaboration unlocks progress by bringing together complementary expertise; comprehensive frameworks prevent unintended consequences; and practical tools drive real-world implementation.

Perhaps most importantly, the conference highlighted that airports planning to accommodate hydrogen and electric aircraft in the 2030s need to begin infrastructure investments now. ALIGHT’s guidance helps airports make these long-term investments strategically.

From Conference to Action .

The tools, networks, and insights developed through ALIGHT are now available for airports worldwide to adapt and implement. For RSB, the project demonstrates our capability to serve as a strategic sustainability partner in complex sectors, applying our comprehensive framework to drive innovation and measurable impact.

The aviation sector faces immense pressure to reduce its climate impact whilst accommodating continued growth. Meeting this challenge requires exactly the kind of collaborative, evidence-based, holistic approach that ALIGHT exemplified. RSB is committed to continuing this work—supporting airports, airlines, and the broader aviation ecosystem in their transitions towards genuine sustainability.

Neste's investment in the Singapore refinery marked a pivotal milestone as the company’s first major renewable products focused investment in Asia and outside of Finland.
In 2010, Neste’s refinery in Singapore commenced operations as the world's largest renewable diesel refinery.
60-year-old Porvoo refinery, a cornerstone of Neste’s innovative refining Neste’s Porvoo oil refinery in Finland began operations in 1965 with the purpose to secure Finland’s oil supply.
“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe.","Neste has been transforming from a local oil refiner in Finland to a global frontrunner in renewable and circular solutions. Today, Neste is the world's leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, enabling its customers across a variety of sectors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with Neste’s renewable solutions.

This year, Neste marks two significant milestones: the 15th anniversary of its renewable products refinery in Singapore and the 60th anniversary of its Porvoo refinery in Finland, showcasing a legacy of refining that has grown from local operations to make a global impact.

15-year-old state-of-the-art Singapore refinery, a crucial hub in global operations. Neste's investment in the Singapore refinery marked a pivotal milestone as the company’s first major renewable products focused investment in Asia and outside of Finland. In 2010, Neste’s refinery in Singapore commenced operations as the world's largest renewable diesel refinery.

A subsequent expansion in 2023 integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capabilities into the refinery operations, elevating the total production capacity of renewable products to 2.6 million tons annually, encompassing renewable diesel, SAF, and renewable raw materials for polymers and chemicals.

Investments in Singapore have solidified Neste's role as a significant global player in renewable fuels, enhancing its global footprint and strengthening ties with its Asia-Pacific customers.

“The Singapore refinery's 15th anniversary is a testament to Neste’s refining expertise and the dedication of our talented employees in Singapore. Their commitment to pioneering renewable solutions and our strategic growth in the region make this refinery a cornerstone of our global operations, giving us an advantage in global competition and enabling us to continue helping our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” says Jukka Kanerva, Senior Vice President, Refining, Renewable Products at Neste.

60-year-old Porvoo refinery, a cornerstone of Neste’s innovative refining

Neste’s Porvoo oil refinery in Finland began operations in 1965 with the purpose to secure Finland’s oil supply. After its expansion, it became the largest oil refinery in the Nordics already in the 1970s.

The basis for Neste’s fuel innovations was built at the Porvoo refinery. Lead-free and sulfur-free fuels were Neste’s first steps towards improving products' environmental performance, and in the 1990s, Neste’s NEXBTL technology for renewables production was developed and NEXBTL refining units started-up in 2007 and 2009 at the Porvoo refinery.

“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe. It was built that way to ensure flexibility in producing more than 100 products from a variety of raw materials, including different crude oil qualities. Now 60 years after its start-up, Neste proudly showcases a very unique oil refinery with the capability of processing not only crude oil but also renewable and recycled raw materials”, says Jori Sahlsten, Executive Vice President of Oil Products at Neste.

“We want to thank our customers and partners for collaborating with us to develop high-quality products for diverse sectors and applications. Above all, we are incredibly proud of our teams, whose expertise and commitment ensure that our refineries continue to serve Neste customers worldwide for years to come,” Jori Sahlsten and Jukka Kanerva state about the refineries’ achievements.

IAG's legacy airlines defected from AEA to ELFAA due to differences of opinion over market liberalisation.","It is more than a year since Delta, United and American Airlines published their 'White Paper' alleging state subsidies to Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad. CAPA's Airlines in Transition (AIT) event in Dublin assembled a panel of senior industry figures moderated by John Byerly, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation at the US State Department, to review the arguments.

The US big three claimed that subsidies to the Gulf three distorted the market. They called on the US government to open consultations under the relevant bilateral air services agreements and, in the meantime, to freeze new passenger services. A ponderous bureaucratic process to examine whether action should be taken is still under way. European airlines have also been dragged into the debate.

At the same time, the Gulf airlines have continued to add and announce new routes to the US. Ultimately, the US big three's aims contemplate the termination, or modification, of the relevant 'open skies' bilaterals, which allow the Gulf airlines unlimited capacity on routes to the US (the bilaterals reciprocally offer the same to the US airlines). From airlines faced with unexpectedly effective competition this cynical approach was little more than an attempt to further distort an already protective bilateral system.

Europe is still an important aviation region. But it is diminishing in importance and its position as one of the two leading world regions (with North America) has been surpassed by Asia Pacific. Moreover, it is clear from orders for widebody aircraft, the main agent of competition between the regions, that the future belongs to Asia Pacific and the Middle East. In this respect, Europe and North America are becoming 'also rans'.

That said, Europe is home to globally significant airlines and other aviation companies, and these players are anxious to participate in the growth offered by aviation markets to the east. The European Union's new Aviation Strategy document, published on 7-Dec-2015, recognises this: ""The EU aviation sector must be allowed to tap into the new growth markets where significant economic opportunities will be generated in the decades to come"".

However, all six associations representing Europe's aircraft operators issued a joint response calling for more specific and far-reaching remedies. In a rare display of unity, AEA, EBAA, EEA, ELFAA, ERA and IACA* said that that the strategy ""lacks ambition"". It certainly seems to duck some key issues.

Aviation in Europe has a PR problem, which is not helped by the fragmentation of industry representation. Efforts to consolidate representation have so far not yielded material results. Europe's five largest airlines are now attempting to seek common ground, prompted by the European Commission's consultation on a new aviation policy. However, they are avoiding obvious sticking points such as protectionism with regard to competition from Gulf-based airlines. By contrast, airport representation is unified in ACI Europe, which has also responded to the Commission with a liberal set of policy proposals.

Recent changes in the membership of Europe's main airline representative bodies have seen ELFAA become its biggest airline association, measured by its members' passenger numbers, ending the previous hegemony of AEA. IAG's legacy airlines defected from AEA to ELFAA due to differences of opinion over market liberalisation.

There has never been a greater need for a single voice on issues such as taxation and the infrastructure provision (both on the ground and in the air). Aviation needs to argue its case and more effectively promote its benefits to the public.",,N,,2025-11-03 21:16:40.019373

Develops new growth channel through Impact Jets' network of ~130 operators

Accelerates adoption by bringing verifiable, traceable SAF to private jet operators and travelers

HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / November 3, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today announced a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with Impact Jets, LLC (""Impact Jets""), a private aviation platform, to accelerate SAF adoption across the private jet market.

Under the MOU, Impact Jets is expected to launch a ""Powered by XCF SAF"" program to onboard private jet operators and clients into direct SAF purchasing through XCF. With access to Impact Jets' ~130 existing clients, XCF will supply the fuel, manage logistics, and provide verified documentation for operators and their end clients, ensuring traceability and measurable environmental impact.

This initiative is expected to bring XCF access to a premium customer segment and expand the reach of its fuel beyond commercial airline partners. With private jet operators known for rapid adoption of best-in-class, reputation-enhancing technologies, the rollout would position XCF at the forefront of sustainability within private aviation.

As part of the collaboration, ""Powered by XCF SAF"" is expected to be featured prominently on the Impact Jets digital platform, including homepage visibility and a dedicated SAF education hub. The companies will jointly launch awareness and promotional campaigns designed to stimulate sales and accelerate SAF adoption within the private aviation community.

Private Aviation: A High-Growth Market for SAF

The U.S. private jet market represents an attractive expansion opportunity for sustainable aviation fuel producers. The U.S. saw more than 3 million private flights in 2024, accounting for more than 40% of all global private jet activity, and burning an estimated 2 billion gallons of jet fuel. With general aviation responsible for roughly 8% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, or nearly 5.5 million gallons per day, the sector represents a meaningful and largely untapped market for SAF and XCF intends to be at the forefront.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Private aviation is an emerging frontier for SAF demand - a premium segment combining strong visibility with significant commercial potential. Working with Impact Jets would allow XCF to extend the reach of our fuel to a premium customer base that values both performance and purpose. We're not just delivering cleaner fuel; we're transforming the experience of private flight into one of leadership in sustainability.""

Rodney Rigg, Chief Executive Officer of Impact Jets, added:

""Partnering with XCF would enable us to offer verified, traceable SAF solutions that deliver real emissions reduction to our customers. Together, we intend to give our members and operators a clear, credible path to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining the performance and luxury they expect when flying private.""

The non-binding MOU reflects a shared vision to accelerate SAF adoption throughout the private aviation market. Execution is subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

by Cindy Tomei (SAFII/The Illinois Manufacturer) The Prairie State can claim a variety of unique qualities as its own: Illinois grows 95% of the processed pumpkins in the U.S., it’s the birthplace of the first skyscraper in 1885, and is the home of the Twinkie. While these little-known state facts may be entertaining, it is also becoming a leader in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry.

In recent years, SAF has increasingly entered the conversation, not only in aviation but also in agriculture, tax policy, biofuel use mandates, the reduction of greenhouse gases, and contributing to a diverse fuel supply. Illinois has been at the forefront of many of these issues as SAF production takes shape.

There are a few obvious attributes that make Illinois the ideal hub for the SAF supply chain. Most notably, the rich agricultural economy has a natural allure in bringing SAF producers to the state. According to data from the Illinois Economic Development Corporation (formerly Intersect Illinois), the state is the number one producer of soybeans, the number two producer of corn, and the number three producer of ethanol — all vital components of SAF feedstock.

It goes without saying that the state’s aviation infrastructure is one to be envied. O’Hare International Airport serves as the number one airport for domestic connectivity. By all accounts, Illinois’ infrastructure, which includes waterways, railroads, and its highway system, contributes to its attractiveness for the entire SAF supply chain.

...

Of note, several leaders in SAF are based within Illinois’ borders. Aether Fuels, Avina Clean Hydrogen, Inc., Crysalis, CES— Compressed Energy Systems, LanzaJet, and Marquis Sustainable Aviation Fuel call Illinois home.

Legislators have also demonstrated a commitment to SAF by passing a first-in-the-nation SAF tax incentive at the state level. The SAF Purchase Credit is designed to support and drive demand from air carriers. The SAFPC is a $1.50 credit per whole gallon of purchased SAF.

...

Lesser-known SAF leaders deserve equal mention. The Sustainable Aviation Fuels Institute (SAFII) focuses on bringing together all SAF stakeholders from around the globe to stay up to date on SAF developments such as tax credits, SAF usage mandates, economic implications, and feedstock updates. Most importantly, SAFII is an Approved Training Provider through ASTM International. ASTM is committed to serving global societal needs; its international standards positively impact public health and safety, consumer confidence, and overall quality of life. Its testing methods are universal in ensuring consistent quality fuel from the producer to the wing (astm.org).

...

SAFII’s team of experts has served on ASTM committees for decades and is recognized for their thought leadership and contribution to the development of industry-accepted testing methods. Every function in the jet fuel/SAF supply chain needs to know these testing standards as fuel moves along the chain of custody. Hands-on training on the testing methods includes fuel sampling on world-renowned, best-in-class testing equipment, manufactured right here in Illinois.

Coming in at 200 pages, the GGR review is a comprehensive review of the state of GGR in the UK, readiness of various GGR technologies, and barriers to scaling removals to deliver on the UK’s net zero ambitions.

What’s the background to the review?

In May 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) commissioned an independent review of GGRs to understand how different GGR options, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation, and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) can assist the UK in meeting its 2050 net zero target.

Removals are required to realise the ‘net’ in ‘net zero’ as even with significant emissions reductions across the economy, some industries will have residual emissions that are unable to be abated (e.g. emissions from ruminant agriculture). Removals help balance these emissions and limit the damaging impacts of climate chance.

The review was chaired by Dr. Alan Whitehead CBE, and was published in October 2025.

Chart and Map of UK GGR companies, according to GGR solution and staff size (2000-2024)

What does the Committee on Climate Change say about GGR?

The Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC’s) advice on the Seventh Carbon Budget recommends emissions be compensated on a source-sink symmetry basis – i.e. that biological emissions be balanced with biological removals, and fossil emissions be balanced with engineered (novel) removals, often with geological storage – currently limited to BECCS and DACCS.

In practice, this means that residual emissions pertaining to agriculture and land use will be compensated for through conventional CDR, primarily afforestation and grasslands, with -29.9MtCO2e of removals in 2050. Residual emissions from all other sectors, primarily aviation, will be compensated for through novel CDR methods, primarily BECCS, DACCS, biochar and enhanced rock weathering (ERW), with -35.8MtCO2e of removals in 2050.

What are the headline recommendations?

What GGR technologies does it recommend?

What are ‘low regret’ options for GGR deployment?

Who pays for GGRs?

Transitioning the UK to a net zero economy and society will incur costs, both to finance the transition, and lost revenues from phasing out emitting activities (e.g. fuel levies). A recent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) report estimates this to be £116 billion, over 25 years1. However, not reaching net zero also incurs costs, as the impacts of a warming world hit the economy. In a three-degree warming scenario, this is estimated to reduce GDP by 8% in 2070 and increase public sectoring borrowing to cover climate damages to over 4% of GDP. Taken together, the OBR report highlights that the costs of not achieving net zero outweigh the costs of achieving it, from a mitigation perspective. Costs and benefits associated from adaptation were not considered.

A key question the Review grappled with was who should provide the funding needed to support the deployment of GGRs in the UK. It considered financing in the context of the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS), the SAF mandate for aviation, the voluntary carbon market, and the potential for procuring GGRs internationally.

GGRs and the UK ETS

The government has previously indicated its intention to expand the coverage of the ETS to include energy from waste and domestic shipping, as well as include engineered removals. Decisions around woodland creation’s inclusion have not been taken but, as the Review notes, its inclusion would have issues, not least increasing misalignment between the EU ETS, with which negotiations to link the two schemes is ongoing.

Inclusion of GGRs in the ETS can provide financial incentive for their deployment at the level of the ETS price. However, without a significant increase in the ETS price, the government would be forced to ‘top up’ the payment to the costs of GGR deployment, given the current high costs of GGRs. Absent any alternative funding mechanism, this cost would be borne by the taxpayer.

The review notes that two policy options are available to avoid this – either constrain the supply of allowances sufficiently so that the gap between the ETS and GGR deployment prices are minimised, or employ a sub-mandate, whereby participating entitles are obliged to pay for an increasing fraction of GGR deployment over time. A buy-out price would also need to be set to ensure compliance with payment into the sub-mandate.

Aviation and the SAF Mandate

Aviation is projected to be the industry with the highest emissions in 2050. Under the CCC’s balanced pathway for net zero, it is assumed that aviation will pay for the removals necessary to balance their residual emissions, as SAF and demand-side abatement alone is insufficient to deliver net zero aviation. Given recent government decisions on airport expansions, the Review acknowledges that demand side reductions are increasingly unlikely, leaving GGR and SAF deployment the most viable policy options.

Currently, the SAF Mandate obliges suppliers of aviation fuels in the UK to include in their output a rising proportion of SAF, from 2% in 2025, to 22% in 2040. As SAF has lower emissions than kerosene, SAF represents an emissions saving, rather than actively reducing atmospheric emissions associated with aviation.

Given this, and the need to scale up the removals necessary to balance aviation emissions, the Review recommends expanding the SAF mandate to become a Net Zero Aviation Mandate, increasing the proportion of emissions to be addressed by SAF and GGRs combined. The Review views this as a means of reducing taxpayer liability for funding GGR deployment, avoiding competition for similar feedstock (in the case of biomass for BECCS and SAF) and, potentially, allowing for more cost-effective abatement, particularly where GGRs prove cheaper than SAF production.

What about sourcing GGRs internationally?

The CCC has consistently avoided recommending the usage of international mechanisms, such as carbon credits, to achieve the UK’s net zero ambitions, and the Review is no different. The Review finds that sourcing GGRs internationally carries significant risks and impacts, particularly around ensuring project integrity and the risks of impacting global fair burden sharing and the UK’s perceived international leadership on climate action.

However, the Review does find a potential role for international cooperation for DACCS, given its high deployment costs. Although the UK’s relatively clean electricity grid means it could produce DACC removals at a lower cost than other countries, in the longer term it may be the case that DACC removals become cheaper than in the UK, particularly in ‘sunbelt’ countries with high potential for solar energy generation. In these cases, it may be prudent to establish bilateral agreements for building GGR projects abroad, where the UK would secure access to lower cost DACC removals. The Review notes this should not be done at the expense of the UK’s current relative advantage in developing scaled GGR.

What about biomass?

A key debate in the GGR space is the role that biomass, particularly biomass utilised in BECCS, should play. BECCS deployment is limited by feedstock (input) availability, including waste feedstock, but also the growth of energy crops such as willow and miscanthus for BECCS. For the latter, this raises questions around land-use, with increased energy crop production reducing the amount of land available for other activities, such as food production or nature restoration. With current large-scale bioenergy plants in the UK running on imported forestry residues, shifting to energy crops is a live issue.

The Review takes a cautious approach to biomass feedstocks, emphasising the need for the UK to demonstrate leadership in sustainably sourcing biomass. To that end, the review calls for the publication of Defra’s Land Use Framework, to understand future land availability in England, and guide decision makers, from landowners to local councils, in making effective land use decisions. Additionally, the Review recommends limiting imported biomass as much as possible to reduce global land-use pressures.

What are the co-benefits of GGRs?

Greenhouse gas removals have a range of co-benefits, depending on the technology in question. The Review highlights a number of these.

Engineered removals can create economic activity and jobs, thereby contributing to the government’s growth objectives. This can happen throughout their lifecycle, from innovation, through operation, and the potential for their outputs (e.g. carbon dioxide) to be used in other industries and sectors. The Review estimates the global GGR market will be up to $1.2 trillion by 2050, with the UK well placed to capitalise on this opportunity, given its relatively well-developed policy on GGRs and storage potential in the North Sea. The Review highlights that these economic opportunities are largely concentrated in industrial centres for engineered removals, while land-based GGRs can lead to economic opportunity for rural areas, and represent new job opportunities to farmers in livestock agriculture or to rural workers.

GGRs can additionally provide access to low or zero-carbon energy in their deployment, via technologies like power BECCS (producing electricity from biomass while capturing and storing the carbon) or the generation of hydrogen or SAF with carbon capture.

For land-based GGRs, the Review highlights the contribution they can make to environmental objectives, such as enhanced flood resilience, improved soil health, biodiversity gains, erosion control, and physical and mental health benefits via access to nature. GGRs can therefore contribute to other government objectives, such as their Environmental Improvement Plan targets, while removing carbon from the atmosphere.

What next?

Key actions to lookout for mainly revolve around the degree to which the government accepts, acts on, or even acknowledges the recommendations contained within the report. Regardless, the report places additional pressure to follow through on already announced policy areas, such as the Land Use Framework, and the sustainable biomass framework consultation. The recommendations around the SAF mandate and aviation may prove more complicated in the context of the recent airport expansion announcements, although the government has approved these whilst remaining committed to net zero, increasing the need for direct mitigation of higher emissions.

Regardless, the challenge around responsibly scaling GGRs will not go away given the need to limit the damaging effects of climate change by reaching net zero. The question is how proactive the government will be in driving the agenda and realising the economic and wider benefits that investments in GGRs can provide.",https://ca1-eci.edcdn.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/carbon-dioxide-removal.jpg?v=1762185679,N,,2025-11-03 18:16:39.705426

For emerging climate technologies like low-carbon steel and DAC, the fund reports that catalysed emissions reductions could substantially exceed the direct reductions from individual projects.","In 2020, Microsoft launched an initiative it called the Climate Innovation Fund with the aim of kickstarting and scaling a huge portfolio of climate technology start-ups.

The fund formed part of Microsoft's medium-term sustainability strategy and it was announced alongside the firm's commitments to being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030.

The fund has adopted what it calls a ""market development flywheel"" approach, combining corporate investment with procurement commitments and technology support.

To date, this strategy has attracted an impressive US$12bn in follow-on capital across its portfolio companies, according to a newly published report which focuses on the lessons Microsoft has learned since the initiative began five years ago.

""Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in bold ideas and scalable technologies that drive real impact,"" says Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft.

Targeting hard-to-abate sectors

Much of the fund has been funnelled into areas where low-carbon alternatives remain scarce or are still commercially unproven.

One of these sectors has been steel production. In an effort to move the dial in this particularly heavy industry, Microsoft invested in Stegra's commercial-scale facility in Sweden, which uses green hydrogen-based direct reduced iron technology.

The plant aims to produce steel with up to 95% emissions reduction compared to traditional blast furnaces. Microsoft has paired this equity investment with some multi-year purchase agreements for suppliers to buy Stegra steel for data centre equipment.

There's also the aviation sector, where Microsoft has been backing the R&D around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Since funding opened, Microsoft has backed Twelve's carbon transformation technology as well as LanzaJet's alcohol-to-jet scheme.

In the same sector, Microsoft invested in a book-and-claim accounting model with Alaska Airlines that allowed the company to report lower emissions from SAF use without requiring physical delivery to specific flights.

First-of-a-kind project financing

The fund has also committed more than US$100m to what it calls ""first-of-a-kind"" projects. As the rubric suggests, these are nascent climate technologies that have been caught in limbo, facing financing challenges too large for venture capital but too risky for traditional infrastructure investors.

The team at Microsoft estimates that this gap typically ranges between US$100m-US$180m per project.

The company provided project finance for Climeworks' Orca plant, the world's first commercial direct air capture (DAC) facility, alongside a 10-year offtake agreement for 10,000 tons of CO₂.

In Nigeria, the fund backed Konexa's construction of renewable energy infrastructure linking Heineken's operations to clean power. That particular project has now been commissioned and aims to establish a replicable model for the country's renewable power sector.

Measuring catalytic impact

The Climate Innovation Fund has not been a case of scattergun investing. Microsoft has been determined to extract as much information from these investments as possible, evaluating the success and viability of projects for the benefit of future investments.

To this end, the Washington-based company has developed a framework alongside Rhodium Group that assesses both direct emissions reductions from invested projects and ""catalysed"" reductions from helping technologies reach cost parity with conventional alternatives.

For emerging climate technologies like low-carbon steel and DAC, the fund reports that catalysed emissions reductions could substantially exceed the direct reductions from individual projects.

Microsoft has acknowledged that the per-dollar emissions reductions from these early-stage investments tend to fall below those from more mature technologies like solar and wind, though it argues that this is a necessary part of the R&D process as it lays the groundwork for future markets and future solutions.

Geographic and social considerations

So far, about 19% of the fund's capital has been allocated to projects in the Global South, including a great deal of investments in energy access across Africa.

The fund backed CrossBoundary Access, which finances mini-grids across the continent, and invested in WaterEquity's initiatives that improve water and sanitation infrastructure across South and Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

And of all the start-ups in the fund's portfolio, 22% of the CEOs and founders are women, while 21% come from underrepresented backgrounds.

""Our goal isn’t just to become more sustainable but also to help every organisation in Africa and the world to do the same,"" says Lillian Barnard, Microsoft's Chief of Enterprise Partners for the Middle East and Africa.

Why Microsoft sees AI as the key to climate innovations

As Microsoft has become more involved with AI, so too has the fund. The project has increasingly incorporated AI into its investment strategy, with the team describing the technology as an ""innovation amplifier"".

Some recent investments on this front include Vibrant Planet, a company that uses AI-powered geospatial analytics to detect and reduce the risks of wildfires. Another is Terradot, a start-up that applies AI to enhanced rock weathering – a novel way of removing carbon from the atmosphere.

These investments in particular speak to the philosophical direction that Microsoft has been going in over the past few years. The company believes that AI's ability to measure, predict and optimise complex systems is going to be essential in the fight against climate change.

The problem is that, for now at least, AI is the single fastest growing source of carbon emissions in Microsoft's entire value chain. The firm's leadership hopes that the benefits it imparts will outweigh the issues it creates in the long run.

As aviation accelerates towards net-zero, one message has become unmistakably clear — no company can decarbonise alone. Airlines, airports, fuel producers, freight forwarders, shippers, and technology providers are increasingly coming together to tackle one of logistics’ greatest challenges: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from air cargo.

Airports as innovation hubs

Among the airports leading this transition is Edmonton International Airport (YEG), which has positioned itself as a hub for hydrogen and clean aviation technologies. Earlier this year, YEG joined H2CanFly, a pan-Canadian consortium advancing hydrogen-powered flight and supporting infrastructure.

“As Canada’s first airport-based hydrogen hub, YEG is helping test scalable solutions that could shape net-zero aviation,” said Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Director of ESG & Sustainability Strategy at YEG.

YEG’s decarbonisation efforts extend beyond aircraft fuel. The airport is piloting Diesel Tech Industries’ Guardian Hydrogen Diesel System on heavy-duty runway sweepers and expanding its hydrogen-powered ground vehicle fleet. It is also supporting ShipAlberta, a digital logistics platform connecting small businesses to global markets — reinforcing its commitment to link economic growth with environmental responsibility.

Data-driven sustainability and partnerships

Chivot-Legris said that partnerships and data-driven innovation form the foundation of the airport’s climate roadmap.

“We joined the Net-Zero Challenge by the Government of Canada in 2022, and we're now a proud bronze participant,” she explained. “That partnership with the government helps us navigate the challenging journey of identifying pathways to reach net-zero by 2050.”

“As Canada’s first airport-based hydrogen hub, YEG is helping test scalable solutions that could shape net-zero aviation.”

Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Edmonton International Airport (YEG)

She stressed the need for close collaboration with governments, academia, and industry to explore clean technologies, assess climate risks, and empower airports to take ownership of their sustainability goals.

“As part of H2CanFly, we aim to accelerate both infrastructure and aircraft technology development to make hydrogen aviation a reality,” Chivot-Legris added.

With 60% of Canada’s hydrogen produced in the Edmonton metro region, YEG is ideally positioned to serve as a testbed for hydrogen applications in aviation. The airport is collaborating with Airbus, CAE, and the National Research Council of Canada to advance hydrogen-powered flight over the next two decades.

SAF and circular collaboration

Beyond hydrogen, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains the most immediate lever for aviation decarbonisation — and partnerships are key to scaling it.

In a South American first, Avianca Cargo, The Queen’s Flowers, and Repsol completed the region’s first SAF Book & Claim operation, offsetting emissions equivalent to over 6,000 gallons of jet fuel on a Bogotá–Miami cargo flight. Using the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) framework, the initiative allows verified emissions reductions to be claimed even when SAF is not physically available at every airport — a model proving that collaboration and certification can make cleaner aviation globally viable.

In Europe, DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz have set a new benchmark through their largest-ever SAF deal, purchasing 13,000 tonnes of fuel to reduce 40,000 tonnes of CO₂ on flights between Frankfurt, Beijing, and Shanghai. “Collaborative efforts like this demonstrate how shippers can play a direct role in decarbonising aviation,” said a company spokesperson.

Similarly, Cargolux, AIT Worldwide Logistics, and Microsoft have launched a three-year SAF partnership to transport server racks for Microsoft Cloud Logistics, targeting 66,000 tonnes of CO₂ savings.

Operational efficiency and forwarder collaboration

“Partnerships are extremely important in general for air cargo, but especially in sustainability,” said Anna-Maria Kirchner, Head of Global Sales at Finnair Cargo.

Kirchner emphasised that collaboration across the value chain — from fuel producers to freight forwarders — is vital for meaningful progress. Finnair Cargo works closely with forwarder partners to optimise routes, reduce cancellations, and maximise aircraft load factors. “The fuller a plane is, the less we are wasting any fuel — and that makes operations far more sustainable,” she explained.

Beyond operations, Finnair Cargo also partners with SAF suppliers, hosting educational seminars and joint initiatives to accelerate adoption. “All of this can only be done as a team sport,” she added. “Everyone — from airlines and airports to fuel suppliers, shippers, and even IT companies — plays a crucial role in making flying more sustainable.”

Forwarders driving measurable results

Partnerships between carriers and logistics providers are also producing tangible emission reductions. Avia Solutions Group, in collaboration with DHL Express, achieved a 12.61% emissions reduction (30.6 tonnes) between January and April 2025 through DHL’s GoGreen Plus service, powered by SAF supplied by bp and Neste.

On the supply side, Neste has ramped up production at its Rotterdam refinery to 1.5 million tonnes annually, with plans to reach 2.2 million tonnes by 2027. Meanwhile, Amazon Air signed an agreement with Neste to supply 7,500 tonnes of SAF for operations at San Francisco International Airport and Ontario International Airport, marking Ontario’s first use of SAF.

Energy innovation and the future of SAF

While SAF remains costlier than conventional jet fuel, industry experts agree it is indispensable to achieving net-zero goals. Broader collaboration — including new entrants, hydrogen development, and circular logistics — is essential to scaling impact.

According to Boeing’s World Air Cargo Forecast, the air cargo market is expected to grow 4.0% annually through 2043, with the global freighter fleet reaching 3,900 aircraft. Freighters are projected to handle over half of total air cargo traffic, while express carriers will account for around 25%. Rapidly growing corridors such as South Asia–East Asia, Domestic India, and Africa–East Asia — each expected to expand around 7% annually — present both opportunities and sustainability challenges.

“For me, nuclear is an important component of the future in terms of power generation to enable the production of SAF.”

Richard Forson, Cargolux

“We need more and more airlines to embark on their sustainability journey. We need more and more corporate customers to reach agreements with airlines to buy SAF and reduce their CO₂ footprint,” said Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and Fuel Efficiency at Airbus, in a video by Neste.

Nuclear power and long-term solutions

In an interview with The STAT Trade Times at transport logistic and air cargo Europe 2025 in Munich, Richard Forson, CEO of Cargolux, highlighted a longer-term perspective — the potential role of nuclear power in producing SAF sustainably.

“I see Microsoft and Google investing in restarting nuclear power plants,” Forson said. “For me, nuclear is an important component of the future in terms of power generation to enable the production of SAF.”

He mentioned that the growing energy needs of data centres cannot be met by wind or solar alone, while coal and gas face strong resistance. “Nuclear, for me, is the answer for these data centres because of the power needed to cool the equipment running inside,” he added.

Forson believes that while nuclear energy is a long-term enabler, the immediate path forward lies in collaboration and innovation. “The immediate option could be to bring in new players, enable more collaborations, and develop new technologies to produce SAF more sustainably,” he said.

The power of collaboration

From hydrogen and SAF to digital platforms and data sharing, the common denominator is clear — partnerships are no longer optional; they are essential.

By aligning incentives, sharing technologies, and coordinating strategies, airlines, shippers, fuel producers, and airports are proving that emissions reductions can be measurable, scalable, and economically viable.

The air cargo industry’s sustainability journey is a collective one — and as Forson, Kirchner, and Chivot-Legris all demonstrate — collaborative innovation remains its most powerful engine for change.

Docket ID No: EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0186

Introduction

Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider and remove program obligations for most source categories under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and suspend program obligations for other sources until reporting year 2034.

Business Roundtable remains concerned by the growing risks from global climate change, including significant economic risks (e.g., technological and market shifts and regulatory and policy risks). Business Roundtable member companies are leading by example, developing and deploying ambitious emissions reduction plans, and exporting innovative technologies that will help lower emissions in the United States and globally, while simultaneously spurring innovation, manufacturing and economic growth. Business Roundtable looks forward to helping advance policies that leverage U.S. leadership, competitiveness and innovation to mitigate the impacts of global climate change while growing our economy.

Business Roundtable welcomes the Administration’s commitment to addressing burdensome regulations, including paperwork and reporting burdens. However, we are concerned that a sudden change to the current program could result in piecemeal, duplicative, incomplete and more burdensome greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting obligations for U.S. companies that also disadvantage them globally. We urge EPA to carefully consider options that would allow the GHGRP reporting framework to continue so that it is not inadvertently recreated at an even greater expense to U.S. business in a scattershot, non-uniform way via other state and foreign governmental avenues. We also urge the agency to hear from stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the agency’s actions and take the necessary steps to coordinate across federal agencies that would also face impacts from the proposal.

GHGRP Data is a Critical Tool for Various Reporting, Disclosure and Compliance Obligations

The GHGRP provides standardized, facility-level emissions data that U.S. companies have relied on for effective regulatory enforcement, tax credit administration, international trade compliance and voluntary disclosures. The proposed changes risk fragmenting emissions reporting across the U.S. economy, introducing regulatory uncertainty and upending an existing process for international trade compliance, particularly for U.S. exports. The comprehensive data set that GHGRP provides, including current emissions levels and historical trends, is also important for helping to prevent ill-informed policies from being adopted.

GHGRP data is central to the administration of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).2 Under current IRS rules, CO₂ injected into secure geologic storage qualifies only if verified under Subpart RR with an EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plan. Removing this pathway would potentially jeopardize sequestration projects, create regulatory uncertainty and chill investment. This would undermine the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that preserved 45Q and increased the value of the credit in some circumstances. At a minimum, elimination of GHGRP will require the IRS to amend its regulations to require new monitoring, reporting and verification protocols—prior to EPA finalizing this rule. Timing is of the essence to ensure the left hand is aware of the right hand’s actions, such that a gap between changes does not undermine investments in major infrastructure projects, including projects based on 45Q credits that taxpayers are relying on in the 2025 tax year.

Other credits such as 45V (clean hydrogen), 40B (sustainable aviation fuel), 45Z (clean fuel production credit) and 48C (advanced energy projects credit) rely on emissions factors from Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model,3 which uses this federally verified GHGRP data as a key input. It is unclear how this data can be replicated in a cost effective or timely way should EPA remove GHGRP obligations, thus creating uncertainty for past, current and future investment decisions relying on these credits. Again, if EPA were to move forward with a final rule that prevents companies from utilizing GHGRP data to claim inextricably linked federal tax credits, Business Roundtable would encourage ample time be afforded to stakeholder engagement to build consensus with private businesses that have relied on U.S. tax policies enacted and sustained with bipartisan support in Congress, which could be abruptly undermined if EPA does not engage across government agencies, particularly with the Department of Treasury in this instance.

Elimination of GHGRP Likely Will Result in Piecemeal Reporting Obligations That Are Incompatible, Incomplete and More Expensive

GHGRP provides a trusted dataset used by state regulators and private companies. If GHGRP obligations were to cease, some states can be expected to step into the void and promulgate their own data collection and reporting obligations. These new requirements, adopted on a piecemeal state-level basis, are at significant risk of becoming inconsistent, creating a cumbersome, balkanized and more expensive reporting obligation for companies subject to the requirements than if the current GHGRP were to continue as is.

EPA estimates the total cost of reporting to be $303 million per year, with subpart W reporting accounting for $256 million of the annual costs.4 Under EPA’s proposed rule, subpart W companies would be relieved of their reporting obligations until 2034.

Companies that are subject to GHGRP have made the necessary investments to monitor emissions, and capture and report the required data. One-time hardware and software investments and employee training necessary to be able to report the data required by GHGRP far exceed on-going costs associated with the program. While on-going reporting costs are not inconsequential, we would expect them to be significantly less than the costs that would be incurred by businesses if they are required to recreate and comply with differing monitoring and reporting obligations likely to emerge at the state and international level if GHGRP were to end. This fragmented reporting system would in turn result in higher costs and less data consistency than if the current GHGRP was left in place. Simply put, the result of the repeal of the GHGRP will be to impose costs that are likely to far exceed the estimated savings associated with repealing the current program in exchange for a sub-optimal, inconsistent, fragmented reporting system.

U.S. Competitiveness in Foreign Markets Would be Undermined

U.S. exports of energy-intensive products would be disadvantaged under the proposed rule. Data transparency provides the backbone of the U.S. competitive position on energy dominance. Credible and verified GHGRP data is vital for U.S. competitiveness in global markets, especially with the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), low carbon fuel (LCF) and methane regulations. Without federally verified GHGRP data, U.S. exporters may face default emissions penalties, higher compliance costs and loss of market access. The United States is Europe’s largest Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplier and a major oil exporter to these markets. Moreover, without the GHGRP data to demonstrate our manufacturing emissions profile, the United States may end up with a higher default value under CBAM, thereby undermining U.S. competitiveness in Europe. The net result of eliminating GHGRP could inadvertently harm U.S. competitiveness by weakening exports and run counter to the President’s “Energy Dominance” agenda.

EPA Should Maintain GHGRP as a Voluntary Program if it Determines the Clean Air Act (CAA) Cannot Legally Support a Mandatory Program

In its proposal, EPA indicated that it “considered the alternative of transitioning the GHGRP from mandatory to voluntary reporting” but ultimately rejected this option because it “could also result in submittal of incomplete or piecemeal reports, and the verification and accuracy of the data submitted would be limited.”5 EPA also concludes that “maintaining continuous or intermittent reporting under any of these source categories, including voluntary reporting, is inconsistent with CAA section 114 (emphasis added).”6

Business Roundtable believes EPA’s authority to administer a voluntary program is consistent with section 114. CAA section 114 allows EPA to collect emissions information for GHGs as the CAA contains an underlying statutory purpose to reduce “air pollutants” that can potentially be regulated under the CAA. EPA recently acknowledged its authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA, even if it declines to exercise such authority in the proposed rescission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding (“’Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate’” GHG emissions,7 quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in AEP v. Connecticut “The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.”).8

Business Roundtable maintains that EPA has the legal authority to regulate GHG emissions if it makes the requisite findings and closely hews any regulatory response to the limitations of the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. EPA9 the Court determined that GHGs are covered by the CAA’s section 302(g) definition of “air pollutant,” and that therefore EPA can impose regulations of GHG emissions once the EPA makes the requisite findings under the CAA. Neither UARG v. EPA10 nor West Virginia v. EPA,11 two cases that struck down EPA’s expansive claims of authority to regulated GHGs, disturbed this central finding.

Although EPA asserts that “since 2011 [the EPA] has not used most of the information collected to carry out other provisions under the CAA”12, EPA can potentially use this information for regulation of GHGs. GHGRP supplies the data necessary for informed decision-making for deciding whether, when and how to regulate GHGs. Accordingly, we believe EPA retains the authority to regulate GHGs and as a corollary, to allow voluntary data collection efforts to inform the agency’s future regulatory efforts.

If EPA is concerned about incomplete data, it may still establish minimum standards for voluntary participation, and we encourage it to do so if it chooses to maintain a voluntary program.

EPA has experience with voluntary programs, including programs directly associated with greenhouse gas emissions.13 Retaining GHGRP as a voluntary program should not be unduly burdensome, nor is it inconsistent with EPA’s legal views regarding the limitations of section 114. Moreover, retention of GHGRP in some form will avoid the multiple rulemakings, inconsistent reporting obligations and international trade and regulatory uncertainty that will result if GHGRP is repealed.

Business Roundtable remains committed to working with the Administration to provide the certainty and predictability that American businesses need to thrive and compete, including by ensuring access to reliable, affordable energy.

Washington, DC, Nov. 3, 2025 – As leaders around the globe prepare to congregate and discuss pressing climate change issues at COP30 in Brazil this November, business aviation stands ready with the industry’s most effective solution for emissions reductions in air travel: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Business aviation is committed to leading climate action and championing sustainability by pioneering the use of SAF. Our sector has been at the forefront of SAF adoption, driving both physical uplift and the development of book-and-claim systems that strategically expand SAF’s reach and impact globally.

Business aviation’s access to SAF is now unprecedented with over 100 FBOs worldwide offering direct uplift, while the robust book-and-claim process provides critical, proven options to effectively address emissions and promote investment directly into future SAF production.

These industry-wide advancements are backed by the Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a partnership of over 20 leading companies and key trade associations, including the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), dedicated to scaling SAF.

The coalition strongly encourages aircraft operators globally to contact their fuel providers, FBOs, and sustainability advisors to identify SAF options — especially for flights en route to Belém, Brazil, for COP30 — and for all future missions.

Scientists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are making it possible, converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that could help the aviation industry cut carbon emissions.

The team uses hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that mimics how crude oil forms in nature. Wet food waste is exposed to high heat and pressure, producing a “biocrude” oil. This oil is then refined using catalysts to remove oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, resulting in a fuel that meets ASTM and FAA standards for commercial aircraft.

“Food waste is an untapped resource,” said Professor Yuanhui Zhang, lead researcher.

We’re turning something that would release greenhouse gases in landfills into drop-in jet fuel.

The stakes are high. Aviation accounts for a growing share of global emissions, and roughly 30% of food produced worldwide is wasted, often ending up in landfills as methane. Converting this waste into fuel tackles emissions while creating renewable energy.

Challenges remain. Lab-scale production yields are currently modest, and scaling up will require efficient waste collection, industrial refining, and economic feasibility. The researchers stress that partnerships with the aviation industry will be key to bringing this technology to airports worldwide.

Beyond aviation, the process could turn other wet biomass, like algae, sewage sludge, or agricultural residues, into fuels or industrial chemicals, supporting a circular bioeconomy.

“This isn’t a magic solution,” Zhang added. “But it’s a step toward turning waste into value and flights into cleaner skies.”

The UK is moving too slowly in its efforts to decarbonize aviation, a sector responsible for a significant portion of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s think tank has warned that the government must accelerate its efforts to cut aviation emissions in order to meet net-zero targets. This is the third time in 2023 that Blair has spoken out about the UK’s green policies, highlighting the urgent need for cleaner fuel alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

Aviation Emissions and the Climate Crisis

Aviation accounted for around 7% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, equivalent to 29.6 million tons of CO2. The Climate Change Committee forecasts that aviation’s share will increase to 11% by the end of this decade and up to 16% by 2035. This trend presents a significant challenge to the UK’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and meeting international climate targets.

In a recent report, Blair’s think tank, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI), pointed out that while governments are mandating the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the coming years, the production of SAF is not progressing fast enough to meet the urgent demands of decarbonizing aviation.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF is a cleaner alternative to conventional jet fuel and can be produced from various feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and even algae. It has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions when blended with traditional jet fuel. SAF is seen as a key part of the strategy to decarbonize aviation, a sector that remains one of the hardest to decarbonize due to its reliance on jet fuel for long-haul flights.

Currently, the UK government has set a target for SAF to account for 40% of jet fuel usage by 2040, up from just 2% in 2025. However, the TBI has warned that while the early stages of SAF usage will help reduce emissions, a significant portion of global and domestic flights will still rely on conventional jet fuel in the coming decades.

Slow Progress and the Need for Urgency

Despite the growing global push for greener aviation, the pace of SAF production in the UK has been slower than expected. The UK government’s current efforts to expand airport capacity, including the planned expansion of Heathrow, could clash with its legally binding emission limits. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has emphasized the importance of SAF to ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of the UK’s climate goals.

Blair’s think tank argues that the UK must invest more in SAF production to meet these ambitious targets. While some progress has been made, including the allocation of £63 million in government funding to scale up domestic SAF production, much more needs to be done. According to the TBI, the government should also explore ways to integrate carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures into the SAF production process to further reduce emissions.

A Global Problem: Aviation’s Impact on Climate

Aviation emissions are not just a national issue for the UK but a global challenge. As air travel grows around the world, especially in developing regions, the demand for cleaner alternatives to jet fuel will increase. Governments must collaborate to create a global framework for SAF production and distribution to ensure that the aviation sector can meet future emissions reduction targets.

The Role of SAF in Net-Zero Aviation

The UK government remains committed to its SAF mandate, but as the TBI report highlights, this commitment needs to be accompanied by faster action. According to a Department for Transport spokesperson, the government is seeing “encouraging early signs” in meeting the SAF mandate and believes that SAF is a key part of the global effort to decarbonize aviation.

However, the TBI urges policymakers to go further. It suggests that the financial responsibility for carbon dioxide removal plans should fall on the aviation industry, which is best positioned to afford such measures. The government should continue to support the growth of SAF production but must also ensure that sufficient financial incentives are in place to encourage faster development.

Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Net-Zero Aviation

The UK faces a tough challenge in reducing aviation emissions, but with the right investments and policy changes, it can achieve its climate goals. Tony Blair’s think tank has made it clear that faster action on sustainable aviation fuels is crucial for meeting net-zero targets. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. The government, along with private sector stakeholders, must work together to accelerate the production of SAF, reduce the industry’s carbon footprint, and ensure that aviation becomes a cleaner and more sustainable mode of travel in the coming decades.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UK-Airlines.jpeg,N,,2025-11-03 16:56:23.813691

A recently unveiled system from Honeywell, a conglomerate corporation headquartered in the United States, can convert agricultural and forestry byproducts into ready-to-use renewable fuels through an innovative Biocrude Upgrading process. This approach transforms waste biomass into sustainable alternatives for marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel and gasoline, delivering higher energy density than many existing biofuels and enabling ships and aircraft to transition without costly engine modifications.

The technology’s modular, prefabricated design also simplifies deployment and reduces investment risk, addressing one of the biggest barriers to decarbonisation in aviation and shipping, long-standing infrastructure “lock-in” that has kept these sectors dependent on high-carbon fuels for decades. The Renewable Energy Institute supports such innovations across the renewable energy sector, recognising their vital role in accelerating the global transition towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

Shipping and aviation are among the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, together responsible for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a share that continues to grow as global trade expands and air travel becomes more accessible. Despite major efficiency gains since the 1960s, aviation emissions have quadrupled and rising incomes worldwide are expected to drive demand for both flights and freight. However, a breakthrough in biofuel technology could offer a promising long-range, low-carbon alternative for these industries.

Maritime shipping still depends heavily on bunker oil, the world’s second dirtiest fossil fuel after coal, and if the industry were a country, it would rank as the sixth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to the US Department of Energy. Like aviation, shipping faces major decarbonisation challenges due to its need for highly energy-dense fuels to power heavy loads over long distances with limited refueling opportunities. While biomass has so far been an impractical substitute given the shortage of waste oil feedstocks, emerging advances in producing biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural residues are opening new possibilities for cleaner alternatives.

Developing biofuels that are both practical and affordable is essential to driving meaningful change in the shipping and aviation sectors. As Ken West, president of Energy and Sustainability Solutions, noted in Interesting Engineering, the maritime industry urgently needs renewable fuels that are readily available and economically viable. The new Biocrude Upgrading technology meets this demand by converting waste biomass into high-density fuels while offering systems that reduce costs from installation through refining and use, making the transition to cleaner fuels far more accessible.

While the biofuels industry has experienced several strong growth years, its future momentum will depend on supportive trade and policy environments. Continued collaboration and open trade with key partners such as Canada, an important supplier of agricultural and forestry feedstocks, will be vital to scaling such technologies. The sector remains sensitive to shifts in government fuel standards and trade policies, which could either accelerate or hinder progress towards a lower-carbon future.

The Renewable Energy Institute plays a crucial role in advancing innovation across the renewable energy landscape by providing accredited training and professional development opportunities for individuals and organisations worldwide. By fostering education and collaboration across industries, the Institute helps ensure that breakthroughs are supported by a skilled workforce capable of driving the global shift to a sustainable energy future.

Coulson SafeFuel is the world’s first patented onboard fuel-quality assurance and protection system. It continuously analyzes the product during refueling, detecting contamination or chemical degradation in real-time, preventing unsafe fuel from ever reaching the tanks.

The innovation comes amid growing safety concerns following multiple fuel-related incidents in military and commercial aviation, and recent Navy aircraft accidents under investigation.

Coulson Aviation’s aircraft often operate in remote environments around the world, where the risk of contaminated or off-spec fuel is heightened. Over years of operations, the company has encountered issues ranging from water-laden Jet A and microbial growth to cross-contamination, while the industry has seen increased fuel issues, including contamination from DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) and SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer) from aging filter separators. One such incident resulted in one of Coulson’s jets having an engine flameout during an overwater ferry flight, a near-disaster that underscored the absence of onboard fuel technology across aviation.

Developed and patented by Coulson’s in-house team, SafeFuel integrates directly into an aircraft’s single-point refueling manifold and analyzes fuel during refueling. The system verifies key parameters in real time and automatically notifies the flight crew and can halt fueling if contamination or out-of-spec readings are detected before fuel reaches the tanks. Each fueling is digitally recorded, providing traceability and a verifiable chain of custody for operators, OEMs, and regulators.

“We’ve spent decades designing aircraft to survive any emergency, but none of that matters if the fuel itself isn’t safe,” said Britt Coulson, President & COO of Coulson Aviation. “As the industry transitions to Sustainable Aviation Fuels and complex global supply chains, the risks multiply and even small deviations can have catastrophic consequences. When only a few gallons of off-spec fuel can bring down a $100 million aircraft, it’s time for aviation to recognize that fuel is the final unmonitored frontier. SafeFuel closes that gap permanently.”

The CEO of Growth Energy says expanding domestic sustainable aviation fuel production could help support the down ag economy.

Emily Skor says growth in the low-carbon fuel market could help boost corn demand.

“We are one of the few commodities that has the volume to be able to satisfy the needs of that market,” she says.

She tells Brownfield the extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a good start, but, “We should be paying farmers more down the road for every bushel of low carbon we purchase. The next step on the policy front is making sure that the Treasury Department connects the dots, so that we give full credit to farmer innovation.

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively.
SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy. SAFCo is set up as a non-profit Company Limited by Guarantee wholly owned by CAAS. Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s Board. Ms Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding Chief Executive Officer.

The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 14 October 2025, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a SAF Levy, to set up a SAF Fund and to procure, manage and allocate SAF andSAF environmental attributes (EAs) or to establish and appoint a central procurement entity to carry out these functions. More details on the SAF Levy amounts will be shared later.

Through SAFCo, CAAS seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF:

a) SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF Fund to achieve the 1% SAF target in 2026, for flights departing Singapore. The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3–5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA. With predictable cashflows from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively. The demand from the SAF Levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements. Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale. They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation, ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026. SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy. SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner SAFCo and use its central procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases. Conversations are ongoing; SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February next year.

SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region. With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still nascent SAF market. This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS and Chairman of SAFCo said, “Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector. The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF Levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

Ms Tan Seow Hui, Chief Executive Officer of SAFCo said, “I am honoured to lead SAFCo at this pivotal stage. My priority will be to put in place credible and scalable frameworks, partnerships and processes to ensure that SAFCo delivers on its mandate to aggregate demand, procure SAF efficiently, and manage SAF EAs transparently. By working closely with airlines, businesses and suppliers, we aim to facilitate greater SAF adoption in the region and contribute to the decarbonisation of aviation.”",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-6.png,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:10.491433

Following the Prime Minister’s meeting with Vietnam’s General Secretary yesterday, VietJet has announced a significant order for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft.

The Transport Secretary visited Airbus’ site in Bristol lawst week to mark the order and see how this will allow Airbus to continue investing in research and development.

Overall, the deal supports Airbus’ 79,000 strong supply chain and 12,000 employees across the country, with Airbus estimated to bring £5.3 billion to the economy each year.

The wings for 100 aircraft will be manufactured at Airbus’ Broughton site in North Wales, with their design developed at the company’s Filton facility, showing a strong pipeline from concept to reality delivered from the UK. This programme will safeguard highly skilled jobs across both regions, supporting delivery of the Plan for Change.

The deal comes alongside further investment from Vietjet into the UK aviation sector, with Vietjet and Rolls Royce signing a deal for 92 Trent 7000 engines to be manufactured in the UK for use in 40 A330 Neos, also set to support thousands of high-skilled jobs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “This landmark deal shows that British innovation continues to be at the forefront in connecting the world.

“By working hand-in-hand with our international partners, we are helping our aerospace sector soar, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs, boosting our economy, and delivering real benefits for working people across the UK as part of our Plan for Change.”

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “This major investment from VietJet is a big vote of confidence in British aerospace and engineering, and will support jobs across the country to deliver our Plan for Change.

“Homegrown research and development is vital to our net zero ambitions and I’m delighted that this order will encourage investment back into aviation innovation – helping us to continue as a global leader in the industry.”

The Government is also supporting sectors such as aviation with major investments to encourage innovation, including £20.4 billion for research and development across the UK until April 2026.

Further funding to support aviation innovation was also announced over the summer, with £63 million to encourage the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels, and £4 million allocated to grassroots research projects trialling next-generation drone technology.

These investments have been echoed by strong industry support, with energy logistics firm Exolum recently announcing the creation of a brand-new Sustainable Aviation Fuel supply network, starting with a fuel blending facility in Portishead, just outside Bristol.

The Government is supporting airport expansion at Gatwick and Luton – where capacity upgrades have been approved – and Heathrow. The moves support the Government’s growth mission and any expansion will be balanced with environmental, climate and air quality aims.

By encouraging investment that feeds back into innovation, such as VietJet’s order, aviation can take advantage of cleaner, greener technology to reduce it’s carbon footprint and expand airports responsibly.",,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:16.025445

The future of sustainable aviation fuel - Circular Online,Not Available,,,,,https://www.circularonline.co.uk/features/turbulence-ahead-the-future-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel/,"Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to slash emissions from aviation and create a market for waste that cannot be recycled.
This is where sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) comes in.
It’s important to bear in mind, however, that SAF is only sustainable if it’s made from a sustainable feedstock.
The word sustainable means different things to different people – for example, is growing so-called ‘energy crops’ that are destined for SAF production, sustainable?
While numerous SAF production facilities have been announced, current production is less than 1% of the 400 billion litres required annually by 2050.","Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to slash emissions from aviation and create a market for waste that cannot be recycled. Ian Farrell asks what’s the catch?

Aviation is a highly carbon-intense activity, but only makes up 2.5% of the world’s CO2 emissions. That sounds like a contradiction, until we factor in an important statistic: it is estimated that only 10% of the world’s population fly.

As incomes and living standards rise, however, so will this figure. Social mobility in countries such as India and China will undoubtedly mean a rise in passenger aviation, while imports mean an increase in freight flights, too.

To add to the problem, while aviation only contributes 2.5% of CO2 emissions, it is responsible for 4% of anthropological global temperature change, thanks to emissions of soot and water vapour, sulphur aerosols and contrails. Some of these heat the planet; others cool it – but the net effect is one of warming.

The aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 looks like a difficult one to achieve. Other carbon-intensive activities are gradually being replaced or refined to make them less polluting – for example, the electrification of automobiles, and the rise in solar and wind farms. But aviation is much harder to decarbonise.

The energy density of hydrocarbon jet fuel is hard to match, especially with current approaches to electrification. There is a lot of research happening in the field of hydrogen-powered aircraft, but this will take time and require the replacement of perfectly serviceable aircraft that cost hundreds of millions of dollars each.

What’s needed in the meantime is a stop-gap solution that can be ‘dropped in’ to existing aviation-fuel infrastructures, enabling the industry to use existing equipment more sustainably while new technology is brought to market. This is where sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) comes in.

Blending fuels together

SAF is virtually identical to the JET-A1-grade kerosene fuel obtained by refining crude oil, except it comes from different sources that are part of a circular closed-loop cycle. At the moment, SAF is blended with JET-A1 up to a maximum 50% mix.

Both fuels are a mixture of hydrocarbon fuel molecules, but JET-A1 also contains aromatic (cyclic) molecules. These have a lubricating role in engines, but are costly to synthesise by themselves, so they are added by blending together SAF and JET-A1.

Eventually, 100% SAF flights will happen – test flights across the Atlantic have already taken place – but modifications to engines and fuel pumps will need to be made first.

SAF can be produced by a number of industrial processes, but the original starting materials are often organic waste. This could be waste oils and fats from food manufacturing, municipal food waste, agricultural by-products and waste, forestry residues, and animal slurries. Even the CO2 from carbon-capture processes can be used in SAF manufacture.

Currently, the most popular way of making SAF is from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids – the so-called HEFA process. These waste materials are first treated with hydrogen to remove oxygen, which breaks them down into hydrocarbon chains. These are then chemically reacted to produce SAF. This process saves around three-quarters of the carbon emissions from fossil jet fuel and is already certified for use in a 50% blend on commercial flights.

The HEFA pathway is currently the only fully commercialised method, and will probably supply the majority of SAF until 2030. However, there is a naturally limited amount of available feedstock for it. Clearly, other processes are needed.

An alternative is to use the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process – an old piece of organic chemistry that is used extensively in the chemical industry – to convert syngas into fuel. Syngas (which gets its name from synthesis gas) is formed from biomass, including municipal solid waste, agricultural wastes, forest wastes, wood, and energy crops. Johnson Matthey is one of the companies taking this forward, with its HyCOgen process, which uses bespoke catalysts to do the necessary chemistry. SAF made in this way can also be blended up to 50% with fossil-derived fuel.

A third option is alcohol-to-jet chemistry. This involves the conversion of cellulosic or starchy alcohols (usually ethanol and isobutanol) through a series of chemical reactions. The alcohols are derived from cellulosic or starchy feedstocks via fermentation or gasification reactions.

In total, there are eight certified processes for making SAF and more will surely emerge as research continues. It’s important to bear in mind, however, that SAF is only sustainable if it’s made from a sustainable feedstock.

The word sustainable means different things to different people – for example, is growing so-called ‘energy crops’ that are destined for SAF production, sustainable? Some would say ‘yes’, as they take CO2 from the air, which is then put back again when the fuel is burned – a closed system.

Others point out that there is more than climate change at play here: land use, biodiversity, water use and food security also need to be taken into account. Deforestation, to make space to grow energy crops, is obviously extremely unfavourable.

The waste industry, however, can provide exactly what SAF production needs, in the form of solid municipal waste.

Harder than it looks

It’s not time to enjoy guilt-free sustainable flying just yet, however. Getting the right waste to where it needs to be for SAF production is not as easy as you might think.

Although multiple biomass feedstocks can be used by gasification-based technologies, the supply chain for used cooking oil and animal fat, as well as forest and agricultural residues, is not well established.

Additionally, the low-energy density of forest residues makes it uneconomical to transport them long distances to a refinery. Unless supply chains are developed with intermediate densification (such as pellets or bio-oils), large-scale SAF facilities could be difficult to establish.

All this will require considerable investment and innovation, and support from governments and industry. The International Energy Agency’s Task 39 evaluated the current state of SAF production in its January 2024 report (bit.ly/3X37aXu). While numerous SAF production facilities have been announced, current production is less than 1% of the 400 billion litres required annually by 2050.

A 2023 Royal Society report (bit.ly/3EEarGq) estimates municipal waste arisings could contribute 12Mt per year of feedstock for bioenergy production. With a 10% conversion rate, this would contribute 1.2Mt per year of fuel, or 10% of the total amount of fuel required.

There is clearly potential for growth, and a market for those collecting municipal solid waste that cannot be recycled, but can SAF compete with current long-term contracts with energy from waste (EfW) facilities?

The inclusion of EfW in the Emissions Trading Scheme could affect things, as could legislation prohibiting the use of single-use plastics, but local authorities are unlikely to change contracts to an as-yet unproven SAF producer at the moment.

If they fail to dispose of the waste, then the local authority could fall into legal default and risk having to pay dearly to send it to landfill – defeating the purpose of the whole SAF exercise.

In summary, if SAF production from waste is to become a reality, there will need to be a wholesale overturning of the current UK waste management system that will take years to achieve.

Remember – SAF is only a stop-gap solution, favoured by the aircraft operators, who can use it within their existing fleets. The aircraft industry, however, is concentrating on its development into hydrogen. Rolls-Royce, General Electric, Airbus, Pratt & Whitney, and Boeing are all developing hydrogen-fuelled engines and aircraft.

It seems as if SAF, at the volumes currently being considered, could have a relatively short shelf life. l",https://www.circularonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2149783756.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:20.689467

The strategy aims to address these vulnerabilities by expanding biofuel use in transport and aviation, turning agricultural output into energy feedstocks and generating rural employment through cultivation and processing.
The biorefinery is projected to produce enough SAF to meet the 10 percent aviation blending target, with annual output estimated at 530,000 million litres between 2028 and 2030.
“The revised framework creates clear market signals through mandatory blending, ensuring long-term investor confidence,” the strategy reads.","The Ministry of Water and Energy will require binding biofuel blending across road and aviation fuels under a revised Biofuel Development Strategy, setting firm deadlines to reduce the country’s reliance on imported petroleum and build a domestic bioeconomy by 2035.

The strategy replaces the 2007 framework and lays out phased targets for the transport sector. Road transport will move to a 10 percent bioethanol blend (E10) by 2030 and 15 percent (E15) by 2035, while aviation will introduce a five percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend, marking a first step toward aligning Ethiopian Airlines with global decarbonisation standards, according to a file obtained by Birrmetrics.

“The strategy aims to ensure energy security through locally sourced biofuels, reduce exposure to global oil price volatility, and create sustainable rural jobs,’” the document states. “By 2035, Ethiopia’s biofuel sector will be a core pillar of the country’s green and inclusive growth agenda.”

Ethiopia’s energy mix remains heavily reliant on biomass, which accounts for nearly 87 percent of primary energy consumption, while oil makes up only eight percent. Imported petroleum, also nearly eight percent of the total energy supply in 2023, draws significant foreign currency and exposes the economy to global price volatility. The strategy aims to address these vulnerabilities by expanding biofuel use in transport and aviation, turning agricultural output into energy feedstocks and generating rural employment through cultivation and processing.

The updated plan coincides with a high-profile partnership announced on October 24 between Sunbird Bioenergy Africa and the Ethiopian Mining Corporation (EMC) to develop a 23,000-hectare agricultural biorefinery, set to begin operations by 2030. The facility will produce SAF for aviation, ethanol for transport, and household biofuels, while supporting the government’s parallel transition toward electric vehicles, liquefied natural gas, and compressed natural gas.

The biorefinery is projected to produce enough SAF to meet the 10 percent aviation blending target, with annual output estimated at 530,000 million litres between 2028 and 2030. Household clean cooking fuels, replacing kerosene, charcoal, and LPG, are expected to reach 120–150 million litres per year from 2025 to 2030. Transport ethanol blends (E10–E20) could generate 115–230 million litres annually in the same period.

A core component of the roadmap is a regulatory and investment framework to attract private capital and ensure market stability. The Ministry plans to collaborate with the African Development Bank and World Bank to provide financing instruments and risk guarantees for biofuel producers and distributors.

The strategy outlines an end-to-end value chain. Sugar cane will serve as the main source for bioethanol, while oil-rich crops such as Ethiopian mustard will be cultivated for biodiesel. The use of non-food feedstocks is intended to prevent competition with food production while expanding agricultural opportunities.

“The revised framework creates clear market signals through mandatory blending, ensuring long-term investor confidence,” the strategy reads. “It integrates climate action with rural industrialisation, placing agriculture at the centre of Ethiopia’s energy transformation.”",https://birrmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1400x900-2025-11-03T144625.089.png,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:26.329481
