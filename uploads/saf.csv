The company sent a letter to the Sugarloaf Twp.
Sugarloaf Twp.
From its Akron plant, Alterra shipped out 23,895 pounds of waste in 2021, but shipments increased to 172,653 three years later.
The NRDC, however, said in an issue brief in March that it’s misleading to consider pyrolysis as recycling.","Alterra Energy ended its proposed plans to build a plastics recycling plant in Sugarloaf Twp.

The company sent a letter to the Sugarloaf Twp. Board of Supervisors on Friday stating its no longer able to pursue developing land at 42 Tomhicken Rd.

“Additionally, the landowner now believes the property’s value is significantly elevated due to its proximity to a proposed transmission line and indicated that he intends to market to a data center project,” according to the letter. “We had been operating under mutually understood expectations related to a lease arrangement; however, the landowner has recently shifted to a purchase-only requirement, which makes the site unworkable within our current development model and timeline.”

Omar Terrie Alterra, Head of Public Affairs for Alterra, confirmed details Monday.

“We are still looking at areas in the Hazleton and Sugarloaf and are committed to trying to come to Northeast Pennsylvania,” Terrie said. “My development team is looking anywhere and everywhere, but doesn’t have a specific location. We are dedicated to Northeast PA.”

The Akron,Ohio-based company planned to truck in discarded plastic from the tri-state area, melt it down and ship it back out via train.

Sugarloaf Twp. Manager Liz Tolan said Alterra never submitted an application with the township.

“They (Alterra) attended one Board of Supervisors meeting several months ago to introduce their company to the board and attendees, and they were scheduled to be on the agenda this month to give an update on where they were with their project, and to answer any questions from residents in attendance,” Tolan said Monday. “They have since withdrawn their request to be on the agenda as they could not secure their parcel in question and therefore will not be developing in Sugarloaf.”

In June, grassroots organizers Annie Vinatieri and Josephine Gingerich, Health Advocacy Outreach Coordinator, educated residents during a town hall meeting about Alterra’s plans, potential health effects and how to get involved.

Using a process called pyrolysis, Alterra planned to heat shredded plastic to 800 to 1,000 degrees to “produce circular synthetic oil for the manufacturing of new plastics and other valuable products.”

Alterra said its Sugarloaf plant annually would have emitted 5.6 tons of hazardous air pollutants, 11.1 tons of particulate matter and 44.4 tons of volatile organic compounds.

From its Akron plant, Alterra shipped out 23,895 pounds of waste in 2021, but shipments increased to 172,653 three years later.

Before the plant, originally proposed by a company called VadXX, opened in 2014, Akron donated land for the facility in return for a share of revenues.

This May, when the plant sought to renew its permits, people packed a hearing, and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency extended the time for people to submit comments, which the agency is still reviewing.

The Natural Resources Defense Council lists more than 25 hazardous air pollutants that can be released from pyrolysis plants in addition to carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide.

Only 10 chemical recycling facilities like it existed nationwide, and nearly all were in the pilot or demonstration stages, according to a July 2024 report for the Ohio River Valley Institute, a valley that has two pyrolysis plants, including Alterra’s original site in Akron.

Chemical and petroleum industries want to demonstrate that the plants can improve low recycling rates for plastic and ensure future demand as the rise of electric vehicles and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reduces the future use of petroleum as fuel.

Chevron Phillips Chemical and Neste, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel, have invested in Alterra.

The NRDC, however, said in an issue brief in March that it’s misleading to consider pyrolysis as recycling.

“Pyrolysis actually can’t recycle much, if any plastic,” the NRDC said, citing a government report that found between 0.1% and 6% of plastic waste entering a pyrolysis plant becomes new plastic. “What it mostly produces instead is dirty fuels.”

From economic and environmental perspectives, the NRDC said it is preferable to make new plastic from virgin materials rather than pyrolysis.

“It’s a false solution to the climate crisis perpetuating the burning of fuels, perpetuating the manufacturing of plastics,” Sandy Field of Save our Susquehanna, a group that defeated a pyrolysis plant that had been proposed by Encina Development Group in Point Twp. Northumberland County and has continued to oppose the technology’s use elsewhere, especially in environmental justice communities where a majority of residents have low incomes or are from minority groups. “We did live without plastics in the olden days. It’s possible.”",https://www.standardspeaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HZS-L-plastics-0628-18.jpg?w=1024&h=703,N,,2025-08-11 17:56:29.580859

The project is situated in Palos de la Frontera, within the Huelva province, and represents a total investment of approximately €1.2 billion. Its location offers strategic advantages, being adjacent to Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park, enabling strong operational synergies and streamlined logistics.

The upcoming plant is designed to deliver an impressive annual output capacity of 500,000 tonnes of sustainable fuels. Among its primary products will be SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and HVO100 (renewable diesel), both of which play a critical role in reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and aviation. Importantly, the feedstock for production will come from agricultural residues and used cooking oils, promoting circular economy principles and reducing reliance on fossil-based raw materials.

From an environmental perspective, the plant integrates advanced, eco-friendly technologies aimed at minimising its impact on the surrounding ecosystem. One of the standout features is its commitment to operating exclusively with recycled water, significantly reducing freshwater consumption. Furthermore, the facility is engineered to cut CO2 emissions by 75% compared to conventional biofuel plants. This reduction translates to avoiding nearly 3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually—a major contribution toward Europe’s decarbonisation goals.

The scale, innovation, and sustainability embedded in this project make it a landmark development for Spain’s renewable energy landscape. It underscores the nation’s ambition to position itself as a leader in clean fuel technologies and green energy production. For Cobra IS, this venture further solidifies its role as a key driver in the transition toward low-carbon transportation solutions across Europe.

This milestone also aligns with VINCI Group’s broader presence and financial footprint in Spain. In 2024, the company generated a total revenue of €3.8 billion in the country. Of this, Cobra IS accounted for €3.2 billion, VINCI Energies for €0.3 billion, and VINCI Construction for another €0.3 billion. The new biofuel plant contract adds to VINCI’s growing portfolio of sustainable infrastructure projects in Spain, further enhancing its strategic position in the European renewable energy sector.

By combining substantial investment, cutting-edge technologies, and a strong commitment to sustainability, the project at Palos de la Frontera is poised to become a benchmark for future biofuel plants worldwide. It not only advances Spain’s clean energy agenda but also strengthens Europe’s pathway toward achieving climate neutrality targets.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-11 15:56:13.432691

The plant at the heart of the story fired up in 2016, turning waste oils and animal fats into what the industry calls sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. It supplied millions of gallons annually to United Airlines and JetBlue Airways—until production ground to a halt in April when all 35 employees were laid off. World Energy, the Boston-based owner, had billed the Paramount facility as a springboard toward a second, larger site in Houston. Chief Executive Gene Gebolys now says the Los Angeles-area closure is a “reset.” Air Products, once slated to lead a $2 billion expansion, pulled out in February, citing unfavorable commercial conditions. United Airlines has since confirmed that it ended its SAF purchase agreement with World Energy “a few years ago.” In a separate statement, JetBlue called World Energy “a valued partner” and said cooperation on future volumes will continue.

Why this matters for eco-minded travelers

Aviation accounts for 2.5 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and traffic is projected to more than double by 2050. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) wants carriers to hit net-zero emissions by mid-century, a target that requires 118 billion gallons of SAF every year—more than 300 times today’s worldwide output. For consumers, the Paramount shutdown removes one of the few verifiable sources of green jet fuel in North America. It also highlights the gap between headline-grabbing airline pledges and on-the-ground production capacity:

SAF is forecast to cover only 0.7 percent of global jet-fuel demand this year, up from 0.3 percent in 2024, according to IATA.

Air passenger demand, by contrast, is expected to rise 6 percent during the same period.

A Reuters review found airlines have announced 165 SAF projects in the past 12 years, but only 36 have delivered any fuel. Another 23 have been abandoned, 27 delayed or placed on indefinite hold, and 31 have yet to produce a single gallon.

If every project still on the drawing board reached full capacity, worldwide supply would expand by 12 billion gallons—barely 10 percent of what is needed for the 2050 goal.

The Cost Conundrum and European Regulations

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced through the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) method—used by Paramount—costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel. Airlines argue that major oil companies are hesitant to increase production at these prices, while some refiners claim that demand is too weak for significant investment. As a result, travelers may bear the financial burden; if SAF remains expensive, airlines could implement ticket surcharges or raise base fares. New European Union regulations mandate airlines to blend at least 2 percent SAF into every flight starting in 2025, increasing to 6 percent by 2030 and 70 percent by 2050. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that the 2025 mandate alone will add $2.9 billion to airlines' annual fuel and compliance costs, likely impacting transatlantic fares.

Challenges in the Global Pipeline

Beyond Paramount, several high-profile projects illustrate the challenges in the sector. SGP BioEnergy, based in New York, initially planned to open the world's largest SAF complex in Panama this year, but construction has been postponed to 2027 due to lukewarm airline support and the possibility of pivoting to renewable diesel for trucks and ships. Meanwhile, British start-up Velocys has spent 15 years trying to commercialize Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts municipal waste and forestry byproducts into jet fuel. Although pilot quantities have been produced, none of its proposed plants—in Oklahoma, Mississippi, or Immingham, England—have been completed. The English site has received £27 million in government grants since 2022, along with an additional £3 million in July, yet the location remains an empty field today.

What can travelers expect in the near term?

Because HEFA relies on limited feedstocks—used cooking oil and animal fats—the aviation industry agrees it will not meet long-term demand. Yet most near-term projects still hinge on that process. Unless alternative pathways mature quickly, airlines may struggle to obtain enough fuel to satisfy upcoming mandates or their own public climate targets.

Tips for travelers

Ask before you book. Some carriers let you purchase SAF credits or contribute to offset schemes. Verify whether the program funds physical fuel production or merely accounting certificates.

Check the route. Airports in California, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden currently see the most consistent SAF deliveries, albeit in small volumes. Choosing flights that pass through these hubs marginally increases the odds that a portion of your ticket goes toward greener fuel.

Mind the aircraft type. Newer planes such as the Airbus A320neo, A220, and Boeing 787 burn up to 25 percent less fuel than previous generations, providing an immediate emissions benefit independent of SAF availability.

Consider nonstop flights. Takeoffs are fuel-intensive; shaving a connection often lowers total emissions even if the nonstop ticket costs slightly more.

Pack light. Every pound in the overhead bin demands extra fuel. One carry-on instead of two makes a difference on short-haul routes.

The closure of the Paramount refinery underscores a harsh reality: the sustainable jet-fuel revolution is moving far slower than travel demand or airline marketing would suggest. As travelers, our choices—selecting efficient aircraft, supporting credible SAF programs, and advocating for transparent progress—remain pivotal. But for the moment, the greenest decision may still be the oldest one: fly less or make every trip count.",https://jetsetterguide.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/AdobeStock_426079297_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 17:56:37.646720

The Next Steps In The Privatization Process Photo: Matheus Obst | Shutterstock With the Portuguese president having signed the decree into law, the privatization process has now been officially started.
In reality, the interested parties have been in discussions for years, even as the process itself has been delayed by political machinations.","Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has signed into law a government decree mandating the privatization of TAP Air Portugal. The government aims to divest a 49.9% stake, including a 44.9% stake to one or more investors, and a 5% stake earmarked for the employees. The Portuguese government is looking to recoup its Covid-era investment in the carrier, which amounts to about $3.7 billion (€3.2 billion).

Interested parties will have 60 days to prequalify, after which they will be given 90 days to submit non-binding proposals for the acquisition of up to a 44.9% stake in the airline. Numerous airline groups have already expressed interest in becoming shareholders of the airline, including the Lufthansa Group, Air France-KLM, and IAG. There is also speculation that Non-EU airlines could become parties to the process as well.

An Important Step Forward In The Process

The process to privatize TAP began in 2023, but was paused following the collapse of Portugal's center-right minority government in March. The new coalition government, which returned to office in May, has made privatization a priority and the Council of Ministers approved a decree-law last month to initiate formal privatization proceedings. That decree has now been signed into law by the country's president.

The state has also made clear what it expects from the process. It is looking for a strategic partner that will preserve the TAP brand, grow the airline's fleet, maintain and grow the existing route network to Portuguese-speaking countries, and invest in local sustainable aviation fuel production projects. The investors must also maintain operations from Lisbon’s Humberto Delgado Airport (LIS), as well as Portugal's secondary airports, such as Porto and Faro.

The Portuguese government has said that it expects bids from ""numerous interested parties,"" including non-EU airlines. It has also structured the flag carrier’s sale model to allow an airline to partner with other airlines, investment funds, and private investors to submit a joint bid. President de Sousa has expressed his pleasure with the process thus far:

“There are more interested parties than we thought, which means it’s an interesting business. It’s not just the classic ones, but others as well. That’s a good sign. Ideally, we will see TAP integrated into a larger group within a year, with a greater capacity to generate synergies and positive value.""

What Are Potential Investors Purchasing?

TAP is not the only airline on the Iberian Peninsula that is looking for strategic partners. Spanish carrier Air Europa has long been exploring potential partnerships to strengthen its financial position. However, all three of the large European airline groups ultimately ended negotiations with Globalia, Air Europa’s parent company, and it is Turkish Airlines that is the last one standing with a binding offer.

TAP is a very different proposition, as interested investors stand to acquire a stake in one of the top 20 European airlines, based on passenger count and fleet size. A member of Star Alliance, TAP carried 16 million passengers in 2024, delivering a net income of $62.3 million (€53.7 million) on record revenue of $4.9 billion (€4.2 billion). The mainline carrier operates an all-Airbus fleet of 80 aircraft, with a further 22 on order (see table below). Its regional subsidiary, TAP Express, operates a further 19 Embraer E190/195s.

According to data from Cirium, in the first half of 2025, TAP operated 100 routes involving 89 different airports. It served 88 destinations from its main base in Lisbon and a further 12 from Porto. For potential investors, one of the airline’s main strengths is its extensive network to Brazil, where it serves 14 different destinations. But equally appealing will be its geographical position at the western edge of Europe, as well as the rapid growth of its North American network, where it now has 11 destinations.

With the Portuguese president having signed the decree into law, the privatization process has now been officially started. In reality, the interested parties have been in discussions for years, even as the process itself has been delayed by political machinations.

In the upcoming months, the sale of the minority stake will be structured into four phases, as follows:

Pre-qualification: All interested parties have 60 days to formally express their intention to proceed with the carrier and qualify for the proposal process.

Proposal submissions: All qualified parties will be required to submit a detailed proposal during the course of Q4, with an emphasis on how their organization will ""foster synergies"" with TAP.

Data from Cirium’s EmeraldSky tool shows that more efficient seating arrangements can significantly reduce aircraft carbon emissions, offering a quick alternative for airlines to meet their net-zero by 2050 commitment.

While increasing seat density might not appeal to passengers on the face of it, such measures can reduce personal carbon emissions. Smart seating solutions can mean that comfort is not noticeably impacted.

How seat density impacts airline CO2 emissions

Cirium’s analysis shows that some airlines have already achieved reductions in CO2 emissions per available seat-kilometre (ASK) by redistributing the fixed space inside the cabin more efficiently.

Once an aircraft is airborne, its fuel consumption is largely fixed. The more seats available to share the fuel load, the lower the per-passenger emissions.

The notion that higher seat density in the cabin can reduce the personal carbon footprint of each passenger is not new. Previous studies conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) have shown that airlines operating the same aircraft on the same route can make their flights more sustainable by adding seats.

An ICCT study published in 2018, examining the transatlantic market, found that:

“Aircraft fuel burn was found to be the most important driver of fuel efficiency overall, explaining almost 40% of the variation in airline fuel efficiency across carriers, followed by seating density, which accounted for one-third of the variation. Freight share and passenger load factors were relatively less important.”

Cebu Pacific reduces carbon emissions by 25% with denser seating on A330-900neo

Cirirum cites one outstanding example of possible environmental gains in Cebu Pacific’s A330-900neo. The airline’s cabin configuration accommodates 459 seats—138 more than the global average for this aircraft type.

Despite operating the same aircraft, on the same route, with the same engines as other carriers, Cebu Pacific has seen a 25% reduction in its environmental footprint, simply by carrying more passengers.

Rethinking aircraft efficiency: Opportunities and trade-offs

Sustainability in aviation is often associated with new technologies, with their associated long research and development timelines, and the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

But new types of propulsion for large commercial jets are still on the drawing board. SAF supplies are woefully low, still under 1% of the global fuel demand, and with few signs of significant increases in the short term.

However, airlines can take immediate steps to fly more sustainably by rearranging their cabins. The question remains whether the airlines’ customers will value greener flights over greater legroom.

In recent years, airlines have been adding more premium space to their aircraft, responding to customer preferences.

The cabin layout decision will hinge on each airline’s brand positioning. It is easier for budget airlines to arrange the cabin space for the lowest individual carbon footprint than it would be for a full-service carrier.

In the end, customers will decide. Airlines will need to balance the stated desire for sustainability with the actions of their customers at the time of booking. If passengers continue to prioritise their comfort over their carbon footprint, then airlines will design their cabins accordingly.

From a sustainability perspective, however, the results are clear: emissions performance is not just driven by the type of aircraft an airline operates but by how it is configured.

Li Qiao (The Conversation) ... But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change. READ MORE

BY Susanne Retka Schill

While there may be only one ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) pathway registered with EPA to generate D4 RINs right now—LanzaJet’s facility in Soperton, Georgia—experts speaking in Omaha at the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo this June all said they expect ETJ to become a viable source of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the future. The goals are substantial. In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge calls for 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050. Based on announcements, 2025 SAF production is expected to reach 660 million gallons globally, according to Azadeh Rohani, senior consultant with Worley Consulting. The International Air Transport Association projects 120 billion gallons of SAF will be needed annually to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

With 850,000 flights operated using SAF since 2011, Tim Hughes, project director with the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative, says the aviation industry is moving forward in decarbonizing its fuel.

Other data collected by the Air Transport Action Group indicates that globally:

• $45 billion dollars have been committed by airlines to date in forward purchase agreements for SAF;

• 69 airports are regularly supplied with SAF;

• 50 airlines have committed to 2030 SAF goals ranging from 5-30%, with most committed to 10%.

• 20 million metric tons of SAF uptake by 2030 could be possible under proposed and committed policies.

Eight SAF technology pathways and three coprocessing pathways have been tested and approved by ASTM, Hughes says, with the HEFA pathway being the most prominent right now. “But we’re also looking at alcohol-to-jet. And, we know that in laboratories we can take any type of carbon source and produce a fuel out of it. Some are more complicated than others, and some require a lot of energy in order to make [them] work.” CAAFI’s technical committee, made up of companies like Boeing, Airbus, GE and Pratt & Whitney, look closely at any new fuel, he says, to make sure it performs at high altitudes, is stable and safe, and works in all different engine types around the world.

ETJ Opportunities

“Ethanol-to-jet can be competitive compared to HEFA, the main process at the moment for SAF, keeping in mind the limitations we see with HEFA feedstock availability,” says Worley Consulting’s Rohani.

The HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) process uses fats, oils and greases to manufacture SAF using the petroleum refining process with specialized catalysts.

The ethanol-to-jet process, also catalytically driven, involves the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, followed by oligomerization to link the smaller chains together, which are then saturated with hydrogen in a hydrogenation step and, finally, fractionated to separate the SAF from the byproducts of renewable diesel and renewable naphtha.

ETJ compares favorably to HEFA in terms of carbon intensity reduction and lands slightly higher in cost of production, Rohani says. (See accompanying chart, “Technologies: Typical CI and COP for SAF”) When comparing soybean oil, the main HEFA feedstock, to corn, the SAF yield per acre of corn is five to six times greater than the SAF yield from an acre of soybeans, Rohani adds, another point in corn ethanol’s favor.

Looking at the cost of production for ETJ, ethanol feedstock is the largest component, followed by capital cost. Revenue projections, Rohani says, indicate ETJ can be profitable, but only if incentives are added to the jet and byproducts price. (See the accompanying “Economics” illustration.) In one analysis, the cost of production comes to $5.80, while the potential revenue, including incentives, is $6.20. “The numbers support profitability and competitiveness of the ethanol-to-jet pathway, which gives us some comfort about investing in this process,” she says.

ETJ, however, will only be profitable if the ethanol feedstock and ETJ process meet the carbon reduction thresholds prescribed in the various incentive programs. “Those solutions are really dependent on a specific case,” Rohani says. Carbon capture and sequestration of the CO2 from fermenters offers the biggest opportunity for CI reduction—around 30%. Integrating CCS with cogeneration offers another 20-30% reduction. Using low-carbon hydrogen, low-carbon power and capturing carbon in the ETJ process itself offer smaller CI reductions. “The steps you take to reduce carbon intensity gives you higher [45Z] credits per gallon.” In the example she gave in her FEW presentation, the total CI reductions could receive $1.10 in 45Z credits. Note: after the FEW, changes were made to the 45Z biofuels tax credit when the OBBB Act was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on July 4.

Sofia Cabrera, SAF price reporter for S&P Global Commodity Insights, projects that in the short- and medium-term, HEFA technology is going to predominate. “We are also seeing ETJ gaining some space in the mid- to short-term, but we forecast that in the long term, the three main technologies, HEFA, ETJ and e-SAF (power-to-liquid) are going to gain the same market share.”

Mostly Policy Driven

Airlines are, in part, turning to SAF in response to customers and investors pushing for more sustainable fuels, Cabrera says, “but SAF demand is driven primarily by policy.” Globally, governments take two approaches. One focuses on carbon intensity and greenhouse gas reduction with various incentives. In the other approach, governments mandate blending volumes. Then there are book-and-claim programs being developed, alongside other voluntary carbon reduction frameworks promoted by international aviation organizations like IATA and CORSIA.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU mandate began this year, requiring 2% blends, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The mandate is layered on top of the Renewable Energy Directive (REDIII). The challenge, Cabrera says, is that individual EU members are taking different approaches, with Germany and Denmark looking at CI while others are focused on blending obligations. European regulations also include feedstock requirements.

In Asia, China, Thailand, South Korea and Japan have mandated SAF blending levels. In South America, Brazil has its Fuel for the Future program, Chile has a Road Map for SAF and Columbia is developing a program. “Many countries are putting a lot of effort into pushing this industry forward,” Cabrera says.

In the U.S., prior to the recent enhancements to the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit, and amid shifting dynamics of oilseed and waste fats, markets had paused some HEFA and renewable diesel projects, Cabrera says. “Other policies like the LCFS in California or the purchase credit for SAF in Illinois haven’t been sufficient to compensate for the amount of uncertainty in the market.” Time will tell whether the enhancements to 45Z will be enough to turn things around.

When asked which were more effective, incentives or mandates, carrots or sticks, Kristine Klavers, managing director at EcoEngineers, says that in Europe, the penalties are so big that “the money will be there. But we see so much more activity here in the U.S. in investments to get incentives, and if we look back in history, incentives have been more effective than penalties.”

Unlocking Incentives

Klavers cautions that prospective SAF producers need to contact compliance consultants like EcoEngineers, early in their development process. “You don’t know how many calls I get from companies saying, ‘I have my technology and engineering completed, I have financing, I’m ready. Can I get a credit?’” But unlike established biofuels, where compliance details wait until the end, SAF specifications and regulations need to be considered from the beginning. SAF needs to first meet ASTM specifications, she explains. ETJ has an approved ASTM pathway with non-specific requirements that can be challenging to navigate.

Getting approval using a different process can take years. Then, the fuel itself has to meet ASTM specifications. ASTM isn’t a regulation, she adds, “it’s a specification created by engine manufacturers. They’re not going to let anything through unless they’re 100% certain that their airplanes are safe using the fuel.”

Then, SAF must meet the requirements for the targeted market. “There is only one fuel, but many, many markets, and each and every country is trying to create their own regulation,” Klavers says. “If you want to go to Europe, you have to have at least 50% reduction in the carbon intensity score. But if you’re building a new plant and you want to go to Europe with your SAF, you have to be at least a 65% reduction. So, that’s just your entrance ticket.” The European market, which has blending mandates being phased in, also has layers of regulations in overlapping directives, regulations on allowable feedstocks, plus differences among countries in how they individually apply the regulations.

In the U.S., the first step is to get a Renewable Fuel Standard pathway approved to be able to generate D4 RINs. There is one ETJ pathway approved already, Klavers adds, but it is plant and feedstock specific. For others, “you better come to a company like ours and file a petition to go to the government and ask for a pathway.”

State credits can be stacked on top of the RINs value, but each state’s program differs slightly. And, even after the passage of OBBB, it is yet to be determined just how the 45Z production tax credit will operate. In Canada, British Columbia has had its own low carbon fuel standard in place for a few years, plus the nationwide Clean Fuel Regulations are getting underway.

In the Q&A after their presentations, the speakers were asked bluntly: Does ethanol-to-jet stand on its own from a profitability point of view, without all the stackable credits?

Rohani replied no. “That’s a definite answer, and that’s part of the challenge for the future,” she said. The cost of production, at the moment, is higher than the revenue that you could get without the incentives. Maybe in the future—the technologies are getting mature fast and there will be advances. The price of utilities, the price of feedstock, all of those would have a contribution, but without those incentives, at the moment, it’s not profitable.”

The current uncertainty around U.S. policies has dampened progress, Cabrera says. “Some projects we were expecting to take off in the next two years, we now expect to move to eight or 10 years.” The policy uncertainty is expected to be short term, however, and doesn’t mean SAF development is stopping, she says. “SAF is still very nascent, and everyone is trying to move forward. That is great, but even the fuel needs some fuel, and that will come from policy, in my opinion.”

Commenting on the letter, ADBA Chair Chris Huhne said “The UK biogas industry is being unfairly penalised under the current rules of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Biomethane – an often carbon negative technology – is treated the same as climate-wrecking fossil gas. It makes no sense, and it’s holding back investment in the infrastructure we need to reach net zero.”

Andy Prendergast, National Secretary of the GMB, said of the union’s support for the letter: “The gas network not only heats and powers millions of homes and businesses, it also supports hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs. Recognising green gases like biomethane as Net Zero fuels under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme not only gives us a path towards net zero, it also provides a way to protect those livelihoods whilst building a viable export industry. We need to seize this opportunity with both hands.”

The letter highlights the important role biomethane could play in net zero if ETS recognition is granted, particularly in the hard-to-decarbonise areas such as chemicals and manufacturing sectors.

It states. “[Biomethane] supports rural economies, displaces fossil fuels, and cuts methane emissions. […] It also plays a critical role in decarbonising high-value industrial sectors that are essential to the UK’s national security and economic resilience.”

Through this open letter, ADBA and the biogas industry call on the Secretary of State to:

Confirm that biomethane injected into the UK’s gas grid will be eligible under the UK ETS as a net zero fuel in the same way as sustainable aviation fuel

Ensure UK ETS rules fully reflect biomethane’s full value

Set out a clear timeline for implementation to give the market confidence,

They conclude: “Developers and investors urgently need clarity and confirmation that the full net zero value of biomethane will be recognised. Further delays threaten to stall a sector that is ready to scale and deliver.”

“This is an immediate opportunity to unlock growth, accelerate decarbonisation, and bring forward billions in private investment. We urge you to act now.”",https://envirotecmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/biogas-plants-and-sunset-1200px.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 12:57:07.919413

Because I’m a great father — and an opportunistic columnist — I told Sally that in exchange for this trip, she had to be my Gen Z travel focus group. She readily agreed (after an impressive eye roll).

The good news is that, according to Sally, Gen Z values travel — and a 2025 Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection report agrees, calling Gen Z the fastest-growing consumer segment in tourism. Sally’s friends constantly share vacation stories and already have extensive travel bucket lists. They might not do business with just any supplier, but if the company is promoting travel in an ethical way, they are ready to book — especially if they can get Instagram-worthy photos from it.

RELATED: What Do Gen Z Travelers Want on Vacation?

More good news for travel advisors is that Gen Z values personal experience. They want to hear from actual people who have taken trips and can share their tips. They are acutely aware of marketing tactics and are skeptical of shotgun sales approaches, especially those filled with false promises and empty taglines.

The challenge for advisors is that Gen Z’s main source for this information is social media — TikTok in particular. According to Sally, everything from where to eat to which companies live up to their promises is determined by what “real” people say on TikTok. And its searchable nature makes it more valuable than other platforms — even Google. So, if you do not already incorporate TikTok into your sales efforts, you should start.

Some of you may wonder why you should worry about this demographic, and I suppose if you’re retiring in the next year or two, you have a point.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel.
Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story.","The federal spending law passed in early July 2025, often called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly reduces federal funding for efforts to create renewable or sustainable types of fuel that can power aircraft over long distances while decreasing the damage aviation does to the global climate.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources — such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/681845/original/file-20250723-56-swckd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C456%2C5472%2C2736&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-11 12:57:16.116048

Japan: USD 2.057/Gallon

Brazil: USD 2.114/Gallon

Belgium: USD 2.036/Gallon

The current prices reflect the material’s critical role in high-performance industries such as aviation and air freight, where regulatory shifts, supply dynamics, and operational demands continue to support a stable or rising global price trend.

Key Regional Price Trends and Market Drivers:

USA

Jet fuel prices in the United States reached USD 2.102/Gallon in June 2025. The decline was attributed to soft spot buying amid deteriorating demand and uncertainty stemming from new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These developments adversely impacted air freight and business travel, pushing refiners to lower prices to offload inventories.

United Kingdom

In the UK, jet fuel prices settled at USD 2.036/Gallon in Q2 2025, influenced by the introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate. Although the mandate was modest, it introduced notable cost implications, with refiners and suppliers adjusting pricing structures to accommodate SAF-related costs.

Japan

Japan recorded jet fuel prices of USD 2.057/Gallon in the second quarter of 2025, with conventional jet fuel prices staying firm due to stable kerosene crack spreads and limited SAF integration. Most airlines continued to depend on imported jet fuel or more affordable foreign SAF alternatives, resulting in steady market conditions.

Brazil

Jet fuel prices in Brazil reached USD 2.114/Gallon in June 2025, following Petrobras’s decision to cut average prices to distributors. This move, combined with a drop in domestic airline fuel expenditures, supported carrier margins, especially after early-quarter pressures from currency depreciation and volatile oil prices.

Belgium

Belgium jet fuel prices stood at USD 2.036/Gallon in Q2 2025. The implementation of EU-mandated SAF blending raised procurement costs slightly, particularly for international carriers. Additionally, planned refinery maintenance constrained local supply, contributing to modest upward pricing pressure.

Jet Fuel Industry Overview:

The global jet fuel market reached a value of USD 176.7 Billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 470.5 Billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 10.20% during 2025–2033. This strong growth outlook underscores the critical importance of jet fuel in powering commercial aviation, air cargo operations, and defense fleets worldwide. As air travel demand rebounds and international connectivity strengthens, fuel consumption across key global routes is expected to rise steadily.

The market is driven by several factors, including the resurgence of international tourism, expansion of airline fleets, and ongoing modernization of aviation infrastructure. Additionally, the increasing integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in line with decarbonization targets, regulatory mandates promoting cleaner alternatives, and steady growth in emerging market air traffic are key contributors to the industry’s upward trajectory.

Recent Market Trends and Industry Analysis:

The recovery in international and domestic air travel remains a key driver of jet fuel demand, with passenger volumes rising sharply. Airlines are reinstating routes and increasing flight frequencies, leading to greater aviation turbine fuel (ATF) consumption. Refineries are adjusting output ratios to prioritize jet fuel, as growing tourism, business travel, and cargo movements push fleet utilization to new highs. The expansion of budget airlines and long-haul operations by Middle Eastern carriers further supports this surge.

In addition to this, geopolitical tensions and increased defense spending have bolstered military aviation fuel demand. Frequent military exercises, surveillance operations, and humanitarian missions have kept defense fleets active across North America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, offering a stable demand base less affected by seasonal or environmental regulations. Simultaneously, the continued boom in e-commerce is driving up air freight operations, with global logistics firms increasing cargo flights and sustaining high fuel draw at refueling hubs.

United Airlines' once-celebrated partnership with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer World Energy has ended, marking another setback for the airline industry's green ambitions, according to a Reuters report. The closure of World Energy's Paramount refinery in April and stalled plans for a Houston facility highlight broader challenges in scaling SAF production, with only 36 of 165 announced airline SAF projects operational globally.

SAF Adoption Falls Short of Industry Goals

Data from the IndexBox platform shows that SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of global jet fuel demand, far below the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) 2050 net-zero target requiring a 300-fold production increase. While airlines like United and JetBlue had touted early SAF commitments, Reuters found that 23 projects have been abandoned and 27 are delayed indefinitely.

Systemic Challenges Plague Production

World Energy CEO Gene Gebolys accused airlines of ""disingenuous"" press releases overstating SAF commitments, though he acknowledged some carriers made genuine efforts. The Paramount refinery, which produced SAF from used cooking oil and animal fat, ceased operations after partner Air Products withdrew from a $2 billion expansion amid financial challenges. Most operational SAF projects rely on limited-supply feedstocks, with only one using alternative Fischer-Tropsch technology.

Regulatory Pressure Mounts

New EU mandates requiring 2% SAF usage by 2025 could cost airlines $2.9 billion annually, IATA estimates. Meanwhile, U.S. projects face uncertainty as SGP BioEnergy delayed its Panama SAF plant to 2027, citing waning airline interest.

The project aims to produce up to 100 million tonnes of SAF annually using organic feedstocks such as crop residues, wood, and plant waste.

Current SAF production largely relies on used cooking oil, palm oil waste, and low-grade vegetable oils - sources with limited supply due to competition with food.

According to Meika Syahbana Rusli, Director of IPB’s Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Centre (SBRC), Indonesia can supply as much as 500 million tonnes of biomass annually - five times Airbus’ needs. Most of the supply will come from empty palm fruit bunches in Sumatra and Kalimantan, and large volumes of rice straw in Java. However, challenges remain in collection due to weak infrastructure, the absence of a clear legal framework, and limited large-scale processing technology.

Indonesia’s biomass output and consumption, particularly wood pellets and woodchips, are rising. While this trend presents new business opportunities, it also raises concerns over the growing risk of deforestation. Environmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara reports nearly 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared between 2020 and 2024 for biomass production, threatening habitats of endangered species such as the Sumatran and Bornean orangutans.

Taking to X, he wrote that the production is set to “begin soon as per ICAO’s CORSIA standards with an annual capacity of 3 crore litres.”

“With more such facilities coming up in the country, we are well on the path to meet the target of 1 per cent SAF blending in all international flights by 2027 and cut our aviation carbon footprint,” he said in the X post.

He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this “milestone”.

“I believe it is a milestone under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji towards India’s commitment to sustainable aviation,” he added.

In 2014, the ethanol blending was just 1.53 per cent. By 2022, India achieved 10 per cent blending, five months ahead of schedule. The original target of 20 per cent blending (E20) by 2030 was advanced to 2025 and has already been achieved in the current Ethanol Supply Year.

Ethanol production has surged dramatically, growing from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres by June 2025.

This remarkable growth has helped reduce the country’s dependence on imported crude oil, leading to a significant saving of Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange.

E20 blending in petrol was introduced by the Centre to reduce the country’s oil import cost, energy security, lower carbon emissions and better air quality.

India however has no plans to mandate the blending of ethanol with diesel. The issue of blending ethanol with diesel is still at an experimental stage.

Notably, at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part “Panchamrit” pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion metric tonnes by 2030.

India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.

That moment sparked something in Christensen, who's now a full-fledged ""rockhound"" — an amateur geologist.

His wedding ring is filled with amethyst, a deep purple variant of quartz. He has two other rings, one set with a fire agate and another with an eyeball agate. He wears an an agate-beaded bracelet, and a necklace featuring an agate.

Mark and his wife, Sara Christensen, opened The Rock and Art Shop near downtown St. Cloud in February 2024. It's a true labor of love and a part-time job, too. Sara is a full-time audiologist at the VA Medical Center, and Mark owns Christensen Painting.

""It's much more than a passion than our other jobs that we work,"" Mark said.

While Mark has been collecting rocks and minerals for more than two decades, Sara said her interest developed more recently.

""Since opening the shop, I mean, I've really learned a lot, so I've really fallen in love with it, just learning about all the minerals you can find in our region, locally, as well as all over the world,"" Sara said.

Mark and Sara, along with their two daughters, often walk along the Mississippi River, searching for agates and other treasures, or taking rockhounding trips across the state.

One of the most precious rocks to find locally is Lake Superior agates, the state's official gem. And contrary to its name, Lake Superior agates can be found throughout Central Minnesota.

""This is actually a really good area to find them. You'll find them on gravel roads, corn fields, along the river, all right here,"" Sara said.

The distinctive red, orange and yellow colors of Lake Superior agates come from iron oxidation, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Formed by ancient lava eruptions near Lake Superior and carried south by glaciers, they range in size from marbles to larger than baseballs.

Mark's most prized Lake Superior agate is just over a pound, although he's found some as big as 5 pounds, he said.

""It's such an arbitrary number, but anything over that 16-ounce mark, people are willing to pay a lot more for because that's like a benchmark,"" Mark said. ""Whenever you can beat that, it's like what they call a 'once in a lifetime stone.'""

If you're on the lookout for a Lake Superior agate, the Christensens offered some advice.

A Lake Superior agate typically has a waxy finish with translucent banding, a reddish husk and pitting, Sara said. Limonite staining, a mustard-like spot, is also common to see on Lake Superior agates, Mark said.

All of the Lake Superior agates sold at The Rock and Art Shop are found within a 30-mile radius of St. Cloud.

And while Lake Superior agates are highly sought after, there are other prized gems and rocks you can find in Minnesota, including jasper, banded chert, hematite (found near the Brainerd area) and amethyst, Sara said.

The Rock and Art Shop's offerings go well beyond rocks, gems and minerals found in Minnesota.

That's, in part, because the Christensens always carve out time for a rockhounding stop when they travel, Mark said. Their travels have included searching for agates on California beaches, several unsuccessful trips to South Dakota in hopes of finding a Fairburn agate and a trip to Arizona for fire agates.

The store's agate offerings span the globe — from the Yangtze River in China to Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Malawi, Mexico and Morocco. There are also domestic agates from Arizona, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota and Wyoming.

The Rock and Art Shop also sells fossils, minerals, polished gemstones, slabs and more. Some offerings include amethyst, Arizona thunder eggs, celestite, geodes, jasper, Michigan copper, obsidian, petrified wood, turquoise and much, much more.

There's also a UV room to display yooperlites, which are fluorescent rocks that typically have a reddish-orange hue.

""They're all the rage,"" Mark said.

The Rock and Art Shop also offers a lapidary (the art of polishing stones) shop and studio, classes including wire-wrapping and copper plating. Their store has also hosted kid-friendly events such as a fossil dig, Sara said.

""Our goal is to just add more of the education side of things. Offer more classes and events; that seems to be the draw for people,"" Sara said. ""Working with more artists or other people that want to come in and teach their craft, and then I really want to focus on kids' events and teach them about geology things.""

Their efforts have also included educating adults by holding free, walk-in identification days.

""You get a lot more people coming to look for education versus just coming to buy stuff, which is awesome,"" Mark said. ""That's what we're really trying to be, a tool for our community.""

PARAMOUNT, California (Reuters) -In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers' pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy's plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United's fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy ""a few years ago"", without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a ""valued partner"" since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy's struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry's plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

NO CLEAR PATHWAY

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10% of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

PARAMOUNT 'RESET'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'EXERCISE IN FUTILITY'

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

NEW TECHNOLOGY

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.

This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery.
Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF.
The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.
“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil). This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Renewable fuels play a key role in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already a key player in both the Hungarian and regional biofuel markets, with hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste, i.e., renewable feedstock, being among the most climate-friendly fuel options, and ranks among the pioneers in Europe when it comes to the production of aviation biofuels.

“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production. This readiness underscores our strategic commitment to sustainable mobility—whether in road or air transport. For us, becoming a complex mobility service provider means offering an increasingly diverse range of fuels, thus creating all the necessary conditions for a smart energy transition for our customers. We are already playing a leading role in this process in the region, and we are determined to maintain this position through continued investments and innovation.” – said Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President, Fuels at MOL Group.

MOL Group is continuously researching and developing new possibilities for the production and use of biofuels. In partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply Llc., MOL Group launched commercial testing of SAF in 2022 in Hungary. Building on this, the company now sells SAF as part of its regular operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, in quantities equivalent to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

SAF can only be produced from classic renewable feedstocks (such as materials of vegetable origin) or waste, but it should meet the same technical and environmental specifications as conventional kerosene. Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The current and projected global supply of SAF falls significantly short of demand, as reflected in prices. This is why MOL Group’s developments are of strategic importance, both from a climate protection and supply security perspective.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mol-group.png,N,,2025-08-11 06:56:15.458072

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount’s closure was a “reset” because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule.
Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.
Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","PARAMOUNT, California - In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers’ pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy’s plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases” overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. “People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.”

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United’s fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy “a few years ago”, without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a “valued partner” since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy’s struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry’s plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

No clear pathway

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry’s claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector’s faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialized, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That’s about 10% of what’s needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn’t producing enough fuel.

“These guys are the cause of the problem, and they’ve got to start playing their part,” said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

“I’d like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,” Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

Paramount ‘reset’

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy’s partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount’s closure was a “reset” because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What’s more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry’s long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

‘Exercise in futility’

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

“This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,” said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry’s green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It’s already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world’s largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

The challenges for Velocys began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys’s English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

NEW TECHNOLOGY

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys's English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.

Now in its ninth year, the increasingly influential list has become an industry bellwether for where airline innovation is heading and what’s worth backing.

This year, the airline group – which includes British Airways and Iberia – is placing its biggest bets on AI and climate tech. The startups are drawn from 11 countries and, for the first time, split into two streams.

New for 2025 is a “Discover” track for early-stage startups, particularly those in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy transition tech. These 15 companies will participate in a six-month mentoring program to prepare them for possible future deployment.

It runs alongside the more commercially focused ""Deploy"" track, which offers 12-week proofs of concept directly with IAG operating companies.

The IAGi Accelerator is the group’s flagship innovation program, fast-tracking collaboration with startups across six focus areas including AI, robotics, sustainability, and next-gen computing.

Speaking exclusively to Skift, Nisha Basson-Mugnier, IAG’s innovation principal, explained the new dual strategy: “We saw the opportunity to engage with early-stage deep-tech startups in a better way. We’ve worked with these types of companies before in our traditional format, but launched the Discover track to reflect how much activity and innovation we’re now seeing – especially in the energy transition space.”

SAF is seen as the most scalable near-term solution to decarbonize long-haul flying – and regulators in both the EU and UK are beginning to mandate its use.

The study will examine opportunities for shared CO2 capture, transport and storage infrastructure, aiming to reduce costs compared to individual projects. Each partner will be involved in at least one hub, comprising centralised capture, transport, and storage facilities.

“With more than 1 billion tonnes of production a year in Asia coming from blast furnace capacity that is relatively early in its production life, it’s important for industry to decarbonise existing steelmaking assets,” said Dr Ben Ellis, Vice President Marketing Sustainability at BHP.

Running until the end of 2026, the study will set out preliminary plans for each hub, including cost estimates, construction timelines, and potential commercialisation pathways.

Steel production accounts for around 7% of global CO2 emissions annually, with demand projected to rise 30% by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum. JSW Group’s targets align with this challenge.

“We aim to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity in steelmaking by 42% by 2030 from a base year of 2005 and achieve net neutral carbon emissions by 2050,” said Prabodha Acharya, Chief Sustainability Officer at JSW Group.

However, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) notes that capture rates remain low at the world’s only commercial-scale CCUS facility for gas-based steel production.

The Al Reyadah plant in the UAE captured less than 20% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2020 and 2021, and 26% in 2022 after its owner EMSTEEL switched to nuclear and solar power for electricity.

EMSTEEL and Masdar are now pursuing alternative decarbonisation pathways, including green hydrogen, following the launch of its DRI-EAF pilot project last year.

“Green hydrogen is an essential element in advancing national and global decarbonisation efforts and we are proud to be at the forefront of that endeavour,” said Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Masdar CEO.

IEEFA warns that a broader industry shift towards DRI technologies could sideline CCUS in steelmaking, as happened in power generation, where projects such as the UK’s £1bn CCS programme and the US Kemper plant were cancelled after policy shifts and cost overruns, leaving few operational facilities.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2022/12/shutterstock_1624978153.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 06:56:50.777670

In the not-so-distant past, Suneet Singal was known as a standout figure in the world of real estate, an industry where ambition towers as high as the buildings he helped finance. Nowadays, he can be found discussing clean energy strategies with entrepreneurs or collaborating with engineers on biomass infrastructure. His pivot from concrete to carbon strategy represents a striking evolution, but for Singal, it’s simply the logical next step in a career driven by value creation. Only now, the value he seeks isn’t just financial, it’s environmental, commercial, and generational.

As nations around the world scramble to meet emissions targets, balance energy security, and maintain economic competitiveness, he has positioned himself as a key advisor and voice of reason in a sector too often caught between idealism and inertia. Singal is not interested in greenwashing or ungrounded optimism. He’s interested in solutions, especially the ones that generate both profit and progress.

Given his real estate background, where asset management, risk, and return are deeply intertwined, Singal brings a fiscally conservative lens to climate innovation. “It’s not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. We can meet domestic needs and create products that serve global markets. It’s not about abandoning values, it’s about elevating them. Competition, innovation, and independence should be the cornerstones of leadership in this space,” he explains.

That philosophy is taking shape across several verticals. In the Southern U.S., for instance, Singal is involved in projects leveraging the region’s abundant biomass and cutting-edge carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) infrastructure. According to industry reports, the U.S. Gulf Coast is on track to become a CCS leader, with more than 80 million metric tons of annual capacity in development. These hubs don’t just store emissions — they enable large-scale industrial decarbonization and could unlock export-ready carbon solutions in a rapidly evolving energy marketplace.

But Singal’s model of leadership doesn’t stop at state lines. He champions commercial partnerships that allow U.S.-based technologies to meet sustainability needs across international markets. These aren’t philanthropic ventures; they’re built around shared commercial interests. The idea is simple: if advanced biofuels or clean hydrogen can be produced at scale using American expertise, they can serve global demand while driving value at home.

He’s particularly focused on market pathways that allow companies to deploy U.S. feedstocks and processing technology through strategically located facilities, whether domestically or abroad. These kinds of efforts reduce supply chain volatility and allow private firms to meet growing international sustainability standards on competitive terms.

Clean hydrogen, for instance, is rapidly gaining momentum in the energy sector. In the U.S., initiatives like the Hydrogen Shot aim to dramatically reduce production costs and expand availability. Singal sees a direct role for private innovators in scaling these technologies — not just in producing them, but in aligning infrastructure, investment, and supply chain capacity for long-term impact.

Singal’s role in these ecosystems is not that of a public official or lobbyist, but of a translator, someone who can bridge policy, capital, and industrial know-how. He speaks the language of markets as fluently as that of environmental science. His background allows him to see beyond short-term incentives and understand how lasting infrastructure must be structured to drive results and attract capital.

That’s why he’s cautious about overly relying on subsidies or temporary tax relief. “If your business model only works because of handouts, it’s not a business, it’s a liability,” he says. “We need to build systems that are cost-competitive and resilient to external factors. That’s what buyers want, and it’s what responsible entrepreneurship demands.”

True to his private-sector roots, Singal is a staunch advocate for U.S.-based production. But he also believes American products must be globally relevant. “Serving international markets from a domestic base isn’t just smart, it’s strategic. When we export real solutions, we shape global trends, create jobs, and keep capital circulating inside our economy.”

This pragmatic approach is resonating with business leaders across multiple sectors, especially those looking to align growth with sustainability without losing sight of cost discipline. Singal often consults with executives exploring how to make sustainability work for their bottom lines. His message is consistent: decarbonization doesn’t have to mean deindustrialization. With smart policy frameworks and entrepreneurial leadership, the U.S. can lead the next generation of energy and infrastructure technologies.

This thinking is particularly relevant in the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector, a space Singal is deeply involved in. As airlines face increasing pressure to reduce emissions, the challenge lies in building a cost-effective, scalable supply of sustainable fuel. Singal’s work is focused on unlocking that potential by leveraging U.S. feedstocks such as agricultural residues and woody biomass, and refining them either domestically or through select global processing hubs. The result is a more reliable, politically stable supply chain that meets international standards without compromising competitiveness.

At the core of Singal’s philosophy is a belief in alignment between market opportunity and sustainability, between growth and responsibility. He rejects the notion that environmentally conscious business must come at the expense of fiscal discipline or national strength. He is also attentive to how critical energy assets are structured, with a preference for domestic control and transparent investment models.

“We should be exporting our capabilities and leadership, not our control. Climate progress isn’t about compliance, it’s about direction. If we want to shape the future, we need to lead it on our terms,” he says.

Singal’s influence continues to grow as businesses seek practical roadmaps for navigating the green transition. His ability to bring clarity to complex systems and connect industrial ambition with environmental responsibility makes him a valuable advisor to executives and stakeholders looking for more than slogans. His model is based on mutual value: the private sector drives innovation, markets reward impact, and industries transition without losing their edge.

There’s something deeply American about Singal’s story. His career trajectory perfectly encompasses both the American Dream and a thirst for making the world a better place. His work doesn’t make headlines every day, but it’s shaping how governments and businesses alike think about the green transition, not as a burden, but as an opportunity for U.S. strength and global cooperation.

“The next decade will determine who leads the global economy, and it won’t just be about output, but about purpose. America has the tools: capital, technology, and talent. If we lead with intention, the results will follow. This is a moment not just for innovation, but for leadership that lasts.” He concluded.",https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1592-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 06:57:07.797860

Despite modest profitability gains in 2025—projected net profits of $36.6 billion and a 3.6% margin—the sector remains trapped in a cycle of thin margins, volatile costs, and systemic fragility. This is not a temporary setback but a structural collapse driven by three interlocking forces: profitability erosion, labor instability, and infrastructure fragility. For investors, the implications are clear: the era of aviation as a reliable growth engine is over. The time to reallocate capital to resilient alternatives—rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms—is now.

The Structural Decline of Aviation

The aviation sector's struggles are rooted in its inability to adapt to a post-pandemic world. While passenger numbers are surging (5.2 billion in 2025), the cost of serving these customers is rising faster. Labor costs alone are projected to grow by 7.6% in 2025, driven by a 4% increase in the global workforce to 3.3 million employees. Airlines are paying premiums to attract and retain pilots, mechanics, and cabin crew, with wages rising 10–15% annually in key markets. Meanwhile, fuel costs—though down 4.8% due to lower oil prices—still account for 26.4% of operating expenses, and compliance with carbon offset programs (CORSIA) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates will add $4.8 billion to industry costs in 2025.

Infrastructure bottlenecks compound these issues. Airports are struggling to modernize aging systems, while supply chain disruptions for aircraft parts have pushed lead times to over a year. Airbus's A350 production is capped at six units per month, and the industry's reliance on rare earth elements for electrification efforts creates new vulnerabilities. Geopolitical risks—ranging from U.S. trade policy shifts to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East—add further uncertainty.

The Workforce Crisis: A Talent Drain and Retention Quagmire

The aviation workforce is in turmoil. The IATA Global Skills Survey highlights a critical shortage of pilots and technicians, with training bottlenecks delaying hiring by 18–24 months. Airlines are caught in a vicious cycle: higher wages to attract talent erode margins, while automation and AI adoption risk displing workers. For example, AI-driven cockpit assistance and single-pilot operations are already under scrutiny by pilot unions, who fear safety compromises. Meanwhile, the rise of space tourism and defense aerospace is siphoning talent away from traditional aviation, exacerbating the ""brain drain.""

Labor costs are no longer a line item but a strategic liability. Low-cost carriers, which once thrived on razor-thin margins, are now grappling with a 20% projected shortfall in maintenance technicians by 2028. Full-service airlines are not immune; their focus on premium services and crew welfare has led to a 6.7% rise in labor costs, outpacing revenue growth. The result? A sector where even modest profitability gains are offset by rising operational fragility.

Infrastructure Fragility: A System on the Brink

The aviation industry's infrastructure is a patchwork of outdated systems and unmet modernization needs. Air traffic control (ATC) systems in the U.S., India, and parts of Africa remain decades behind global standards, contributing to delays and safety risks. The 2024 FAA Reauthorization allocated $105.5 billion to modernize ATC, but progress is glacial. Meanwhile, the integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and AI-driven logistics is stymied by regulatory inertia and incompatible legacy systems.

Environmental regulations add another layer of complexity. The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation mandate—requiring a 70% SAF blend by 2050—has pushed airlines into uncharted financial territory. SAF costs are 2–3 times higher than conventional jet fuel, and production capacity remains insufficient. Airlines are caught between regulatory compliance and shareholder expectations, with many forced to pass costs to consumers through higher ticket prices.

The Case for Sector Rotation: Resilient Alternatives

As aviation's structural weaknesses crystallize, investors must pivot to sectors poised to benefit from the post-aviation travel shift. Three areas stand out: rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms.

1. Rail: The Digital Renaissance of Connectivity

The global digital railway market is projected to grow from $83.74 billion in 2024 to $230.60 billion by 2034, driven by AI, IoT, and 5G integration. Governments in Asia Pacific—led by India, China, and South Korea—are investing heavily in smart infrastructure, with digital rail systems enhancing freight logistics and passenger mobility. For example, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) reported a 100-basis-point improvement in its operating ratio to 59.0% in Q2 2025, driven by higher freight volumes and core pricing gains. Its free cash flow of $1.105 billion year-to-date underscores the sector's resilience.

2. Regional Logistics: The Urbanization-Driven Boom

Urbanization and e-commerce are fueling demand for regional logistics networks. In Asia Pacific, where 60% of the global population growth is concentrated, companies are leveraging AI and IoT to optimize last-mile delivery. The region's logistics sector is expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2030, outpacing global averages. Investors should target firms with exposure to smart warehousing, drone delivery, and cross-border e-commerce platforms.

3. Digital Travel Platforms: The Integrated Future of Mobility

Digital travel platforms are emerging as undervalued beneficiaries of the aviation sector's decline. As airlines face fare volatility and operational inefficiencies, travelers are increasingly relying on integrated platforms that combine rail, regional air, and digital services. These platforms, which leverage AI for route optimization and real-time booking, are projected to capture 30% of the global travel market by 2030.

Conclusion: A Strategic Reallocation Imperative

The aviation industry's perfect storm—structural decline, labor instability, and infrastructure fragility—demands immediate portfolio reallocation. Investors who cling to airlines risk being caught in a sector where even modest gains are offset by systemic risks. By contrast, rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms offer a path to resilience, growth, and long-term value creation.

As disruptions challenge global supply chains, air freight emerges as a critical enabler of continuity and efficiency.

This article outlines six major forces behind the expansion of international air freight, each contributing to its rising demand and shaping the future of global logistics.

1. E-commerce Expansion Is Boosting Air Freight Demand

Online shopping continues to grow at double-digit rates worldwide, changing how consumers order and how businesses deliver. With mobile commerce rising and platforms becoming more global, buyers now expect orders within days—even when shipped internationally. This shift has pushed businesses to make air freight central to their fulfillment approach.

For instance, Amazon Air has reshaped India's e-commerce delivery by operating the only dedicated air cargo fleet in the country, currently using two aircraft to transport tens of thousands of packages daily. Since its 2023 launch connecting four major cities, it has expanded to serve 12 cities via air and multimodal air-rail networks, covering over 100 origin-destination pairs. Amazon Air significantly boosts next-day delivery with over 99% on-time performance, overcoming India’s logistical challenges through precise overnight operations, enhancing delivery speed, reliability, and scale ahead of events like Prime Day.

Similarly, in March 2025, CEVA Logistics launched a direct air charter between Wuxi and Chicago to meet growing e-commerce demand, increasing trans-Pacific capacity and shortening delivery times for online retailers. Retailers, DTC brands, and global marketplaces are using air cargo to meet fast delivery expectations and provide consistent service. Fulfillment centers are being located near major airports to support this.

Key Drivers:

Demand for fast, cross-border delivery

Growth of mobile-first and international online retail

Dependence on air cargo for time-sensitive, high-value goods

Retailers are also offering premium delivery options that rely heavily on air transport, as more customers are willing to pay for guaranteed speed. As e-commerce reaches deeper into emerging markets, air freight will continue to play a vital role in expanding reach and meeting service standards.

2. Global Trade Growth Is Lifting International Air Cargo

Cross-border trade continues to fuel economic activity, and its recovery is driving up air freight volumes. As companies expand their sourcing and sales internationally, they’re leaning more on fast, dependable shipping solutions.

In June 2025, global air cargo demand grew modestly by 0.8% year-on-year, driven by a 9.0% surge in Asia-Pacific amid trade tensions and military conflicts impacting other regions. Capacity rose 1.7%, but load factor declined to 45.5%. North America and the Middle East saw notable demand drops (-8.3% and -3.2%, respectively), while Europe had minimal growth (0.8%). Key trade lanes like Europe-Asia (+10.6%) expanded, contrasting with declines on Asia-North America (-4.8%). Lower jet fuel prices and global manufacturing recovery underpin mixed regional performance.

Air freight remains especially important in sectors where delays aren’t an option. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and precision equipment all require fast, secure, and compliant delivery.

Key Drivers:

Multinational manufacturers are using air freight to avoid production delays caused by late components. In complex supply chains, quick shipping ensures smooth operations—especially during peak seasons or amid policy changes.

3. Fleet Expansion and Route Optimization Support Growth

Modernization of cargo fleets is helping the air freight sector keep pace with demand. Airlines are adding wide-body freighters and upgrading aircraft for better efficiency and cargo space. These investments give operators more flexibility along busy routes.

For instance, between March 2024 and March 2025, Amazon Air expanded its U.S. fleet’s cargo capabilities, with a 14% increase in weight capacity and a 12.9% rise in volume. The fleet now includes ten Airbus A330-300 freighters, seven of which joined within the last year. These widebody jets surpass the Boeing 767-300s—Amazon’s second-largest aircraft—in carrying capacity, offering 17% more in tonnage and 6% more in volume. Widebody aircraft now account for more than 75% of Amazon’s domestic available ton-miles, a sharp rise from figures reported three years earlier.

Passenger airlines are also using cargo space on long-haul flights, allowing for extra volume without deploying dedicated freighters. This approach has been key during peak demand or lower passenger traffic.

Key Drivers:

Larger freighter fleets on major trade lanes

Increased use of cargo holds in passenger aircraft

Upgraded airport cargo terminals and logistics hubs

Smarter routing and AI-based network planning

Airport investments are improving infrastructure, from cold storage and automation to customs pre-clearance. In May 2025, AISATS opened a new logistics park at Bengaluru Airport featuring cold chain capabilities, automated handling, and integrated customs systems. These updates reduce delays and boost capacity, making air freight more dependable.

4. Technology Is Reshaping Air Freight Operations

Digital tools are improving every stage of the air freight process. Carriers and logistics firms are adopting automation, predictive models, and real-time tracking to give customers better visibility and control.

Today’s shippers expect to monitor shipments end-to-end, receive live updates on delays, and track environmental conditions like temperature or vibration. This is especially crucial in sectors like biotech, electronics, and aerospace.

In June 2025, Etihad Cargo rolled out SmartTrack, a sensor-based tracking platform offering real-time shipment data, condition monitoring, and improved oversight. Similarly, cargo.one introduced AI-powered automation and unified workflows to streamline air freight quoting for forwarders in July 2025. It automates shipment data extraction, rate collection, and consolidates all rates—including ad hoc and manual airline rates—into a single platform. A central queue enhances team collaboration, syncing quotes with TMS for faster processing and higher conversion. These innovations boost efficiency by eliminating manual tasks, allowing focus on customer relationships and strategic activities.

Key Drivers:

Use of IoT, GPS, and smart containers

AI-powered forecasting and dispatch systems

Online booking and rate comparison tools

Blockchain-enabled customs and documentation

By reducing manual steps and improving tracking, digital platforms help teams plan more efficiently and avoid surprises. These improvements also support better communication and service quality, which strengthens customer relationships.

5. Adapting to Shifting Trade Policies and Geopolitics

Changing trade agreements, tariffs, and customs rules are forcing businesses to rethink logistics strategies. In these cases, air freight offers the speed and adaptability needed to respond quickly.

Shifts in trade policies—most notably the United States’ elimination of the de minimis threshold for low-value imports from China in May 2025—have significantly disrupted established air freight patterns. This policy change led to a sharp 27% year-over-year drop in air cargo volumes from China to the U.S., prompting a global reconfiguration of trade routes and supply chain strategies. Furthermore, deals like the RCEP and updates to the USMCA have led companies to revise trade lanes. Many now use air shipping to avoid congested or unstable routes and take advantage of new corridors.

Key Drivers:

Carriers are increasing use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), upgrading to fuel-efficient aircraft, and switching to electric vehicles for ground handling. In April 2025, IATA launched a global SAF Registry through CADO, enabling airlines to track SAF usage and cut lifecycle emissions. According to the IATA, global production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to double in 2025, reaching approximately 2 million tons. This would account for about 0.7% of the total fuel consumed by airlines worldwide—a notable rise from the 0.3% share in 2024. Despite the growth, SAF still comprises a relatively small fraction of overall aviation fuel use, highlighting the considerable gap that remains to meet net-zero emission targets.

Key Drivers:

Wider adoption of SAF and cleaner propulsion

New aircraft with better fuel efficiency

Solar-powered, energy-efficient terminals

Built-in emissions tracking in freight platforms

Shippers are also driving change. Many now ask for carbon data in bids and prefer carriers with certified green programs. As carbon regulations expand, sustainable air freight is becoming the new standard—not a premium offering. To meet the growing demand, Neste commenced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production at its Rotterdam refinery in April 2025, boosting its global SAF capacity to 1.5 million tons annually. The refinery, capable of producing up to 500,000 tons of SAF yearly, is undergoing expansion to increase renewable fuel output to 2.7 million tons by 2027, making it the largest renewable diesel and SAF facility worldwide. Neste’s total renewable fuels capacity will reach 6.8 million tons, with SAF capacity growing to 2.2 million tons, strengthening its role in reducing aviation emissions.

Why Air Freight Matters Now More Than Ever

Air freight is growing rapidly, powered by rising e-commerce, global trade, smarter logistics, and sustainability goals. These drivers are not just trends—they’re reshaping how goods move internationally.

Wizz Air is proactively ahead of both EU and UK mandates, having adopted a diversified portfolio approach that includes investment in SAF production, multiple memoranda of understanding, and two long-term offtake agreements – including the partnership with Firefly in the UK.","Wizz Air UK’s managing director, Yvonne Moynihan, visited the facilities of Firefly Green Fuels, a key strategic partner in the airline’s journey to net-zero emissions by 2050.

The visit showcases ongoing successful collaboration between the two organisations and underlines commitment to scaling up the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK.

During the visit, Ms Moynihan met with Firefly’s leadership team, toured the site, and reviewed progress on the development of SAF production capabilities. The discussions focused on the importance of SAF in driving aviation decarbonisation and on the innovative technologies being developed at Firefly to produce SAF from sewage sludge – a low-cost, waste-based feedstock with strong decarbonisation potential.

The site, which is owned by Haltermann Carless, is located with existing infrastructure to upgrade the fuel and strong transport links to London airports.

Firefly is on track to meet their proposed completion date on the first facility in 2029, with additional facilities planned across several other geographies. The Harwich facility will bring new green energy jobs to the area and enjoys strong support from local MPs and residents. The project is expected to contribute to UK energy security while creating a much-needed new disposal pathway for sewage waste.

Despite challenging global M&A market conditions, Chinese investments in Brazil jumped 64 percent year-over-year, though deal count dropped, signalling a mature shift toward fewer but larger, high-impact acquisitions.

This momentum accelerated following Brazilian President Lula's May 2025 Beijing visit, which secured over $4.5 billion in new Chinese investments [2], including: Envision Group ($1 billion sustainable aviation fuel), CGN Power (~$529 million wind/solar), Great Wall Motors (~$1.05 billion automotive), and Longsys (~$423 million semiconductors).

Energy and Critical Minerals Drive Investment Wave

A&M analysis of 94 Chinese investments over the past five years shows Energy and Natural Resources accounting for 85 percent of total announced deal value—over $19 billion.

Chinese companies are spearheading Brazil's renewable transformation: State Power Investment Corp leads major solar projects including the Luiz Gonzaga Complex, China Three Gorges has invested $68 million in hydro projects, and State Grid secured nearly $5 billion for transmission infrastructure. This supports Brazil's standout energy profile—90 percent of electricity from low-carbon sources, far outpacing the 41 percent global average [3].

China's focus on critical minerals, especially lithium, underpins this trend with major deals worth over $2.2 billion since August 2020. Brazil's emerging ""Lithium Valley"" offers compelling advantages: high-grade spodumene deposits, competitive production costs, and strategic proximity to US and European markets.

Strategic Spotlights

EVs: Chinese cars have become ubiquitous in Brazilian streets, with rapidly increasing market share. Chinese automakers captured 80 percent of Brazil's EV market share in the first half of 2025 [4], with BYD dominating pure electric vehicles at over 75 percent market share [5]. Local manufacturing by BYD and Great Wall Motors, combined with Geely's Renault partnership, further demonstrate strategic localization approaches, while positioning Brazil as Latin America's EV export hub.

Tech Expansion: Chinese technology companies are making strategic advances into Brazil's food delivery service industry. Meituan plans to invest $1 billion over five years to launch Keeta, representing a direct challenge to dominant player iFood [6], while DiDi relaunched operations through 99 Food in 2025 after a previous suspension [7]. These moves signal Chinese tech firms' search for growth overseas amid intense home-market competition.

AI Opportunity: Brazil's AI market is projected to reach $4.42 billion by 2025, and $17.91 billion by 2031 [8]. Brazilian Government support through the R$23 billion National AI Plan and renewable energy mandates for data centers creates opportunities for tech giants like Huawei (cloud service since 2019) and Tencent (São Paulo data center since 2021). Brazil is emerging as a key AI battleground where Chinese expertise offers an advantage, but success requires local partnerships to navigate evolving regulations and seize growth opportunities.

A&M Cross-Border Expertise

Successful China-Brazil investment execution requires deep expertise across regulatory environments, cultural contexts, and operational complexities. A&M brings deep expertise in helping Chinese companies access the Brazilian market and vice-versa, with experienced professionals in both countries.

A&M Strategic Recommendations

For Chinese Companies:

Deploy real-time BRICS market intelligence—track minerals, renewable incentives, and regulatory shifts.

Carefully vet local partners—select customs, tax, and compliance experts with China-Brazil credentials to avoid surprises.

Identify funding partners early—prioritize those with local market coverage and currency capabilities.

Accelerate your market-entry timeline—fast-track manufacturing to get ahead of rising EV tariffs.

For Brazilian Businesses:

Integrate beyond raw exports—move up the value chain with processing and battery-pack capabilities.

Build EV supply-chain readiness—align processes with leading OEM standards.

Actively leverage digital partnerships—collaborate with Chinese tech leaders for e-commerce, AI, and logistics.

For Investment Professionals:

Shift focus to deal quality—prioritize fewer, higher-impact transactions.

Target ""Lithium Valley"" advantages—rigorously assess asset quality and cost structures.

Evaluate AI and green energy platforms—capitalize on incentives and Brazil's strong renewables profile.

Position Brazil as a BRICS hedge—diversify strategies to leverage Brazil's rising influence in EV and critical minerals amid global trade volatility.

China, Malaysia and Singapore account for 70 per cent of imports of the fuel, Department of Climate Change and Energy data show.
Forshaw said the introduction of a 1-2 per cent mandate would provide the signal needed for investors to commit to new local sustainable aviation fuel projects and help safeguard Australia’s long-term fuel supply.
These “IEA days” include fuel on ships bound for Australia as well as that stored domestically.
A government spokesman said Labor had invested $250 million in the low-carbon liquid fuel industry through its Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.","The local boss of aviation juggernaut Airbus warns that Australia is at risk of sleepwalking into a fuel security crisis and missing its long-term climate targets unless the government forces airlines to use sustainable fuel.

Airbus Australia’s chief representative, Stephen Forshaw, said a mandate of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent on the use of sustainable fuels by aircraft would kickstart a local biofuels industry, cut emissions and reduce the country’s heavy reliance on imported fuel.

Over the past decade, Australia has doubled its dependence on imported jet fuel to more than 7 billion litres, more than one quarter of which comes from Chinese refineries. China, Malaysia and Singapore account for 70 per cent of imports of the fuel, Department of Climate Change and Energy data show.

Low-carbon fuels are derived from renewable or sustainable sources such as feedstocks and waste products and can be “dropped in” as a direct replacement for fossil fuels without major capital outlays or equipment upgrades.

Australia exports a huge proportion of the products required to make clean fuels – such as sugarcane, canola and tallow – but is a global laggard in their development and has no existing operational projects. Singapore, by contrast, has the capacity to produce more than 1 billion litres of biofuel.

Forshaw said the introduction of a 1-2 per cent mandate would provide the signal needed for investors to commit to new local sustainable aviation fuel projects and help safeguard Australia’s long-term fuel supply. The 2 per cent figure is higher than that previously suggested by industry.

“If we don’t move quickly to seize this opportunity, we run a real risk that the future will be made in Singapore, not Australia,” he said. “We want to use our feedstock here to produce fuels here, power our industry here and capture the economic and security benefits here.

“We can’t afford to default to what we’ve been historically pretty good at in Australia – exporting our raw commodities for others to process. Doing this, we simply export the opportunity to others.”

Defence experts sounded the alarm about Australia’s fuel supply levels as recently as June, when US bombing of Iran prompted fears the Middle Eastern nation would close access to a key trading route – and access to critical supplies of oil.

Under protocols laid down by the International Energy Agency, nations should hold at least 90 days of oil stocks in reserve. These “IEA days” include fuel on ships bound for Australia as well as that stored domestically.

According to the most recent government data, in May Australia had 48 days of imported oil coverage and only 17 days worth of jet fuel supplies.

Forshaw will tell a major industry conference on Tuesday that Australia can no longer depend on a “benign” trade environment for its future fuel imports.

“Cross-border supply chains grew during times when the benefits of globalisation were understood. Their resilience is being increasingly challenged by growing nationalism, protectionist trade policies and security challenges,” he said.

“Fuel underpins energy and transport, and powers our wider economies – literally.”

In July, government green bank the Clean Energy Finance Corporation said fuel security risks could become “particularly pertinent” for Australia’s defence forces, which will be reliant on liquid fuels for many decades.

The corporation also said Australia’s failure to develop a biofuel industry would put its net-zero targets out of reach in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and long-haul trucking.

The Albanese government is set to reveal a new 2035 target for reducing carbon emissions in coming weeks. The Climate Change Authority, which is advising on the target, has previously sought feedback on a goal in the range of 65 to 75 per cent on 2005 levels.

A target in such a range would require a significant uplift from the existing 2030 target of a 43 per cent – including from the aviation and heavy transport sectors.

A government spokesman said Labor had invested $250 million in the low-carbon liquid fuel industry through its Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

Airbus is an investor in a SAF project near Townsville called Jet Zero. Forshaw said well-designed production tax credits would help narrow the gap between the price of SAF and that of traditional jet fuel – which is a key barrier to the industry’s development.

“We can’t ask governments to support endlessly, and we have to be realistic that funds are scarce, so measures need to be well-targeted and designed to encourage the private sector to invest,” he said.",https://acapmag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1372488167-4.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 22:56:44.140053

“Boeing’s ITB investments in Canada reflect our commitment to fostering innovation and supporting local communities,” said Al Meinzinger, President of Boeing Canada.
These partnerships have not only bolstered Boeing’s Canadian operations but have also contributed significantly to the development of Canada’s aerospace industry, driving job creation and economic growth nationwide.","Boeing’s recent investments underscore its dedication to Canada’s aerospace sector, particularly in British Columbia. At the Abbotsford International Airshow on August 8, 2025, the aerospace giant revealed a significant boost in its Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) investments, amounting to $345 million CAD. This investment follows the Canadian government’s selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon aircraft to meet its long-range Multi-Mission Aircraft needs, further solidifying Boeing’s ongoing relationship with Canada’s aerospace and defence industry.

Key initiatives over the past year highlight Boeing’s proactive approach in supporting both local and national aerospace ventures. Among these are:

$61 million CAD directed towards British Columbia’s aerospace sector, reinforcing local enterprises such as Boeing Vancouver and COTA Aviation. This funding supports the expansion of the province’s aerospace capabilities, benefiting the regional industry ecosystem.

$17.48 million CAD allocated to sustainable aviation fuel projects, including $7.48 million for a groundbreaking Dimensional Energy project in Richmond, B.C. This initiative transforms industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel, positioning Canada at the forefront of sustainable aviation efforts.

$240 million CAD in Québec, with investments fostering innovation in the aerospace sector through collaborations with key players like Wisk Aero, Héroux-Devtek, and the Aerospace Development Centre in the newly established Québec Espace Aéro Innovation Zone. These investments fuel technological advancements and innovative breakthroughs.

$17 million CAD aimed at Indigenous education through a partnership with the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies (SIIT). This funding supports the expansion of the Saskatchewan Aviation Learning Centre, addressing the global shortage of skilled Aircraft Maintenance Engineers.

$10.3 million CAD invested in Solace Power, a Newfoundland-based company specializing in wireless power, sensing, and data technologies for high-growth industries, including aerospace, telecom, and automotive. This investment nurtures innovation within the local tech sector.

“Boeing’s ITB investments in Canada reflect our commitment to fostering innovation and supporting local communities,” said Al Meinzinger, President of Boeing Canada. “With 106 years of history in Canada and 500 suppliers spanning every province, we are proud to partner with Canadian organizations and invest in initiatives that will have a lasting impact on the aerospace industry and the communities we serve.”

Boeing’s commitment to these initiatives is part of its broader history of successful ITB programs in Canada, having completed over $15.5 billion CAD in ITB projects over the past four decades. These partnerships have not only bolstered Boeing’s Canadian operations but have also contributed significantly to the development of Canada’s aerospace industry, driving job creation and economic growth nationwide.

“Boeing’s $13 million CAD investment under the P-8 ITB program has been transformative for COTA Aviation,” said Kyle Kusznieryk, CEO of BC-based COTA Aviation. “With their support, we’ve been able to strategically acquire advanced manufacturing equipment that expands both our capacity and technical capabilities. This has directly enabled us to take on new aerospace and defence production programs and launch a recruitment campaign to support our continued growth.”

The selection of the P-8A as Canada’s Multi-Mission Aircraft has had a ripple effect on the country’s economy. Currently, 81 Boeing suppliers across Canada are involved in the production of the P-8A, with each of the 170+ aircraft in global operation containing over $11 million CAD worth of Canadian-made content. To date, Boeing has awarded over $2 billion CAD in P-8 contracts to Canadian companies.

Recent innovations—from AI-driven biomass optimization to converting food waste into biogas, hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel—are transforming the sector. In India, the Ethanol Blending Program (EBP) has been a gamechanger, achieving 20% ethanol blending (E20) in petrol by March 2025, ahead of schedule. This has saved ₹1.36 lakh crore in FOREX, boosted farmers’ incomes, and reduced GHG emissions. Benefits include reduced oil imports, enhanced energy security, rural economic growth, and cleaner air. Challenges remain in feedstock availability, vehicle compatibility, water use, and food security. With government support and new technologies like 2G ethanol from agri-waste, India is on track to strengthen energy security, support rural economies, and combat climate change.

,,2025-08-10 13:17:43+00:00,Alapjárat,Biodízel-világnap: kimagaslóan nyitottak a magyarok a fenntartható mobilitás lehetőségeire,Not Available,,,,,https://alapjarat.hu/aktualis/biodizel-vilagnap-kimagasloan-nyitottak-magyarok-fenntarthato-mobilitas-lehetosegeire,"A válaszok alapján a magyar autóvezetők 83%-a számára fontos, hogy az autójához használt üzemanyag fenntartható forrásból származzon.
„Szükség van az állami szerepvállalásra és a gyártó cégeket ösztönző, támogató jogszabályi környezetre az alternatív, fenntartható üzemanyagok elterjedése érdekében.” - ezzel az állítással a lakosság 64%-a ért egyet.
A MOL-csoport frissített SHAPE TOMORROW stratégiájában kiemelt hangsúlyt kapnak a megújuló üzemanyagok.
„A MOL a már ma is állít elő megújuló alapanyagokból dízel-, valamint fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyagot, és készen áll ennek bővítésére.
SAF csak klasszikus megújuló (például növényi) alapanyagból vagy hulladékból készülhet, de ugyanúgy teljesítenie kell a műszaki és a környezetvédelmi előírásokat, mint a hagyományos kerozinnak.","A magyar felnőttek közel kétharmada hezitálás nélkül utazna bioüzemanyaggal működő repülővel is – ami különösen azzal összevetve tanulságos, hogy egy önvezető autóban történő utazást (ami technikailag ma már többé-kevésbé reális lehetőség) csak 40%-nyian vállalnának be jelenleg. A friss adatok a MOL megbízásából készített országos reprezentatív kutatásból származnak. A felmérésből kiderült: kiemelkedő, 80 százalékot is meghaladó a bioüzemanyag-hajtású repülőgépen való utazási hajlandóság a 30–39 évesek körében. Hasonlóan magas ez az arány a felsőfokú végzettségűek között is – a 65 év felettieknek viszont csupán a 39%-a utazna olyan légijárművön, amit bioüzemanyag hajt.

A válaszok alapján a magyar autóvezetők 83%-a számára fontos, hogy az autójához használt üzemanyag fenntartható forrásból származzon. Különösen igaz ez a férfiakra, illetve az 50 éven felüli autóvezetőkre. Az adatok egy látszólagos ellentmondásra is rámutatnak: miközben a legtöbben valamilyen anyagi előny vagy ösztönzés hatására váltanának zöldebb üzemanyagra (tízből kilenc válaszadó jelölt meg ilyen tartalmú válaszlehetőséget azok közül, akik eleve nyitottak a fenntartható üzemanyagok használatára), minden második autóvezető már ma is hajlandó lenne valamennyivel többet fizetni a bizonyíthatóan megújuló forrásból származó energiáért. A kérdezettek 68%-a hidrogénhajtású autóba is szívesen beülne.

Az alternatív üzemanyagokra váltás jelenlegi megítélése elsősorban a költségektől függ: a leghatékonyabb ösztönző az alacsony ár és a költséghatékonyság lenne, kiemelten az idősebb korosztály (50 éven felüliek), és az alacsonyabb iskolai végzettségűek körében. „Szükség van az állami szerepvállalásra és a gyártó cégeket ösztönző, támogató jogszabályi környezetre az alternatív, fenntartható üzemanyagok elterjedése érdekében.” - ezzel az állítással a lakosság 64%-a ért egyet. Az életkor, az iskolai végzettség és a településméret növekedésével párhuzamosan nő az állami szerepvállalás iránti igény.

Az ellentmondást a demográfiai eltérések oldják fel: ártöbbletet jellemzően a fiatalok és a diplomások hajlandóak fizetni a zöld üzemanyagokkal együtt járó tisztább környezetért, míg az árelőnyt igénylők relatív többsége az 50 feletti korosztályból kerül ki. Az is fontos tapasztalata ugyanakkor a kutatásnak, hogy a zöldátállás esetében a második leggyakrabban említett motiváció maga a fenntarthatóság, a környezet megvédésének szándéka, vagyis a CO₂-kibocsátás csökkentése, a levegő tisztasága, illetve az ökológiai egyensúly megőrzése. Ezeket a környezeti-természeti szempontokat elsősorban a fiatalabb (18–39 éves) válaszadók és a diplomások emelték ki a válaszaikban.

A MOL-csoport frissített SHAPE TOMORROW stratégiájában kiemelt hangsúlyt kapnak a megújuló üzemanyagok. A MOL már jelenleg is a hazai és a regionális bioüzemanyag-piac kulcsszereplője (a hulladékból, vagyis megújuló alapanyagból előállított hidrogénezett növényi olaj a leginkább klímabarát üzemanyagok közé tartozik), és európai összevetésben is az úttörők közé tartozik a repülőgép-bioüzemanyagok előállításában.

„A MOL a már ma is állít elő megújuló alapanyagokból dízel-, valamint fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyagot, és készen áll ennek bővítésére. A felkészültség azt jelzi, hogy a vállalatcsoport valóban stratégiai célként tekint a fenntartható mobilitásra, legyen szó akár a közúti, akár a légi közlekedésről. A komplex mobilitási szolgáltatóvá válás számunkra azt jelenti, hogy egyre többféle üzemanyagot kínálunk, megteremtve az okos energiaátmenet minden szükséges feltételét ügyfeleink számára. Ebben a folyamatban már ma is vezető szerepet játszunk a régióban, amit beruházásaink és fejlesztéseink révén tartósan meg kívánunk őrizni” – nyilatkozta Zsótér Csaba, a MOL-csoport üzemanyag üzletágának ügyvezető igazgatója.

A vállalat – egyebek között a Szegedi Tudományegyetemmel és a Pannon Egyetemmel együttműködve – folyamatosan kutatja és fejleszti a bioüzemanyagok előállításának, illetve felhasználásának új lehetőségeit. A Budapest Airporttal, a Wizz Airrel és a Repülőtéri Üzemanyag Kiszolgáló Kft.-vel együttműködve a MOL 2022-ben kezdte meg a fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyag (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, azaz SAF) kereskedelmi tesztelését. Erre alapozva ma már üzemvitel-szerűen értékesít SAF-ot Magyarországon Szlovákiában és Horvátországban, hozzávetőlegesen 14 kilotonna biokomponensnek megfelelő mennyiségben A vállalatcsoporthoz tartozó Slovnaft pozsonyi üzemében az idei év eleje óta immár a SAF-gyártás tesztelése zajlik – a hidrogénezett növényi olajat (HVO) tartalmazó dízel előállítása mellett -, a szintén csoporttag INA rijekai finomítójában pedig az elmúlt hetekben indult meg a SAF termelése annak érdekében, hogy az érintett országok teljesíteni tudják az EU megújuló üzemanyagok arányára vonatkozó 2030-as 6%-os célszámát.

SAF csak klasszikus megújuló (például növényi) alapanyagból vagy hulladékból készülhet, de ugyanúgy teljesítenie kell a műszaki és a környezetvédelmi előírásokat, mint a hagyományos kerozinnak. Jelenleg globálisan is alig néhány olajfinomító mondható felkészültnek a fenntartható repülőgépüzemanyag-előállításra. A mai és a prognosztizált SAF-kínálat is lényegesen elmarad a kereslettől – amit az árak is tükröznek -, ezért van stratégiai jelentősége a MOL fejlesztéseinek mind klímavédelmi, mind ellátási szempontból.",https://alapjarat.hu/sites/default/files/styles/metatag/public/tankolas-no-d.jpg?itok=BnYKgzEb,N,,2025-08-10 12:56:55.096738

Virgin Australia’s New Growth Path and Fleet Expansion

In his keynote speech, Dave Emerson, Virgin Australia’s CEO, accentuated the value segment enhancement. Virgin was aiming its marketing at small business, corporate value, and premium leisure travellers. Emerson explained how Virgin Australia is attempting to capture about one-third of the domestic market share, a figure the airlines is focused on increasing in the airline’s customer base in these segments to flex further.

Recently, the airline achieved significant milestones, including its successful IPO, which attracted a 25% investment from Qatar Airways. This strategic partnership also resulted in launching new international flights from Australia to Doha. Emerson added that Virgin Australia’s future plans include fleet expansion with 16 new aircraft, including the Boeing 737 MAX and Embraer E-Jets E2, slated for delivery in the coming fiscal year.

The airline’s fleet renewal program aims to modernize its aircraft while remaining financially efficient, relying on cash flow rather than raising additional capital. The company has grown from a post-administration fleet of 58 aircraft to over 100 in operation today. Additionally, Virgin Australia is introducing pet-friendly flights as part of its customer experience enhancement efforts.

Managing Risks in a Volatile Global Environment

Austrian Capital Territory’s Chief Minister Andrew Barr, ACCC’s Matthew Schroder, and Cairns Airport’s CEO Richard Barker participated in a panel discussion focusing on an important topic of concern in the world today; the need to manage risks considering the current global climate.

As the aviation industry faces numerous challenges, including geopolitical instability, fuel price volatility, and the fast-paced advancements in AI technology, the panelists discussed strategies to ensure sustainable airline operations and competitive pricing.

Matthew Schroder mentioned that the ACCC had approved the Qatar Airways-Virgin Australia strategic partnership, highlighting its potential to boost competition and offer significant benefits to Australian consumers, including better access to international routes, including a daily flight from Canberra to Doha starting December 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Net-Zero Emissions Goals

The summit placed a strong emphasis on aviation sustainability. With the Australian aviation sector facing increased pressure to meet net-zero emissions goals, panelists from Air New Zealand, Qantas, and Boeing discussed the challenges and opportunities in adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s Sustainability Lead for the South Pacific, outlined the critical role SAF will play in decarbonizing the aviation industry. However, she pointed out that SAF adoption has been slow due to the limited local production and high costs, as it currently remains three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

The Group Sustainability Officer of Qantas Messent Fiona underscored that shifting to SAF will require collaboration throughout the entire aviation ecosystem. Corporate collaborations along with government action were noted by Fiona to be crucial for achieving the carbon reduction targets in 2030.

The Australian Aviation Market: Recovery and Growth

According to Simon Elsegood, CAPA’s Head of Research, the Australian aviation industry is on a strong recovery path post-COVID. However, several challenges remain, including workforce shortages, supply chain disruptions in aircraft production, and increasing maintenance costs.

In terms of market trends, international passenger traffic is rebounding faster than domestic travel, with Southeast Asia and emerging European markets seeing the most significant growth. However, the industry faces constraints in aircraft availability, which affects route development and overall capacity growth.

One of the biggest changes in recent years has been the decline in business travel, which has been significantly impacted by the rise of video conferencing and changing corporate policies post-pandemic.

Qantas’ Ambitious Fleet and Sustainability Plans

During a discussion with Qantas Domestic CEO Markus Svensson, I learned about the airline’s exciting plans for fleet renewal, which includes the new A321XLR aircraft. The first delivery is expected by Christmas 2025, with a total of 10 aircraft slated for delivery by mid-2026.

This fleet renewal program is part of Project Sunrise, an ambitious initiative to introduce non-stop long-haul flights to any destination globally, starting with Sydney-London routes by 2027. Additionally, Qantas is focusing heavily on SAF and reducing its carbon footprint through sustainable aviation technology.

Conclusion: The Future of Aviation

The CAPA Airline Leader Summit 2025 held in Cairns demonstrated the aviation sector’s resolve to tackle problems and capture possibilities. Through fleet expansions and strategic partnerships to the implementation of Sustainable Aviation practices, the Summit emphasized toward the aviation industry’s future will be much collaboration and innovation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CAPA-Airline-Leader-Summit-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 12:57:31.004014

Memperingati Hari Kebangkitan Teknologi Nasional (Harteknas) 2025 pada 10 Agustus, PT Pertamina (Persero) melanjutkan upaya pengembangan energi baru dan terbarukan (EBT), serta transformasi teknologi berbasis keberlanjutan.

Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina Oki Muraza mengatakan, perusahaan kini tidak hanya berfokus pada bisnis hidrokarbon sebagai warisan, tetapi juga telah mengembangkan beragam solusi energi hijau. Salah satunya, program pengembangan bioetanol di lingkungan Pertamina Group.

""Pertamina tengah memanfaatkan berbagai jenis feedstock lokal seperti molase (produk samping industri gula), batang sorgum, dan nira aren untuk memproduksi bioetanol. Produk ini nantinya akan digunakan sebagai bahan bakar campuran (blending) untuk gasolin,"" kata Oki pada forum Konvensi Sains, Teknologi, dan Industri (KSTI) di Bandung, Jumat (8/8).

Selain bioetanol, di forum yang sama Pertamina juga menampilkan progres pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sebagai solusi bahan bakar ramah lingkungan untuk sektor penerbangan, serta bahan baku minyak goreng bekas atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO).

Saat ini, Pertamina giat mendorong pembentukan ekosistem nasional untuk mengumpulkan UCO sebagai bahan baku SAF. Dengan langkah tersebut, Indonesia diharapkan mampu menjadi pusat produksi SAF untuk kawasan ASEAN.

""Ke depannya kita berharap akan ada ekosistem untuk pengumpulan minyak goreng bekas atau used cooking oil menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Cita-cita besarnya Indonesia nanti akan menjadi hub bagi produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel di ASEAN,"" kata Oki.

Pada kesempatan yang sama, Pertamina juga menyampaikan apresiasinya terhadap dukungan pemerintah dalam inisiatif menyelenggarakan forum KSTI 2025 yang digelar di Gedung Sasana Budaya Ganesha (Sabuga), Bandung, Jawa Barat yang berlangsung pada tanggal 7 - 9 Agustus 2025.

Oki menilai KSTI 2025 sangat strategis untuk membuka peluang kolaborasi antara industri, perguruan tinggi, dan lembaga riset. Sinergi itu antara lain dilakukan bersama berbagai universitas seperti Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), serta Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) sebagai balai penelitian.

""Baik itu di hulu, meningkatkan produksi di hilir, meningkatkan efisiensi, menghasilkan BBM yang ramah lingkungan, dan juga di bidang energi terbarukan, sebagai kontribusi untuk meningkatkan porsi dari renewables atau energi terbarukan di dalam bauran energi nasional,"" ujar Oki.

Partisipasi Pertamina dalam acara ini turut menegaskan posisi perusahaan sebagai pemimpin transisi energi di Indonesia. Dengan mengedepankan inovasi, kolaborasi, dan riset berkelanjutan, Pertamina berkomitmen mendukung agenda nasional menuju energi yang lebih bersih, efisien, dan berdaulat.

Quando corretamente processados em Unidades de Recuperação Energética (URE), esses resíduos podem ser convertidos em produtos de alto valor agregado, como biodiesel, etanol de segunda geração (E2G), SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), hidrogênio verde, eletricidade e fertilizantes organominerais. Essa transformação energética proporciona não apenas expressivos ganhos ambientais — ao reduzir emissões de gases de efeito estufa e proteger lençóis freáticos da contaminação — como também estimula a economia circular, gera empregos qualificados e fomenta cadeias produtivas de base tecnológica em nível local e nacional. Entretanto, a realidade ainda caminha em sentido oposto: a destinação dominante dos RSU continua sendo os aterros sanitários, cuja eficiência energética do biogás captado é, em média, 10% daquela obtida com a gaseificação em UREs modernas. Além de ineficientes, os aterros continuam a ser grandes emissores de metano e contaminantes.

Fracassos que poderiam ter sido evitados

Projetos inovadores — como os da Fulcrum BioEnergy (SAF) e da Raízen (etanol 2G) — fracassaram economicamente, não por ausência de tecnologia, mas por desprezar a análise adequada das incertezas envolvidas em seus investimentos. Ao ignorarem fatores críticos como volatilidade do CAPEX, flutuações de preços dos produtos, custos operacionais, produtividade e — especialmente — a possibilidade de ocorrência de eventos de natureza tributária e de mercado, ambos os projetos tornaram insustentáveis econômica e financeiramente, causando impactos negativos para investidores, governos e a sociedade.

Importante destacar que esses riscos foram previamente identificados e mensurados nos estudos de viabilidade econômica financeira realizados pela DBEST PLAN. A empresa previu que, sem a devida consideração de cenários tributários desfavoráveis e variações de mercado — como os que efetivamente ocorreram — os projetos da Fulcrum e da Raízen estariam destinados ao fracasso.

DBEST PLAN e Safran: Referência Nacional e Internacional

No Brasil, a DBEST PLAN – Engenharia e Tecnologia da Informação e a Safran, empresa internacional, destacam-se como pioneiras na incorporação dessa metodologia em seus estudos de viabilidade para projetos de energia limpa. Aplicando com rigor a Simulação de Monte Carlo, essas empresas avaliam com precisão a viabilidade de projetos de SAF, biodiesel, etanol 2G, hidrogênio verde, eletricidade e fertilizantes organominerais, processando biomassa e RSU em UREs de última geração. Ao acompanhar práticas de análise adotadas por grandes players internacionais, a DBEST PLAN contribui para a transição energética do Brasil com soluções sustentáveis, financeiramente sólidas e socialmente justas. Sua abordagem orienta decisões governamentais, evita desperdícios de recursos públicos e privados e impede o surgimento de novos projetos fadados ao fracasso. Recomendações Finais Projetos inovadores de alto risco devem obrigatoriamente utilizar ferramentas como a Simulação de Monte Carlo para: • Proteger investidores de perdas desnecessárias, • Garantir o correto dimensionamento do CAPEX e OPEX, • Ajustar as expectativas de retorno à realidade econômica, • Demonstrar maturidade técnica perante financiadores e órgãos de fomento.

É hora de o setor público e privado reconhecerem que a transição energética requer, além de boas intenções e tecnologias promissoras, rigor analítico e gestão estratégica das incertezas. Só assim evitaremos novos casos como o da Raízen e garantiremos que os recursos investidos resultem em impactos positivos reais para o Brasil e o mundo.

Pendahuluan

Langit Bandung, Jumat 8 Agustus 2025, menaungi Gedung Sasana Budaya Ganesha (Sabuga) yang ramai oleh stan inovasi dan diskusi hangat antara peneliti, akademisi, dan pelaku industri. Dalam laporan Pikiran Rakyat berjudul ""Hari Kebangkitan Teknologi Nasional, Pertamina Hadirkan Solusi Transformasi Teknologi Berbasis Keberlanjutan"" (9/8/2025), Pertamina menegaskan komitmennya mempercepat transformasi energi hijau. Momentum ini kian penting di tengah desakan transisi energi global yang menuntut langkah nyata.

Harteknas 2025 menjadi panggung lahirnya kolaborasi lintas sektor demi mewujudkan energi bersih dan efisien. Kehadiran Pertamina tak sekadar memamerkan teknologi, tetapi menandai arah baru yang melampaui bisnis hidrokarbon. Transformasi ini memperlihatkan keberpihakan pada keberlanjutan, bukan semata keuntungan.

Keseriusan itu tampak pada inovasi bioetanol, pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), hingga rencana membangun ekosistem nasional pengumpulan Used Cooking Oil (UCO). Di tengah krisis iklim, langkah-langkah ini bukan sekadar strategi bisnis, melainkan wujud tanggung jawab generasi kini untuk menjaga kelayakan bumi bagi masa depan.

1. Bioetanol: Energi Hijau dari Potensi Lokal

Pemanfaatan sumber daya lokal seperti molase, batang sorgum, dan nira aren menjadi salah satu terobosan strategis Pertamina. Bioetanol yang dihasilkan akan digunakan sebagai campuran gasolin, mengurangi emisi dan ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil. Inovasi ini menunjukkan bahwa energi terbarukan dapat dibangun dari kekayaan hayati yang selama ini kurang dimanfaatkan.

Selain memberikan solusi lingkungan, program ini juga membuka peluang ekonomi bagi petani lokal. Pengolahan feedstock menjadi bioetanol menciptakan rantai nilai baru yang memberi manfaat langsung bagi masyarakat di sekitar sentra produksi.

Data-Driven Takeaways YPF's SAF venture is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition.","The aviation industry is racing toward net-zero emissions by 2050, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the only scalable solution to decarbonize air travel. While the global SAF market is projected to grow at a blistering 57.53% CAGR from 2025 to 2034, Latin America remains a largely untapped frontier. Argentina's state-owned oil giant, YPF, is positioning itself as a regional leader with a $400 million joint venture—Santa Fe Bio—to produce SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) at its San Lorenzo refinery. This move is not just a bet on green energy; it's a strategic play to capitalize on a market growing at 50.1% CAGR in Latin America (far outpacing the user's 20% figure) and a regional SAF supply gap that could become a goldmine for early movers.

Why YPF's Play Stands Out

YPF's Santa Fe Bio project is a masterclass in strategic positioning. The San Lorenzo refinery, located in a port city, offers ideal logistics for exporting SAF to Europe and North America, where demand is surging due to CORSIA mandates and corporate ESG goals. The venture leverages Argentina's abundant feedstock—used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and animal fats—at lower costs than competitors. This is critical: SAF production costs remain high globally, but YPF's access to low-cost raw materials and Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI)—which offers tax breaks and streamlined permitting—creates a compelling cost advantage.

The project's two-phase rollout also demonstrates operational prudence. Phase 1 will focus on building a pretreatment plant and a state-of-the-art biorefinery, with scalability baked into the design. By 2030, the Latin American SAF market is expected to hit $792.5 million in revenue, up from $69.2 million in 2024. YPF's early entry positions it to capture a significant share of this growth, especially as regional airlines and global carriers seek local suppliers to avoid the high costs of importing SAF from North America or Europe.

Policy Tailwinds and Market Dynamics

YPF's timing is impeccable. Argentina's national energy transition goals align with global decarbonization targets, and the government's RIGI regime reduces financial risk for investors. Meanwhile, the global SAF market is expected to balloon from $2.25 billion in 2025 to $134.57 billion by 2034, driven by airlines like Delta, United, and British Airways committing to 100% SAF blends. Latin America's current SAF supply is negligible, creating a vacuum YPF is poised to fill.

The joint venture with U.S.-based Essential Energy adds another layer of credibility. Essential's expertise in biofuel technology complements YPF's infrastructure and market access. Together, they're building a production model that could serve as a blueprint for other emerging markets.

Risks and Rewards

No investment is without risk. SAF production faces challenges like feedstock supply chain bottlenecks and high capital costs. However, YPF's self-funding approach (reducing debt risk) and Argentina's policy support mitigate these concerns. The company is also hedging its bets by producing HVO, a diesel-like product with growing demand in the transportation sector.

For investors, the key question is whether YPF can scale production quickly enough to meet demand. The answer lies in its phased rollout and strategic location. If the project hits its production targets, YPF could become a regional SAF powerhouse, with export potential to Europe and North America.

Data-Driven Takeaways

YPF's SAF venture is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition. The company's ability to leverage Argentina's resources, policy incentives, and global demand trends positions it as a winner in a market growing at 50%+ CAGR. While the user's 20% CAGR figure underestimates the sector's potential, the core thesis holds: YPF is betting big on a future where carbon-neutral aviation is non-negotiable.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 23:56:14.796925

The Australian aviation market is projected to add 40 million passengers over the next decade.

The domestic market will account for two thirds to three quarters of passengers, with growth of 2% to 2.5%. The international market has more growth upside at 2.5% to 3%, based on conservative estimates.

Airline Leader Interview: Air New Zealand, CCO, Jeremy O'Brien

Air New Zealand recently announced Nikhil Ravishankar as its next CEO. Described as ""constantly curious"" and ""a real innovator,"" Ravishankar brings significant digital expertise to the role. Having served at the airline for over five years, he has focused on enhancing customer experiences and operations through digital technology and introduced an agile operating model that has improved the organisation's responsiveness to change.

The airline has faced significant operational challenges, with up to 11 aircraft grounded simultaneously due to engine issues. To maintain network integrity, Air New Zealand implemented several solutions, including:

Leasing three Boeing 777s from Cathay Pacific.

Securing 15 additional Pratt & Whitney engines.

Receiving new A321neo deliveries.

These measures have enabled the airline to resume growth, particularly across the Tasman Sea where it will operate 1.7 million seats during the winter season - a 10% year-on-year increase. The airline is also expanding services to Pacific Islands and domestic routes.

Fleet expansion continues with ultra-long-haul Boeing 787s arriving in February and March 2026, featuring increased premium cabin density to target the premium leisure market, particularly from the US.

The airline is innovating with its SkyNest product - six bunk beds between premium economy and economy cabins that passengers can book for four-hour sleep periods on ultra-long-haul flights. This reflects Air New Zealand's commitment to addressing customer pain points through innovation.

Regarding network strategy, Air New Zealand is evaluating potential returns to London and Chicago markets and exploring opportunities in India through partnerships. The carrier is taking a more rational approach to route selection post-COVID, focusing on markets where it has ""the right to win"" and can achieve sustainable returns.

Current Challenges and Approaches:

Airlines are shifting from carbon intensity metrics to net emissions measurements.

The next five years are deemed critical for meeting 2030 reduction targets.

Industry consensus that airlines cannot achieve decarbonisation alone - partnerships across the entire ecosystem are essential.

Policy and Economic Considerations:

Harmonised policy frameworks across regions are preferred to avoid fragmentation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) development presents significant economic opportunities, potentially adding to GDP and creating jobs.

Learning from international policy implementations is crucial for Australia and New Zealand to design effective frameworks.

Cost Distribution and Financing:

The ""green premium"" of SAF (currently 3-4 times more expensive than conventional fuel) requires sophisticated cost-sharing mechanisms.

Book and claim systems (separating physical fuel from environmental attributes) could help aggregate demand.

Defence procurement and corporate partnerships are emerging as important demand signals.

Broader Benefits Beyond Emissions:

SAF development offers fuel security benefits, reducing dependence on imports.

Rural communities could benefit from agricultural feedstock production, creating regional jobs.

Tourism industry faces significant economic risks if aviation sustainability isn't addressed.

Carbon Offsets and Physical Climate Impacts:

High-integrity carbon credits remain essential for net-zero strategies.

Physical climate impacts already affecting aviation operations through extreme weather events.

Tourism destinations face infrastructure challenges from rising temperatures and severe weather.

The panel emphasised that sustainability messaging should focus on economic opportunities rather than solely on climate risks, and that the entire tourism ecosystem must collaborate on solutions rather than leaving the burden solely with airlines.

As the aviation sector races to meet emissions targets, YPF's Santa Fe Bio project is not just a local initiative—it's a global opportunity.","Argentina's energy transition is accelerating at a pivotal moment in global aviation decarbonization. At the heart of this shift is YPF S.A.'s Santa Fe Bio project, a $400 million investment to convert the San Lorenzo refinery into a biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). This initiative, part of YPF's broader 4×4 Plan, positions the state-owned oil giant to capitalize on a regional SAF supply gap and Argentina's unique competitive advantages in renewable feedstock and infrastructure. For investors, the project represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector poised for explosive growth.

Argentina's Energy Transition: A Catalyst for SAF Demand

Latin America's aviation sector is grappling with a stark supply-demand imbalance for SAF. While global airlines commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, SAF production in the region remains nascent. A 2025 MIT study estimates that Latin America could supply 10–15% of global SAF demand by 2050, but current production costs—ranging from $1.11 to $2.86 per liter—far exceed conventional jet fuel prices of $0.70 per liter. Argentina's Santa Fe Bio project directly addresses this gap by leveraging its agricultural surplus and existing refining infrastructure.

YPF's strategic location in Santa Fe province, a hub for soybean and biodiesel production, provides access to low-cost feedstocks like used cooking oils and agricultural residues. The San Lorenzo refinery's port connectivity further enhances its export potential, targeting markets in Europe and the U.S., where SAF demand is surging due to stringent sustainability mandates. Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), which offers tax breaks and streamlined permitting, reduces financial risk for YPF and underscores the government's commitment to decarbonization.

Regional Scarcity and YPF's Competitive Edge

The scarcity of SAF in Latin America is a critical tailwind for YPF's venture. Brazil, the region's biofuel leader, is prioritizing ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) pathways, while Argentina's focus on HVO and SAF from waste oils differentiates its approach. YPF's partnership with Essential Energy, a U.S.-based biofuel innovator, adds technical expertise and global market access. The joint venture's phased rollout—starting with a raw material pretreatment plant and a state-of-the-art biorefinery—ensures scalability and adaptability to evolving feedstock and certification standards.

Moreover, Argentina's regulatory environment is aligning with global sustainability trends. The 2025 introduction of pure biofuel regulations for marine transport signals a broader openness to low-carbon fuels. YPF's Santa Fe Bio project, which aims to reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, aligns with these policies and positions Argentina as a regional SAF exporter.

Financial and Environmental Metrics: A Dual Win

While specific production capacity figures for 2025 remain undisclosed, the project's $400 million investment and RIGI incentives suggest a robust financial model. YPF's self-funding approach, combined with Essential Energy's operational experience, minimizes debt risk. The project's carbon reduction potential is equally compelling: SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by 50–80%, directly supporting Argentina's net-zero goals and attracting ESG-focused investors.

Investment Thesis: Timing the Aviation Decarbonization Wave

The Santa Fe Bio project is a strategic bet on a sector where timing and positioning are critical. With global SAF demand projected to grow at a 20% CAGR through 2030, YPF's early mover advantage in Latin America's underdeveloped SAF market is a key differentiator. The project's alignment with Argentina's energy transition policies, coupled with its access to low-cost feedstocks and export-ready infrastructure, creates a compelling value proposition.

For investors, the venture offers exposure to both YPF's operational transformation and Argentina's broader decarbonization agenda. While risks such as feedstock price volatility and regulatory shifts exist, the project's RIGI incentives and Essential Energy's partnership mitigate these concerns.

La producción estará enfocada principalmente en SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) para la aviación y, de forma alternativa, en HVO (Aceite Vegetal Hidrotratado, por sus siglas en inglés), con propiedades similares a las del gasoil.

La decisión, anticipada meses atrás por el presidente y CEO de YPF, Horacio Marín, forma parte del plan denominado “YPF del Futuro”, con el que la compañía prevé expandirse hacia distintas fuentes energéticas fuera de los hidrocarburos.

En el caso de Santa Fe Bio, desde la empresa anticiparon que el proyecto demandará una inversión estimada de USD 400 millones. El financiamiento será estructurado en su mayor parte bajo un modelo de project finance, en acuerdo con un socio estadounidense especializado en la elaboración y comercialización de biocombustibles.

En el caso del SAF, se elabora a partir de cultivos como colza, camelina y carinata, mientras que los HVO se hacen en base a e elaborarán a partir del procesamiento de aceites vegetales, residuos, grasas animales y otros insumos.

El proyecto se desarrollará en dos fases y está previsto que sume los beneficios del Régimen de Incentivo a las Grandes Inversiones (RIGI).

Cómo será la sociedad

Este joint venture estará integrado en partes iguales por YPF y el grupo Essential Energy, con presencia nacional e internacional en el mercado de biocombustibles de primera y segunda generación.

Ambas compañías comenzaron a trabajar en la factibilidad del proyecto en diciembre de 2024, tras la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento (MOU), y en la actualidad continúan definiendo los términos contractuales finales.

El plan contempla el uso de la infraestructura de la refinería de San Lorenzo, en la provincia de Santa Fe, donde se instalará una planta de pretratamiento de materias primas y una biorrefinería de última generación. También se adecuarán instalaciones del complejo industrial, para llevar adelante la producción.

El SAF es considerado por organismos internacionales como la alternativa sostenible más escalable para el transporte aéreo a mediano plazo. En este contexto, se proyecta un crecimiento de la demanda en los próximos años, con oportunidades de exportación hacia Europa y Estados Unidos, mercados que exigen certificaciones internacionales.

La ubicación de la refinería de San Lorenzo fue elegida por su proximidad a la zona núcleo productiva, la disponibilidad de materia prima y su conexión directa con el puerto, lo que facilita la logística de comercialización y exportación.

Historia de la refinería

La refinería de San Lorenzo, fundada en 1938 por YPF, fue privatizada en 1993 y pasó por distintas manos, entre ellas Pérez Companc, Repsol y Petrobras. En 2002 fue adquirida por Oil Combustibles y, en 2018, volvió a YPF en sociedad con Dapsa, en el marco de un proceso de liquidación judicial.

El complejo industrial incluye destilería, planta de despacho de combustibles, parque de tanques, planta de asfalto y un puerto de gran capacidad sobre la Hidrovía Paraná-Paraguay. Actualmente, la refinería se encuentra inactiva y será reconvertida para el nuevo proyecto.

Según el plan, en la primera etapa de operación, prevista para 2030, la planta producirá unas 100.000 toneladas anuales de SAF. Con la ampliación de capacidad, se espera superar las 500.000 toneladas por año.",https://www.newsdigitales.com/uploads/noticias/2/2025/08/afa5c676215b36e834d978a3f6c2258b48821072.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 21:56:16.257054

As per Marie Claire, it’s the only supercharged L322 Her Majesty ever owned, powered by a 4.2-litre V8 engine. Special modifications were added by Land Rover’s Special Vehicle Operations division, including side steps, mud flaps, a dog guard for the Queen’s beloved corgis, a boot liner, rear grab handles to aid entry and exit, and upgraded internal wiring for royal security equipment. It even features a quirky bonnet ornament of a Labrador with a pheasant in its mouth, something that oddly fits the car’s royal countryside charm. The Queen, despite having hundreds of chauffeurs at her service, loved driving cars herself and would be regularly pictured in them, as per the BBC.

The vehicle, which clocked around 120,000 miles and was based at Windsor Castle, is expected to fetch between £50,000 and £70,000 when it goes under the hammer at Iconic Auctioneers’ Silverstone Festival on August 23. “Vehicles with such distinguished provenance rarely enter the market, making this an exceptional opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts alike,” said Rob Hubbard, Managing Director and Principal Auctioneer of Iconic Auctioneers. “Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s personal Range Rover combines automotive excellence with an unmatched historical significance.”

The website of Iconic Auctioneers on their website cited, ""This significant vehicle, exclusively used by Her Majesty between 2006 and 2008, represents a rare opportunity to acquire a historically important, exquisitely presented, and uniquely specified Royal Range Rover. Originally supplied directly by Land Rover Special Vehicle Operations, the vehicle was meticulously prepared for its prestigious duties.""",https://d241qoz0w3ggzz.cloudfront.net/770057/uploads/af34aec0-744b-11f0-9488-351ac2332c2c_1200_630.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 19:56:20.366257

A közlemény idézte Zsótér Csabát, a Mol-csoport üzemanyag-üzletágának ügyvezető igazgatóját, akinek tájékoztatása szerint a Mol már most is állít elő megújuló alapanyagokból dízel-, valamint fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyagot, és készen áll ennek bővítésére.

A vállalat – egyebek között a Szegedi Tudományegyetemmel és a Pannon Egyetemmel együttműködve – folyamatosan kutatja és fejleszti a bioüzemanyagok előállításának, illetve felhasználásának új lehetőségeit.

A Budapest Airporttal, a Wizz Airrel és a Repülőtéri Üzemanyag Kiszolgáló Kft.-vel együttműködve a Mol 2022-ben kezdte meg a fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyag (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) kereskedelmi tesztelését. Erre alapozva a társaság már értékesíti a SAF-ot Magyarországon, Szlovákiában és Horvátországban.

Hozzátették, hogy a SAF csak klasszikus megújuló (például növényi) alapanyagból vagy hulladékból készülhet, de ugyanúgy teljesítenie kell a műszaki és a környezetvédelmi előírásokat, mint a hagyományos kerozinnak.

A kutatást a Mol megbízásából az Iránytű Intézet készítette idén májusban, 500 ember bevonásával.

By launching direct flights from Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Charlotte (CLT) to Québec City's Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB), the carrier is not only enhancing connectivity but also catalyzing a $50 million tourism revenue boost for the region. This move aligns with a broader trend of airlines targeting secondary markets to diversify revenue streams while addressing the growing demand for sustainable travel. For investors, the expansion offers a compelling case study in how strategic infrastructure investments, ESG alignment, and regional partnerships can drive long-term value.

Infrastructure: A $200 Million Bet on Future Growth

Québec City's Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB) is undergoing a transformative $200 million infrastructure overhaul as part of its 2025–2030 strategic plan. This investment is critical to accommodating a projected 2.4 million annual passengers by 2030 and includes the redesign of the domestic arrivals area, runway and taxiway renovations, and enhanced public transit options. The airport's 2024 passenger traffic surged by 43.8% to 1.68 million, underscoring the urgency of these upgrades.

The infrastructure push is not merely about capacity—it's about creating a seamless passenger experience. Modernized facilities, optimized food concessions, and revamped parking solutions are designed to meet evolving traveler expectations. For investors, this signals a long-term commitment to YQB's role as a regional hub. The airport's EBITDA of $34.6 million in 2024 and its net income of $3.6 million highlight its financial resilience, making it an attractive partner for airlines seeking to expand into high-growth markets.

ESG Alignment: Greening the Skies with Low-Carbon Corridors

American Airlines' expansion to YQB is deeply embedded in its net-zero emissions by 2050 roadmap. The airline is deploying fuel-efficient Embraer 175 aircraft for the DFW-YQB route, which reduces per-passenger carbon footprints. YQB itself has achieved a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2016, a feat driven by runway efficiency upgrades and contrail-avoidance strategies. These initiatives align with the growing investor appetite for ESG-compliant assets, particularly in sectors facing regulatory scrutiny over carbon emissions.

The airport's 2040 carbon neutrality goal for airport-authority-managed operations further cements its appeal. For instance, YQB's one-way corridor at international arrivals has cut operational delays by 15%, reducing fuel burn and emissions. Such innovations not only enhance environmental performance but also lower operational costs—a win-win for airlines and investors.

Regional Airline Synergies: Expanding Reach Without the Cost

American Airlines' partnership with regional carriers like Flair Airlines and Air France exemplifies a cost-effective strategy to expand its network. By using Embraer 175s for the DFW-YQB route, the airline minimizes capital expenditures while maintaining high-frequency service. This model is particularly effective for secondary markets like Québec City, where demand is seasonal but growing.

The collaboration also diversifies YQB's route offerings, with connections to destinations like Halifax, Edmonton, and Paris. For investors, this highlights the potential of regional airlines as undervalued assets in the post-pandemic recovery. Flair Airlines, for example, has seen a 30% increase in regional route profitability since 2023, driven by its focus on underserved Canadian markets.

Investment Implications: Where to Allocate Capital

Infrastructure Providers: Companies involved in airport construction and technology upgrades (e.g., Arconic, which supplies aircraft components, or AECOM, a construction and design firm) stand to benefit from YQB's $200 million investment.

Regional Airlines: Flair Airlines and other regional carriers with contracts to serve YQB could see revenue growth as American Airlines expands its network.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Producers: As American Airlines ramps up SAF usage to meet its net-zero goals, firms like Neste and Gevo may see increased demand.

Tourism-Linked Sectors: Hospitality chains and tour operators in Québec City are poised to capitalize on the 2.9% passenger traffic increase, with hotel occupancy rates projected to rise by 10% in 2025.

Conclusion: A Model for Future Aviation Growth

American Airlines' Québec City expansion is a blueprint for sustainable, tourism-driven growth. By combining infrastructure investments, ESG alignment, and regional partnerships, the airline is not only enhancing its competitive edge but also creating a ripple effect of economic activity. For investors, this represents a rare opportunity to align with a strategy that balances profitability with planetary and social responsibility. As the aviation industry navigates a post-pandemic landscape, the YQB model offers a roadmap for resilient, future-proof growth.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 17:56:07.523858

«Con este paso, YPF S.A. ingresa en un mercado global en expansión, alineado con las exigencias ambientales del sector aerocomercial y con alto potencial de desarrollo en los próximos años».","El directorio de YPF S.A. anunció la creación de Santa Fe Bio, una empresa que se dedicará a la producción y comercialización de biocombustibles de última generación en la ciudad de San Lorenzo.

La producción se orientará al combustible denominado SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) para la aviación. Y también a la producción de HVO (Aceite Vegetal Hidrotratado), con propiedades similares a las del gasoil.

La inversión estimada por la petrolera es de 400 millones de dólares. Para las nuevas líneas de producción se utilizará, con las necesarias modificaciones, la infraestructura de su refinería de San Lorenzo. Allí se instalará una planta de pretratamiento de materias primas y una biorrefinería de última generación.

El proyecto se desarrollará en dos fases, y la idea es presentarlo para calificar en el régimen de beneficios impositivos del RIGI.

Los nuevos biocombustibles se producirán a partir del procesamiento de aceites vegetales y residuos, además de grasas animales entre otras materias primas.

Asociación

Santa Fe Bio estará conformada en partes iguales entre YPF S.A y el grupo Essential Energy, una compañía referente en la elaboración y comercialización de biocombustibles de primera y segunda generación, con presencia en el mercado nacional e internacional.

Ambas compañías comenzaron a trabajar en la factibilidad del proyecto en diciembre de 2024. Fue luego de firmar un Memorando de Entendimiento (MOU) que derivó en una letra fina contractual aún en proceso.

Aviones con combustible sostenible

El combustible de aviación (SAF) que se elaborará en San Lorenzo está calificado por organismos internacionales como la única alternativa sostenible y escalable del transporte aéreo a mediano plazo.

Por esta razón, se proyecta un crecimiento de la demanda en los próximos años. Una de las metas es en torno a la posibilidad de exportación a Europa y Estados Unidos. Y eso, en base al cumplimiento de rigurosas exigencias y certificación de calidad ISCC que se prevén cumplir.

Según un comunicado de la empresa con mayoría accionaria estatal, la ubicación de la Refinería de San Lorenzo es estratégica para este tipo de proyectos. Por la disponibilidad de materia prima en esta zona núcleo productiva y por estar al lado de puertos que optimizan la logística de comercialización.

The NFU said the potential complete closure of one of the UK’s two bioethanol plants raised serious concerns for arable growers in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and the wider biofuels sector.

Vivergo’s owners AB Foods said the UK's largest bioethanol plant, at Saltend, is in doubt following a government agreement with the US to abandon a 19 per cent tariff on US imports of the fuel as part of the recent UK-US trade deal.

Managers at the plant are also are calling on ministers for assistance, in the form of financial help, warning production at the plant could stop in just over a month.

The plant has come to be regarded as a foundation of the UK’s renewable fuel sector and has taken more than one million tonnes of wheat annually from more than 4,000 UK farms. In addition, the facility also produces important co-products, such as high-protein animal feed.

It has been forecast some 4,500 jobs in the supply chain could be impacted by Vivergo closing, and in particular the farmers who grow the wheat.

Managing director Ben Hackett has written to wheat growers warning the plant could only honour existing contracts for wheat purchases while the uncertainty continued.

Mr Hackett said: ""We have the site, the skills, the supply chain and the ambition to lead the way on sustainable aviation fuel.

""But without urgent government support for British bioethanol, the UK risks losing that opportunity, along with the jobs and billions of pounds in investment that depend on it.""

The government has stated it is holding talks with Vivergo “to find a way forward”.

As farmers are being faced with unpredictable markets and small margins, the NFU is pressing Keir Starmer’s administration to help ensure UK-grown grain has a viable future beyond feed markets, and assurances that the bioethanol sector will form a key plank of Britain’s green energy revolution.

NFU Combinable Crops Board Chair Jamie Burrows said the abrupt suspension of operations at Vivergo threatened to destabilise what was an already volatile market.

“Not only are there huge implications for those growers that currently supply Vivergo, but this also has the potential to put further downward pressures on farmgate prices at a time when our arable farmers are already facing huge challenges including extreme weather and ongoing market volatility.”

Mr Burrows said the closure emphasised the urgent need for government to support the domestic biofuels industry by enabling increased use of crop-based biofuels in transport and aviation.

“In order to open up further market opportunities to incentivise UK wheat being used by UK biofuel plants, the NFU is calling for government to allow more biofuels from crops to be used in road transport and aviation.”

Meanwhile, it has emerged this week that a green jet fuel investment worth £1.25bn could be put in jeopardy if the plant is forced to close.

Chris Smith. the chief executive of Meld Energy, which signed an agreement with Vivergo Fuels earlier this year for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at Saltend, said that without Vivergo at the site they may have to look overseas.

As the world grapples with the aftermath of the Ukraine war and the rise of multipolarity, Brazil's balancing act offers a blueprint for navigating uncertainty.","In the shadow of the Ukraine war and the fracturing of the U.S.-led global order, Brazil has emerged as a pivotal actor in reshaping the economic and geopolitical landscape of the Global South. As the host of the 2025 BRICS summit, Brazil is leveraging its diplomatic finesse and economic heft to steer the bloc toward a pragmatic, non-confrontational path. This strategy—balancing Western ties with South-South cooperation—has created a unique window for investors to capitalize on BRICS-driven markets while navigating the turbulence of a multipolar world.

The Geopolitical Chessboard: Brazil's Pragmatic Mediation

Brazil's foreign policy under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been defined by a “multi-aligned” approach. Unlike Russia's hardline stance or China's assertive expansionism, Brazil has avoided direct confrontation with the West while championing BRICS as a platform for inclusive growth. This balancing act is critical in a post-Ukraine world, where the U.S. and its allies have imposed sanctions on Russia, and BRICS nations face pressure to choose sides.

By hosting the 2025 BRICS summit, Brazil has positioned itself as a stabilizing force. The bloc's expansion—from five to eleven members—has introduced new dynamics, but Brazil's emphasis on institutional coherence and practical cooperation has mitigated fragmentation. For example, the inclusion of Indonesia, a strategic bridge between East and West, has strengthened BRICS' economic and geopolitical footprint. This expansion, coupled with Brazil's focus on trade facilitation and financial integration, has created a more resilient bloc less susceptible to ideological divides.

Investment Opportunities: BRICS as a Growth Engine

The BRICS bloc's focus on infrastructure, de-dollarization, and sustainable development has unlocked a range of high-conviction investment opportunities. Here are three key areas to watch:

1. New Development Bank (NDB) and Green Infrastructure

The NDB, established in 2015, has become a cornerstone of BRICS economic cooperation. With a $50 billion capital base and a mandate to fund clean energy, transportation, and climate resilience projects, the NDB is a critical player in the Global South's green transition. In 2024, the bank issued a $1.25 billion green bond to finance clean transportation and energy efficiency, signaling its commitment to sustainability.

Investors should consider NDB-backed projects in Brazil, India, and South Africa, where solar, wind, and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure are accelerating. For instance, Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) has partnered with the NDB to fund $1.7 billion in climate-related projects, including EV charging networks and biofuel production.

2. Clean Energy and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The BRICS Business Council (BBC) has identified energy transition as a strategic priority. Brazil, in particular, is emerging as a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2025, Chinese company Envision Energy announced a $1 billion investment in Brazil to produce SAF from sugarcane, leveraging the country's agricultural expertise. This project, part of a broader $38.8 billion energy transition investment in Brazil in 2023, highlights the potential for cross-border green partnerships.

India, meanwhile, is targeting 8–10 million tonnes of SAF production annually by 2040, driven by partnerships with Airbus and domestic research institutions. Investors in renewable energy firms with exposure to BRICS markets—such as NextEra Energy (NEE) or Ørsted (DONG)—could benefit from this trend.

3. Digital and Financial Innovation

Brazil's push for a BRICS-wide digital payment system and a potential common currency is reshaping the bloc's financial architecture. While a unified BRICS currency remains aspirational, the group's experiments with local currency trade and blockchain-based transactions are reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. The Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), a $100 billion liquidity pool, further insulates BRICS members from Western financial shocks.

Investors should monitor the performance of BRICS-focused ETFs like the iShares MSCI BRIC ETF (BKF) and the WisdomTree Brazil Equity Fund (EBR). Additionally, fintech firms operating in BRICS markets—such as Nubank (NU) in Brazil or Paytm (PAYTM) in India—are well-positioned to capitalize on the shift toward digital finance.

Geopolitical Risks and Mitigation Strategies

While BRICS offers compelling opportunities, investors must remain mindful of geopolitical risks. Internal divisions, particularly between China and India, and the lingering impact of U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports, could disrupt momentum. However, Brazil's diplomatic agility—evidenced by its role in brokering the G20's 2024 climate agreement—suggests a capacity to navigate these challenges.

To mitigate risk, investors should adopt a diversified approach:

- Sectoral Diversification: Allocate across clean energy, infrastructure, and technology to hedge against sector-specific volatility.

- Currency Hedging: Use BRICS-focused ETFs or local-currency bonds to reduce exposure to dollar fluctuations.

- Political Risk Insurance: Consider instruments like the MSCI Emerging Markets Political Risk Index to assess country-specific vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: A New Era of South-South Cooperation

Brazil's 2025 leadership of BRICS marks a turning point in the Global South's quest for economic autonomy. By prioritizing stability, sustainability, and multilateralism, Brazil has transformed BRICS from a geopolitical talking shop into a dynamic engine of growth. For investors, this means opportunities in green infrastructure, digital finance, and cross-border partnerships that transcend traditional East-West divides.

As the world grapples with the aftermath of the Ukraine war and the rise of multipolarity, Brazil's balancing act offers a blueprint for navigating uncertainty. The BRICS bloc, under Brazil's stewardship, is not just a counterweight to the West—it's a bridge to a more inclusive and resilient global economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 14:56:51.282126

Taking to X, he wrote that the production is set to ""begin soon as per ICAO's CORSIA standards with an annual capacity of 3 crore litres.""

""With more such facilities coming up in the country, we are well on the path to meet the target of 1 per cent SAF blending in all international flights by 2027 and cut our aviation carbon footprint,"" he said in the X post.

He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this ""milestone"".

""I believe it is a milestone under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji towards India's commitment to sustainable aviation,"" he added.

In 2014, the ethanol blending was just 1.53 per cent. By 2022, India achieved 10 per cent blending, five months ahead of schedule. The original target of 20 per cent blending (E20) by 2030 was advanced to 2025 and has already been achieved in the current Ethanol Supply Year.

Ethanol production has surged dramatically, growing from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres by June 2025.

This remarkable growth has helped reduce the country's dependence on imported crude oil, leading to a significant saving of Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange.

E20 blending in petrol was introduced by the Centre to reduce the country's oil import cost, energy security, lower carbon emissions and better air quality.

India however has no plans to mandate the blending of ethanol with diesel. The issue of blending ethanol with diesel is still at an experimental stage.

Notably, at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part ""Panchamrit"" pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion metric tonnes by 2030.

India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. (ANI)

But, the blossoming new technology has been hit with skepticism when it comes to farmers incorporating it into their operations.

Zach Johnson, also known as the Millennial Farmer, was the moderator for the panel focusing on artificial intelligence. He said he believes that his children growing up with artificial intelligence will be much like how he grew up with Google, and later down the line, a smart phone. Joining him on the panel were Ken O’Brien, agronomy innovation leader with Corteva, and Don Scribner, director of product for TerraClear.

So far, there have been many bells and whistles when it comes to AI, but when looking past those shiny pieces of equipment and technology, Scribner believes AI is setting up farmers for success in a more realistic way.

“You see autonomous tractors. You see spot spraying happening. Combines are changing their settings as we go. But if you kind of think about what it's doing today, it's really setting up, and it's sensing and acting really quickly,” Scribner said. “Where it's going to step forward is this ability to start bringing in more and more inputs … give information quickly to farmers, so you can maybe make changes before you go to the field, as you're in the field, and maybe make a different decision than you would have in the past.”

While AI is set to make decisions easier in the future, some worry about potentially being replaced by the technology. O’Brien doesn’t anticipate that in his field of work. However, he thinks it’s important to work with the technology instead of against it.

“I don't think technology like AI or digital solutions in general are going to replace agronomists, but I tell the agronomists at Corteva or Pioneer all the time, I do think agronomists who understand how to use these tools are going to replace those who don't. They're going to be more valuable to their customers. They're going to understand how to increase performance more,” O’Brien said.

Another worry farmers are voicing is the lack of security that can come along with AI. Many worry about a data breach or someone getting a hold of their or their farm's personal information. Panelists urged farmers to be careful with their information, even if they do not utilize AI into their current farming operation.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/529eea6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fe5%2F7d31458f4b2796395b2694b2247e%2Fimg-3348.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:56:26.251682

India’s leadership in the Global Biofuels Alliance underscores its commitment to a sustainable energy future.
By driving international cooperation, advancing research, and enabling policy innovation, India is paving the way for a cleaner, greener global energy ecosystem.","India is playing a pivotal role in the expansion of the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), positioning itself as a leading voice in global efforts to promote sustainable and clean energy solutions. As a founding member of the Alliance, launched during India’s G20 Presidency in 2023, the country has been instrumental in shaping its vision and mobilizing support from both developed and developing nations.

Through robust policy initiatives such as the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme and targeted financial incentives, India is not only advancing its domestic biofuel industry but also contributing significantly to global energy transition goals. By fostering international collaboration and promoting technology sharing within the Alliance’s framework, India is cementing its leadership in the global biofuels sector.

Institutional progress and International partnerships

The GBA formally adopted its Governance Framework during the fifth Temporary Executive Committee (TEC) meeting held on July 24, 2025, marking its transition into a full-fledged international organization. Earlier, in October 2024, the Alliance signed the Host Country Agreement with the Government of India, establishing its Secretariat in New Delhi.

These developments signal a major step toward institutionalizing the GBA and strengthening its international mandate. India’s role as host further enhances its strategic position in the global biofuel landscape.

The GBA’s membership has expanded to 32 nations and 14 international organizations, with keen interest received from other countries and organizations as well.

Economic and strategic benefits for India

The Alliance is expected to generate several benefits for India’s biofuel economy. Among its goals, the GBA aims to provide new opportunities for Indian industries by positioning the country as a global knowledge base and production hub for biofuels — including ethanol, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG).

India’s active participation in the Alliance reinforces its influence in the global biofuels sector, offering a platform to showcase its advancements and attract international collaboration.

Key initiatives and global outreach

As an international organization, the GBA has undertaken a range of initiatives to promote the awareness and adoption of biofuels worldwide. It has actively participated in major national and international events such as COP28, COP29, the World Economic Forum, and India Energy Week (2024 and 2025). These engagements have enhanced visibility at the intersection of policy and industry.

The Alliance has also hosted curated roundtables, panel discussions, a Knowledge Webinar Series, and released joint statements to further global dialogue on biofuels. Its participation in high-level forums like the G20 and G7 has contributed significantly to the global narrative on sustainable energy transitions.

Public awareness and research publications

To broaden its public outreach, the GBA launched several social media campaigns, including the “Do You Know” initiative, aimed at highlighting key facts and benefits of biofuels. Additionally, it published two whitepapers — “Potential of Non-grain-based Biofuels in India’s Energy Transition” and “Role of Bio-based Diesel in Diesel Transition” — which advocate for the critical role of biofuels in decarbonization and global energy sustainability.

Also Read: Is E20 Fuel Safe for Older Cars?
With India moving forward beyond E20 to higher ethanol blends, providing diversified fuel choices might be revisited sometime in the future.
In the event of incompatibility, the use of lesser ethanol blends where available (e.g., E10) is recommended for modifications from authorised service workshops.","Speaking at the Biofuels 360° Summit in New Delhi, Pankaj Jain, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas Secretary, put an end to speculation on India's ethanol blending strategy with a straightforward statement: petrol pumps will only have E20 on sale, which is 20 per cent ethanol and 80 per cent petrol, in the future. There will be no buffet of fuel blends such as E10, E20, or E30. Speaking exclusively with Acko Drive, Jain explained that the government's plan for now is to stick with the E20 blend and ensure that there's no confusion among customers, logistical nightmares for oil companies, and delays in achieving environmental goals. ""For now, we only have the e20 blend, but other blends will happen in due course, of course, the matter is under consideration with the inter-ministerial committee, so it's too soon to comment.""

Jain presented the move as a step towards long-term decarbonisation, citing international precedents like Brazil's E27, while assuring the public that Indian vehicles and fuel systems are prepared to handle E20. Yet he also left room for higher levels in the future, once the market, the manufacturing, and the infrastructure fully fall into line.

Why Only E20, for Now?

Jain noted that one blend makes logistics easier, avoids consumer complexity, and facilitates faster policy implementation. Having several alternatives, such as E10, E20, or E30, available at fuel stations would make distribution, retail, and campaigns more complex.

Supporting E20 with Global Examples and Indian Readiness

Jain referred to Brazil's long experience with E27 (27 per cent ethanol) as evidence of viability. Most international automakers already support such blends, implying Indian-origin or India-sold cars should have no problems with E20. He expressed belief in the ecosystem developed thus far, such as regulatory structures, fuel standards, and manufacturer participation, to enable the transition to E20.

Looking Beyond E20? Perhaps Later

Whereas there's no instant step towards dual blends, Jain kept the door ajar. With India moving forward beyond E20 to higher ethanol blends, providing diversified fuel choices might be revisited sometime in the future. Meanwhile, however, E20 continues to be the country's uniform, crystal clear and single.

Context: India's Biofuel Journey

This is according to India's ethanol blending plan: from an aspirational vision a few years ago to exceeding 10 per cent ethanol blending ahead of the timeline, and now attaining E20 earlier than anticipated. In parallel, the government is promoting second-generation ethanol (from farm waste) and investigating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on a phased basis.

Public Concern and Industry Response

Though official guarantees have been made, unease lingers. Car manufacturers and some drivers are concerned with engine incompatibility, decreased fuel economy, and corrosion, particularly on older, non-E20-tuned cars. The ministry and independent research oppose these concerns: fuel efficiency effect allegedly minimal, component wear acceptable, and engine damage mostly anecdotal. These assurances are meant to pre-empt disinformation and support public confidence.

Will Existing Vehicles Require Changes?

For most post-April 2023 vehicles, fuel systems have already been upgraded to be compatible with E20 by automakers. Yet, numerous cars made before this time, particularly pre-2015 models, can suffer from material wear or engine knocking from increased ethanol levels. Compatibility lists were issued by manufacturers, and in a few instances, minor modifications like replacement of fuel lines or resetting the ECU might be necessary.

What Do Owners of Older Cars Do?

Owners of older cars are recommended to consult OEM advisories to ascertain E20 compatibility. In the event of incompatibility, the use of lesser ethanol blends where available (e.g., E10) is recommended for modifications from authorised service workshops.

Regional Readiness: States Leading and Lagging

States like Delhi-NCR, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka are already a step ahead in terms of E20 adoption because of robust ethanol manufacturing capability and superior blending infrastructure. In contrast, some north-eastern states and parts of the hill regions are set to experience slower rollout because of logistical issues, limited ethanol availability, and fewer blending facilities.

The Big Question: Is Going E20-Only the Right Move?

Requiring only one fuel mix streamlines rollout and enhances clarity. Is it overly inflexible, though? With no fallbacks, how do we guard against older car owners or areas of lower awareness? As India goes greener, must flexibility in fuel selection be sacrificed for tempo, or is consistency the wiser, more scalable route?",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/E20_Fuel_Pump_7db62410de.webp,N,,2025-08-09 10:56:13.223411

The PUC granted a site permit to Gopher State Solar for its project in Renville County , north of Bird Island in Kingman, Osceola and Bird Island townships.

The company has secured a 1,645-acre area and will place solar panels on 977 of those acres, as previously reported by the West Central Tribune. The project of up to 200 megawatts will use photovoltaic panels and connect to Great River Energy’s existing Panther Substation, according to the news release.

The company estimates it will cost $187.75 million to $242.5 million to develop, including construction and all of the associated engineering and permitting needs, according to the report by the West Central Tribune. It estimates the operation will generate $32 million in tax revenues over an expected 40-year life span.

A site permit was also approved for Coneflower Energy’s solar project of up to 235 megawatts in Custer Township in Lyon County. Coneflower has proposed two interconnection options — a new 345-kilovolt transmission line to a future Xcel Energy substation or a new switching station to connect to an existing 115-kilovolt transmission line, according to the news release.

Both projects are expected to be operational by late 2027.

Based on extensive community input and feedback from state and local agencies, the PUC directed the solar companies to undertake several key mitigation activities, according to the news release.

These requirements, which were a direct result of public engagement and consistent with site permits for other recent solar energy projects, include working with landowners to develop and implement visual screening to minimize aesthetic impacts, creating vegetation management plans for pollinator-friendly plants and employing local Minnesota workers.

“The feedback we received from local communities was critical to our decision-making process,” said Commissioner John Tuma in the news release. “We heard directly from landowners about their concerns, and as a result, the final permits require additional visual screening and landscaping. This is a great example of how engaging in the process helps us create a better result for everyone.”

These projects align with the PUC’s core mission of ensuring safe, reliable and sustainable utility services at just and reasonable rates, according to the news release.

By adding a combined 435 megawatts of solar capacity to the grid, these facilities will contribute to grid reliability and help the state meet its clean energy standards, according to the PUC.

Ambas empresas comenzaron a trabajar en la factibilidad del proyecto en diciembre de 2024, tras la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento (MOU), y actualmente avanzan en los términos contractuales definitivos de su alianza.

Producción con foco exportador

La producción incluirá principalmente SAF, el mencionado tipo de combustible para aviones elaborado a partir de fuentes renovables, pero también podrá generarse HVO (aceite vegetal hidrotratado), con propiedades similares al gasoil. Las materias primas serán aceites vegetales, residuos orgánicos y grasas animales.

""La ubicación de la Refinería de San Lorenzo resulta estratégica para este tipo de proyectos por la disponibilidad de materia prima en esta zona núcleo productiva y el vínculo con el puerto que habilitan la logística de comercialización"", explicaron desde YPF en un comunicado.

Qué es el SAF

El Sustainable Aviation Fuel es considerado por organismos internacionales como la única alternativa sostenible y escalable para la aviación en el mediano plazo. La demanda global proyecta un fuerte crecimiento, impulsado por las regulaciones ambientales y la necesidad de reducir emisiones de carbono en el transporte aéreo.

En ese contexto, YPF apunta a posicionarse como proveedor en mercados exigentes como Europa y Estados Unidos, que requieren combustibles certificados con estándares internacionales como el ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification).

""Con este paso, la compañía ingresa en un mercado global en expansión, alineado con las exigencias ambientales del sector aerocomercial y con alto potencial de desarrollo en los próximos años"", indicó la empresa dirigida por Horacio Marín.

Santa Fe busca posicionarse como un actor clave en la producción de combustibles sostenibles para la aviación. Bajo los ejes de Producción, Innovación y Trabajo, se impulsa el programa Santa Fe destino SAF, orientado a promover el desarrollo de biocombustibles.

De acuerdo a información oficial, la propuesta contempla la instalación de refinerías especializadas en SAF, con el objetivo de consolidar a la provincia como un referente nacional e internacional en materia de energías renovables.

“Ethanol blending gained serious momentum only after 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office.
Look at Brazil-they've run on E27 for years without issues,” Puri stated, warning that “vested interests” were attempting to derail India's ethanol revolution through misinformation.

Pioneering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Puri also spoke about India's push into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).","As India continues to push the boundaries of its clean energy goals, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday declared that “India's ethanol journey is unstoppable,” while participating in a Fireside Chat Session on the sidelines of the Pioneer Biofuels 360 Summit, held in the capital.

Responding to growing public interest and concerns around ethanol-blended fuels, Puri strongly defended the success and future of the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme. He revealed that India had achieved its ambitious E20 blending target in the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY)-five years ahead of the original 2030 timeline, and well in advance of the revised 2025 goal.

“Ethanol blending gained serious momentum only after 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office. At the time, blending stood at just 1.53 per cent. By 2022, we reached 10 per cent-five months ahead of schedule-and now E20 is already a reality,” Puri said. He emphasised that ethanol-blended petrol is safe and reliable, countering widespread concerns about vehicle damage.

“There has not been a single case of engine failure or breakdown since E20 became a base fuel 10 months ago. Look at Brazil-they've run on E27 for years without issues,” Puri stated, warning that “vested interests” were attempting to derail India's ethanol revolution through misinformation.

Environmental and Economic Benefits, Minister Puri underlined the multiple gains from ethanol adoption:

* Over ?1.4 lakh crore in foreign exchange savings

* Significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions

* Cleaner air and better engine performance

* Increased income for farmers

He noted that innovative ethanol production methods, such as 2G ethanol refineries in Panipat and Numaligarh, are turning agricultural waste like parali (crop stubble) and bamboo into clean fuel-addressing both pollution and farmer livelihoods.

Highlighting a major transformation, he said ethanol derived from maize had grown from 0% in 2021-22 to 42% in 2025, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of India's biofuel programme.

Flex-Fuel Vehicles and Future Targets. On the rollout of Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs), Puri said that Indian automobile manufacturers are already developing E85-compatible vehicles, in coordination with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

“The Ethanol Blending Roadmap (2020-25) has laid the foundation. With the success of E20, we'll now scale gradually to E25, E27, and E30, with BIS standards and incentives in place.”

Farmers as Energy Partners

The Minister stressed that ethanol blending is more than a fuel strategy-it's a social and economic revolution.

“This is about empowering our Annadatas (farmers), turning them into Urjadatas (energy providers). Over the past 11 years, ethanol procurement has enabled ?1.21 lakh crore income to farmers, reduced crude imports by 238.68 lakh metric tons, and saved ?1.40 lakh crore in foreign exchange,” he said.

Pioneering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Puri also spoke about India's push into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The Ministry is working with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global partners to build a phased SAF roadmap.1% SAF blending for international flights by 2027

2% target for 2028, with further scale-up as supply grows. He cited the example of the Indian Oil Corporation refinery in Panipat, which is already producing SAF from used cooking oil, showcasing India's innovation in sustainable energy.

As India races ahead in its energy transition journey, the Petroleum Minister's message was clear: ethanol is here to stay, and the country is not just catching up with global standards-it is setting new ones.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 11:56:25.789040

§48 – Energy Credit The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.
FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.","This is an updated version of the alert published on July 4.

President Trump signed H.R.1, commonly referred to as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (the ""Act"") into law on July 4, 2025. Below are our summaries of the amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations.

The focus of the changes in the Act are as follows:

Special rules apply to wind and solar, including (i) a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for facilities beginning construction after July 4, 2026, (ii) removal of ""energy property"" under section 48 from 5-year MACRS depreciation, and (iii) amendments to the applicable domestic content percentages under section 48E;

Enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, including (i) application of the ""material assistance"" rules to wind and solar facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, (ii) extending the period for assessment to 6 years for a deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"", and (iii) introducing accuracy-related penalties for understatements of income tax by more than 1% due to overstating the ""material assistance cost ratio"" of property qualifying for credits under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E;

Codification of the beginning of construction rules in IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, for purposes of the FEOC requirements;

""Metallurgical coal"" is eligible for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45X in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, and until Dec. 31, 2029; and

Clean hydrogen production facilities beginning construction before Jan. 1, 2028, remain eligible for credits under section 45V, with no applicable FEOC requirements.

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the Act, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after the year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property continues to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property continues to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits terminate for wind and solar facilities that (i) begin construction after July 4, 2026, and (ii) are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, are not subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar will phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill initially passed by the House of Representatives included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property will be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2027) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit is allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) are apparently not subject to the rule above.

Observation: Residential solar electric property is not subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers is still eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 may qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009, has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power are eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is fixed at 30% and can not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh does not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance is no longer necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate can not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the base credit amount is the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026).

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit terminates for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027; and

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit is terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently do not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate phases out based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, are not credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate phases out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) is credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, is not credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the Act), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules are required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components are credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers may still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period is extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and Treasury will provide distinct emissions rates for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z is not credit eligible, and Treasury is authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury is authorized to prescribe rules for sales to related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (and fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 that has not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) is not allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF does not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) does not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A is extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount is increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and is in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit may be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the “tech-neutral” ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

As of July 4, 2025, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification will not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§48D – Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

For qualified property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is increased to 35%.

Observation: An advanced manufacturing facility must begin construction before Jan. 1, 2027, to be eligible for credits under section 48D.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The Act does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" are prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X than to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;19

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or21

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally means 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" also means a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale does not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" is determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentages are:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentages are:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components, the threshold percentages are:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components, the threshold percentages are:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals, the threshold percentages are:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Act codifies that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury is required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027, applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Treasury must issue material assistance safe harbor tables by Dec. 31, 2026. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier is required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, is not included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification introduces an additional layer of complexity. The statute further authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity may be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty applies to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" means a disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" causes an ""excessive payment"" and incurs the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification is required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 10:56:26.229602

Taylor Swift received plenty of backlash for taking numerous flights on two private jets during her 2023 tour.
For example, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce planet-warming gas pollution for aircrafts by as much as 94%, according to the Department of Energy.","The week after July 4 is apparently a big one for billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Bob Iger.

That's when dozens meet for a massive annual summit coined as a billionaire summer camp. Business leaders from across the country fly into the Sun Valley Friedman Memorial Airport in Sun Valley, Idaho.

According to Business Insider, the airport may see as many as 190 aircraft arrive on the Tuesday following July 4, just about double what the airport usually welcomes.

Tim Burke, the director of the airport, told Business Insider that the event leads to ""the busiest week of the year here in the Wood River Valley.""

The annual summit is intended to bring CEOs together to discuss business and future power plays. But its carbon footprint is difficult to ignore. The influx of nearly 200 jets into a small-town airport highlights how many people — particularly the ultra-wealthy — prioritize convenience over the planet.

A 2023 report by the Institute for Policy Studies found that the top 1% of people may be responsible for half of all aviation emissions.

Another report from the European Federation for Transport and Environment stated that private jets may be up to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes.

That all adds up fast when dozens of private jets pile into a single rural airport. But it's certainly not the first case of public frustration over luxury travel and its environmental cost.

Taylor Swift received plenty of backlash for taking numerous flights on two private jets during her 2023 tour. Jeff Bezos also drew criticism when he added an $80 million jet to his collection.

Some of the criticism is because everyday consumers and families are encouraged to change their habits, like driving less or cutting energy use, to help the planet.

On a Facebook post from news anchor Maggie O'Mara (@MaggieOMaraJournalist), one commenter asked if the point of the summit was to ""laugh at the rest of us?""

Some alternatives could prove healthier for the planet if people can encourage the top 1% to get on board.

For example, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce planet-warming gas pollution for aircrafts by as much as 94%, according to the Department of Energy. Some aviation leaders are also experimenting with hybrid-electric aircraft, which can use about 5% less fuel than standard aircraft.

Supporting companies pushing for change, like those investing in sustainable airline fuel and low-emissions aircraft, could help move the industry in a cleaner direction.

It may also signal to billionaires that strong leadership means taking responsibility for actions that impact the environment.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/billionaire-summer-campimage-rec9YF9e5b4HicZri.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 10:56:29.759428

“We already have 113 compressed biogas (CBG) plants operational, with another 73 currently under construction,” he said, underlining the progress in clean energy infrastructure.
“Our domestic gas production is rising at an annual rate of 18%, though we still import about 50% of our natural gas requirements,” he noted.
In the meantime, we will continue to import, increase domestic production, and diversify our sources,” he said.
To reduce risk and ensure stable supplies, India now sources oil and gas from nearly 40 countries around the world.","Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, on Friday outlined India’s ongoing efforts to enhance domestic energy production while acknowledging the country’s continued reliance on imports to meet rising demand.

Speaking at the Pioneer Biofuels 360 Summit in New Delhi, Puri said India is making notable advancements in the bioenergy and natural gas sectors. “We already have 113 compressed biogas (CBG) plants operational, with another 73 currently under construction,” he said, underlining the progress in clean energy infrastructure.

The Minister pointed to the growing number of CNG-compatible vehicles entering the Indian market as another positive development. “If you look at the new car models being launched, many are CNG-compatible. That in itself is a success story,” he added.

Highlighting the scale of LPG distribution in the country, Puri noted that India now has 33.5 crore LPG connections, including 10.5 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. However, despite this extensive network, he admitted that around 60% of LPG is still imported.

“We are defying the usual trends. Even with such wide coverage of LPG connections, we remain dependent on imports,” he said.

To address this gap, the government is pushing forward on multiple fronts to increase domestic fuel production. “Our refineries will scale up output, and we’re ramping up efforts in exploration and production (E&P),” Puri said.

On the natural gas front, he reported positive growth. “Our domestic gas production is rising at an annual rate of 18%, though we still import about 50% of our natural gas requirements,” he noted.

Puri reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), stressing that while full energy self-sufficiency will take time, progress is being made. “A country like India, facing these challenges, is steadily moving toward self-reliance. In the meantime, we will continue to import, increase domestic production, and diversify our sources,” he said.

India, the third-largest energy consumer globally, currently uses around 5.4 million barrels of oil per day. It imports roughly 80% of its crude oil and 50% of its natural gas needs.

“Our theme reflects Indonesia’s future energy needs — securing supply through the sustainable use of biomass and bioenergy,” said Dr. Meika Syahbana Rusli, SBRC Chair at IPB University.

A major focus was the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as both an opportunity and a challenge for the country. Dr. Meika noted that while Indonesia has made progress in biodiesel production, SAF faces technical, economic, and logistical hurdles. “Our roadmap is ambitious: 1% of total fuel from SAF by next year, 2.5% by 2030, and 5% by 2035. These targets will not be easy to achieve,” he said.

SBRC is working on technology to turn solid biomass into bio-oil through gasification, which has drawn interest from Airbus Singapore. With supplies of lipid-based feedstocks for SAF expected to decline by 2030, biomass could become the primary raw material.

Edi Wibowo, Director of Bioenergy at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said the government is preparing new regulations to speed up bioenergy growth. “We want to maximise this potential to strengthen national energy independence and security,” he said.

The Pacific Northwest Low-Carbon Hydrogen Analysis was supported with funding from Washington’s Climate Commitment Act.
Report Resources The full Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Analysis and Alberta Hydrogen Analysis at www.pnwer.org/h2-study.","BRITISH COLUMBIA – The Pacific Northwest Economic Region (PNWER) announced the completion of landmark, multi-jurisdictional studies that provide a comprehensive view of supply, demand, and trade flow potential for low-carbon hydrogen across the Pacific Northwest. The cross-border Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Analysis was commissioned by Washington State Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Climate Solutions, and the Alberta Hydrogen Analysis was commissioned by the Government of Alberta.

The studies were conducted by Deloitte and developed to enable policymakers, industry stakeholders, Indigenous and Tribal Nations, and regional partners to better understand the economic landscape, funding tools and policy frameworks that support the development and deployment of hydrogen. Together, these studies serve as a resource to help develop robust cross-border hydrogen economies that attract investment, enable multi-sector uses and support high-quality jobs across the region.

“The Pacific Northwest has long been at the forefront of energy innovation,”Matt Morrison, PNWER executive director, said. “These new hydrogen studies build on this momentum and chart a path for how we can work together across jurisdictional borders to build an interconnected, low-carbon hydrogen economy that competes on the global stage.”

Pacific Northwest Low-Carbon Hydrogen Analysis

British Columbia and Washington state are demonstrated leaders in planning for and investing in low-carbon hydrogen economies to drive growth, diversify energy tools and enhance regional energy resilience. This first-of-its-kind study explores cross-border collaboration opportunities that leverage geographic proximity and existing relationships to drive economic growth, infrastructure development and hydrogen accessibility.

“Washington is a clean hydrogen leader nationally and internationally. We recognize the important role clean hydrogen plays in reducing harmful emissions, bringing good jobs to the state, and strengthening our robust clean technology industry,” Commerce Director Joe Nguyen said. “By building on our longstanding relationship with British Columbia and working more closely together, we can boost clean hydrogen market growth in our region and amplify its positive impacts here at home and across the broader Pacific Northwest.”

“Low-carbon hydrogen is part of a sustainable, clean energy future,” Adrian Dix, Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions, said. “Through B.C.’s Clean Energy and Major Projects Office, we are working with project proponents, industry, First Nations and local communities to create a world-leading hydrogen economy, and this collaborative work will help all of us in the Pacific Northwest to achieve that milestone.”

Each jurisdiction is critically positioned with alternative electricity grids and existing hydrogen technology expertise that supports infrastructure and energy development. The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program, plans to build eight hydrogen hubs across Washington, Oregon and Montana over the next 6-10 years.

Key Recommendations:

Share data and coordinate planning of hydrogen projects and initiatives across jurisdictions in the Pacific Northwest.

Evaluate opportunities to harmonize policies to facilitate cross-border hydrogen development, including funding mechanisms and seamless trade.

Support ways to involve, partner with and benefit Tribes, First Nations and communities. This includes educational resources, associations and collaboration to uplift indigenous voices.

Advance regional hubs and cross-jurisdictional corridors for aligned hydrogen and synthetic fuel use.

Commerce’s Green Electrolytic Hydrogen and Renewable Fuels Recommendations for Deployment in Washington Legislative Report (January 2024) informed study results. In recognition of shifting federal policy in the U.S. and Canada, the study emphasizes state/provincial-level planning and coordination between British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho.

Alberta Hydrogen Analysis

The Government of Alberta launched its Hydrogen Roadmap in 2021, which outlines a comprehensive strategy for hydrogen production, research and development, carbon capture and use cases across sectors. The new Alberta Hydrogen Analysis expands these efforts by putting forward recommendations to enhance Alberta’s hydrogen funding and regulatory landscape, support new and existing hydrogen hubs, assess potential for hydrogen-fueled transportation, and explore export potential to other Pacific Northwest provinces and states. The Government of Alberta will take the Alberta Hydrogen Analysis into advisement as it revisits the Hydrogen Roadmap in 2025.

“Hydrogen can be a game changer for Alberta and the Pacific Northwest’s energy diversity and security. The results of this research will inform Alberta’s Hydrogen strategy and create new partnerships, all while advancing innovation to ensure Alberta’s hydrogen economy continues to develop. Alberta will continue to grow as a Canadian and global leader in low-cost clean hydrogen production.” Brian Jean, Minister of Energy and Minerals, said.

Alberta has a well-established hydrogen value chain with hydrogen hubs in Edmonton, Calgary and other locations. The Government of Alberta aims to expand hubs in Alberta and the greater region to develop a comprehensive network of integrated hydrogen supply chains. Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho are expected to see significant increase in demand for hydrogen by 2050, giving rise to bi-lateral trade capacity and necessary cross-border cooperation. Alberta is the jurisdictional host for the 2026 PNWER Annual Summit in Edmonton next year.

Key Recommendations:

Ensure regulatory efficiency, codes and standards in a governance toolkit tailored to hydrogen hub operations.

Lead a formal platform for hydrogen hubs across Canada to share knowledge and best practices.

Build new market demand by implementing incentives and support tools to reduce hydrogen adoption barriers.

Fund research and development opportunities to lower costs through technology, innovation and attract capital investment.

Pursue hydrogen exports by conducting assessments on transportation logistics corridors to identify bottlenecks and investment opportunities.

Enable carbon capture, utilization and storage to reduce lifecycle emissions and support low-carbon certification.

Activate technology and innovation to underpin a successful long-term hydrogen economy strategy.

Both studies were presented in a session at the PNWER Annual Summit in Bellevue, Washington, and will be made available for online viewing. Policymakers, Tribal and First Nations, and industry leaders are encouraged to engage with the findings and participate in upcoming engagement activities.

Using these studies as a foundation, PNWER aims to lead the establishment of a Pacific Northwest Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition in partnership with the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association and Montana Renewables. Modeled after the Minnesota SAF hub, the coalition will convene regional stakeholders in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and western Canada to support the production, storage and deployment of SAF in the Pacific Northwest. The coalition is planned to meet in late summer 2025.

The Pacific Northwest Low-Carbon Hydrogen Analysis was supported with funding from Washington’s Climate Commitment Act. The CCA supports Washington’s climate action efforts by putting cap-and-invest dollars to work, reducing climate pollution, creating jobs, and improving public health. Information about the CCA is available at www.climate.wa.gov. PNWER gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Province of British Columbia through the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, and the Province of Alberta through the Ministry of Energy and Minerals and Ministry of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction.

In 2014, ethanol blending was merely 1.53%.

Responding to a question on the success of the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme, the Minister highlighted that ethanol blending gained serious momentum only after 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office. In 2014, ethanol blending was merely 1.53%. By 2022, India achieved 10% blending, five months ahead of schedule. The original target of 20% blending (E20) by 2030 was advanced to 2025 and has already been achieved in the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY). This success, the Minister noted, was made possible through sustained policy reforms such as guaranteed pricing for ethanol, allowing multiple feedstocks, and rapidly expanding distillation capacity across the country.

Dispelling misinformation and false narratives surrounding ethanol-blended fuel, Puri emphasized that there has not been a single case of engine failure or breakdown reported since E20 became a base fuel over the last 10 months. Citing Brazil’s example, he said the country has run on E27 for years without any issues.

Some lobbies with vested interests are actively attempting to create confusion and derail India’s ethanol revolution. However, such efforts will not succeed. The E20 transition is already firmly underway, backed by strong policy support, industry readiness, and public acceptance—and there is no turning back.

Elaborating on the benefits of E20, the Minister said it results into reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, enhances engine performance, and has already led to over ₹1.4 lakh crore in foreign exchange savings. He pointed out that 2G ethanol refineries in Panipat and Numaligarh are converting agricultural residues like parali and bamboo into ethanol, providing a win-win solution for clean fuel, pollution control, and farmer income. He further highlighted the remarkable growth of maize-based ethanol—from 0% in 2021–22 to 42% this year—calling it a transformational shift.

On the issue of Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs), Puri said that the Indian automobile industry has already demonstrated its capability. Indian OEMs have begun rolling out prototypes for E85-compatible vehicles. Continuous consultations have been held with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and other major auto manufacturers, and the direction is clear—progressively moving towards higher ethanol blends. The Ethanol Blending Roadmap (2020–25) has laid a strong foundation, and the successful rollout of E20—five years ahead of target—demonstrates both industry readiness and consumer acceptance. The country will now gradually scale towards E25, E27, and E30 in a phased, calibrated manner with the support of BIS standards and fiscal incentives.

The Minister stressed that ethanol blending is not just about mixing fuel—it is about empowering Annadatas by turning them into Urjadatas., reducing crude imports, saving foreign exchange, creating green jobs, and honouring India’s climate commitments. Over the past 11 years, ethanol procurement has enabled ₹1.21 lakh crore income to farmers, reduced crude imports by 238.68 lakh metric tons, and saved ₹1.40 lakh crore in foreign exchange.

Speaking about India’s efforts in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Puri said the Ministry is working closely with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global technology partners to develop and scale up SAF. Like ethanol, India will adopt a phased approach to SAF adoption. A blending mandate has already been initiated, with a target of 1% blending for international flights by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, and scaling further as supply stabilizes. He also cited the example of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. Refinery in Panipat, which is using used cooking oil to produce SAF—showcasing India’s innovative and sustainable pathway forward.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image002WXOH.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 11:57:05.940005

At the forefront of this transformation is OPAL Fuels, a renewable natural gas (RNG) innovator that has captured the attention of investors and policymakers alike. With a staggering 33% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) RNG production growth in 2025, OPAL is not just riding the wave of climate-conscious investing; it is engineering the wave itself.

Strategic Positioning in the RNG Sector

OPAL Fuels' success stems from its dual focus on technological agility and policy alignment. RNG, derived from organic waste streams like dairy manure and food waste, is a critical bridge between legacy fossil fuels and a net-zero future. Unlike synthetic alternatives, RNG leverages existing infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution. OPAL's vertically integrated model—spanning feedstock acquisition, production, and distribution—positions it to capitalize on the sector's rapid expansion.

The company's infrastructure pipeline is equally compelling. By 2026, OPAL plans to triple its RNG production capacity, with new facilities in key agricultural regions of California and Texas. These projects are not speculative; they are underpinned by long-term offtake agreements with major transportation and energy companies. This visibility into future revenue streams reduces operational risk, a rare advantage in the volatile clean energy sector.

Policy Tailwinds: The 45Z Tax Credit Extension

The recent extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit through December 31, 2029, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R.1), has supercharged OPAL's growth trajectory. The 45Z credit, which provides a per-gallon incentive for low-carbon fuels, is now more accessible than ever for companies like OPAL that prioritize domestic feedstock.

The 2025 amendments to the 45Z credit—requiring feedstock to originate from North America and excluding indirect land use change emissions—align perfectly with OPAL's operational strategy. The company's partnerships with U.S. dairy farms and waste management firms ensure compliance with these new standards, while the prohibition on double crediting for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) eliminates competition for overlapping incentives. This creates a “first-mover” advantage for OPAL in the RNG-to-transportation segment, where demand is surging due to corporate net-zero pledges and federal clean fuel mandates.

Data-Driven Investment Case

To quantify OPAL's momentum, consider the following:

- Production Growth: OPAL's RNG output has grown 33% QoQ in 2025, outpacing the industry average of 18%.

- Cost Structure: The company's all-in production cost of $1.20 per gallon (vs. $1.50 for peers) is driven by its proprietary anaerobic digestion technology and low-cost feedstock.

- Policy Leverage: With the 45Z credit now extended for five years, OPAL's effective tax rate is projected to drop by 15%, boosting EBITDA margins.

Risks and Mitigations

Critics may point to RNG's reliance on volatile policy environments and the need for continued infrastructure investment. However, OPAL's diversified feedstock portfolio, long-term contracts, and alignment with bipartisan climate goals (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act) insulate it from regulatory shifts. Additionally, the company's recent $200 million debt financing at historically low interest rates ensures it can execute its expansion plans without diluting shareholder value.

Conclusion: A Near-Term Buy

For investors seeking exposure to the decarbonization revolution, OPAL Fuels offers a rare combination of near-term scalability, policy tailwinds, and operational discipline. The 45Z extension through 2029 is not just a regulatory win—it is a catalyst for compounding growth. With RNG demand projected to grow at a 25% CAGR through 2030, OPAL is poised to capture a disproportionate share of this market.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 11:57:10.834661

Indian Oil's Panipat refinery has been crowned the country's first to pump out sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil, The Times of India reported. The word ""sustainable"" makes eco-warriors faint with joy, and SAF is just one ""E"" shy of SAFE. Maybe we should toss in Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's beloved ethanol and call it SAFE: Sustainable, Awesome, Fry-powered Ethanol.

Inspectors from Swiss certification firm Cotecna's Indian arm have certified the Panipat refinery, declaring it fit to turn your post-pakoda sludge into jet fuel. They have also saddled us with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a UN dream to make planes fly without guilt.

By 2027, India has been roped into blending 1% SAF for international flights, inching to 2% by 2028. Domestic flights will follow. Late arrivals are not new.

INDIA NO STRANGER TO SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

SAF is no stranger to our headlines, even if it makes little headway. Back in August 2018, SpiceJet flew a Bombardier from Dehradun to Delhi on a 75:25 mix of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and jatropha-based biofuel, cooked by the Indian Institute of Petroleum.

In 2022, IndiGo flew with a 10% SAF blend on a ferry flight from Toulouse to Delhi. These trips are made to make headlines, followed by the kind of silence you hear after a flop Bollywood sequel.

Jatropha, that weed we have idolised since childhood for its firepower, was once India's biofuel heartthrob. In the 2000s, we planted it like crazy, believing it would free us from oil imports. It did not. Yields on marginal lands were as pathetic as Raid 2, and it gobbled farmland, jacking up food prices. Now, it's a sidekick, not Shah Rukh Khan of biofuels.

Ethanol has had it better because it found a guardian in Nitin Gadkari. India hit 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025, five years early, saving Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange and pumping production from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres.

If your scooter is whining about mileage, and your car's fuel injectors are throwing tantrums, you clearly are from the petrol lobby. Tough luck, aam aadmi, tweet your tears, but ethanol is here to stay. Buy an E-20-compliant car and see the blending go up to E-27 as declared.

The government is now eyeing ethanol for SAF via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, aiming for 30 billion litres annually from crop waste and municipal trash. It is pricier than ATF, like Chayos chai versus roadside cutting, but who, if not you, will sustain the sugar industry by buying its byproduct?

REAL PAKODA OF COOKING OIL PUZZLE

Now, the real pakoda of a puzzle: collecting used cooking oil. Where will the Panipat refinery source the crude oil to refine, in this case, used mustard oil. By door-to-door collection, like trash collected every morning? Will we have 3 coloured bins now: green, blue and yellow for the oil? Or grovelling to pakoda-walas to donate their black, tar-like treasure, reused till it's basically liquid regret? The answer, my friend, is frying in the kadhai!

India could churn out 19-24 million tonnes of SAF yearly, but a 5% blending target needs 140 million litres of oil. That's a Himalayan pile of pakodas to fry. Supply chains are shakier than a cycle rickshaw on a Gurugram flyover. Villagers in Chhattisgarh and Karnataka scrounge jungles for jatropha seeds, which then hitch-hike hundreds of miles to refineries.

Here's where you, proud Bharatiya naagrik, become the hero India didn't ask for. Set up a pakoda stall, and you are not just self-employed, you are a cog in the crude oil supply chain to Panipat. Fry hard, dream big! India's gunning for 8-10 million tonnes of SAF by 2040, needing Rs 6-7 lakh crore in investments to cut oil imports by $5-7 billion annually. Over 1.2 million jobs could sprout, if we ever sort out this logistical circus.

advertisement

So, fuel your imagination, not disappointments. Turning your kitchen oil into jet fuel is like betting on a bullock cart to win Formula 1. If we can somehow wrangle the oily drippings from a billion samosa-holding hands, maybe, just maybe, that cart will zoom past the chequered flag. Until then, keep frying pakodas and save the planet.

In April, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 Enhanced Performance (EP) for the type, featuring lighter materials, improved aerodynamics, and upgraded turbine cooling. The result is at least a one percent reduction in fuel burn, translating into lower emissions, reduced costs, and potentially longer nonstop flights.

For airlines, even a marginal gain matters. On an 18-hour flight, the EP could save around $1,200 in fuel. The engine is also certified for 50% sustainable aviation fuel and designed to run on 100% SAF in the future. Delta Air Lines became the first carrier to receive an A350-900 equipped with the EP in June, with other operators expected to follow once FAA certification is complete.

While Rolls-Royce’s upcoming UltraFan may eventually surpass it, the EP offers a ready-now efficiency upgrade that strengthens the A350’s position as a leader in long-haul travel."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/528986518_122242199504064089_892948511151790057_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=melCmpG3-LYQ7kNvwGL9zKQ&_nc_oc=AdkAhzgmjtFnoNRrNRRHkST-FFSqaIgGURGimXy6GzibetX7mxRHoMVGPzH84NizaBiDUEwh8NLoJGLkkpbYEVIs&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=4ATcr6FD4issYnhAPpi9Ng&oh=00_AfVFwcGpMQcd9MgzTDR_2_KXsdWktIrf1R84sejqCes_0Q&oe=689C9B11,N,,2025-08-09 00:56:18.943932
