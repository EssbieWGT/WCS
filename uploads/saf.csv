This contract will help the international aviation sector meet carbon offsetting needs. It supports the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The new contract will trade on Xpansiv’s CBL spot exchange. It will also be available through partner exchanges. These include the Aviation Carbon Exchange (ACE), which CBL runs with the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The Johannesburg Stock Exchange’s JSE Ventures Carbon Market will also offer it.

This expansion is a big step in blending voluntary and compliance carbon markets. Airlines are now entering the first compliance phase of CORSIA.

The Growing Need for Carbon Credits in Aviation

The aviation industry is responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits are becoming more essential for airlines aiming to cut emissions. This is because alternative technologies, like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are still costly and not fully developed.

Under CORSIA, airlines must offset emissions above 2019 levels. They do this by buying carbon credits from approved projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases.

The demand for high-quality carbon credits will likely rise. This increase comes as more airlines and industries join compliance markets. ICAO recently projected that 100-150 million tons of CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) will be required during the first compliance phase.

RELATED: CORSIA Credits Soaring Costs: How They Are Reshaping Aviation’s Future

Xpansiv’s new GEO CP1 contract aligns with this growing demand, as remarked by John Melby, Xpansiv CEO:

“The transition into the compliance phase of CORSIA is a watershed moment for the rapidly converging voluntary and compliance carbon markets. Our new GEO CP1 contract has been carefully designed based on an extensive market consultation, which revealed a clear consensus to launch the contract only when deliverable supply was available and sufficient clarity around the ICAO framework was achieved. Those conditions have now been met.”

Standardized Trading and Market Transparency

One of the key features of the GEO CP1 contract is its alignment with CORSIA EEU eligibility criteria. When launched, EEUs from this contract will be sourced from top environmental credit registries. These include:

ART TREES,

ACR,

Climate Action Reserve,

Gold Standard, and

Verra.

When more registries get CORSIA approval, their credits can be used in the contract, too.

Xpansiv is using its strong market infrastructure to boost transparency and efficiency in trading. A unique sub-account structure developed for IATA’s recent EEU procurement events will also be available for GEO CP1 participants. This setup allows traders to trade the contract without needing main accounts for each credit standard. It makes access to CORSIA-compliant credits easier.

An analysis by Abatable suggests that demand for CORSIA credits could surpass available supply by 2030. Without new projects, CORSIA demand in Phase 2 can be 14x bigger than the supply.

Market Growth and the Role of Carbon Credits

The launch of the GEO CP1 contract comes at a time when the carbon market is experiencing rapid growth. In 2023, global carbon market revenues reached a record $104 billion.

Companies in aviation, energy, and manufacturing are turning to carbon credits. They use these credits to meet sustainability goals and follow regulations.

Regulatory frameworks like the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are boosting the demand for verified carbon offsets. Also, consumer demand and investor interest in sustainability have pushed companies to join carbon markets. As a result, investment firms and financial institutions are integrating carbon offset projects into their portfolios.

Even with this growth, the carbon market has struggled with price swings and unclear regulations. In 2024, carbon credit prices dropped due to shifts in global climate policies.

The global average carbon price stood at $32 per ton of CO₂, falling short of the estimated $50 per ton needed by 2030 to achieve Paris Agreement targets. Localized markets like California’s cap-and-trade system saw carbon prices hit $42 per metric ton in 2024. They are expected to rise to $46 per ton in 2025.

Xpansiv’s Performance in the Carbon Market

Xpansiv has seen significant growth in its trading volumes, particularly on its CBL platform. In November 2024, trading volumes almost doubled. This surge was fueled by Nature-Based Global Emission Offsets (N-GEOs). More than 600,000 tons were traded at prices between $0.30 and $4.10 per metric ton.

By mid-December 2024, over 2 million tons of carbon credits were traded on the platform. This made up 16% of all transactions for the year.

In January 2025, Xpansiv’s CBL spot exchange made headlines. It recorded over $27 million in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) transactions. This amounted to a total of 251,758 MWh.

These market trends show the increasing reliance on Xpansiv’s infrastructure for carbon trading and emissions management.

The Future of Carbon Markets and CORSIA Compliance

Looking ahead, Xpansiv is well-positioned to support the expansion of carbon markets. As companies and governments push for net-zero goals, the need for quality carbon credits will grow. Standardized trading tools like the GEO CP1 contract boost the trust and ease of access in carbon markets.

Government policies will also play a crucial role in shaping the future of carbon markets. Initiatives like carbon pricing, cap-and-trade, and carbon taxes will likely affect credit demand. Also, new tech like blockchain for credit tracking will boost market transparency. This helps stop problems like double counting.

There is still significant work to do to scale up supply and make SAF cost competitive with conventional jet fuel.","Ground Support Worldwide attended the Aviation Fuel Handling Training Symposium, hosted by Gammon Technical Products Feb. 18-20 in Irving, Texas, where industry experts presented to approximately 300 professionals from around the world.

Among the experts was Amy Carico, director of fuel services and technical standards at Airlines for America (A4A), whose presentation ""SAF 101 - Introduction to Alternative Jet Fuels and Their Handling"" provided an overview of this growing industry. A4A contributed these responses to GSW questions.

GSW: What does the term ""SAF"" really mean?

A4A: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is one of the many terms describing liquid aviation fuel that emits less carbon on a lifecycle basis than traditional, petroleum-based aviation fuel, while satisfying other relevant sustainability criteria and still meeting the rigorous specifications required to ensure safety of flight.

SAF can be produced from a variety of feedstocks that are coupled with production pathways that use different fuel-processing technologies. Depending on the feedstocks and production pathway, today’s SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by around 60-80% when compared to conventional jet fuel, with 100% reduction possible in the future.

Jet fuel has always been a complex mixture of hundreds of unique molecules, and each batch is unique, based on the crude slate and refinery processing. Sustainable Aviation Fuel meets the same technical and safety standards as conventional jet fuel. To be used in aircraft today, SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel.

GSW: What is SAF made of?

A4A: SAF can be produced from a number of different feedstocks including oils and fats, oil seed crops, woody wastes, municipal solid waste, CO2 and water.

All SAF that is used in aircraft today is a mixture of a synthetic blend component (SBC) and petroleum-based fuel. SBC, often referred to as neat SAF (not yet blended with conventional jet), is the industry-accepted technical term referring to a finished product meeting one of the ASTM D7566 annexes.

Prior to blending, SBC or neat SAF is not yet approved as a finished fuel and cannot be used in aircraft. It must be blended with conventional jet fuel prior to testing/certification as ASTM D1655 compliant jet fuel.

A mixture of SBC (or neat SAF) with conventional jet fuel creates Semi-Synthetic Aviation Turbine Fuel (SSATF) or Semi-Synthetic Jet Fuel (SSJF). After the SSJF has received one of

several sustainability certifications, it is then deemed and qualified as SAF. These are the industry-accepted technical terms.

Only SSATFs or SAFs that are already blended can be approved as finished fuels, and then be used in aircraft just like any other jet fuel.

GSW: Is there such a thing as fully synthetic aviation fuel?

A4A: Fully synthetic aviation turbine fuel (FSATF) is the industry-accepted technical term for a finished fuel that is made wholly of synthetic components (no conventional jet fuel). These are also commonly referred to as “100% SAF” and have been used on a number of demonstration flights conducted by airlines and OEMs. Because there is not yet an approved ASTM standard for these fuels, they have not yet been used on commercial flights.

FSATFs may contain fuel produced using only a single method of production or may be multiple approved D7566 annexes/production processes blended with each other. FSATFs are molecularly identical to conventional jet fuel and necessarily contain aromatic molecules in order to comply with ASTM D1655.

GSW: What do SAF logistics look like?

A4A: Most SBC or SAF production facilities are not adjacent to standard refining facilities, and SBCs need to be transported to blending facilities before transport to airports.

Pipelines are the safest, most efficient, most economical way to transport liquid fuels. Almost all jet fuel moves by pipeline. Today, no pipelines move SBCs or neat SAFs - only blended SAF can go into a pipeline.

To scale the SAF industry, infrastructure investments across the supply chain are needed. For example, the majority of pre-airfield tanks are not equipped to conduct a proper blend. Expanding the locations where SAF is produced and blended can support the efficient delivery of this fuel to airports.

EI 1533 is a document, produced through collaboration of the world’s leading subject matter experts, containing quality assurance requirements for semi-synthetic jet fuel and synthetic blending components. It defines handling procedures, testing and controls for various types of transportation and equipment used for import, export and shipping of SBC or SAFs. It is the global standard for handling of SBCs and SAF, and can be downloaded here.

GSW: How should SAF be handled at airports?

A4A: SAF requires no special handling, with no special checks or equipment modifications. Once the fuel has met D1655 requirements, it is considered the same as conventional jet fuel.

GSW: What is the industry's goal for adopting SAF usage?

A4A: U.S. carriers transport over 2.6 million passengers and 61,000 tons of cargo per day while contributing just 2 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. operators are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Expanding the availability, affordability, and usage of SAF will be essential to reach that goal. U.S. airlines have pledged to work across the aviation industry and with government leaders to make three billion gallons of cost-competitive sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available for use in 2030. Reaching these goals will require significantly increased commercial scale production and significantly more affordable SAF.

GSW: What do you foresee for the future of SAF usage?

A4A: The SAF industry is still in its infancy. As such, because of the high cost of SAF and the limited production of this fuel, SAF quotas or mandates are not appropriate. But support for voluntary SAF deployment initiatives and incentives can help to scale the growing industry.

SAF must meet rigorous certification and environmental criteria, and there are currently very few producers of SAF, so the costs are very high while logistics for feedstocks, production, blending and delivery are still being established. Scaling this industry will require continued policy support and stakeholder engagement to ensure that SAF is both affordable for airlines and profitable for fuel producers.

U.S. airlines are committed to making SAF commercially viable to support our environmental and supply diversification goals and have engaged with fuel suppliers and other stakeholders to support the nascent industry. There is still significant work to do to scale up supply and make SAF cost competitive with conventional jet fuel.

Accordingly, U.S. airlines welcome support for efforts to make SAF fully commercially viable and deploy SAF where it makes sense as we scale up. U.S. airlines are reaching out to policymakers, renewable fuels producers, and increasingly with the agriculture industry to find ways to more rapidly scale up the availability of affordable SAF. If we are collectively successful, in addition to the environmental benefits, there benefits to be gained for fuel producers, farmers and other feedstock providers, airlines, and the traveling public, We encourage fuel producers, airports, policymakers, environmental organizations and other stakeholders to work with us in cooperative ways to develop, evaluate and support policies that will, quite literally, get SAF off the ground.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/03/67d9a7a79bf8b42a36af0dbf-20250219_092502.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-28 17:56:25.172459

challenges while embracing transformative innovations. Labor shortages, capacity constraints, geopolitical tensions, and sustainability imperatives are reshaping operational strategies, while technological advancements in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and digitalization are redefining efficiency and resilience.

This comprehensive analysis synthesizes findings from industry reports, case studies, and regulatory frameworks to provide actionable insights for stakeholders navigating this complex environment. Key themes include the urgent need for workforce upskilling, infrastructure modernization, and the integration of sustainable practices to meet evolving e-commerce demands and regulatory standards.

Labor shortages and workforce dynamics

Labor shortages remain among the most pressing challenges for air cargo operators in 2025. The scarcity of skilled personnel - exacerbated by immigration restrictions and outdated hiring practices - has led to operational delays, increased overtime costs, and heightened safety risks.

Inadequate staffing at cargo terminals has extended shipment wait times, directly impacting customer satisfaction and supply chain reliability. Overburdened employees face declining morale, creating a cyclical problem of burnout and attrition that further strains productivity.

Leading organizations are implementing reskilling programs that combine technical training with soft-skills development to address these gaps. Microlearning modules and immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) are being deployed to simulate real-world scenarios, enabling workers to master equipment handling and safety protocols without disrupting operations.

Some airlines have adopted AI-driven predictive analytics to identify skill gaps and tailor training programs, resulting in improvements to operational efficiency. Partnerships with academic institutions complement these initiatives to create pipelines for talent in logistics management and aviation engineering.

Capacity constraints and infrastructure modernization

Air cargo terminals worldwide are operating at or near capacity, struggling to accommodate the surge in e-commerce-driven shipment volumes. At some major hubs, legacy infrastructure has led to bottlenecks in cargo processing, with average handling times increasing by more than 20% since 2023, in some cases.

Operators are investing in automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) and AI-led sorting technologies. Deployment of caster decking and IoT-enabled smart containers are significantly reducing cargo processing times while minimizing human error.

Modernizing infrastructure extends beyond terminal upgrades. Airports increasingly integrate with road and rail networks to create seamless multi-modal logistics corridors. The Port of Oakland's Phase 2 expansion project, for example, which includes electrified cargo loaders and automated guided vehicles (AGVs), has enhanced connectivity between air, land, and warehouse operations.

However, such projects require significant capital, posing financial challenges for operators already contending with inflationary pressures.

Geopolitical tensions and supply chain resilience

Geopolitical shifts, particularly U.S.-China trade disputes and regional conflicts, have forced air cargo operators to reconfigure supply chains. Alterations in global air freight routes due to tariff uncertainties and sanctions have increased average transit times.

Forward-thinking companies are adopting agile logistics models, in some cases leveraging blockchain for real-time shipment tracking and diversifying supplier networks across Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, reducing geopolitical risk exposure.

New trade policies, such as eliminating duty-free exemptions for low-value shipments, have complicated customs processes. Air cargo operators must now submit digital manifests 12 hours before departure, necessitating upgrades to compliance management systems.

Collaborative platforms like IATAʼs ONE Source have standardized documentation across 150 countries, reducing clearance delays. Mid-sized carriers' compliance

costs remain high, however, averaging $4.3 million annually.

Technological transformation and operational efficiency

AI is revolutionizing air cargo operations through applications in route optimization, predictive maintenance, and demand forecasting, enabling reduced fuel consumption through analysis of real-time weather data and optimized flight paths.

Similarly, predictive maintenance algorithms serve to decrease equipment downtime while extending the lifespan of critical assets like aircraft tugs and conveyor systems.

The shift from paper-based processes to digital platforms has accelerated, with most cargo handlers now using IoT sensors for real-time tracking. Blockchain technology ensures data

transparency across supply chains, enabling stakeholders to monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) for sensitive shipments like pharmaceuticals.

Sustainability imperatives and regulatory pressures

Sustainability has transitioned from a voluntary initiative to a regulatory mandate. The

International Air Transport Association (IATA) mandates a 5% SAF blend for all cargo flights by 2025, driving investments in biofuel production facilities.

Major companies are committing to achieving net-zero emissions, deploying electric ground support equipment (eGSE) and solar-powered warehouses at major hubs.

Meanwhile, circular economic principles are gaining traction, particularly in recycling unit load devices (ULDs) and packaging materials.

Simultaneously, fleet modernization initiatives are replacing older aircraft with fuel efficient models, cutting CO₂ emissions per ton-mile.

Cybersecurity in a digitally dependent ecosystem

Advancements aside, the industry’s reliance on digital systems has exposed vulnerabilities to AI-driven cyberattacks. In 2024, a ransomware attack on a major European cargo handler disrupted 15% of global air freight for 72 hours, highlighting the need for robust defenses. Solutions include zero-trust architectures, which restrict access to critical systems, and AI-powered threat detection platforms which aim to reduce incident response time.

Strict data privacy laws, such as the EUʼs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require cargo operators to encrypt sensitive customer information. IATAʼs Cybersecurity Certification Program has standardized protocols across 210 airlines, ensuring compliance while maintaining operational flexibility.

Strategic recommendations and future directions

What can be done to move air cargo handling into the next era with greater efficiency and cost effectiveness? The following areas offer ideas for a good start:

Workforce Development: Expand partnerships with technical schools and offer tuition reimbursement programs to address skill gaps.

Infrastructure Modernization: Prioritize automated systems and multi-modal hubs to alleviate capacity constraints.

Sustainability Integration: Accelerate SAF adoption through government subsidies and industry consortia.

Cybersecurity Resilience: Allocate 5% of IT budgets to AI-driven threat intelligence

systems.

Future research should focus on scaling AI applications for small-to-medium airports and

optimizing hydrogen fuel cell technologies for ground support equipment. Cross-industry

collaborations, such as the Air Cargo Tech Summit, will play a pivotal role in standardizing green technologies and sharing best practices.

The air cargo industryʼs ability to thrive in 2025 hinges on its capacity to balance operational challenges with technological innovation. By addressing labor shortages through targeted training, modernizing infrastructure, and embracing sustainability, stakeholders can build resilient supply chains capable of withstanding geopolitical and economic shocks.

As digital transformation accelerates, proactive investments in cybersecurity and AI will ensure competitiveness in an increasingly dynamic market. The path forward demands collaboration, agility, and a relentless focus on efficiency - qualities that will define the next era of global logistics.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/03/67d0775db3f9d7c15a75088e-20240817_10.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-28 16:56:51.095891

Transcript

Speed by itself is a joint development between British Airways and Lanza Jet. The project itself is split in two pieces. You've got Nova Pangea producing 2G ethanol using their process and that ethanol would then be used at The Lancet facility to take ethanol into SAF. The facility itself, so the lands is yet facility is going to be in the north of England. So it's going to be the first 2G ethanol SAF production facility in the Europe. On the current plan and it has the potential depending on where we get that ethanol from to produce carbon negative S. When when we say that we have to talk about the the CIO of the of the plant from all the way through from ethanol production, which is effectively outside defense line of Lanja jet. But ethanol production all the way through to the SAF production and logistics. So we have to look at the carbon intensity of the fuel from initiation all the way through to wing tip to produce that. Calculation.

Major aviation companies including SMBC Aviation Capital, AerCap, and Luxaviation have signed on, signaling strong industry commitment.

The “Book and Claim” method simplifies SAF access, especially benefiting smaller operators.

Airbus announced a pilot program running through 2025 to test a “Book and Claim” model, enabling operators to “book” SAF quantities and “claim” emission reductions—even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Airbus will purchase SAF certificates managed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognized sustainability body, and resell them to aircraft and helicopter operators. This boosts immediate demand and solves logistical challenges for smaller or remote operators.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, explained:

“Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

The first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed closely by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup—highlighting broad industry support.

In its current form, HEFA is mainly reliant on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction, which has several drawbacks since HDO requires large amounts and pressures of hydrogen, feedstocks of high purity and cost, as well as problematic sulfided catalysts that risk contaminating the biofuel product with sulfur. A process based on decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) offers an attractive alternative to HDO, since it requires lower amounts and pressures of hydrogen, feedstocks of low purity and cost, and simple supported metal catalysts. Herein, several geographically distributed oleaginous feedstocks – ranging from municipal waste feeds (brown grease) to pine chemicals (tall oil and rosin) – were upgraded to RD and SAF via deCOx. Powdered and engineered Ni-based catalysts were used for FOG-to-RD conversion via deCOx, evaluating deoxygenation over reducible and non-reducible oxides.

Engineered alumina-based catalyst showed superior deoxygenation activity and stability for up to 300 hours on stream. Similarly, quantitative conversion of FOG to SAF was achieved over bifunctional Ni-Cu-based catalysts with zeolitic supports, with deCOx and isomerization occurring in a single step. Initial screening studies performed in a semi-batch reactor revealed that upgrading distilled tall oil (DTO) over a Ni-Cu-based catalyst afforded all types of hydrocarbons comprising SAF, namely n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics. The same combination of feed, catalyst, and reaction conditions were applied in a fixed-bed reactor for a continuous experiment, consisting of two 72-hour cycles with catalyst regeneration in between. DTO conversion remained quantitative (~100%), with aromatic yields ≥80% regardless of time-on-stream. Most liquid products fell within the carbon number and boiling point range of jet fuel across all samples. Notably, the reaction produced all hydrocarbon classes found in SAF, with particular abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons. Since ~20% aromatics are required to swell elastomeric seals and prevent leaks in aircraft fuel systems, seal compatibility testing confirmed that the aromatics-rich SAF blendstock exhibited a volume swell percentage comparable to qualified SAF blends. Catalysts used for deoxygenation reactions were characterized using various techniques – including N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, microscopy, and temperature-programmed methods – to rationalize trends, propose reaction pathways, and elucidate structure-activity relationships. Finally, to evaluate the economic and environmental feasibility of this technology, techno-economic and lifecycle analyses were conducted on an integrated plant combining catalytic deoxygenation and hydrothermal gasification, producing hydrogen for converting tall oil fatty acid to SAF. The analyses revealed a minimum fuel-selling price of USD$0.39/L – lower than that of existing SAF pathways (USD$1.4/L) – with greenhouse gas emissions of 5.1g CO2-eq/MJ, which is 94% lower than fossil jet fuel (85g CO2-eq/MJ).",https://chem.as.uky.edu/themes/fwrd/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-28 18:57:22.439638

The energy gap in a superconductor is usually the same everywhere in the material.
In the 1960s, physicists wondered whether some superconducting materials could have stronger energy gaps in some areas, and weaker in others.
The modulation of the energy gap is at the scale of the space between the atoms in the material.
“The observed gap modulation represents the strongest reported so far, leading to the clearest experimental evidence to date that gap modulation can exist even at the atomic scale,” says lead author Lingyuan Kong.","Physicists have produced a superconductor which could help achieve room-temperature operations which would be useful in applications like medicine, transportation and lossless power transmission.

The new California Institute of Technology superconductor has stronger superconductivity in some areas and weaker in others.

Superconductivity is a quantum state where metals can conduct electricity with no resistance. It is already used to for powerful magnets in MRI machines.

The main drawback of superconductors is that the only materials known to achieve superconductivity require temperatures at extremely low temperatures within just a few tens of degrees above absolute zero (-273.15°C or -459.67°F.)

It costs a lot of money and energy to keep superconductors at such low temperatures. And the few superconductors which have been shown to operate at room temperature require immense pressures – another drain on dollars and power.

In normal metals, electrons move freely through a lattice of positively-charged ions made up of protons and neutrons. When the electrons bump into the ions, they lose energy. This is what physicists call resistance.

In superconductors, on the other hand, the electrons are weakly attracted to each other and bind together to form ‘Cooper pairs.’ Within small energy ranges, called energy gaps, the electrons remain paired and don’t lose energy when they collide with the ions.

The energy gap in a superconductor is usually the same everywhere in the material.

In the 1960s, physicists wondered whether some superconducting materials could have stronger energy gaps in some areas, and weaker in others.

The new Caltech research, published in Nature, has produced such modulation in flakes of an iron-based superconductor.

The modulation of the energy gap is at the scale of the space between the atoms in the material.

The researchers have named the new modulated state a Cooper-pair density modulation (PDM) state. Their modulation means the energy gap within the superconductor is up to 40% stronger in some areas.

“The observed gap modulation represents the strongest reported so far, leading to the clearest experimental evidence to date that gap modulation can exist even at the atomic scale,” says lead author Lingyuan Kong.

Kong’s team’s discovery was made possible by the first successful scanning tunnelling microscopy of an iron-based superconductor. This kind of microscopy works by moving a very sharp metal wire tip over a surface to reveal the surface’s structure at the atomic scale.",https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/team-finds-new-superco.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 15:56:08.540872

We believe that the targets are realistic and can be met,"" a spokesperson from Fuel Industry UK said.","The chief executives of four of Europe’s biggest airlines urged the EU to delay rules requiring the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) because of concerns over supply.

The EU requires all airlines operating in the region to use a proportion of SAF in its jet fuel mix. They must currently use SAF for 2% of the fuel mix but that will ramp up to at least 6% by 2030. The UK has a similar mandate that will rise to 10% in 2030.

The European Commission told Skift it rejects the calls for a delay: ""We consider the current SAF targets to be realistic and feasible,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. “We have reaffirmed to stay the course of the European Green Deal and will therefore stick to these targets. The focus is now on their implementation, and we will offer support where needed.”

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, was among the airline bosses at an aviation industry event in Brussels Thursday who spoke about the targets. “They want us to use SAF. Well show us where the SAF is. Realistically, the SAF does not exist. We don’t see it,” he said.

Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr added: “We need to cut and revise EU regulations quickly.”

Luis Gallego, CEO of British Airways owner IAG, blamed fuel producers for turning their back on greener fuels. “The oil producers say that they are not producing enough because they prefer to allocate the capital in fossil fuel or other activities,” he said.

Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary agreed and said that fuel producers told him they will not meet or have sufficient supply of SAF by 2030. “I don’t want to abandon those commitments, but I think it’s clear that the EU is going to have to move to the right,” he said. “We don't see a path toward the amount we need to reach the mandate. It needs to take the pressure off us and put it on the people who actually produce the SAF.”

SAF Supply Challenges

On the same day the airline executives spoke, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) published a report showing that fuel producers are falling behind on SAF production.

BCG surveyed over 500 aviation industry executives and found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of their revenue into SAF. High production costs and fuel prices remain the major challenges, the report said.

Fuel Industry UK, which represents oil majors such as BP and Exxon Mobil, told Skift it believes the targets will be met.

""Fuel companies are working hard to supply their obligations to meet the targets. We believe that the targets are realistic and can be met,"" a spokesperson from Fuel Industry UK said.

‘Trump is upturning everything’

The aviation executives also warned that Europe’s sustainability targets could result in the region’s air travel industry becoming less competitive, while President Donald Trump moves towards deregulation in the United States.

“Yes we have to be net zero by 2050 but competition is where it’s going to be. Everything is going to be subject to making the industry more competitive,” said O’Leary. “Trump in the White House is upturning everything. Europe is going to have to respond to that.”

While the future of SAF is still uncertain in the United States, a report from the non-profit climate group Climate Catalyst suggested that conservative states are benefiting from green jet fuel incentives, which has led experts to believe that SAF will not be dismantled in its entirety there.

EU transport director Magda Kopczyńska previously defended the EU’s SAF policy, saying production is increasing.

""Seven years ago nobody talked about alternative fuels in aviation. What we put in place are requirements for airlines to gradually have more SAF in the fuels they use,” she said at the Destination Europe summit in February.

That means a four-fold increase in Airbus’ procurement spending in India in a decade, up from $500 million in 2019.
Explaining the importance of India in the Airbus’ scheme of things, company officials said they don’t see India as a market only.
‘Make in India’, ‘Design in India’, ‘Innovate in India’ and ‘Train in India’ is said to be the guiding Indian strategy for Airbus, which has built its South Asia headquarters and a pilot training centre in New Delhi.
The Airbus CEO, as head of GFAS, had visited India last October.","That leaves sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the biggest hope to achieve the 2050 net-zero target and that’s where India held so much interest of the global aerospace industry at the Airbus Summit 2025, given its abundance of agricultural residues, ethanol, biomass, non-edible oil, municipal wastes, et al.

As against the global production of 2 million tonnes of SAF in 2024, India is estimated to have the potential to produce 8-10 million tonnes of SAF annually. Just think of how farmers in Punjab and Haryana, who have been burning stubbles and polluting the air, become stakeholders in SAF production.

“You can use this feedstock (for SAF) and also control pollution,” said Gabrielle Walker, co-founder of CUR8, a leading market-maker on carbon removals.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO, LanzaJet, a sustainable aviation fuel producer and alternative fuels technology company, spoke about how there was high interest in building a self-production facility and how his company is working with India on this.

LanzaJet is reportedly negotiating with Indian Oil Corporation for a joint venture to build an SAF plant in India.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus, said that what is happening in India and China in terms of sustainable fuel should not be underestimated.

“We are going from jet fuel to SAF. There is a unique opportunity for India to contribute to the growth of aviation and decarbonisation,” Faury told ThePrint. Airbus has been in touch with SAF stakeholders in India.

“We want to play catalyst to help grow the SAF ecosystem in volumes and also on manufacturers, regulators, airlines to pool the use of SAF. That’s a collaborative effort that needs to be done. India has a lot of potential for SAF and we are hoping that India will be showing the way and leading on the growth of SAF,” said Faury.

Airbus’ India strategy

But the discussions on SAF potential are only a small part of why Airbus, Europe’s biggest aerospace company, is betting so much on India.

Its CEO is expecting procurement of components and services from India to grow by about 50 percent in the next five years: from $1.4 billion today to $2 billion by 2030. That means a four-fold increase in Airbus’ procurement spending in India in a decade, up from $500 million in 2019.

It’s not just about the sourcing volumes, though.

The French company is now sourcing complex components from India, such as A320neo cargo doors (Tata), A320/A330 flap track beams (Dynamatic) and A220 doors (Dynamatic). In the last four years, the number of engineers hired by Airbus in India has more than trebled, from 1,000 in 2021 to over 3,500 today.

“India is not only a market for aviation. It’s also supplying to the world, to Airbus—many parts, systems, equipment, and that’s growing very fast. India is very strong in software, in equipment manufacturing, IT and engineering. That’s where there is really appetite from outside to collaborate,” the Airbus CEO told ThePrint.

Explaining the importance of India in the Airbus’ scheme of things, company officials said they don’t see India as a market only. The company is developing a holistic aviation and aerospace ecosystem in India across all dimensions—assembly, manufacturing, engineering, innovation, digital, training, education, maintenance and leasing, they said.

Airbus has already set up two final assembly lines in India, for C295 aircraft and H125 choppers. It has also started two pilot training centres with a capacity of 14 full flight simulators in India.

It is also partnering with the IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) and Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya, with Tata Strive for academic curricula, developing R&D centres, creating Aerospace Chairs at universities, investing into skill centres and offering scholarships.

‘Make in India’, ‘Design in India’, ‘Innovate in India’ and ‘Train in India’ is said to be the guiding Indian strategy for Airbus, which has built its South Asia headquarters and a pilot training centre in New Delhi. It has also announced a joint venture with the Tata Group to set up a second pilot training centre in Gurgaon, which will have 10 simulators.

Faury said Indian companies were scouting in Europe, looking at potential targets for M&A and trying to extend their footprint. There are opportunities in Europe.

“Therefore, I like the idea of the best Indian players going from India to the world. That’s what we see and we are encouraging. I am putting them in touch with the chairman of GIFAS, French aerospace and defence association… I have put some of them in touch with GIFAS in charge of SMEs,” said Faury.

The Airbus CEO, as head of GFAS, had visited India last October.

“We had 60 companies joining and creating contacts in India with Indian partners, suppliers, customers. India in integrating itself in the global aerospace industry,” said Faury.

At the Airbus Summit 2025 in Toulouse, the company presented a view of the technology that will create the single-aisle airliner of tomorrow.

Pinning down what the airlines of the next decade will look like is both very easy and nearly impossible at the same time.

With over a century and a quarter of development behind us, aerospace science and technology are pretty well established, as is the basic idea of what a commercial airliner looks like. It hasn't changed very much at all since the introduction of the jet engine in the 1950s.

On the other hand, aeronautics is far from a done deal. There's still a lot of room for technology to benefit from new tools, materials, and ideas. While the airliner of the 2030s might still look like the boring old cylinder-and-wings template that appeared in the 1930s, it can still benefit from remarkable innovations.

The problem for the predictors is that what these innovations will be is far from certain and how these innovations interact with things like the marketplace, regulations, and the infrastructure that supports the air industry makes predictions so difficult that if I could do so with any certainty, I'd be down the casino making a fortune playing Baccarat.

That being said, Airbus gave the public a glimpse of the future single-aisle passenger plane based on what the company is developing through its various projects. The presentation was frustratingly short on details, but it did provide some insights into what may be coming as well as clarification of Airbus's decision to slow-walk its hydrogen-powered airliner.

According to the company, the next generation of Airbus airliners will feature wings that mimic those of birds, making them lighter, thinner and longer. Based on work done at Airbus's Wing Technology Development Centre at Filton, England, which is home to the Wing of Tomorrow (WoT) research and technology program, the new wings will produce more lift for less drag. To offset these extra-long wings, they will be foldable, so the new planes will be able to use existing airport gates.

Another innovation is a new jet engine that Airbus is working on. The Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator replaces the present turbofan and cowling of modern jet engines with an open turbofan that is larger and sits out in the open. This is claimed to reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to present engines and will be able to run on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) at blends of up to 100%.

Along with new engines, Airbus wants to introduce hybridization, with lithium-ion or solid-state batteries and high voltage systems being used not only for propulsion, but as a way to run onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting, which would also reduce fuel consumption.

Another area is materials. Airbus wants to move away from Carbon-Fibrer Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) in favor of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Thermoplastic Polymer Composites (CFRTP). This new material is an improvement of CFRPs because it can be reshaped and reprocessed after forming, can be manufactured faster, has higher impact resistance, is recyclable and remoldable, and has lower processing costs.

The future airliner will also move more into the digital realm with systems that are highly connected and automated, with the ability to instantly update itself and with increased data processing speeds. In addition, new automatic assistance systems will make flying safer and help pilots to handle complex tasks with less distraction.

But why isn't the future Airbus airliner running on hydrogen? At the Summit, Airbus explained that it ran the numbers and found that, while it could build a successful hydrogen airliner, the plane would be successful in the same way that Concorde was successful. In other words, a technological triumph, but a commercial failure.

The market simply isn't ready for hydrogen planes. The regulatory framework isn't there, nor is the hydrogen economy to provide the green or gold hydrogen fuel, so while the new iteration of the 100-seat, 1,000-nm-range (1,150 miles, 1,850 km) ZEROe hydrogen liner is more advanced, with six engines instead of four, it will remain in development for now.

""Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonize aviation,"" Airbus Head of Future Programmes Bruno Fichefeux.

Today, Airbus engineers are actively developing innovative solutions that promise to revolutionise the future of aviation. How exactly?

Imagine a new Airbus single-aisle aircraft with wings designed with advanced aerodynamics and biomimicry in mind to generate significantly more lift, reducing fuel consumption and increasing efficiency. Its engines will consume 20% less fuel than current models, making air travel more decarbonised and cost-effective. To further support the fuel gains made with engine improvements, Airbus anticipates a growing role for hybridisation and electrification technologies.

And don’t forget materials: the aircraft will be built with materials that are lighter yet stronger, allowing for aircraft that are both more durable and easier to handle. Furthermore, Airbus is adopting a holistic approach to integrating a novel system platform that will include smart automation not only within the aircraft but also in ground operations and maintenance.

These innovations will transform how aircraft are built, operated, and maintained, setting the stage for a new era. But what are the details of these revolutionary changes that are in store?

Taking flight like a bird

Aircraft wings have evolved significantly in both design and functionality since the early days of flight. The first wings were simple, flat and straight, relying on basic aerodynamics to achieve lift and made of basic materials like wood. As engineering progressed over the years, wings became more streamlined and curved, optimising lift and reducing drag for better performance.

Compared to where they began, today’s aircraft wings may seem to be at the apex of innovation. But Airbus believes there is still a world of possibilities for improving wing design. In 2023, the company opened the Wing Technology Development Centre at its Filton site in the UK. It is home to the Wing of Tomorrow (WoT) research and technology programme, which is heavily involved in the design of the wing for the future next generation of aircraft. But the programme goes beyond design, targeting improvements in new wing manufacturing and assembly technologies.

While technical details are being kept tightly under wraps, some of the possibilities for a new wing have already been publicly disclosed, with the most prominent being a folding wing. This gives the aircraft a longer wingspan in flight, increasing lift and reducing drag, while still making it compatible with airport gates.

Powering a more energy-efficient aircraft

Similar to wings, the aviation industry has progressed through various models of engines over the decades, steadily improving the fuel efficiency, performance and safety of the propulsion system. While the piston engines of early aircraft provided the necessary thrust to get off the ground, they were limited in efficiency and speed. The turbojet engine, first introduced in the 1950s, changed aviation forever and permitted it to spread around the globe. Today’s turbofan engine offers improved fuel efficiency and less noise, which has led to it becoming the standard in modern commercial aviation.

To take things to the next level, Airbus is investigating the potential of a few promising engines technologies. One primary contender is the open fan. An open fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades that generate thrust are larger and not contained by a nacelle, the cowling that contains the fan in current-generation engines. This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.

Airbus is working with propulsion experts CFM on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator, which aims to show how this technology could reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to today’s most efficient single-aisle engines. Airbus plans to flight test RISE on its A380 flight test aircraft by the end of the decade.

Electrification and hybridisation improvements

Hybridisation means combining different energy sources instead of relying solely on jet fuel. This comes in a few different forms. First and foremost, the next generation of Airbus aircraft will be able to fly with a blend of up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). As SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, this compatibility standard will be a key lever in helping airlines reach their decarbonisation target.

But SAF is not the only way to reduce emissions. Airbus is also working on advancing hybrid-electric propulsion, which supplements the use of conventional jet fuel or SAF with electricity from batteries or fuel cells. This has the potential to reduce an aircraft’s carbon emissions by up to 5%. Much like hybrid automobiles, electric hybridisation can reduce fuel consumption by using otherwise wasted energy to power non-propulsive functions.

The EcoPulse demonstrator, a joint project between Airbus, Daher and Safran, gave significant insight into the use of lithium-ion batteries onboard an aircraft with a high-voltage network. Airbus is also exploring the potential of solid-state batteries, which could provide an optimal balance of energy and power output for the next generation of aircraft. These batteries could be used to power the aircraft while taxiing on the ground, as well as during flight for onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting.

Exploring new materials for increased efficiency

Just like the wings and propulsion system, the materials used to build aircraft have evolved significantly since the Wright Flyer’s wooden airframe took its first flight with cotton muslin wings. Wood was replaced by aluminium within the first few decades of flight, which in turn began to be replaced by carbon-fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) in the 1980s, as its superior strength and lighter weight improved fuel efficiency. Titanium has also come to play a key role in modern aircraft, as it is strong enough to be used for high-stress aircraft components but weighs less than steel.

Overall, materials have shifted from being weaker and heavier to now being high-strength and lightweight. This has led to improvements in safety, fuel efficiency and aircraft performance. But Airbus believes there is more progress to be made. One key pathway for improvement is researching how biomass composites and thermoplastics could replace CFRP, and the progress being targeted is not limited to weight reduction. Airbus is also seeking to make the aircraft manufacturing process both more sustainable – by choosing materials that are more easily recyclable – and to make it more efficient, with less waste and quicker assembly.

An example of these kinds of improvements is the Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD), an Airbus-led programme under Clean Sky 2’s Large Aircraft platform. Using carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic polymer composites (CFRTP) instead of CFRP, the demonstrator achieved its weight-saving target at a neutral cost and also proved greater manufacturing efficiency. The CFRTP is also easier to reuse and recycle than other materials.

The evolution of aircraft systems

Airbus disrupted the commercial aircraft market in the 1980s when it introduced fly-by-wire technology on the A320. By replacing mechanical controls with digital ones, the aircraft’s safety, manoeuvrability and reliability was improved. Soon adopted by the entire industry, fly-by-wire defines the fourth generation of aircraft flying today.

While fly-by-wire is now the industry standard, it is not the end of the road. Airbus is designing a common digital platform for a future next-generation single aisle, which will ensure safer and more efficient operations. These future systems will be highly connected and automated, powered by advanced computer platforms. These will permit automatic installation, updates and modifications of system applications, allowing for immediate improvements to enhance performance. At the same time, increased processing speeds supported by AI will increase the amount of data that can be securely processed. This will facilitate predictive maintenance and enhance passenger experience through the availability of real-time information.

Safety, the highest priority of Airbus, will also be further strengthened through increasingly automatic assistance technologies for pilots, helping them navigate complex operations with greater precision. This automatic assistance will also be expanded outside the cockpit, to ground operations and maintenance.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/d1eb512da94d8db3fe8ed11fd6b8bf01.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 13:57:00.163730

Running until June 2028, the EU-funded project, called PACIFIC, sees Airbus head a consortium that includes engine supplier Rolls-Royce, German aerospace research centre DLR, fuel supplier Neste, and universities in Finland, Germany and the UK.

PACIFIC is designed to improve modelling and prediction capabilities to better assess contrail formation.

Typically found in the upper troposphere at altitudes of 32,000-42,000ft, contrails are increasingly considered to have a warming effect on the atmosphere that is more short-lived, but potentially greater than, that of CO2.

Recent studies – including the Airbus-backed VOLCAN and ECLIF3 projects – have suggested that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can cut contrail production by up to 25% due to lower emissions of soot particles.

While more data is needed to validate those potential benefits researchers face a challenge to replicate the results obtained through flight testing.

“The repeatability and predictability are not there,” said Mark Bentall, Airbus head of research and technology programmes, speaking during the manufacturer’s Summit event in Toulouse on 25 March.

The accuracy of weather forecasts is a particular problem, with contrails only forming in ice super-saturated regions.

“It is very difficult to predict the weather. We have to schedule multiple aircraft, and then we don’t produce contrails and then we go home,” he says.

Airbus and its partners in the three-year study will assess how the composition of different fuels and the combustion process affects soot emissions and contrail formation.

“You can easily measure emissions on the ground – it is much easier than in flight – but it is harder to replicate the temperature, pressure and humidity conditions you find at altitude,” says Thomas Viguier, Airbus innovation and technology specialist.

To do that, Airbus will use a cold chamber – described by Bentall, half-jokingly, as a “big fridge” – supplied by project partner the University of Helsinki.

This will be located to the rear of one Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine on an A350 test aircraft and will cool the exhaust stream and “set the conditions so the water vapour emitted will freeze and generate ice crystals”, says Viguier.

“To actually create a contrail on the ground is something we have not done before,” adds Bentall, who hopes this will create a “repeatable test”.

Before it can begin tests with the ‘big fridge’, though, the project will need to select the exact fuels to test.

Starting with 10 different fuels, including Jet A-1, the team will run a series of combustion tests, both in the laboratory and on test rigs, to evaluate the soot particles produced by each and how different engine power levels affect that.

It will then select three fuels to take forward to the ground-test phase, examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties.

Separately, Airbus is to collaborate with major Canadian aerospace academic and research organisations to measure non-CO2 emissions from different fuel types.

Called CRYSTAL, the project includes ground- and flight-test campaigns at the airframer’s Mirabel site in Quebec using a Pratt & Whitney PW1500G-powered A220 test aircraft.

BY Global Bioenergies

The company supplied a batch of SAF to Safran, the world's second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer, to evaluate the specific properties of Global Bioenergies' SAF, used in its neat form, during the fuel injection phase prior to combustion in the engine. This phase is crucial to ensure, among other things, high efficiency and therefore lower fuel consumption. A test campaign was carried out near Rouen at CERTAM (regional innovation center of technological exchange in aerothermal and engines).

Frédéric Ollivier, CTO at Global Bioenergies, says:” The various simulations carried out by the CERTAM demonstrator have enabled us to test the behavior of our fuel under various conditions representative of an aircraft engine. Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF, without blending it with kerosene, produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, very similar to the spray from Jet A-1, the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”

ONERA, the French aerospace research center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies' SAF.

Emission levels were measured using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies, Jet A-1 as a control, and a blend of 50% SAF and 50% Jet A-1 (the maximum proportion currently authorized by ASTM when certifying Global Bioenergies’ process). These three batches of fuel were injected into the laboratory burner in order to quantify and characterize the non-volatile particles emitted during combustion, i.e. soot. Several representative conditions were tested to simulate soot emission levels, both on the ground and in flight.

The results obtained using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies show a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared with Jet A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory. The results obtained from the 50-50 blend show a reduction in particulate matter that is globally proportional to the SAF incorporation rate.

Louise Ganeau, research engineer at ONERA, explains, “Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally, and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore, from an environmental standpoint, SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, concludes, ” The properties of our fuel had already been validated when it obtained ASTM certification. The tests carried out today in the best French laboratories go even further in characterizing our product. These validations strengthen the attractiveness of our offer.”

During the A4E Aviation Summit taking place today in Brussels, the CEOs of Ryanair, IAG (International Airlines Group, whose main subsidiaries are British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, Iberia Express, Level, as well as IAG Cargo and Avios Group), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, respectively Michael O'Leary, Luis Gallego, Carsten Spohr and Benjamin Smith, expressed serious concerns about the feasibility of this ambitious target.

According to the CEOs of the main European airlines, the picture is worrying: the prohibitive costs and the limited availability of SAF represent insurmountable obstacles, seriously jeopardizing the competitiveness of the sector. Gallego stressed the urgent need for a European strategy that guarantees SAF at competitive prices, warning that without concrete interventions the only viable solution is to postpone the 2030 target. Spohr added fuel to the fire, calling on the EU to adopt ""light rules"" as part of the Green Deal. Both CEOs highlighted the lack of a coherent European strategy and an adequate regulatory framework to support the transition towards SAF.

The appeal of the 4 has sparked reactions at international level, first of all the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has expressed similar concerns regarding the availability of SAF and the associated costs. In particular, the association has underlined the need for government policies that incentivize the production of SAF and reduce costs. It has also highlighted the importance of investments in infrastructure and technologies to support the transition to sustainable fuels.

Let us not forget that the issue of SAFs is at the heart of the global debate on sustainable aviation, with several regions following suit and adopting similar policies and objectives. However, the challenge of large-scale production and cost reduction remains a significant obstacle, the solution of which seems far from being achieved. The request for a postponement raises questions about the implications for the EU's emission reduction targets and the aviation sector's commitment to sustainability.

“We are pleased to welcome Qatar Airways as not just a strategic partner, but a part owner in Virgin Australia.","28 March 2025: Qatar Airways Group and Virgin Australia have received final go-ahead from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for the airlines’ integrated alliance. This final determination officially signals the green light for Virgin Australia’s new 28 weekly flights between Australia and Doha – operated under a wet-lease with Qatar Airways – to proceed.

The ACCC’s authorisation of Qatar Airways’ partnership with Virgin Australia gives the Australian carrier access to the scale and expertise of a world-leading global airline and facilitates its re-entry into long-haul international flying. This will drive increased competition in the market while delivering greater choice and value for Australian passengers.

Utilising aircraft wet-leased from Qatar Airways, Virgin Australia is set to commence long-haul flights from Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to Doha from June 2025, followed by Melbourne to Doha in December 2025. Through the award-winning Hamad International Airport in Doha, the flights open up more than 100 connecting itineraries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and enable Australian passengers to benefit from a host of increased loyalty earn and redemption opportunities for Qatar Airways’ Privilege Club and Velocity members.

In addition to this, the flights will provide a significant boost to the Australian visitor and tourism economy, generating an estimated AUD$3 billion in economic value over the next five years.

The collaboration arrangement will also support jobs growth, both in Virgin Australia and across the broader aviation and tourism sectors in Australia, with Qatar Airways set to provide secondment opportunities for 20 Virgin Australia pilots and 40 cabin crew in 2025. Another important area of focus for the partnership is sustainability, which includes the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel initiatives.

This follows the Australian Government’s approval of Qatar Airways Group’s 25 per cent investment in Virgin Australia on 27 February 2025 – joining existing majority shareholder Bain Capital.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Officer, Engr. Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said: “Today’s announcement by the ACCC sends a clear signal of the appetite that exists for delivering competition, world-class service and value to Australian passengers.

“It also marks the start of a new chapter in the relationship between our two airlines, and I would like to thank our Virgin Australia colleagues and valued stakeholders for their tireless dedication to our shared ambition to create healthy competition within the local aviation market, as well as our collective commitment to supporting Australian businesses, Australian jobs and the wider economy.”

Virgin Australia Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dave Emerson said: ""This is a defining moment for Virgin Australia and the Australian aviation landscape. The ACCC’s final approval of our deeper strategic partnership with Qatar Airways marks the start of a new chapter for our airline and a world of opportunities for our people and customers.

“Already, we are seeing some of the positive benefits of the partnership, including increased sale activity on airfares between Australia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa thanks to increased competition.

“We are pleased to welcome Qatar Airways as not just a strategic partner, but a part owner in Virgin Australia. This reflects a huge vote of confidence from a leading global airline in our business and in Australian aviation more broadly.”

Bain Capital Partner, Mr. Mike Murphy said: “This important milestone allows the airlines to harness their collective strength and unlock new areas of cooperation for the benefit of Australian consumers. We are delighted to officially welcome Qatar Airways Group as a minority investor in Virgin Australia.”

This involves the use of biochar, which is largely produced in Switzerland and removes and binds CO2 from the atmosphere in the long term.

With this important step, the company is doing important pioneering work in Swiss helicopter flying together with its customers, which is now being expanded.

Thanks to the consistent implementation of the sustainability strategy, over 1,400 tonnes of CO2 have been removed from the air in recent months. This remarkable figure underlines Swiss Helicopter’s firm commitment to climate protection. Pilot training and check flights, which have been completely CO2-compensated over the past two years, also represent an important part of the CO2 compensation already achieved.

From one April 2025, Swiss Helicopter AG will now extend this environmentally friendly approach to all of the flight school’s training flights. This means that in future, all training and further training flights by prospective and already licensed pilots will also be carried out in a CO2-compensated manner. Charter flights by private pilots will also be CO2-compensated in future as a result of this step.

This step will almost double the amount of CO2 offset. The corresponding certificates with plants have already been guaranteed by the supplier from Switzerland for the coming years.

With this initiative, Swiss Helicopter AG is making an important contribution to the important reduction of emissions in the aviation sector in addition to the continuous reduction of CO2.

The proposal from the Iowa Economic Development Authority was considered in a pair of legislative hearings Thursday at the Iowa Capitol, where stakeholder groups and lawmakers offered their thoughts.

IEDA Director Debi Durham said the goals for the redesign, established by her agency and the governor’s office, were to make Iowa’s network of tax incentives balanced and responsible, and to provide a return on investment to taxpayers.

Durham and lawmakers in support say it is time to redesign the state’s tax incentives because many were created when Iowa had a less-competitive overall tax structure. Since statehouse Republicans have in recent years lowered Iowa’s business and personal income tax rates, not all incentives remain necessary, proponents argued.

“We want incentives that will allow us to compete but at the same time grow our GDP and basically create wealth in Iowa, and we believe we have done that,” Durham said.

Under Durham’s proposal:

Durham said the legislation is not perfect and acknowledged that various stakeholders will take issue with some of the proposals.

Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, a Republican from Wilton who chairs the House’s committee on tax policy, praised the legislative package but also said he has heard some concerns that he believes lawmakers will find to have merit and want to work through.

“I think it’s an extremely aggressive and necessary change to our tax credit system. As our (personal income tax) rate has lowered down to 3.8 percent, the need for some of these things has diminished,” Kaufmann said. “I think it’s an aggressive bill and I think that’s a great thing. Our tax system has become competitive; we need to make sure our tax credit system is competitive.”

Iowa stakeholders offer feedback

Lobbyists representing local economic development agencies and chambers of commerce, housing developers, nonprofits and community foundations, taxpayer advocates and an Iowa-based film production company testified Thursday during the public comment periods of the two legislative hearings.

Nonprofit and community foundation leaders were vocal in their opposition to the proposal to end the annual allocation to the Endow Iowa credit. Multiple speakers said the credit is vital to encouraging donors in their communities.

Lynne Carroll, executive director of Heart of Iowa Big Brothers Big Sisters in Marshall County, said the organization was able to start an endowment that benefits the community and has since grown thanks to Endow Iowa.

“The only reason that (endowment) has grown is due to the Endow Iowa tax credit,” Carroll said. “Those funds continue to help small nonprofits like me to be able to reinvest in the community — not just in that program or that agency for today or for this fiscal year, but for long term.”

A lobbyist for Kemin Industries, a biotech human and animal food company, said the proposed $40 million cap on what would be the renamed Research and Development Tax Credit would create uncertainty for Iowa businesses. The lobbyist said that uncertainty could sway a company that is considering whether to invest in Iowa or another state with a more robust research and development tax credit.

“From a certainty perspective for a business, be they someone large like Kemin or a startup, introducing the cap at $40 million will interject a lot of uncertainty for a business that decides that they may want to try to claim that credit and make business investment decisions in this state based on the availability of that credit being there,” Kemin lobbyist Dane Schumann said.

The proposal to add sustainable aviation fuel and boost the funding for the Renewable Chemical Production tax credit was welcomed by biofuels companies.

“Stakeholders from Iowa and beyond have had a conversation about what is necessary to bring staff to Iowa, and this is an excellent opportunity for the state to have new production,” said Kent Hartwig, of Gevo, a Colorado-based renewable fuels and chemicals company focused on aviation fuel. “These plants are substantial. They’re billion-plus investments that have massive trickle-down effects. …

“As we look to build these facilities that have significant capital investment, we need investment. We need Wall Street to say, ‘This is a place to invest.’ So incentives like this are meaningful. They will provide us with another chip to go to these Wall Street investors and say Iowa is a place to build this plant.”

Both of the twin bills, House Study Bill 305 and Senate Study Bill 1205, were approved by subcommittee panels of state legislators Thursday. That makes both eligible for consideration by the House and Senate Ways and Means committees.

Kaufmann said the House bill will be considered by the full committee in two weeks.

The proposed changes include introducing a new tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel production and temporarily increasing tax credits for workforce housing.

Some in the business community have concerns about the implementation of a cap on the research activities credit and the elimination of the Endow Iowa program.

Supporters of the revamp argue that it will help Iowa maintain a competitive business environment while ensuring fiscal responsibility.

Iowa lawmakers have pushed forward the state economic development chief's proposed wide-ranging revamp of financial incentives used to spur business development that they predict will result in ""significant"" savings for the state.

Industry partners are embracing the Iowa Economic Development Authority's pitch for a new tax credit that would encourage sustainable aviation fuel production and for a temporary boost to workforce housing tax credits, which require projects to be priced affordably for entry-level workers, seniors and families.

But there was some pushback from the business community on a provision that would implement a cap on Iowa's research activities credit and on the proposed elimination of the Endow Iowa program that nonprofits say encourages philanthropic giving.

In partnership with the governor's office, Debi Durham, director of the IEDA and Iowa Finance Authority, said agency officials considered how to overhaul business development incentives while being fiscally responsible.

After Iowa legislators cut corporate, income and other taxes in recent years, Durham said the more targeted slate of incentives would help Iowa maintain a competitive business environment.

""There's some people that say to me, 'Well, we don't need incentives as we just become more competitive,' and I wish we lived in that world, but we don't, because if you've got 49 other governors and economic developers, they're competing,"" Durham said. ""We want incentives that will allow us to compete, but at the same time grow our GDP and basically create wealth in Iowa. And we believe we have done that.""

The new incentives would be capped at $110 million annually, a sharp drop from the existing $170 million cap.

However, the state doesn't always dole out the maximum amount for each tax credit program, so Durham said the amount the state would save is ""significant"" but didn't yet know the exact fiscal impact of the proposal.

As lawmakers on House and Senate Ways and Means subcommittees advanced the measure Thursday, they were overall positive about the proposals, House Study Bill 305 and Senate Study Bill 1205. The bills stoked larger conversation about the role of financial incentives in enticing economic development projects.

""I just have a hard time keeping all of these programs in place in perpetuity, because at what point in time are we trying to stimulate an activity, and at what point in time does it become a subsidy in perpetuity?"" said Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, chair of the Senate's tax policy committee.

Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said he largely saw the bill as a positive, but had some concerns about scaling back certain programs.

""I see some real pluses in here, and I know that she (Durham) got the direction that they need to find some savings in economic development, and unfortunately, we put a squeeze on her over the years that I wasn't very supportive of because I think economic development policies are the driver offunding everything in this state,"" Dotzler said. ""I mean, if you're a big fan of education or health care orwhatever, this is where it comes from.""

Rep. Derek Wulf, R-Hudson, said the bill was a ""great start” but had concerns about the proposed changes to the research activities credit program and Endow Iowa.

How would the IEDA alter tax credit programs?

Durham is proposing vastly reshaping the state's financial incentives:

Replace the High-Quality Jobs Program with Business Incentives for Growth. Reduce the allocation from $68 million to $50 million.

Sunset the state's Angel Investor Tax Credit program, established in 2002 to jumpstart venture capital investment in Iowa startups. Create a new Seed Investor Program in combination with an existing Innovation Fund. The state would offer $10 million a year in tax credits.

Replace the existing Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit with one for sustainable aviation fuel. The state would double allowable credits from $5 million to $10 million annually.

Replace the uncapped research activities tax credit program administered by the Iowa Department of Revenue with one run by IEDA and institute a $40 million annual cap. This would save about $16 million a year, though the amount currently doled out varies. The new program would be limited to specific industries and require an application.

Temporarily bump the $35 million workforce housing tax credit program to $43 million in fiscal year 2026 (the budget year spanning July 1 through June 30, 2026) and $40 million in fiscal year 2027, addressing pent-up demand from when the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues and delayed projects.

Keep the redevelopment (brownfield/grayfield) tax credit allocation at $15 million to transform abandoned and underused properties, but making some technical changes to the current verification process.

Maintain the $45 million allocation to the historic preservation tax credit program, but make owner-occupied single-family homes ineligible.

Eliminate the Endow Iowa program that helps community foundations attract donations with donors getting a state tax credit equal to 25% of the gifts, up to $100,000. Cutting it would save $6 million annually.

Establish a two-year pilot program for in-state film production. That program would provide a rebate after expenses to projects that qualify — up to $10 million annually.

Sunset or repeal tax credits for targeted jobs (saving about $2.2 million), assistive devices and employer child care. It would save about $2 million to cut the employer child care tax credit, which has never been used since its creation in 2022.

What do businesses, other groups say?

Kent Hartwig, director of state government affairs for Gevo, a renewable fuels and chemicals company with a focus on commercializing sustainable aviation fuel, said the proposal presented ""significant opportunity"" for the sustainable aviation fuel industry in Iowa.

He said it would help companies build sustainable aviation fuel plants, which typically exceed $1 billion.

""As we look at the opportunities to grow and where should we build, we need to have the ability to finance these plants,"" Hartwig said. ""And so this is the type of incentive that says to Wall Street invest inGevo, invest in SAF, because there's a support system in place.""

Officials with community foundations and nonprofits opposed eliminating the Endow Iowa tax credit and feared it would hinder development prospects, especially in rural areas or communities that have relied on donations to pursue major projects or recover from disasters.

Christina Bateman, a lifelong Atlantic resident, said her town relied on a $23 million gift using the Endow Iowa program to give a boost to a $75 million public-private partnership creating a new child development center, 144 new housing units and expanding an existing YMCA.

“Rural communities just really need all the tools in the toolbox in order to be successful,"" she said, asking to keep tax credits as they are.

Nate Ristow, president and CEO of the Iowa Taxpayers Association, said the research activities credit is one of the key incentives for Iowa businesses.

Based on a survey of the group's members, he said estimates show Iowa businesses have invested $3 billion in research in Iowa, and that employs more than 20,000 Iowans. Jobs pay more than $100,000 a year on average.

""These are good, paying jobs that Iowans fill, and where companies do their research is where they produce, and investments made in research lead to new innovative products, new production lines and new businesses,"" Ristow said.

Speakers were resoundingly pleased to see more funding toward the workforce housing tax credit program to address high demand for more affordable housing.

Craig Patterson, representing the Professional Developers of Iowa, an association of economic development professionals, said ""the workforce housing piece is a huge, huge win for us"" and hoped to see expanded funding become permanent.

But there were concerns about Senate File 465, which tweaked the eligibility for historic preservation tax credits.

Rebecca McCarley, of Cedar Rapids, told lawmakers barring single-family homes from participating in the program would threaten small-scale efforts, often led by nonprofits, to rehabilitate single homes at a time.

""This is going to have a huge economic impact,"" McCarley said.","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/02/PDEM/75486910007-reynolds-india-cs-010.jpg?crop=8639,4861,x0,y449&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-03-28 07:56:29.015325

Korean Air opts for GEnx and GE9X engines to power new aircraft

Korean Air has reinforced its commitment to modernisation by ordering GEnx and GE9X engines to power its newly acquired fleet of Boeing aircraft. This follows the airline's agreement to purchase 20 Boeing 777-9s and up to 30 Boeing 787-10s.

As part of the deal, Korean Air has also signed a service agreement with GE Aerospace covering the maintenance, repair, and overhaul of the GE9X engines. With this move, the airline becomes the first GE9X customer in South Korea.

Walter Cho, Chairman and CEO of Korean Air and Hanjin Group, emphasised the importance of the collaboration, saying: “GE Aerospace provides the advanced technology that powers our commitment to excellence. Our partnership is essential to Korean Air's vision of becoming the world's most loved airline.”

Since its introduction in 2011, the GEnx-engine family has accumulated over 62 million flight hours, making it GE Aerospace's fastest-selling, high-thrust engine. More than 3,600 GEnx engines are currently in service or on order, powering two-thirds of all 787 aircraft in operation today.

Meanwhile, the GE9X engine, available exclusively on Boeing's 777X family, is the world's most powerful commercial aircraft engine. It delivers a 10% improvement in specific fuel consumption compared to its predecessor, the GE90-115B, and boasts industry-leading emissions efficiency.

Both the GEnx and GE9X engines are already certified to operate on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends, supporting Korean Air's commitment to a more sustainable future in aviation.

NextGen CDR Facility’s clientele spans a diverse array of industries, reflecting a broad commitment to carbon removal across the corporate spectrum.","This week, high-quality carbon dioxide removal (CDR) facility NextGen welcomed a major new buyer for its curated portfolio of durable CO2 removal projects.

Japanese megabank Mizuho Financial Group, the world’s 15th largest bank with assets totaling $2 trillion, has become the latest buyer of carbon removal through NextGen.

Happening at a time when securing carbon removal funding still poses a challenge for many in the industry, this landmark partnership signals trust in this rising decarbonization sector, setting an example for other businesses and organizations to include CDR into their sustainability strategies.

NextGen, a joint venture between South Pole and Mitsubishi Corporation, offers its clients access to high-integrity CDRs delivered by solutions that successfully store carbon for more than 1,000 years at an average price of $200/tonne.

Patrick Bürgi, Chairperson of NextGen and Managing Director Japan / Co-Founder at South Pole, shared that NextGen, South Pole, and Mitsubishi Corporation are delighted to welcome a globally leading financial institution like Mizuho among the list of CDR buyers.

He stated, “Carbon dioxide removals are critical to climate action, now more than ever. We need more institutions entering the market from every angle. Meanwhile, NextGen remains committed to upholding high integrity and low risk through our diversified portfolio approach.”

«Companies and governments must partake in carbon removal,» Megan Kemp, NextGen CDR

Shinichi Tsunoda, operating officer & general manager of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., commented, “For Mizuho, participating in the early NextGen initiative as a buyer constitutes our first step into the technology-based CDR field at the core of decarbonization.”

“Going forward, Mizuho will positively contribute to the broader implementation of technologies that will further technology-based CDR in Japan, as well as to the commercialization of the CDR field.”

Following the announcement of this deal, our team had the chance to ask Megan Kemp, Global Head of Strategy at South Pole and NextGen CDR, a few questions around this milestone development and future vision of CDR.

Carbon Herald: What are your expectations for 2025 in terms of CDR purchases? Do you expect more companies to make the same move as Mizuho?

Megan Kemp:

2025 is set to be a pivotal year for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), with corporate purchases continuing to accelerate. According to CDR.fyi, purchases of durable CDR grew 78% in 2024, and deliveries rose by 120%. This trajectory suggests that demand will continue to grow as companies recognize the importance of securing high-durability removals early, however the decline in the number of unique buyers (down 18%), mean there is still significant work to do to support bolder corporate engagement.

NextGen CDR expects to see more companies following in the footsteps of Mizuho and other early movers. Organizations are increasingly driven by a combination of factors: mitigating regulatory risk, building sustainable branding, and strategically investing in a market expected to expand significantly in the coming decades. We are already witnessing increased participation from financial institutions, consulting firms, and industrial players who are locking in high-quality supply ahead of anticipated regulatory shifts.

Commenting on the recent inclusion of carbon dioxide removal in the draft version of the Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2 released by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), Megan states,

While we welcome SBTi’s inclusion of near- and long-term removal targets for Scope 1 emissions and believe it will improve market signalling on demand, there is room for much greater ambition in this area. This is a step in the right direction, but not yet a breakthrough moment for durable carbon dioxide removals (CDRs).

To drive real progress, these targets must be made more specific and actionable, ensuring companies address their ongoing and residual emissions while investing in the critical, future removal infrastructure we need – today. Let’s also not forget that both nature-based and technological removals are critical for achieving long-term climate goals and resilience.

Relevant: SBTi Opens Door To Carbon Removal, Releases Net-Zero Standard For Public Consultation

However, voluntary demand alone will not be sufficient to scale to the levels required by 2050. Government action remains crucial in setting clear compliance signals and de-risking investments in CDR.

NextGen CDR continues to work with policymakers in the US, EU, Japan, and the UK to ensure that robust and scalable policies support the long-term growth of this market.

Governments such as the US, Canada and Denmark have committed to purchase CDR, which we will see come to fruition in 2025, and potentially drive a wave of follow-on investment in government diligenced projects.

In 2025, we anticipate further momentum as more companies recognize that CDR is not just a cost but a strategic investment in a net-zero future.

What changes need to be made within the carbon removal sector to stimulate bolder corporate CDR investments?

To unlock bolder corporate investments in carbon dioxide removal (CDR), several critical barriers must be addressed:

Cost Sensitivity: Corporates remain highly price-sensitive to technological CDR solutions, with the 2024 average price at $350/t. Large-scale adoption will require cost reductions, making investment in scaling efforts over the next 1–3 years essential. Governments play a crucial role in accelerating cost declines through subsidies, innovation funding, large-scale procurement, and contracts for difference.

Unclear Corporate Claiming Guidance: The inclusion of interim targets for permanent CDR credits in SBTi’s draft Corporate Net-Zero Standard Version 2.0 is a step in the right direction. However, it is essential to extend this to Scope 2 and 3 emissions to ensure meaningful corporate action today and drive market scale.

Slow Compliance Market Integration: Technological CDR will remain expensive and below the necessary scale unless fully integrated into compliance markets. While the UK, EU, and Japan have committed to including tech-based CDR, progress has been slow. Speeding up this transition is key to creating long-term demand signals.

Market Complexity and Trust: With over 30 standards, 100+ methodologies, and multiple overseeing bodies, navigating the CDR market remains challenging. The introduction of the ICVCM’s Core Carbon Principles will help establish clarity on high-quality standards, while the EU’s development of BECCS and DACS methodologies under the CRCF will provide a critical baseline for voluntary and compliance markets.

Looking ahead to 2025, we see a clear path to overcoming these barriers. The speed of change will be the decisive factor in driving stronger corporate commitments and accelerating the scale-up of high-quality CDR solutions.

Do you notice a specific company profile among your clients? Are NextGen services procured by specific industries?

NextGen CDR Facility’s clientele spans a diverse array of industries, reflecting a broad commitment to carbon removal across the corporate spectrum.

Our founding buyers include Boston Consulting Group (management consulting), LGT (private banking and asset management), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (shipping and logistics), Swiss Re (insurance), and UBS (financial services).

The addition of Mizuho Bank, a prominent financial institution, further underscores the financial sector’s proactive engagement in carbon removal initiatives.

This diversity among our clients indicates that NextGen’s services are not confined to specific industries; rather, they appeal to organizations across various sectors that are committed to achieving net-zero emissions, collectively scaling the market and addressing climate change through durable carbon removal solutions.

Are there other CDR collaborations in the pipeline that would further enrich the NextGen portfolio?

NextGen will complete its diversified portfolio of high-quality, permanent carbon dioxide removals in 2025. We will be contracting several new long term offtakes from a range of technology types and geographies, which will announce throughout the year.

By increasing the number of long term offtake agreements we enter in to, we are able to stimulate the CDR market by:

What is Airbus ZEROe?
Airbus notes that, with ZEROe, it was looking ""to explore the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells.""
ZEROe A380 testbed shelved as Airbus looks to develop a global ecosystem One of the most interesting aspects of the Airbus ZEROe program in its early years was the fact that the manufacturer was looking to use the first-ever A380 as a testbed for the new hydrogen engines.
However, as reported recently by Aerospace Testing International, Airbus has since decided to shelve the plans to use a modified superjumbo as a testbed for its new ZEROe hydrogen engines.","Recent years have seen sustainability become an increasingly important factor in major decision-making processes across all facets of the modern aviation industry. Airlines, airports, and aircraft manufacturers located all around the world are working hard to optimize their operations, with initiatives pertaining to sustainability often finding themselves at the heart of this drive in the race to net zero by 2050.

In terms of aircraft themselves, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely considered to be a useful stepping stone, as it can be used in varying blends on conventional commercial aircraft. However, in the longer term, manufacturers are considering alternative propulsion methods, and the potential design alterations that would need to be made on new planes in order to accommodate this. For Airbus, the future of the company's commercial aircraft manufacturing lies in the ZEROe.

What is Airbus ZEROe?

Airbus has long been something of an innovator in the diverse and dynamic world of commercial aviation, with its maiden airliner, the A300, being the first widebody aircraft in the world to be powered by just two jet engines. Since then, it has continued to make history, with the multinational planemaker's A380 being the first-ever commercial jetliner with two full passenger decks. In recent years, the firm's A321XLR has been touted as the future of long-haul narrowbody flights.

Want to know more about sustainability in aviation?

However, Airbus has also been looking further into the future with concepts for brand-new aircraft powered by alternative propulsion systems. It first revealed these in September of 2020, when, in order to celebrate Zero Emissions Day, the manufacturer unveiled designs for three all-new aircraft that would be powered by hydrogen instead of conventional jet fuel or SAF . Commenting on the launch of the project, known as ZEROe, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury stated that:

""This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen. The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight. I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen - both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft - has the potential to significantly reduce aviation's climate impact.""

Airbus notes that, with ZEROe, it was looking ""to explore the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells."" The company has since decided on hydrogen fuel cell technology as the primary propulsion method for these aircraft, explaining that ""the results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, supported the viability of this technology.""

Four different designs

Given the famously diverse nature of the commercial aviation sector, which has always been a dynamic industry, but especially in recent years, as airlines' fleets and networks have grown, there is no 'one size fits all' solution to hydrogen propulsion. This is why Airbus launched the ZEROe program with three different concepts, and it has since added a fourth to its repertoire as research into the matter continues.

Two of these feature conventional fuselages, at least in relation to the kinds of aircraft that we are used to in commercial aviation. The first is a turbofan-powered airliner designed to carry up to 200 passengers for distances of more than 2,000 NM (3,704 km), with hybrid-hydrogen engines providing thrust. This will be joined by a twin-turboprop design able to carry up to 100 passengers more than 1,000 NM (1,852 km), powered by hybrid-hydrogen engines with eight-blade propellers.

Moving away from these aircraft designs that have relatively conventional fuselage structures in terms of what we are currently used to, Airbus' third initial ZEROe design was a Blended-Wing Body (BWB) aircraft. The company aimed for this plane to have similar capacity and range specifications to its hydrogen turbofan design, but, as pictured below, it would feature a blended fuselage with engines on the top.

In December of 2020, Airbus subsequently revealed a fourth ZEROe concept. This was ""based on an electric propeller propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells which transform the hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction."" As Simple Flying reported at the time, this would be powered by six quick-swap removable fuel cell pods ""that act as standalone turboprop motors"" and have eight-blade propellers made of composite materials. Airbus went on to note recently that:

""In 2023, the ZEROe teams powered on the future hydrogen-propulsion system designed for the fully electric concept aircraft.""

Originally aiming for a 2035 introduction

At the time of the project's launch, Airbus set itself the goal of getting its new hydrogen-powered commercial airliners into commercial service by 2035. This gave the company a 15-year window to get the project over the line, with hurdles such as investment, hydrogen storage and transportation, and refueling capabilities at airports among the major hurdles. Speaking in 2020, Guillaume Faury stated:

""These concepts will help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world's first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035. The transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem. Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.""

As mentioned earlier, airlines, airports, and manufacturers across the globe are working on the shared sustainability goal of getting their emissions down to net zero by 2050. As such, getting its new ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft into service by 2035 would put Airbus well ahead of the curve. This timeline also allows a cushion for delays, which looks like a useful factor based on recent developments.

Latest news: heavy delays

Indeed, according to a report last month by Sustainability Magazine, Airbus now believes that it is more realistic to target the late 2040s as the timeframe for full-scale commercial deployment of its new ZEROe hydrogen-powered airliners. This is because, as the publication puts it, ""the anticipated hydrogen economy required for successful deployment may be five to 10 years behind Airbus's expectations.""

The projected delays reportedly largely boil down to a lack of confidence in current hydrogen infrastructure availability. After all, for such aircraft to be deployed on a global scale, the relevant infrastructure would have to be rolled out worldwide. However, research on this front has slowed, as Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury recently made a point of noting during a recent interview with Sustainability Magazine:

""There's been a lot of work in the last years on bringing a green hydrogen supply to a number of industries as a way to decarbonize. Analysis of the landscape and progress has shown that a lot of projects have been put on the back burner, have been delayed, or are of lesser importance than what was expected five years ago. By entering a hydrogen plane into service, there would need to be sufficient green hydrogen supplies, so we are working with airports.""

Faury notes that some progress has been made on this front, with Airbus having ""partnered with a number of airports which are willing to start introducing hydrogen in their operations ahead of the plane [coming into service]."" However, the company has yet to see ""the growth of the ecosystem that we need to see happening with sufficient confidence to gain comfort that entry into service would be successful from the hydrogen supply perspective,"" so ZEROe will be delayed.

ZEROe A380 testbed shelved as Airbus looks to develop a global ecosystem

One of the most interesting aspects of the Airbus ZEROe program in its early years was the fact that the manufacturer was looking to use the first-ever A380 as a testbed for the new hydrogen engines. This was confirmed in February of 2022, with various factors making the quadjet an ideal aircraft for the job. As noted in coverage by Simple Flying at the time of the announcement, these included the extra redundancy offered by its extra engines and the extra space onboard.

However, as reported recently by Aerospace Testing International, Airbus has since decided to shelve the plans to use a modified superjumbo as a testbed for its new ZEROe hydrogen engines. According to the Financial Times, this news came as part of a wider package of cuts on this front, with the publication noting that Airbus will ""cut the budget dedicated to its hydrogen initiatives by 25%.""

Despite the disappointment attached to these recent developments, Airbus remains confident in its plans to build a global hydrogen ecosystem. According to the multinational European planemaker, the company has already amassed a list of ""more than 220 airports as partners, in addition to numerous energy providers and airlines"" in its attempts to take hydrogen technology global. This will be a key step forward in ensuring that its ZEROe program faces no further delays.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-106.png,N,,2025-03-28 06:56:07.186423

The SAF Registry

IATA is developing the SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It tracks the environmental benefits of SAF as they move across the SAF value chain, and enables the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

IATA’s director general, Willie Walsh, called the SAF Registry “a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF”.

The SAF Registry is intended to help solve the challenge of limited SAF supply, which IATA says is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally, by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, it gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on the capacity of firms to co-finance the cost of decarbonization. Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.

CADO’s goals

CADO’s mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, said that the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO.

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations. CADO membership is open to organizations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain; states or quasi-state organizations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry; and related interest groups indirectly benefiting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.",https://www.passengerterminaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IATA-establishes-Civil-Aviation-Decarbonization-Organization-to-operate-SAF-registry-e1743003570839.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 10:56:53.067254

1. Introduction

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are derived from biomass, organic waste, and carbon dioxide, offering an alternative to traditional aviation fuels composed of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons. The primary goal of SAF utilization in the modern day is to decrease carbon emissions in the aviation industry while maintaining traditional aviation fuels’ unique chemical properties, consistent with improved resistance to temperature fluctuations, freezing, and high-temperature explosions. Recent efforts to achieve this goal include initiatives led by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation industry by 2050. Nevertheless, the aviation industry accounts for approximately 2% of greenhouse gas emissions internationally, highlighting the importance of SAFs in mitigating the effects of global warming by implementing normal and isomeric alkenes to mimic the properties of traditional fuels [1].

Various materials have been proposed as feedstock for SAF production. Among the most prevalent production pathways include hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFAs), derived from vegetable oils, algae-based oils, and animal fats refined through the two-phased process of hydrogenation. Alcohol-to-jet (AJT) technologies have also been used to alter the carbon structure of alcohols, such as ethanol and isobutanol, through molecular bonding and deoxygenation. Additionally, power-to-liquid (PtL) has shown promise in converting carbon-containing materials, renewable electricity, and non-fossil carbon dioxide to produce refinable synthetic liquid hydrocarbons and crude oils by combining hydrogen synthesized from water electrolysis with carbon dioxide (CO₂) captured through Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis [2]

However, significant barriers remain preventing large-scale SAF production. Although HEFA has already shown promise as a commercially viable SAF pathway, ATJ, PtL, and FT technologies are still in early development. Moreover, many sustainable feedstocks used for these processes have also raised biodiversity and deforestation concerns, are limited in supply, and often compete with other industries that heavily depend on these materials, such as biodiesel production [3]. Additionally, global infrastructure facilitating SAF refinement, transportation, and storage is scarce, rendering production logistically challenging.

This paper will evaluate recent advances in the development and scalability of SAF technologies. With an emphasis on identifying efficient and cost-effective producing methods using various feedstocks like algae, biowaste, and renewable electricity to reduce carbon emissions within aviation while meeting growing industrial demands, this review will also discuss research into blending ratio optimization, life cycle analysis, and policy frameworks to incentivize large-scale SAF adoption despite recent challenges in the field.

2. Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuels

2.1 Algae-Based SAF

Algae-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production relies on microalgae and cyanobacteria, which can efficiently convert CO₂, water, and sunlight into lipids suitable for biofuel conversion. As illustrated in Figure 1, algae accumulate high lipid contents under optimized conditions, making them a promising alternative to conventional oil crops [35]. The process typically involves cultivation in open ponds or photobioreactors, followed by

lipid extraction and hydroprocessing to generate hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), the most widely accepted SAF pathway [4].

One of the primary advantages of algae-derived SAF is its high biomass yield and minimal land-use impact, allowing for production without competing with food supply chains. Furthermore, microalgae can be cultivated using non-arable land, saline water, and industrial waste streams rich in CO₂, enhancing sustainability [5]. However, scalability remains challenging due to the high costs associated with cultivation, harvesting, and lipid extraction. Improvements in genetic engineering and strain selection have led to enhanced lipid accumulation and growth rates, with recent studies demonstrating lipid contents exceeding 50% of dry biomass in optimized conditions [6].

Despite its potential, commercial viability depends on reducing energy-intensive processing steps. Current research focuses on integrated biorefineries that utilize residual biomass for biochar, biogas, or high-value co-products to offset costs. Additionally, advancements in direct catalytic conversion of whole algae biomass—bypassing lipid extraction—are being explored to improve process efficiency and economic feasibility [7].

2.2 Waste Biomass and Residual Feedstocks

Waste biomass-derived SAF leverages agricultural residues, forestry waste, municipal solid waste (MSW), and industrial byproducts to create drop-in fuels while reducing landfill waste and emissions. The most common conversion methods include thermochemical processes such as gasification-Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis and pyrolysis, which break down biomass into synthesis gas (syngas) or bio-oil, respectively, before upgrading into aviation-compatible hydrocarbons [8].

Agricultural residues, including corn stover, wheat straw, and sugarcane bagasse, are rich in cellulose and lignin, making them ideal for biofuel production through enzymatic hydrolysis or catalytic depolymerization. Forestry residues, such as sawdust and bark, have also been utilized in bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis, with upgraded biofuels showing promising fuel properties comparable to conventional jet fuel [9]. Additionally, MSW conversion provides a scalable alternative by repurposing plastic waste and organic fractions into liquid hydrocarbons through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and catalytic cracking [10].

Challenges in waste biomass utilization include heterogeneous feedstock composition, which affects conversion efficiency and fuel quality. Advanced pretreatment methods, such as steam explosion and torrefaction, have been employed to enhance biomass reactivity and improve overall process yields. Recent studies indicate that blending bio-based intermediates with petroleum-derived fractions can improve SAF compatibility and cost-effectiveness, supporting wider industry adoption [11].

2.3 Renewable Electricity and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Fuels

Power-to-liquid (PtL) technology enables synthetic fuel production from CO₂ and renewable electricity, offering a fully decarbonized alternative to conventional aviation fuels. The process involves electrolytic hydrogen (H₂) production via water electrolysis, followed by FT synthesis or methanol-to-jet (MTJ) conversion, where hydrogen reacts with captured CO₂ to form liquid hydrocarbons suitable for aviation applications [12].

One key advantage of PtL fuels is their potential for carbon-neutral operation, as the CO₂ used in production can be sourced from direct air capture (DAC), industrial flue gases, or biogenic emissions. When coupled with wind, solar, or hydroelectric power, PtL fuels achieve near-zero lifecycle emissions while ensuring fuel security and scalability independent of biomass availability [13]. However, high energy input requirements and electrolyzer efficiency limitations currently hinder large-scale deployment.

Advancements in high-temperature co-electrolysis using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have demonstrated higher conversion efficiencies and lower operational costs than conventional alkaline or PEM electrolysis. Additionally, catalysts optimized for selective CO₂ hydrogenation are improving hydrocarbon yield and product selectivity, making PtL fuels more commercially viable [14]. However, recent techno-economic assessments indicate that PtL fuels currently have higher production costs compared to fossil jet fuel, with projections suggesting that cost parity may not be achieved in the near term. Factors such as the high energy requirements for electrolysis, limited availability of low-cost renewable electricity, and the nascent state of carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure contribute to these challenges. For instance, a 2023 study reported that the production costs for e-kerosene are higher than recent fossil jet fuel prices, ranging from approximately $340 to $1,370 per ton, depending on various factors including electricity costs and plant scale [15]. These findings suggest that significant technological advancements and policy interventions will be necessary to make PtL fuels economically competitive with traditional jet fuels.

2.4 Comparison of SAF Feedstocks: Benefits, Challenges, and Maturity

As evidenced by section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, SAFs can be derived from various feedstocks, each with unique advantages and challenges. Algae-based SAF offers high lipid yields and can be grown on non-arable land, but its commercial viability is limited by high production and extraction costs. Waste biomass and residual feedstocks, including agricultural and municipal waste, provide a scalable and cost-effective SAF pathway, though feedstock variability and pretreatment costs pose challenges. This pathway is already commercially viable. PtL fuels, produced using renewable electricity and captured CO₂, present a fully decarbonized alternative, independent of biomass availability. However, high energy demands and infrastructure costs currently limit widespread adoption. As summarized in Table 1, waste biomass-based SAF is the most commercially mature, while algae and PtL fuels hold long-term potential with continued advancements in cost reduction, technology scaling, and policy support.

3.Production Pathways and Optimization Strategies

3.1 Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) represent the most commercially viable pathway for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, accounting for the majority of current SAF supply. The process involves hydrotreatment of renewable lipid feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, waste fats, and algal lipids (primarily in the forms of cooking oil or animal fats), to produce drop-in biofuels that meet conventional jet fuel specifications. Observable in Figure 2, HEFA fuels undergo hydrodeoxygenation, hydrocracking, and isomerization to remove oxygen and adjust hydrocarbon chain length, resulting in a fuel with high energy density and compatibility with existing aviation infrastructure [16].

One of the key advantages of HEFA-based SAF is its low sulfur content and improved combustion characteristics, leading to reduced particulate emissions compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel. However, feedstock availability and cost remain primary constraints to large-scale adoption. While waste fats and used cooking oils provide cost-effective alternatives, their limited supply necessitates the expansion of dedicated oilseed crops, such as camelina and carinate, or advancements in high-lipid algae cultivation [17].

Recent research has focused on catalyst optimization and process integration to improve HEFA yield and reduce hydrogen consumption. Studies on NiMo and CoMo catalysts have demonstrated improved deoxygenation efficiency, while novel bifunctional catalysts incorporating zeolites enhance selectivity for jet-range hydrocarbons [18]. Additionally, co-processing HEFA intermediates in petroleum refineries is emerging as a cost-effective strategy, leveraging existing infrastructure to scale SAF production [17].

3.2 Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) Conversion

The alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway utilizes fermentation-derived alcohols, such as ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol, as precursors for SAF production. The process involves dehydration, oligomerization, hydrogenation, and distillation to convert short-chain alcohols into branched and cyclic hydrocarbons that meet jet fuel specifications [19].

A key advantage of ATJ fuels is their feedstock flexibility, as alcohols can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and syngas fermentation. However, the pathway is less mature than HEFA and requires higher processing energy due to the additional chemical steps involved [19]. Additionally, selectivity and catalyst efficiency play crucial roles in determining overall fuel yield and economic feasibility.

Recent advancements include improved dehydration catalysts, such as zeolite-based materials, which enhance conversion efficiency and minimize byproduct formation. Additionally, genetically engineered microbial strains have been developed to increase alcohol titers in fermentation, reducing downstream processing costs [19]. In a recent study, an optimized ATJ process using butanol from biomass fermentation achieved a conversion efficiency of 84% with a jet fuel yield exceeding 50% by weight—a significant improvement over earlier designs [19].

Despite its potential, ATJ SAF remains more expensive than HEFA-derived fuels, with production costs largely dependent on feedstock sourcing and process energy requirements. Ongoing research into integrated biorefineries and process intensification is expected to improve the pathway’s commercial viability [20].

3.3 Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis

Gasification followed by FT synthesis is a thermochemical pathway for SAF production, converting solid biomass, municipal solid waste (MSW), and other carbonaceous feedstocks into liquid hydrocarbons via syngas (CO + H₂). The process consists of high-temperature gasification, syngas cleaning, FT synthesis, and hydrocracking to generate aviation-compatible fuels [20].

The FT pathway is particularly attractive due to its feedstock versatility and ability to produce a wide range of hydrocarbons, including diesel and jet fuel. Additionally, FT-derived SAF has excellent combustion characteristics, featuring a high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and near-zero sulfur content, resulting in reduced particulate emissions compared to conventional jet fuel [20].

Despite these advantages, FT SAF faces significant economic barriers due to high capital investment requirements and relatively low process efficiency. One of the primary challenges is syngas purification, as contaminants such as tars, ammonia, and sulfur compounds can poison FT catalysts and reduce overall conversion efficiency [20].

Recent advancements in biomass pretreatment, catalyst development, and process intensification have led to improved FT SAF yields. For instance, Co-based and Fe-based FT catalysts have been optimized for higher selectivity towards jet-range hydrocarbons, while hybrid gasification approaches incorporating plasma-enhanced and catalytic gasification have shown promise in reducing syngas cleaning costs [20].

A key area of research focuses on blending FT SAF with conventional fuels to improve fuel properties and emissions performance. Recent trials indicate that a 50/50 FT-blended fuel can achieve CO₂ lifecycle reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, supporting regulatory approval and industry adoption [20].

3.4 Emerging Catalytic and Electrochemical Approaches

Beyond conventional SAF pathways, emerging catalytic and electrochemical conversion technologies are being explored to enhance process efficiency and reduce carbon intensity. These include direct CO₂ hydrogenation, electrochemical CO₂ reduction, and biocatalytic routes that utilize engineered microbes for hydrocarbon synthesis [20]. One promising approach is high-temperature co-electrolysis, where solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are used to convert CO₂ and H₂O into syngas, which can then be processed into SAF via FT synthesis. This method has demonstrated higher conversion efficiencies and lower energy penalties compared to traditional electrolysis and gasification routes [20].

Another innovative pathway involves heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of CO₂, utilizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and single-atom catalysts to selectively produce liquid hydrocarbons. Recent studies have reported conversion efficiencies exceeding 60% with low-temperature, low-pressure operation, making this approach attractive for distributed SAF production [20]. Biotechnological advancements are also contributing to SAF development, with genetically engineered microbes capable of directly converting CO₂ into hydrocarbons via engineered metabolic pathways. For example, engineered Clostridium strains have demonstrated continuous biofuel production from industrial CO₂ waste streams, providing a sustainable and scalable alternative to fossil-based aviation fuels [20].

While still at the early TRL (Technology Readiness Level) stages, these emerging technologies hold long-term potential for cost-effective, carbon-neutral SAF production. Future research will focus on scaling these approaches, integrating them with renewable energy sources, and improving catalyst longevity and process stability [20].

4. Optimizing SAF Blending and Lifecycle Analysis

4.1 SAF Blending Ratios for Performance and Emissions

Sustainable aviation fuel is designed to be compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure through blending with conventional jet fuel. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has established specifications under ASTM D7566, which currently permit blending ratios of up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway [21]. These specifications ensure that the blended fuel meets the necessary performance and safety standards for aviation operations while maintaining engine reliability and fuel efficiency. While most commercial operations use SAF blends up to 50%, certain SAF pathways, such as Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK), have been approved for 100% SAF use in test flights. Recent trials conducted by Boeing, Airbus, and commercial airlines have demonstrated that 100% SAF can be used without engine modifications, showcasing its potential for full replacement of fossil-based jet fuel in the future [22]. However, full regulatory approval for commercial 100% SAF use is still under review, requiring further studies on long-term engine performance, emissions impact, and fuel supply scalability.

Higher blending ratios have been shown to improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions. Studies indicate that increasing the proportion of sustainable fuel in the blend leads to lower particulate matter and sulfur oxide emissions, primarily due to the absence of aromatics and sulfur compounds in alternative fuel sources [22]. This reduction in particulate emissions also decreases the formation of contrails, which contribute to radiative forcing and climate impact. Research has demonstrated that using 100% alternative fuel can reduce ice crystal formation in contrails by up to 50%, significantly mitigating its environmental effects [22].

Despite these benefits, challenges remain in achieving higher blending percentages beyond current regulatory limits. Studies suggest that blends exceeding 50% may require modifications to fuel systems, seals, and combustion dynamics, necessitating further research and certification efforts before widespread adoption [22]. Additionally, fuel composition variability across different production pathways may impact overall engine performance and material compatibility [22].

4.2 Lifecycle Carbon Footprint and Sustainability Metrics

Assessing the environmental impact of sustainable fuels requires a comprehensive life cycle analysis (LCA), often referred to as a “well-to-wake” assessment. This evaluation considers all stages of the fuel’s production and use, including feedstock cultivation, refining, distribution, and combustion in aircraft engines [23]. LCA studies suggest that well-established production pathways, such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50–80% compared to conventional fossil fuels [23]. However, the actual carbon savings depend heavily on the type of feedstock used. For instance, HEFA fuels derived from used cooking oil (UCO) or animal fats result in higher emission reductions than those sourced from palm or soybean oil, which have greater land-use change impacts [24].

Beyond carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, the impact of sustainable fuel on non-CO₂ emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and water vapor emissions, is a crucial consideration. Research indicates that using sustainable aviation fuel reduces soot particle emissions, leading to fewer contrail ice crystals and a lower overall climate-warming effect [22]. Since contrails contribute significantly to aviation-induced climate change, reducing their formation is a major advantage of shifting to higher blending ratios [23].

However, the effectiveness of different production pathways varies. While PtL fuels can theoretically achieve near-zero lifecycle emissions when produced using renewable electricity and carbon capture, their actual impact depends on the energy source for electrolysis and CO₂ sourcing method. If 100% renewable electricity (e.g., wind, solar, or hydropower) is used, and CO₂ is sourced from direct air capture (DAC) or biogenic emissions, PtL fuels can approach full carbon neutrality. In contrast, if the electrolysis process is powered by fossil-fuel-based electricity, the overall emissions can be significantly higher, reducing the climate benefits of PtL fuels [25]. Similarly, the ATJ pathway exhibits a wide range of carbon reduction potential (60–85%), largely dependent on the feedstock source. ATJ fuels derived from sugarcane-based ethanol tend to have lower emissions, whereas corn-based ethanol—which requires higher land and energy inputs—results in higher associated emissions [26]. To provide a comparative overview, Table 2 summarizes the lifecycle carbon footprint reductions of different SAF pathways, highlighting their potential GHG savings under optimal conditions.

5. Scaling Challenges and Economic Concerns

The scalability of SAF production is significantly constrained by the availability and sustainability of suitable feedstocks. Current primary feedstocks, such as waste oils and fats, are limited in supply and face competition from other industries, leading to potential supply chain bottlenecks. For instance, the finite availability of used cooking oil and animal fats restricts the volume of SAF that can be produced through the HEFA pathway. Additionally, the cultivation of energy crops raises concerns regarding land use, water consumption, and potential impacts on food security, necessitating careful consideration to avoid adverse environmental and social effects [27]. To mitigate these challenges, research is focusing on alternative feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and algae, which offer greater abundance and sustainability. However, the development of efficient and cost-effective technologies to convert these feedstocks into SAF remains a significant hurdle. Advancements in biochemical and thermochemical conversion processes are essential to unlock the potential of these alternative feedstocks and enable large-scale SAF production [28].

SAF’s economic viability is another critical factor influencing its adoption in the aviation industry. Currently, SAF production costs are substantially higher than those of conventional jet fuel, primarily due to the high costs associated with feedstock procurement, processing technologies, and the scale of production facilities. Estimates suggest that SAF can be two to three times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, posing a significant barrier to widespread adoption [29]. Economies of scale play a pivotal role in reducing production costs. As production volumes increase, unit costs are expected to decrease, making SAF more competitive with conventional fuels. Policy interventions, such as subsidies, tax incentives, and carbon pricing mechanisms, are also crucial in bridging the cost gap and encouraging investment in SAF production infrastructure. For example, government initiatives that provide financial support for SAF producers can enhance economic feasibility and stimulate market growth.

The existing fuel infrastructure is predominantly designed for fossil-based jet fuels, presenting challenges for the integration of SAF. Modifications to transportation, storage, and refueling systems may be necessary to accommodate SAF’s unique properties and ensure compatibility with current aviation operations. Additionally, the geographic distribution of SAF production facilities relative to major airports can impact logistics and supply chain efficiency. Establishing a robust distribution network is essential to facilitate the widespread adoption of SAF [27]. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders, including fuel producers, airlines, airport operators, and policymakers, are vital to address these infrastructure challenges. Developing standardized protocols and investing in infrastructure upgrades can streamline SAF integration into the existing fuel supply chain, thereby supporting the scaling of SAF utilization in the aviation sector [28]. Additionally, policy and regulatory frameworks can significantly influence the development and deployment of SAF. Supportive policies, such as blending mandates, tax credits, and research funding, can create a favorable environment for SAF advancement. For instance, the European Union has implemented the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which sets a minimum supply mandate for SAF in Europe, starting with 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050 [31]. However, policy uncertainty and inconsistent regulations across different regions can pose challenges for investors and producers. Coordinating policies and establishing long-term regulatory commitments are essential to providing the stability needed for substantial investments in SAF production capacity [32].

6. Future Works

Advancing SAF necessitates addressing current limitations in catalyst efficiency, feedstock sustainability, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Enhancing catalyst performance is pivotal for improving SAF production efficiency. Emerging materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and single-atom catalysts, have shown promise in increasing reaction rates and selectivity in processes like FT synthesis and ATJ conversion. For instance, MOFs with tailored pore structures facilitate better access to active sites, thereby improving hydrocarbon yield. However, challenges related to catalyst stability and scalability under industrial conditions persist. Current research focuses on doping strategies and support modifications to enhance catalyst durability and performance [33].

In bioengineering, genetically modified microorganisms are being developed to optimize metabolic pathways for higher lipid production, serving as efficient feedstocks for SAF. For example, engineered strains of Yarrowia lipolytica have demonstrated increased lipid accumulation through the overexpression of specific genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Despite these advancements, issues such as genetic stability and process scalability remain. Ongoing studies aim to refine genetic constructs and fermentation conditions to achieve consistent, high-yield lipid production suitable for industrial applications [34].

Optimizing the entire SAF production process is crucial for economic viability and environmental impact reduction. Integrating advanced pretreatment methods, such as steam explosion and torrefaction, can enhance biomass reactivity, leading to higher conversion efficiencies. Additionally, process intensification techniques, including the use of reactive distillation and membrane reactors, are being explored to streamline production steps and reduce energy consumption. However, challenges in process integration and control need to be addressed to fully realize these benefits [35].

Diversifying feedstock sources is essential to ensure a sustainable and resilient supply chain for SAF production. Non-edible oilseed crops, such as camelina and carinata, are gaining attention due to their low agricultural input requirements and compatibility with existing farming practices. For instance, field trials of camelina have shown its potential as a rotation crop, providing both economic and soil health benefits. Nevertheless, considerations regarding land use change and indirect environmental impacts must be carefully managed. Research is ongoing to assess the lifecycle emissions of these feedstocks and develop best practices for their cultivation and harvesting [36].

Lastly, securing adequate funding is critical to supporting the research, development, and commercialization of SAF technologies. Government grants, private investments, and public-private partnerships play vital roles in financing these initiatives. Policy instruments, such as tax incentives and carbon pricing, can further stimulate investment by improving the economic competitiveness of SAFs. For instance, the implementation of a carbon offset and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA) aims to incentivize the adoption of lower-carbon fuels. Nonetheless, uncertainties in policy frameworks and market dynamics pose risks to sustained funding. Continuous engagement with policymakers and stakeholders is necessary to develop stable and supportive financial mechanisms [37].

7. Conclusion

SAFs provide a promising pathway for reducing aviation-related carbon emissions while maintaining compatibility with existing fuel infrastructure. This review explored key SAF feedstocks, including algae, waste biomass, and PtL fuels, as well as major conversion pathways such as HEFA, ATJ, and FT synthesis. While SAF technologies have demonstrated viability, challenges related to feedstock availability, production scalability, and economic feasibility persist. Advancements in catalyst optimization, process integration, and emerging electrochemical approaches offer potential solutions to improve fuel yield and reduce costs. Additionally, policy frameworks and financial incentives will play important roles in accelerating SAF adoption. Continued research into novel feedstocks, improved conversion processes, and infrastructure development is necessary to support the widespread implementation of SAFs as a long-term solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry.

It is now laying the groundwork in leading the production and usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with its agricultural waste feedstock, which is expected to meet the country's jet fuel demand and capacity to export.

During the recent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Forum, the Philippine Department of Transportation (DOTr) partnered with major global aerospace company, Boeing to drive SAF adoption through collaboration with aviation stakeholders.

According to the DOTr, the country has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to meet all national jet fuel consumption needs with even potential for exports.

“The success of the SAF Forum underscores our commitment to a sustainable aviation sector,” DOTr officials said. “By fostering innovation and partnerships, we are paving the way for the Philippines to become a leader in SAF production and usage.”

Beyond environmental benefits, the SAF initiative is expected to generate jobs, strengthen the local supply chain, and build expertise in sustainable fuel production.

The forum pushed to fast-track aviation’s carbon footprint reduction through SAF, which is a key lever to decarbonising aviation. SAF has the potential to lower emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to industry experts.

SAF adoption in ASEAN

Southeast Asia’s feedstocks can supply approximately 12% of global SAF demand to meet the commercial aviation industry’s net-zero goal by 2050, according to a report by Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) and supported by Boeing.

The study showed that the Philippines and its ASEAN neighbours Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia’s total feedstock availability accounts for about 90% of the region’s SAF supply capacity.

Meanwhile, the Association of Asia-Pacific Airlines (AAPA) targets using 5% SAF blend by 2030.

Launched at the forum was the Island Skies Alliance (ISA), consisting of SAF and NbS (Nature-based Solutions) stakeholders such as the Air Carriers Association of the Philippines (ACAP). Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific Air and AsiaAir are ACAP members.

ISA has set the goal of 1% blend by 2030 for Philippine operations.

However, scaling up SAF production comes with challenges. Aviation expert and SAF investor Tina DiCicco cautioned that higher ticket prices are inevitable.

“Singapore, for instance, is the first country to impose a sustainable fuel levy beginning 2026. This can add between $1 to $16 to a flight ticket,” she said.

Singapore also plans to mandate the use of SAF on all departing flights from 2026, starting with a 1% SAF target. It hopes to increase this target to 3-5% by 2030.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/MC-Asia/uploadedImages/Articles/News/Association_Meetings/fuel-250328.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-03-28 06:56:25.658747

Building on the initial summer launches, flights from Melbourne to Doha’s Hamad International Airport will begin in December 2025. As part of the wet-lease agreement, Qatar Airways will supply aircraft and crew for the flights, which will open up more up more than 100 connecting routes for Australian passengers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Additionally, they are expected to provide a significant boost to the Australian visitor and tourism economy, generating an estimated AUD$3 billion over the next five years.

Significantly, Qatar Airways will provide secondment opportunities for 20 Virgin Australia pilots and 40 cabin crew in 2025, boosting job growth in the sector. Another important area of focus for the partnership is sustainability, including the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel initiatives.

Advancing sustainable fuel

In October 2024, Qatar Airways and Virgin Australia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on a range of sustainability initiatives, including aims to advance the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), environmental management including waste and energy management, sustainable procurement, and aviation workforce development.

The flight announcements follow the Australian Government’s approval of Qatar Airways Group’s 25 per cent investment in Virgin Australia on 27 February 2025, joining existing majority shareholder Bain Capital.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Officer, Engr. Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said: “Today’s announcement by the ACCC sends a clear signal of the appetite that exists for delivering competition, world-class service and value to Australian passengers.”

Virgin Australia Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dave Emerson said: “Already, we are seeing some of the positive benefits of the partnership, including increased sale activity on airfares between Australia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa thanks to increased competition.”

The EU's push to expand the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has sparked strong backlash from the aviation industry.

On March 27, 17 major European airlines issued a joint statement, arguing that the limited availability and high cost of green fuels are placing a heavy burden on the industry's decarbonization efforts. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) also openly stated that the EU’s SAF targets are simply unattainable.

SAF shortages hinder aviation's path to decarbonization

The 17 airlines, including Ryanair, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, and the International Airlines Group (IAG), which owns British Airways, have historically been recognized for their sustainability efforts. However, their sudden and vocal criticism of EU policies has drawn significant public attention.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative, flights departing from EU airports must blend a certain percentage of SAF into their fuel supply. The target for 2024 is set at 2%, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. However, SAF currently costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel and accounts for just 0.3% of global aviation fuel supply, posing a major challenge to the industry's decarbonization goals.

The joint statement cited a recent report from Steer Economics, which highlighted the financial burden on members of Airlines for Europe (A4E), the region’s largest airline association. Compliance with regulations has driven costs up by 200% over the past decade, reaching a total of €15 billion (about $16.1 billion USD) by 2024—an amount sufficient to purchase 300 new fuel-efficient aircraft.

European airlines are now calling on the EU to ramp up SAF production or relax regulatory measures to prevent them from falling behind global competitors. IATA Director General Willie Walsh warned, ""We can't just stand back and pretend that these targets are meaningful and can be achieved. They were never going to be capable of being achieved.""

Despite their criticism, airlines reaffirmed their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, the European Commission remains firm on its SAF targets. EU Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas stated that discussions with airline executives will be arranged to better understand their concerns.

SAF and other regulations have increased environmental costs for airlines. (Image: Unsplash)

SAF production plans slashed by 50% as costs rise

After U.S. President Donald Trump significantly scaled back climate action, calls from European businesses for the EU to ease sustainability obligations have been growing. Stricter emissions regulations for the automotive industry have already been delayed, and the aviation sector is also hoping for a reprieve.

Besides, A new Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report has raised further concerns about SAF supply shortages. According to the report, under current industry trends, SAF production will be insufficient to meet airline decarbonization targets by 2030. Bio-based SAF (Bio-SAF) is expected to fall 30% short of demand, while synthetic SAF (e-SAF) will require a 45% increase in production to meet targets.

BCG surveyed 200 aviation suppliers with over 500 senior executives, finding that rising energy and operational costs have forced SAF production plans to be cut by 50 to 70%. Slow regulatory approvals and economic uncertainty have also led many companies in the SAF supply chain to adopt a wait-and-see approach.

The report suggests that in addition to regulatory mandates, carbon pricing could help bridge the price gap between fossil fuels and SAF. By creating financial incentives, carbon pricing could drive demand and encourage long-term investment in SAF production.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1743138894175956961.png,N,,2025-03-28 04:56:13.269505

How does the market and environment for renewable fuels today compare with when you started?
When we talk about the low carbon fuel standards, it basically means that they are trying to decarbonize their economies, and the low carbon fuel standard is focused on transportation.
Their neighbors to the north in Oregon and Washington have implemented similar programs with the low carbon fuel standards.
New York City also just implemented renewable diesel in their ferry fleet, so those famous Staten Island ferries are now using renewable diesel.","By Dusty Sonnenberg, CCA, Field Leader, a project of the Ohio Soybean Council and Soybean Check-off

Clean Fuels Alliance America (Clean Fuels), previously known as the National Biodiesel Board, is the national trade association representing the biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel industries. The organization is based in Jefferson City, Mo., and is partly a soybean check-off funded initiative. Clean Fuels works to create sustainable industry growth through education, communication, governmental affairs, and technical and quality assurance programs. Clean Fuels works as the coordinating body for research and development in the United States, comprised of state, national and international feedstock and feedstock processor organizations, fuel suppliers, fuel marketers, distributors and technology providers.

Tom Verry serves as Director of Outreach and Development for the organization. The Ohio Field Leader (OFL) had the opportunity to catch-up with Verry during Commodity Classic and get an update on some of the positive momentum that Clean Fuels is experiencing currently.

OFL – You have been in this industry for nearly three decades. There has been a lot of excitement and serious discussions regarding the growing demand for renewable fuels in the past few years. How does the market and environment for renewable fuels today compare with when you started?

Verry – The exciting part or the supply/demand equation in our industry right now is on the demand side. I’ve been around for 30 years, and I have never seen the opportunity look so good for biodiesel as I do today. We are seeing new industries looking to use biodiesel to help decarbonize their supply chain.

OFL – Are there any specific companies or examples that show promise?

Verry – Ohio is a great example. Madison Corby with the Ohio Soybean Council is working with our petroleum team on some Great Lakes shipping companies to get biodiesel in their Great Lakes fleet of ships. We are also working with the class one railroads like Norfolk Southern. They have all committed to decarbonization goals and they see biodiesel as the fuel they want to use to reach those carbon goals. They want to get to 20% biodiesel blends in a relatively short period of time. They are looking at a time frame of five to six years from now, and the reality is that they just started at 3%.

Another example is the home heating oil market in the Northeast. We see train loads of biodiesel leave the Midwest head to the Northeast to supply them with bioheat. There is a lot of pressure to decarbonize their home heat industry. Their options are petroleum heating oil, (which is very common), or switching to air source heat pumps. If a home does not have a heat pump, retrofitting the heating system can cost anywhere from $25,000-$30,000. On the other hand, if they switch from petroleum heating oil to using biodiesel, then they just change the fuel type and do not need to replace the entire heating system.

OFL – You mentioned carbon goals. Low carbon seems to be a buzz phrase. How does the idea of low carbon apply to the fuel industry and increasing demand?

Verry – In the industry we talk a lot about the low carbon fuel standards. Currently the low carbon demand is more of a west coast market. With that said, it is currently about half of our demand, and California has led that.

When we talk about the low carbon fuel standards, it basically means that they are trying to decarbonize their economies, and the low carbon fuel standard is focused on transportation. We have seen California as the leader. Currently they are at 75% biodiesel and renewable diesel. That is 75% of the diesel market, and California is the #2 diesel market in the country behind Texas. Their neighbors to the north in Oregon and Washington have implemented similar programs with the low carbon fuel standards. Oregon is at 40% of the diesel pool and Washington is at about 20% use. The newest entry is New Mexico. It is one of the biggest big oil states in the country and they are going to start implementing low carbon fuel standards.

Everyone is looking at new and different technologies to meet the low carbon fuel standards. Often, they see electric vehicles (EV’s) playing a big role. They can do a great job in certain segments but in the heavy-duty truck and transportation industries, it is just not quite there yet. That really provides an opportunity for us. I don’t know if we are ever going to see an electric ore carrier or other shipping vessel on the Great Lakes. I do know that until they figure it out, I think there is a lot of opportunity for biodiesel.

OFL – How do farmers’ soybean check-off dollars help move the needle in the discussions with state governments as they look at decarbonization options?

Verry – Because of support from the check-off we can generate the data needed to have the discussions which are backed up by that data with the states considering their low carbon initiatives. With that data, we can make a convincing case that biodiesel and renewable diesel can play an important role in reaching their goals.

New York City is an exciting example. New York City mapped out a decarbonization strategy 20 years ago. What they plan to do is electrify what vehicles they can, and then with what they can’t, they are going to put biodiesel and renewable diesel in. That is where they are today. They have 12,000 diesel vehicles. It is the largest municipal fleet in the country, and it is running on 100% renewable diesel and biodiesel blends. That includes their fire department (FDNY) and also the police department (NYPD) and the sanitation departments. They are all running on blends of biodiesel and renewable diesel.

New York City also just implemented renewable diesel in their ferry fleet, so those famous Staten Island ferries are now using renewable diesel. In the near future they want to convert to using bioheat in all their school buildings.",https://ocj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Clean-Fuel.png,N,,2025-03-28 07:56:42.148357

The pre-feasibility study will explore the application of Licella's advanced manufacturing technology to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues.
This bio-intermediate will then be refined into SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel, establishing a domestic supply chain based on local production and consumption.","To revolutionize sustainable fuel production in Japan, Marubeni Corporation, Japan Airlines (JAL), Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Chugoku Lumber Co., Ltd., Boeing Japan KK, and Obayashi Corporation have announced a joint memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a pre-feasibility study of SAF. The focus of this study is the commercialization of SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel derived from domestic forest residues.

This initiative addresses the growing urgency to reduce carbon dioxide emissions within the aviation and chemical industries. Japan, possessing abundant forest resources, is poised to leverage thinning materials and wood processing residues as sustainable raw materials. The increasing adoption of wood in large-scale construction further amplifies the potential for utilizing these residues.

The aviation industry, grappling with the imperative to decarbonize, views SAF as a critical solution. However, a stable domestic supply chain, encompassing raw material sourcing, production, and utilization, is essential to meet the anticipated surge in SAF demand from 2030 onwards. Similarly, the chemical industry is actively pursuing greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies, transitioning to sustainable feedstocks like biochemical products from biomass and chemically recycled plastics to achieve carbon neutrality and a circular economy.

The pre-feasibility study will explore the application of Licella's advanced manufacturing technology to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues. This bio-intermediate will then be refined into SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel, establishing a domestic supply chain based on local production and consumption. The study will meticulously assess the economic viability of this business model, including raw material supply and processing systems, manufacturing processes, product logistics, and CO2 emission reduction effectiveness.

The consortium aims to complete the pre-feasibility study by December 2025. The ultimate goal is to achieve commercialization around 2030, contingent on the study's progress. This ambitious project signifies a significant step towards a sustainable future for both the aviation and chemical industries in Japan.

The collaboration brings together the expertise of diverse industry leaders: Marubeni's global trading and project development capabilities, JAL's aviation operational experience, Mitsubishi Chemical's chemical manufacturing prowess, Chugoku Lumber's forestry and wood processing expertise, Boeing's aviation technology leadership, and Obayashi's construction and sustainable infrastructure development expertise.

This initiative underscores Japan's commitment to developing innovative and sustainable solutions that contribute to global efforts in combating climate change. By harnessing domestic forest resources and leveraging advanced technologies, the consortium aims to establish a robust and sustainable fuel supply chain, paving the way for a greener future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-28 04:56:18.188501

The need for feedstock diversity

Many SAF projects struggle with feedstocks that are too expensive, too scarce, or both.

Today SAF is overwhelmingly produced using the hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which converts waste fats, oils and greases from sources like used cooking oil and animal fats. (Some synthetic jet fuel is also produced via the HEFA process using crop-based feeds like canola and soybean oil, but because such feeds...

In January 2024, the company announced a partnership with Trinity College Dublin to establish the Trinity College Dublin SAF Research Facility at SMBC Aviation Capital’s new headquarters in Dublin.

In addition to research collaborations, SMBC Aviation Capital launched a sector-leading sustainability solution for airlines in September 2022. The company invested $53.3 million in high-quality carbon credit programs aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. This initiative provides airline customers with access to carbon credits as part of lease agreements or independently, supporting their net-zero ambitions by 2050. The carbon credits are derived from energy-efficient cookstove projects in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, contributing to both environmental and social benefits.

How the Airbus “Book and Claim” Model Works

Under this system, buyers can purchase SAF credits, securing the environmental benefits of using the fuel without needing to physically transport it to their location. Instead, the SAF is consumed elsewhere, while buyers receive certification of their contribution to emission reductions. This allows for a more flexible and efficient distribution of SAF, ensuring broader market access.

To implement the system, Airbus will procure SAF certificates and oversee their management through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a globally recognized sustainability certification entity. These certificates will then be resold to interested aviation customers, including aircraft and helicopter operators, stimulating demand and ensuring verified sustainability benefits.

The pilot program, set to run through 2025, aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the “Book and Claim” framework. Airbus will assess the market response, the reliability of this approach, and the potential role of third-party facilitation in expanding SAF availability. This initiative is expected to generate valuable insights that will help shape future SAF integration strategies across the aviation industry.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Gets a Boost, But Uncertainty Remains

The U.S. sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry gained momentum as the Department of Energy approved $782 million in funding for Montana Renewables, significantly expanding production capacity. This, alongside Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 project, marks a $3 billion investment push to scale SAF production and cut aviation emissions. However, uncertainty surrounding key tax credits and policy shifts threatens the sector’s long-term viability.

While the U.S. faces regulatory and economic hurdles, Europe leads with ambitious mandates, reinforcing SAF demand through policy-backed incentives. Meanwhile, ICAO’s new financing initiative aims to attract investors, but Washington’s shifting stance raises concerns. With SAF positioned as aviation’s best decarbonization tool, stable policies and long-term investments are crucial for scaling production.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pm_38_651_651236-dc89xqlhwf-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 21:56:31.161092

This self-imposed deadline may not be met.

One of the largest sticking points in House and Senate negotiations is the House-passed plan to identify $880 billion in spending cuts through FY 2034 in programs overseen by the Energy and Commerce Committee. This feat would likely require substantial reforms or cuts to entitlements like Medicaid. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R–S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, called the House's plan ""woefully inadequate.""

A source of wasteful spending that lawmakers could target is energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Passed in 2022, the IRA supercharged subsidies and tax credits for all types of energy technologies, including renewables, sustainable aviation fuel, nuclear power, and electric vehicles. The bill also gave oil and gas companies access to $500 billion in new tax credits, according to the tax firm Baker Tilly. So far, the IRA's subsidies have largely benefited wealthy households and large corporations.

The Congressional Budget Office initially projected the IRA to cost $370 billion over 10 years, but the price of the bill's energy and climate provisions has steadily climbed since. A recent report by Travis Fisher and Joshua Loucks of the Cato Institute estimates that the IRA's tax credits and subsidies will cost taxpayers $936 billion to $1.97 trillion in 10 years and between $2.04 trillion and $4.67 trillion by 2050. Tax returns already signal a higher bill than anticipated. Tax credits for residential clean energy and energy efficiency, which were originally estimated to cost $459 million in 2023, ended up costing $8.4 billion that year.

One of the most expensive provisions of the bill is its clean electricity investment and production tax credits, which have no set expiration date and will sunset when a 25 percent reduction (compared to 2022 levels) in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity sector is achieved. As the report points out, growing power demand and the Trump administration's rollback of regulations will slow down or even stall decarbonization of the grid, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay for these credits indefinitely. Cato says these two credits will ""likely cost taxpayers between $70 billion and $180 billion per year in the years just before the GHG target is met.""

Costs aside, the IRA, which has been heralded as the largest climate bill in history, does a poor job of reducing GHG emissions. Cato estimates that the bill's provisions will reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at a cost of $224 to $535 per ton. Tree planting and natural regeneration, meanwhile, can reduce CO2 emissions at a price of $23 per ton.

Despite the bill's ballooning costs and inefficient GHG reductions, a repeal of IRA spending, which would require full Republican support, is unlikely. Recently, 21 House Republicans signed a letter in support of keeping the bill's tax credits.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/03/3-27-25-v1-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 17:56:48.678674

Hexagon has sponsored this post.

As global markets trend towards sustainable, net-zero economies, aviation finds itself at a crossroads. For decades, airplane geometries have converged. They all contain a large, pressurized tube; massive, petrol-filled wings and a half-dozen-or-so jet — maybe propeller — engines. Interiors have new creature comforts, space saving methodologies and lighter materials, but for generations development has stagnated. Aziz Tahiri, vice president of Global Industries Aerospace & Defense at Hexagon, argues that for the industry to align with sustainability trends, everything must change.

“You have to review everything in an aircraft to be sustainable,” says Tahiri. “Almost everything was designed 40 years ago. You need to reconsider all these systems. This is hard because of the economics and financial systems attached to it. You need to almost reinvent everything, and new product introduction costs a lot of money.”

The obvious first step is to change aircraft power systems. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid and electric systems, green hydrogen fuel cell systems are leading candidates, but which should be selected and how will this selection affect aircraft geometry? Designing, testing and manufacturing the prototypes to answer these questions — while maintaining best practices — will get expensive and time consuming.

“We need to rethink the aircraft without spending ten years to design a new aircraft,” explains Tahiri. “To spend $12 billion to design an aircraft; you need to produce thousands over ten years to break even. We need to reduce the design cycle time to test new materials, fuel and designs to get a new aircraft in six years and maybe $6 billion.”

So, what technologies will make the aircraft industry sustainable: new fuels, batteries, fuel cells? One, or a combination, will inevitably come out on top. But it will be new technologies for high fidelity 3D simulation, traceability and advanced manufacturing that get us there.

How high fidelity 3Dsimulation can make flying green

Simulation technology is by no means new to the aerospace industry. For decades it has been used to validate the structural integrity of components, aerodynamics strategies, test new materials and assess propulsion strategies. What has changed is its accuracy and time to results; this should change how it’s used.

“Yesterday you could not avoid prototyping several times — even up to 3-6 prototypes — and the engineering teams were using simulation to test and validate them more extensively. Today with efficient large model processing, it’s much easier to iterate with an accurate 3D or system model in the virtual world. So maybe you only need to prototype once to find out if what you make works as designed,” says Tahiri. “That is what we do at Hexagon. We have simulations so close to reality and physical testing we can avoid multiple physical tests and iterations.”

The idea is to reduce design cycle times by replacing the use of physical prototypes with digital alternatives and using them extensively earlier in the design phase. This saves a lot of money and time, as building prototypes as large and complex as an aircraft isn’t easy.

Tahiri explains that this iterative process is becoming even faster thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The use of AI can significantly reduce the computational time needed to get results. Additionally, AI can be used to suggest iterations to a design, helping engineers zero-in on optimal geometries faster than before.

Using modern simulation and AI, Tahiri suggests engineers start testing:

Aircraft architectures like delta wings, blended wing bodies and adjustable wingtips.

Biomimicry to see how bird and insect flight might influence and optimize aerodynamics.

The performance of materials like composites, and components made via additive manufacturing.

Propulsion and storage strategies for hydrogen, batteries and fuel cells.

How 3D model traceability tools bring sustainability to aviation

Like simulation, traceability is not new to the aviation industry. Since aviation’s inception, documentation has helped design, certify and justify aircraft designs. What has changed is that traceability is no longer a manual endeavor — almost everything can be digitalized efficiently and accurately.

“You once had an army of inspectors to check everything is signed off and manufactured right,” said Tahiri. “Now we are using automated inspection capabilities with laser scanners that digitally send measurements to certification systems. These scanners can ensure traceability all along the product lifecycle. Instead of having a huge amount of paper for inspection reports, you now have a digital report that correlates to a 3D measurement cloud that can be meshed into a CAD model.”

The detailed 3D measurements add a critical “source of truth” to the digital twin and ensures all stakeholders collaborate on the same data throughout the product lifecycle. For instance, simulation experts can take the measurements from the manufacturing team to ensure a plane, as built, meets sustainability requirements. These geometries can also be used to help process development teams make the manufacturing processes more sustainable — by reducing scrap, for example.

How manufacturing must change to make aerospace sustainable

Since development teams can iterate on a design to reduce scrap, it stands to reason they can iterate on designs to ensure manufacturability — or better still, optimise it virtually before any CAPEX is committed. “Before you certify a new design, you need to make sure it is manufacturable,” Tahiri confirms. “This usually happens after the design of the aircraft. However, we can now simulate the manufacturing processes before a design is signed off and certified.”

This means that — well before any assembling, drilling or fastening — development teams can assess if a design can be manufactured ­and if said manufacturing process meets sustainability goals. “If you engineer something but you can’t manufacture it, or it takes re-engineering every time you do, the ROI is ten years instead of five and the engineering fails,” says Tahiri. “Well-engineered products can be manufactured, and the processes are optimized for quality, cost, sustainability and time to market.”",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_484970881-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-03-27 14:56:24.596823

UK GHG emissions fell by 4pc in 2024

London, 27 March (Argus) — The UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 4pc year-on-year in 2024, provisional data released by the government today show, driven principally by lower gas and coal use in the power and industry sectors. GHG emissions in the UK totalled 371mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) last year, the data show, representing a fall of 54pc compared with 1990 levels. The UK has legally-binding targets to cut its GHG emissions by 68pc by 2030 and 81pc by 2035 against 1990 levels, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The electricity sector posted the largest proportional year-on-year fall of 15pc, standing 82pc below 1990 levels at 37.5mn t CO2e. The decline was largely a result of record-high net imports and a 7pc increase in renewable output reducing the call on coal and gas-fired generation, as well as the closure of the country's last coal power plant in September , which together outweighed a marginal rise in overall electricity demand, the government said. Industry posted the next largest emissions decline of 9pc, falling to 48.3mn t CO2e, or 69pc below 1990 levels, as a result of lower coal use across sectors and the closure of iron and steel blast furnaces. Fuel supply emissions fell by 6pc to 28.4mn t CO2e, 63pc below where they stood in 1990. And emissions in the UK's highest-emitting sector, domestic transport, fell by 2pc to 110.1mn t CO2e, 15pc below 1990 levels, as road vehicle diesel use declined. Emissions in the remaining sectors, including agriculture, waste and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), edged down collectively by 1pc to 67.2mn t CO2e, some 50pc below 1990 levels. Only emissions from buildings and product uses increased on the year, rising by 2pc as gas use increased, but still standing 27pc below 1990 levels at 79.8mn t CO2e. UK-based international aviation emissions, which are not included in the overall UK GHG figures, rose by 9pc last year to reach pre-Covid 19 pandemic levels of 26.1mn t CO2e, the data show. But UK-based international shipping emissions edged down by 1pc to 6.2mn t CO2e. By Victoria Hatherick Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Trump unveils new tariffs on auto imports: Update

Adds details throughout Washington, 26 March (Argus) — President Donald Trump said today he would impose a 25pc tariff on foreign-made cars and trucks imported into the US, but said there will be no tariffs on automobiles assembled in the US. Trump said the new tariffs on imported automobiles marked the ""beginning of Liberation Day"", the term Trump has used to reference his plan to unveil sweeping tariffs on major foreign trade partners on 2 April. The White House estimates the tariff on imported cars and trucks will generate $100bn/yr in new tariff revenue. Trump said the auto tariff will go into effect on 2 April, providing a financial incentive for automakers to relocate manufacturing to the US. ""We'll effectively be charging a 25pc tariff, but if you build your car in the United States, there's no tariff,"" Trump said in remarks at the White House. ""And what that means is a lot of foreign car companies, a lot of companies, are going to be in great shape."" The auto tariffs will likely add thousands of dollars to the price of many imported cars and trucks. But the tariffs — the details of which have yet to be released — appears more targeted than Trump's initial plan to impose a 25pc tariff on nearly all imports from Canada and Mexico, because the tariffs would not apply to cars and trucks parts, so long as the vehicles are assembled in the US. ""Anybody that has plants in the United States it's going to be good for, in my opinion,"" Trump said. Ontario premier Doug Ford previously warned that Trump's plan to impose a nearly across-the-board import tariff could have caused auto manufacturing in the US and Canada to grind to a halt within as few as 10 days. Trump eventually delayed those tariffs until 2 April. Earlier this week, Trump said that South Korean automaker Hyundai's decision to invest $5.8bn to build a steel mill in Louisiana offered a blueprint for how companies could avoid tariffs. Trump has already imposed a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminum, and earlier this week said he would announce tariffs on imported lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Even as a lack of details about the upcoming tariffs has fueled uncertainty for businesses and sharp declines on US stock markets, Trump has continued to announce additional tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump said any country taking delivery of Venezuelan oil or gas would be ""forced"" to pay an incremental 25pc tariff on any goods imported in the US. US oil executives appear to be growing tired of Trump's chaotic trade policy, particularly his imposition of a 25pc tariff on imported steel that is used in drill pipes, executives said in a survey the US Federal Reserve of Dallas released Wednesday. The uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy is causing ""chaos"", they said in the survey, and increasing their cost of capital. ""Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn't have a clear goal,"" an unnamed oil executive said in the survey. ""We want more stability.""

Trump to impose new tariffs on auto imports

Washington, 26 March (Argus) — President Donald Trump will announce new tariffs on the automobile industry later today, the White House said, at a time of significant uncertainty about his trade policies. Trump plans to offer further details on the automobile tariffs this afternoon, less than a week before he plans to announce tariffs against major foreign trade partners on 2 April, which Trump has dubbed ""Liberation Day"". Trump has already imposed a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminum, and earlier this week said he would announce tariffs on imported lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Trump last month threatened to impose 25pc tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, starting on 4 March — including imported automobiles and vehicle parts — but he eventually offered a one-month reprieve for US automakers before delaying those tariffs entirely until 2 April. The scope and timing of the upcoming automobile tariffs remains unclear, and the White House has yet to provide further details. But Ontario premier Doug Ford previously warned that steep tariffs on Canada could cause auto manufacturing in the US and Canada to grind to a halt within as few as 10 days. Earlier this week, Trump said that South Korean automaker Hyundai's recent decision to invest $5.8bn to build a steel mill in Louisiana offered a blueprint for how companies could avoid tariffs.

UK eyes 80pc maritime emissions cuts by 2040

London, 26 March (Argus) — The UK is aiming to reduce fuel lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its domestic shipping by 30pc by 2030 and 80pc by 2040 compared with 2008 levels, reaching zero by 2050. The goals are ""intentionally ambitious"", the UK government said, and will be supported by both domestic and international policy measures as set out in its new maritime decarbonisation strategy. The first phase of the strategy ""will rely on existing IMO regulation"" to improve vessel efficiency this decade, the government said. The second phase will centre on larger vessels. One key policy in the strategy is pricing maritime emissions, which the government expects to do through a combination of pushing for the IMO to introduce a global shipping GHG levy from 2027, and the government's existing plan to extend the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) to domestic maritime emissions from next year. The government will ""work to understand how these schemes interact, and to avoid any double charging of emissions"", it said. It is still to consider the feedback to its recent consultation on technical elements of the sector's inclusion in the UK ETS, it added. The government also intends to regulate maritime fuel use, both by pushing for IMO-level standards this year on the GHG intensity of fuels, and implementing domestic UK fuel regulations on which it plans to consult in 2026. Calls for evidence were also published alongside the strategy on both potential requirements for zero or near-zero at-berth emissions, with a formal consultation on this planned next year, and on measures to support the decarbonisation of small vessels and targeted maritime sub-sectors. For the latter, the government expects to focus on vessels ""with a clear route to decarbonisation"". ""Measures for harder-to-decarbonise vessels may not be required until the mid-to-late 2030s,"" it said. Maritime emissions accounted for 8pc of the UK's transport emissions in 2022, despite having declined by 30pc compared with 1990 levels, government data show.

In a world shaped by poly-crises, the question we must ask ourselves is: How can the energy transition spark economic growth while addressing global challenges?

Investing in clean energy is investing in economic prosperity

Due to geopolitical tensions, economic shifts and lack of regulatory certainty the energy transition has reached a critical juncture. As a result, strategically important first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects face challenging business cases, leading to a slowdown in projects reaching final investment decision (FID). To move forward, we must recognize that the energy transition presents a significant opportunity to drive economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, technological innovation and energy security on a global scale.

The business case for clean energy investment

The solutions to decarbonize and improve efficiencies in energy-intensive industries – —such as steel, cement and long-distance transportation – —are available and scalable today. However, large-scale deployment requires new business and partnership models as well as financing mechanisms, and bringing pioneers together to form new, forward-thinking coalitions. It also requires de-risking technologies and projects through pilots and ongoing testing.

If we succeed with that, the energy transition can help boost economic growth:

Creating jobs at scale: Clean energy projects can generate millions of jobs worldwide. According to the Hydrogen Council, the global hydrogen economy alone is expected to create 20-25 million jobs by 20501.

Attracting investments and strengthening local economies: According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), clean energy projects attract foreign capital, improve tax revenue and diversify economies. Fossil-fuel producers are leveraging renewable hydrogen production to transform their energy sector, creating export opportunities and enhancing economic and energy resilience. Montana Renewables is a successful example of how you can revamp a retired fossil fuel unit to a renewable one, maintaining jobs, while creating additional revenues for local farmers.

Transforming industries through innovation: Innovation in clean energy strengthens global competitiveness. For instance, Topsoe’s involvement in Project SkyPower is accelerating e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production in Europe – opening new export opportunities for innovative technologies.Similarly, our collaboration with Vestas and Skovgaard Energy to launch the first-ever green ammonia plant in Ramme, Northwest Jutland, Denmark, showcases how renewable energy can be directly integrated into ammonia production. This approach accounts for fluctuations in power generation, thus offering a cost-effective solution for producing green ammonia.

Maintaining global competitiveness: Regions that fail to invest in clean energy risk losing entire industries to those that move faster in scaling up technologies. Industrial competitiveness depends on securing cost-effective, local and sustainable energy sources. Alternative energy solutions, such as green hydrogen, often come at a higher price, which can deter investors focused on short-term returns. However, the premium cost can also be viewed as an insurance against future price volatility, energy supply risks and industrial decline. Just as companies assess geopolitical risks in their financial models, clean energy investments can be viewed as a safeguard for long-term stability and competitiveness.

New export opportunities: Renewable fuel production enables lower-income countries to shift from exporting raw materials to exporting high-value energy products, fostering industrial development and improving economic conditions. For example, biofuels derived from agricultural waste or residues can create new revenue streams for farming communities while positioning these countries as suppliers of sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, nations with abundant renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind, can leverage green hydrogen and its derivatives as key export commodities - helping to build global clean energy trade while driving local economic growth. In India, for example, Topsoe is partnering with Hygenco to develop a green ammonia plant in Odisha, utilizing its dynamic ammonia technology to convert green hydrogen into ammonia – and enabling the country to export high-value sustainable energy.

Topsoe’s role in boosting economic growth

At Topsoe, we believe that helping energy-intensive industries to decarbonize and become more efficient is central to building a resilient global economy. Our scalable solutions, such as advanced ammonia synthesis technologies and Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell technology for green hydrogen production, empower countries to leverage their renewable resources for localized production. This approach enhances energy resilience, creates new revenue streams, and supports industrial development.

A case on sustainable aviation fuel production: Project SkyPower

Topsoe is part of this CEO led initiative to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF). This project will help position Europe as a leader in clean aviation fuel technology and could secure millions of jobs within the aviation industry. They estimate that e-SAF could unlock a EUR 350+ billion global market opportunity and save 400 million tonnes of CO2e annually by 2050, while increasing the EU’s energy resilience.

Beyond its direct impact, e-SAF drives advancements in carbon capture and power-to-X technologies, creating spillover benefits that strengthen Europe’s global competitiveness.

Looking ahead

Through BR Aviation, Vibra has advanced talks with different commercial- and executive-aviation companies for supply, reinforcing its commitments to the energy transition and meeting the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.
The blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel will initially be in the proportion of 10 percent SAF and 90 percent fossil fuel, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions on flights fueled by Vibra with this fuel.
“Vibra has established itself as a pioneer by bringing SAF to Brazil, a product that represents the future of aviation fuel and is aligned with the need for decarbonization in the aviation sector,” Bragança said.
“With a 60 percent market share in the aviation market, we are leaders not only in the sale of fuels but also in the provision of solutions, innovation and sustainability.","Vibra, the largest fuel distributor and one of the largest energy companies in Brazil, announced March 25 that it is taking another important step towards decarbonizing the aviation sector, announcing the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the country.

The imported biofuel is now available at the base located at Tom Jobim airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro, which recently received certification from the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System GmbH, which guarantees the sustainability tracking of the entire product supply chain—from raw material through production in the biorefinery, to distribution via the base at Tom Jobim airport (Galeão Base), through BR Aviation, Vibra’s business unit for aircraft-refueling services.

With this initiative, Vibra said it not only consolidates itself as the first company in Brazil to import SAF on a commercial scale but also as a pioneer in making the product available for sale in the domestic market.

Through BR Aviation, Vibra has advanced talks with different commercial- and executive-aviation companies for supply, reinforcing its commitments to the energy transition and meeting the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

“Being the first company to bring SAF to Brazil on a commercial scale and make this product available to our customers in the domestic market fills us with pride and reinforces our commitment to decarbonization,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s executive vice president of operations. “We will continue to make efforts to make the Brazilian energy matrix increasingly stronger and more competitive, serving our customers with the fuel they need.”

SAF is produced from renewable sources and reduces greenhouse-gas emissions by approximately 80 percent compared to conventional aviation fuel, contributing to the construction of a cleaner and more sustainable future.

The product made available by Vibra was produced from used cooking oil (UCO), one of the raw materials with the lowest carbon intensity, since it is a residue.

The entire process, from the search for a supplier, import, certifications, to the blending of SAF with fossil-based aviation fuel at Vibra’s base in Galeão took 10 months of planning and execution, starting right after the first book and claim in Latin America was operationalized, also made possible by Vibra in partnership with Gol in June 2024.

This January, 23 isotanks (tank containers) with approximately 550,000 liters (145,295 gallons) of SAF departed from the port of Antwerp, Belgium, bound for Rio de Janeiro, marking what Vibra said is the beginning of a new era for the sustainable fuels market in Brazil.

The blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel will initially be in the proportion of 10 percent SAF and 90 percent fossil fuel, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions on flights fueled by Vibra with this fuel.

Vibra said its pioneering work breaks down important barriers and demonstrates the feasibility of adopting SAF in Brazilian aviation, also providing the development of Vibra’s expertise with the blend and later allowing higher percentages to be added to conventional aviation fuel, up to the limit of 50 percent, as currently permitted by international standards.

Vibra said it is prepared to serve all customers interested in purchasing the product, which is already available for sale, and support the decarbonization of their operations.

“Vibra has established itself as a pioneer by bringing SAF to Brazil, a product that represents the future of aviation fuel and is aligned with the need for decarbonization in the aviation sector,” Bragança said. “With a 60 percent market share in the aviation market, we are leaders not only in the sale of fuels but also in the provision of solutions, innovation and sustainability. As leaders, we are prepared to expand the supply of SAF in the Brazilian market, using our infrastructure in more than 90 airports and our expertise to deliver safe and competitive solutions.”

The sustainability of the operation, from raw materials to aircraft refueling at Galeão, was also possible thanks to obtaining ISCC certification for Vibra’s bases in Cubatão and Galeão.

This certification ensures the traceability and sustainability of the biofuels sold by Vibra, opening doors for the company to operate in new markets, both in import and export, based on very strict environmental standards.

Vibra said it has invested significantly in renewable energy, directing more than USD$1.2 billion to this segment.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_4107fbc4e11b41d7a9115916201189b4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_525,h_311,al_c,lg_1,q_80/80995f_4107fbc4e11b41d7a9115916201189b4~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-03-27 16:57:12.676762

Airlines and airports globally invest just 1-3% of their revenues or capex on SAF, per the report cited by Reuters.

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG’s findings.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel, and we see that trend very clearly, there is a slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” said BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada, who co-authored the report.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, Director General at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.

IATA said at the end of 2024 that growth in SAF volumes is “disappointingly slow.”

Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tons, double the 500,000 tons produced in 2023. However, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel, according to IATA’s latest estimates.

“Investors in new generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle,” IATA’s Walsh said.

To reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, IATA analysis shows that between 3,000 and more than 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be needed.

The annual average capex needed to build the new facilities over the 30-year period is about $128 billion per year, in a best-case scenario, according to IATA.

Transferring energy Heat pumps (HPs) are critical for achieving net zero targets.
According to the IEA, HPs can potentially remove at least 500 million tons of global carbon dioxide emissions in 203022.
This is primarily due to the significant energy efficiency gains that can be achieved through electrification of economic activities.","Time is of the essence – 2014 to 2023 was estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record at around 1.2°C above the average between 1850 and 19001. Last year was the hottest recorded and the first where surface temperatures exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels2, but last year was also a different age.

If 2024 was the year of democracy as billions of people around the world cast their ballot, then 2025 – and beyond – is where we see seismic shifts in policies from new administrations, as well as the implications that cascade onto the domestic as well as the global stage.

According to the IEA, “the net zero emissions scenario envisages an increase in the capacity of CCS (carbon capture and storage) to 170 million tons in 20308.” Despite this, there is still a long way to go – CCUS continually makes up less than 0.5% of global investment in clean energy and efficient technologies, the IEA notes9.

The first industrial-scale CCUS projects are being launched across the cement industry. In 2024, Heidelberg Materials constructed the world’s first industrial-scale CCS facility – the Brevik cement plant in Norway, which is capable of capturing 400 kilotons of CO2 emissions per year.

“Heidelberg’s Brevik plant will deliver the world’s first carbon-captured net zero cement and concrete, with management expecting to be able to sell this product in the first half of this year,” says Eisenegger.

“We participated in the latest green bond deal to support the company’s build out of carbon capture technologies which directly mitigate climate change. While we expect some cyclical headwinds and negative price/cost spread to reduce future earnings, we expect the balance sheet to remain strong (net leverage 1.2x),” he adds. “Credit risk is currently very similar within the sector, while Heidelberg bonds have traded marginally wider. Therefore, we continue to see Heidelberg bonds compensating us relatively well for the underlying risk.”

Driving down transport emissions

Road transport is at the beginning of its most significant technological transformation in a century, with electrification, autonomous driving, clean hydrogen, and bioenergy at the forefront of the decarbonisation challenge.

In contrast to power generation, the transportation sector largely occupies the ‘high-cost’ area of the decarbonisation cost curve, responsible for approximately 20% global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, according to a Goldman Sachs report10.

Aviation: A new runway

Aviation’s share in anthropogenic global warming weighs in at approximately 4% to date11. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) envisions SAF contributing up to 65% of industry decarbonisation by 205012.

The importance of this technology is being recognised – and global authorities have it firmly in their regulatory sights as a vital enabler in decarbonising the aviation industry. As of 1 January 2025, the European Union’s (EU) SAF initiative (ReFuelEU Aviation) requires 2% of all fuel uplifted at EU airports to be SAF. This will increase to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035 and 70% by 205013.

According to energy pioneer Neste, the company’s production capability of approximately 1.5 million tons of SAF per annum could meet the entire mandate between now and 2029 – but “all available SAF volumes will be needed for the industry to reduce its emissions to reach the industry's net-zero target14.”

Meanwhile, the UK’s SAF Mandate also took effect in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, rising in line to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040, with the government underlining its vital role in decarbonising the aviation industry. “The SAF Mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatons of carbon savings per year by 204015,” the UK government’s website states.

While the market is growing, challenges remain. A paper published last year analysing SAFs reported that “the feasibility of SAF production still depends on feedstock availability, cost-effectiveness, and route selection. Overall, technological advancements and gradual cost reductions, coupled with policy drivers, will be key factors in promoting the widespread application and commercialisation of SAF16.” While SAF plays a crucial role as a key enabling technology, it is likely that SAF on its own can only achieve limited fuel substitution and other alternatives are needed to decarbonise aviation to a larger extent, eg electrification of short haul flights.

“In the case of Neste, fixed income investors can use green bonds as a financing instrument to support the capacity expansion of SAF, while staying clear from their oil and gas activity,” says Eisenegger. “This is thanks to the predefined project eligibility criteria which states how the proceeds of green bonds can be deployed by the issuer.

“The Rotterdam refinery expansion is expected to expand renewable product capacity by 1.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2026 while the Singapore refinery expansion will have an optionality to produce up to 1mtpa of SAF,” he adds. “As bond valuations started to price in risks of a credit rating downgrade due to cyclical margins pressure, we have taken the opportunity to build a position in Neste via green bonds to benefit from an increasingly attractive financial risk-reward.”

Despite the promise of SAF, there is clearly still a long runway ahead to fall in line with the net zero emissions scenario, according to the IEA, which notes that “the use of SAF would need to increase more than twice as fast as in the NZE17 scenario, reaching about 4 exajoules (EJ) by 2030 and accounting for about 25% of the aviation fuel market18.”

Decarbonising buildings

Direct carbon emissions from buildings, both residential and commercial, account for a significant portion of total global CO2 emissions, primarily due to the use of fossil fuels for space and water heating.

Buildings operations account for “30% of global final energy consumption and 26% of global energy-related emissions (8% being direct emissions in buildings and 18% indirect emissions from the production of electricity and heat used in buildings)19”, according to the IEA.

Over the next three decades, the global building floor area is expected to skyrocket by 75% with emerging markets accounting for approximately 80% of the demand, the IEA stated. A transformative energy shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives is therefore essential for buildings, whose operations contribute heavily to global emissions.

Transferring energy

Heat pumps (HPs) are critical for achieving net zero targets. Unlike conventional heating systems that generate heat by burning fossil fuels or through electric resistance, a heat pump “extracts heat from a source, such as the surrounding air, geothermal energy stored in the ground, or nearby sources of water or waste heat from a factory. It then amplifies and transfers the heat to where it is needed. Because most of the heat is transferred rather than generated, heat pumps are far more efficient than conventional heating technologies such as boilers or electric heaters and can be cheaper to run20,” the IEA notes.

Additionally, this source is produced at a much higher rate of efficiency – to the tune of 300% to 400%21. This means that HPs – which run on electricity from the grid – produce three to four times as much energy in the form of heat in comparison to what they’re consuming in electricity.

So far, policy plans by governments around the world indicate an increased use in heat pumps, which will have a clear impact on the use of oil, gas and coal for heating. According to the IEA, HPs can potentially remove at least 500 million tons of global carbon dioxide emissions in 203022.

“Johnson Controls International (JCI) offers one of the largest portfolios of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment and controls in the world, and we believe that the company has favourable structural end-market exposure and reliable financial policies that include both a firm investment grade commitment and a disciplined capital allocation policy amongst other attributes,” says Eisenegger.

“We own green bonds of JCI. The financing provided via these green bonds has helped avoid 1,200,000 metric tons of CO2e23 through eco-efficient and/or circular economy adapted projects, production technologies and processes such as the installation of heat pumps.”

Retro challenges

Invented in the 1850s and used in homes from the mid-20th century onwards, heat pumps are not a new invention, and their wider adoption still rests on overcoming hurdles. These range from high installation costs to potentially huge retrofits to larger buildings requiring better insulation and heating distribution.

Despite the benefits that HPs offer to help limit the rise in global temperatures, they also face a significant challenge in terms of electricity supply with concerns that they could face a surge in demand for electricity, particularly in colder climates.

“In the long-term, the decarbonisation of heat through electrification needs to be coupled with the successful decarbonisation of the electricity grid, which makes it more challenging,” a study by researchers in the Energy and Power Group at the University of Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science notes24. “Depending on the heating technologies deployed and the degree of consumer behavioural change, a significant increase in peak power demand might be observed.”

According to Claire Halloran, co-author of the report25, “if just 10% of British households switched to heat pumps it could increase peak electricity demand by 4% to 5%. This increase is nearly twice the power capacity of Hornsea 2, the largest offshore wind farm in Britain.”

Electrifying success

As with heat pumps, many enabling technologies are reliant on modernising and expanding the grid system, and when it comes to the success of net zero technologies, most roads lead back to electrification.

The widespread adoption of electrification is widely recognised as a crucial element in the energy transition. This is primarily due to the significant energy efficiency gains that can be achieved through electrification of economic activities. When generating electricity directly from renewable sources, efficiency can be two to three times higher compared to using fossil fuels. This is because the thermal conversion process of fossil fuels wastes the majority of the energy contained in hydrocarbons.

“Electrification is an inevitability,” says Eisenegger. “Electrification through reliable and carbon-neutral power infrastructure, with a smart power grid system serving as the backbone for its widespread adoption, is perhaps the crucially enabling role to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”",https://mandg.scene7.com/is/image/mandg/amp4-thumbnail-cleanmachine,N,,2025-03-28 01:56:37.807056

CADO is a not-for-profit organisation based out of Montreal. As its founding member, IATA’s role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

To be eligible for CADO membership, organisations must meet one of the following three requirements.

They must be, either: organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain or represent associations or groups of participants within the chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the SAF Registry’s operations and benefits; or related interest groups indirectly benefiting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA is developing the SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way.

It will ensure the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked throughout the SAF value chain and allow airlines and other corporations to use the benefit claims to meet regulatory obligations and voluntary commitments.

SAF supply is scarce, only available in a few places worldwide, so the goal of the SAF registry is to help solve the shortage problem by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers regardless of geographic location.

It will also provide airlines’ corporate customers with access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalise on financial clients’ capacities to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.

SAF Registry participation will be free until April 2027, after which the price will be determined on a cost-recovery basis.

Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also commented: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor.”

Walsh added: “Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward.”",https://www.aviationbusinessnews.com/resources/uploads/2025/03/ABN-Images-2025-03-27T092332.704.webp,N,,2025-03-27 16:57:17.052793

During a visit(opens in a new tab) to Penn England Farms in Blair County, the Governor highlighted how a methane digester is converting farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and reducing pollution. Under the Lightning Plan, more farmers will have access to shared digesters, further reducing costs and generating new revenue by selling excess energy back to the grid.

Backed by labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, the Lightning Plan fast-tracks energy projects, streamlines permitting, and delivers real savings for Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvania has long been at the forefront of energy innovation – from Ben Franklin’s experiments to today’s cutting-edge clean technologies– and the Lightning Plan builds on this legacy, ensuring the Commonwealth remains a national leader in energy production and economic growth for decades to come.

Earlier this month, Governor Shapiro launched(opens in a new tab) his legislative push for the Lightning Plan at Voith Hydro in York, one of the world’s largest dedicated hydropower manufacturing facilities. In January, the Governor unveiled(opens in a new tab) his plan during a visit to Pittsburgh International Airport, highlighting a $1.5 billion hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel project which is creating 3,000 construction jobs and positioning Pennsylvania as a hub for next-generation energy solutions. Additionally, he announced(opens in a new tab) a new agreement with PJM Interconnection, securing $21 billion in consumer savings over the next two years to lower household energy costs and protect Pennsylvania ratepayers.

Read what bipartisan legislators from the General Assembly; labor, industry, environmental, and consumer leaders; and Pennsylvanians from all across the Commonwealth are saying about Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan:

Yvette Longenecker, Owner of Penn England Farms: “Our family has spent generations producing high-quality milk while being responsible stewards of the land — that’s why we installed a digester. A digester allows us to turn something we already have — manure — into something valuable: renewable energy. It helps power our farm, reduces odors, improves water quality, and provides an additional revenue stream to keep our operation sustainable.”

Mark Heeter, President of the Blair County Farm Bureau: ""As a farmer and president of the Blair County Farm Bureau, I know the challenges our industry faces — from rising costs to the need for more efficient practices. That’s why today’s announcement is so important. The community energy proposal gives farmers the opportunity to invest in methane digesters, reduce energy costs, and improve farm operations to stay competitive. The Agricultural Innovation Program has already been a valuable resource, and increasing investment in this initiative is critical to ensuring farmers can access the technology needed to keep their businesses strong. On behalf of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau and farmers across the state, I thank the administration for recognizing the importance of agriculture and supporting innovation. We look forward to working together to strengthen our industry.""

Steven McKnight, President and CEO of the Altoona Blair County Development Corporation (ABCD): “It’s an honor to share the podium with Governor Shapiro and Secretary Redding. I had the privilege of serving as President of the Pennsylvania Economic Development Association when the Governor took office, and we were eager to engage with the new administration’s vision. Governor Shapiro quickly recognized that Pennsylvania’s last formal economic development plan was from 2003 — outdated for today’s modern economy. Since then, his administration has worked hard to create bold initiatives like the Site Development Fund, housing programs, Main Street revitalization, and the Lightning Plan, which we’re here to highlight today. Programs like these are fueling growth across the Commonwealth, allowing rural and agricultural communities — like Williamsburg — to embrace innovative energy solutions, reduce costs, and stay competitive. Governor Shapiro, we appreciate your vision, planning, and ongoing partnership in strengthening Pennsylvania’s economy.""

Senator Judy Schwank: “Community Energy will make clean, renewable energy more affordable and accessible for farmers, helping them lower utility costs and boost profitability. I'm proud to partner with Governor Shapiro to introduce Community Energy legislation, which is just one exciting piece of the Lightning Plan. This is a pivotal opportunity to come together and embrace comprehensive energy policies that will power Pennsylvania's bright future.""

Representative Peter Schweyer: “The demand for energy in Pennsylvania continues to grow and as demand rises so does the strain on the utility grid. Community energy will help reduce the strain on the electricity grid and help lower utility costs by allowing people that cannot currently utilize solar panels or other renewable energy sources to get access. Folks can save money and reap the grid benefits. I am pleased to work with Gov. Shapiro on community energy and look forward to getting this bill across the finish line and to his desk.”

Stanley Kocon, President & CEO of Voith Hydro North America: “Demand for electricity in the US is growing, and hydro power stands out as one of the most reliable and sustainable renewable energy sources available, not only for generating electricity, but also for storing energy – an often overlooked but essential resource to maintain a stable energy grid. We wholeheartedly support the Governor’s plan to lower electricity costs and to build and upgrade more power plants to ensure clean, reliable and affordable energy for Pennsylvania's future.”

Jim Enders, President of the Central Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council: “We’re long overdue to unite behind a strategy that encourages energy production, lowers costs for energy consumers, creates good paying union jobs that offer family sustaining wages, and at the same time is mindful of the planet that we will leave behind for our kids and our grandkids. These are common sense goals that we should all be able to agree on. Organized labor is encouraged by the Governor’s leadership on an energy plan that creates thousands of good paying union jobs and puts Pennsylvania energy at the forefront.”

Kevin Schreiber, President & CEO, York County Economic Alliance: “The Lightning Plan’s impact on communities like York – where manufacturing is not just an industry but a way of life – will be transformative. The plan will attract new investments and stimulate job creation by prioritizing sustainable energy production and modernizing tax and other incentives, ensuring that advanced manufacturing remains a cornerstone of local economies. It will also empower manufacturers, such as Voith Hydro, to continue to expand operations and lead global energy innovation.”

Patrick McDonnell, President & CEO of PennFuture: “It's not just enough for us as a Commonwealth to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure. It's important for us to boost the amount of renewable energy here in the state. It's important for us to realize the benefits to air quality, to water quality, to build those things. The lightning plan is a real, concrete way for us to reduce energy costs for consumers and to make sure we're putting the people of Pennsylvania to work.”

Senator Carolyn Comitta: “As a major energy-producing state, Pennsylvania is in a unique position to lead on sustainable energy sources that can reduce electric costs for families, bring new jobs to our communities, and help secure our right to clean air and pure water. PACER and the Governor’s “Lightning Plan” are the way forward to cleaner air, better economic opportunities, and consumer savings on electricity bills,” said Comitta, who serves as Minority Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. “I thank Governor Shapiro, Rep. Abney, and our legislative partners and co-sponsors for coming together to prioritize Pennsylvania’s future.”

Representative Aerion Abney: “PACER is a win-win for the environment and Pennsylvanians. The program is a tremendous boost to economies across the state by creating many new jobs in the energy sector and reinvests crucial funds in the protection of our planet’s health for generations to come.”

Representative Steve Samuelson: “The current qualifications for a business to claim the Semiconductor tax credits are unattainable. Not only do they leave out worthy businesses making great strides in manufacturing a key component of our electronic devices, but the credits have gone unused for the past two years. My bill would make the credits more attainable, ultimately achieving the goal of spurring economic development.”

Senator Steve Santarsiero: “I have long said that it’s a false premise to say we must choose between creating jobs OR saving our planet. I applaud Governor Shapiro for leading the way and bringing together the interests of consumers, labor and the environment to find a solution that works for all of us. To that end, I am proud to introduce legislation to create the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard, the next generation of alternative energy portfolio standards for the Commonwealth. PRESS will turbocharge energy build-out in Pennsylvania and create a more diverse mix of energy resources focusing on clean, reliable, and affordable energy.”

Representative Danielle Otten: “Pennsylvania is at a critical juncture. With energy demand skyrocketing, the PJM capacity markets facing unprecedented price spikes, and our state sorely lagging in clean energy investments, it’s imperative that we act now. PRESS, as part of Governor Shapiro's Lightning Plan, will help to diversify our energy sources, reduce emissions, build resiliency into our grid, improve reliability, and lower electricity costs for ratepayers, while creating workforce opportunities and securing Pennsylvania's position as a leader in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for the next 20 years.""

Senator John I. Kane: ""Pennsylvania has always been a leader in energy innovation, but red tape has held us back from building the next generation of reliable energy projects. I'm thrilled to see Governor Shapiro taking bold action with the Lightning Plan, and I'm proud to be the prime sponsor of the RESET Board, which will be a key part of that vision. This one-stop shop for energy development will get steel in the ground faster, create good jobs, lower costs for consumers, and ensure Pennsylvania remains an energy powerhouse for decades to come.""

Representative Mandy Steele: “If we are serious, really and truly serious, about supercharging energy development in the state to bring costs down for Pennsylvanians and set us up as a dominant energy leader, we must streamline the process. Creating a Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board will speed up the entire process, from permitting to reducing red tape, and supporting new energy projects in a big way. I am happy to be able to work with the governor on getting this proposal through the legislative process and become law.”

Senator Lisa Boscola: ""Pennsylvania’s energy future requires a balanced approach, one that prioritizes both supply and demand. Act 129 is a needed but outdated initiative. When first introduced, the program helped make households more efficient by changing out inefficient appliances. As demand continues to outpace supply, we need to reimagine the tools used to create efficiencies in our homes and businesses. Reforming this program will give homeowners and businesses the incentives they need to reduce their energy bills by making investments in items that will drive down their energy consumption. By driving down demand, the program helps ensure we have the power we need to keep Pennsylvania running. Act 129 reforms are just one component of a strategic energy policy that includes smart investments in energy efficiency, resiliency, and generation.""

Representative Kyle Donahue: “I believe that Gov. Shapiro’s lighting plan is a fruitful step forward for the energy industry in Pennsylvania. This plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building next generation power, and position the commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. I look forward to working with Gov. Shapiro and my colleagues in the state House and Senate to support legislation that will enact this plan.”

Senator Jay Costa: “As a lifelong resident of Allegheny County, I know how important it is to deliver good, honest union jobs to our working families, regardless of whether they have a college degree. I also know the importance of keeping costs down wherever possible, so folks can put their hard-earned money where they want it to go, like their kids’ college funds or family vacation. I am proud to be supporting Governor Shapiro on his plans to do both things at once through his Lightning Energy Plan. By unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy potential, Governor Shapiro will create energy jobs, lower energy costs, protect PA’s energy independence, and position our commonwealth as a leader in the nation.”

Senator Nick Pisciottano: “I commend Governor Shapiro for this bold, responsible, forward-looking energy plan, and I am happy to be a prime sponsor in the Senate of the EDGE tax credit programs, designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing sectors. I share the Governor’s commitment to affordable, clean, and reliable energy for every family, business, and community in Pennsylvania. This plan will lower electricity costs, which is a top priority for our residents who are facing rising utility bills. We are excited to introduce a plan that strikes a vital balance between meeting the growing energy demands of our state, while also making sure we are protecting our environment for future generations. By focusing on both innovation and practical solutions, we are setting the stage for Pennsylvania to thrive in the energy sector and compete in the global economy.”

Representative John Inglis: “Pennsylvania energy powered the industrial revolution and Pennsylvania energy will power the technological revolutions of the future – if we make the right investments to support the projects that create jobs today and help create jobs for years to come. I’m proud to be the sponsor of the EDGE tax credits in the Lightning package to help fund energy generation and infrastructure upgrades and a brighter future.”

Representative Rob Matzie: “Pennsylvania is the crossroads of America for roads, rails, and skies. Investing in sustainable aviation fuel production with the Lightning plan helps cut emissions, create good-paying jobs, and support innovation in agriculture.”

Representative Tom Mehaffie: “Pennsylvania has lost out because the PA EDGE tax credit program was not utilized as envisioned. We are overdue to re-energize the tax credits and ensure the Commonwealth – and nation – have sources of PA-produced, reliable power for years to come.”

For additional information about these proposed rules, please see PwC Insight IRS notices provide initial guidance on the Section 45Z clean fuel credit.
Detailed records must substantiate the production and emissions rates for the credit, and certification is required for sustainable aviation fuel.","In brief

What happened?

Starting in 2025, the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit replaces the Sections 40A and 40B tax credits. Earlier this year, Treasury and the IRS released guidance on the Section 45Z credit, which applies to clean transportation fuel (1) produced at a qualified facility in the United States and (2) sold between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, with specific criteria for emissions rates and facility qualifications.

Why is it relevant?

Enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Section 45Z provides a tax credit of 20 cents per gallon of clean transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility by a taxpayer and sold to an unrelated person after 2024. The credit amount is 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel. These amounts are multiplied by five if the taxpayer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions in constructing, repairing, or altering the facility. Notice 2025-10 provides rules that Treasury and the IRS intend to propose in forthcoming proposed regulations on Section 45Z, while Notice 2025-11 offers general information on determining fuel emissions rates and includes the initial emissions rate table.

Action to consider

To claim the Section 45Z credit, a taxpayer must (1) register under Section 4101 as a producer of clean fuel and (2) provide certification from an unrelated party of compliance with certain requirements for sustainable aviation fuel. Taxpayers that may be affected by the forthcoming proposed regulations should consider submitting comments by the April 10 due date.

In detail

Section 45Z provides a tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility in the United States and sold to an unrelated person for various uses. To qualify, the fuel must meet specific lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions criteria published by Treasury in an annual table of emissions rates for different fuel types. Nonaviation fuels are subject to the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model, while sustainable aviation fuels are subject to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or similar methodologies. The Section 45Z credit amount is determined by the fuel's emissions factor and applicable rates, and companies that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are eligible to increase the credit amount by a multiple of five.

Observation: Section 45Z’s reliance on GREET and CORSIA to determine whether fuels meet emissions and production standards is consistent with other technology-neutral credits enacted as part of the IRA.

Notice 2025-10 details proposed rules under Section 45Z for qualified facilities, ownership, and production. The notice provides that (1) a qualified facility includes all components that function interdependently to produce transportation fuel and (2) carbon capture equipment can be used to contribute to the lifecycle GHG emissions rate. Significantly, a company is not required to own the facility to claim a Section 45Z credit, as production is attributed to the producer. Notice 2025-10 clarifies that a company must engage in substantial processing activities, which excludes minimal processing activities like blending, to qualify as a producer. Additionally, the fuels must be suitable for use in highway vehicles or aircraft. The notice also provides methodologies for determining emissions rates for different fuel types.

Observation: Notice 2025-10 provides rules that may be included in forthcoming proposed regulations on Section 45Z. It provides preliminary guidance that is not binding on taxpayers. For additional information about these proposed rules, please see PwC Insight IRS notices provide initial guidance on the Section 45Z clean fuel credit.

Taxpayers may obtain a provisional emissions rate for novel fuels or those using un-established pathways under Notice 2025-10 by first obtaining an emissions value from the Department of Energy. Detailed records must substantiate the production and emissions rates for the credit, and certification is required for sustainable aviation fuel. Registration under Section 4101 is necessary to qualify for the credit, with specific requirements for re-registration and notification of ownership changes.

Notice 2025-11 provides background on the CORSIA program and the 45ZCF-GREET model for determining emissions rates. Taxpayers are required to use the most recent determinations from the emissions rate table for nonaviation fuels and choose between CORSIA or 45ZCF-GREET for sustainable aviation fuels.

Observation: The GREET life cycle analysis was developed by the Department of Energy to assess the environmental impacts associated with technologies, fuels, products, and energy systems across various stages of the supply chain. Other IRA credits that rely on the GREET model include Section 40B for sustainable aviation fuel and Section 45V for clean hydrogen. See our PwC Insights for more information:

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU will require airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

But airlines complain SAF is not widely available and too expensive, hampering competitiveness.

""We don't have enough SAF, and the SAF that we have is very expensive,"" Luis Gallego, CEO of the IAG airline group bringing together Iberia, British Airways and other carriers, told a press conference.

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels.

EU rules require carriers to include two per cent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six per cent in 2030 and then soaring to 70 per cent from 2050.

But a study published by A4E estimates SAF production would be 30 per cent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030, according to Gallego.

""It is now clear that SAF supply will not be sufficient to meet the six per cent target by 2030,"" said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030"" target, added Gallego.

Contributing to almost three per cent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said that, in addition, it also helps address environmental pollution.

“Previously, used cooking oil was usually just disposed of, causing pollution to waterways and rivers. However, these days, used cooking oil is being used as the base material for the production of SAF.

“In years to come, sustainable aviation fuel is expected to become a mandatory requirement internationally. As such, the collection and recycling of used cooking oil not only helps prevent environmental pollution but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector, which is one of the sectors with the highest carbon emission rates,” he said.

He said this when met at the programme to collect used cooking oil at the Taman Setapak Jaya Ramadan Bazaar organised by FatHopes Energy Sdn Bhd, in collaboration with Eko Setiawangsa here yesterday. It was also attended by FatHopes Energy chief executive officer Vinesh Sinha.

Meanwhile, Vinesh Sinha said the aviation sector is the most difficult to decarbonise due to the lack of viable alternatives.

“Whereas in road transport, multiple options such as electrification and hydrogen are available. As a Malaysian company, we believe it is our responsibility to help solve the world’s biggest challenges,“ he said.

He added that the Malaysian government has provided strong support for this initiative and hopes that new policies will be introduced to regulate the country’s entire ecosystem.

He also shared that FatHopes Energy has been collecting used cooking oil at Ramadan bazaars nationwide daily.

“During Ramadan, we can collect around 2,000 to 3,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil per day from each bazaar. This initiative is being carried out nationwide, with the most visible presence in Kuala Lumpur. However, we are also actively operating nationwide, including in Sabah and Sarawak.

Early last year, their scaled-down Pathfinder model received an airworthiness certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing JetZero to do official test flights.

Energy-efficient, sustainable aircraft development like JetZero's could pave the way for net-zero aviation pollution. Globally, the aviation industry is responsible for 2.5% of carbon dioxide emissions, and has ""grown faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road or shipping,"" per the International Energy Agency.

Delta has already made good progress on their path to sustainability. A sustainable aviation fuel blending facility is under construction in Minnesota, and will help Delta replace planet-polluting jet fuel.

Tom O'Leary, the cofounder and CEO of JetZero, told Delta News Hub that ""JetZero is working to change the world by bringing to market an aircraft that aims to fly this decade and make immediate and marked progress toward reducing airline energy costs, and the associated emissions.""

""The ability to realize such significant efficiency gains in the near future meaningfully impacts the industry's commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and will serve as the foundation on which other technologies and efficiencies can be realized,"" O'Leary said.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JetZeroimage-recwb7TqdjW5h8sOC.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 13:56:48.464600

Airbus Says Innovation Can Offset Air Travel But the Record Isn't Good,Darin Graham,,,,,https://skift.com/2025/03/27/airbus-aviation-emissions-stablized-climate-change/,"Kitcher added that rather than limiting air travel, the focus should be on decarbonization strategies such as alternative fuels and more efficient aircraft.
“At the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel,” she said.
The net result: Research published in Nature shows that aviation emissions have more than doubled since 1990.
The European Union also reported that aviation emissions in Europe have doubled since 1990.
“So far, the sector has made almost no progress on the latter,” Ritchie wrote in a report on aviation emissions.","At the Airbus Summit in France on Tuesday, Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher claimed that aviation emissions have remained “relatively stable” and that innovation could help offset the industry’s continued growth.

While steady as a share of total emissions, the record shows a rise in aviation emissions in the past three decades and there are several challenges to implementing new tools that make air travel more efficient.

Kitcher made her case on a panel discussing limiting the amount of flights to slow down emissions: “We’ve seen that over the decades, although air travel has doubled, actually the greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have remained relatively stable. So it shows that the technology and the measures that we’re implementing are offsetting the growth from aviation,” Kitcher said at the conference.

Kitcher added that rather than limiting air travel, the focus should be on decarbonization strategies such as alternative fuels and more efficient aircraft.

“At the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel,” she said. “So it’s really about being able to offset and reduce emissions with the right tools to be able to get us to net zero in 2050.”

When asked about Kitcher's remarks, an Airbus spokesperson pointed Skift to a 2024 Airbus report that showed that aviation's share of global carbon dioxide emissions had remained at around 2%.

Aviation Emissions: What the Research Shows

Over the years, aircraft have become more fuel-efficient, helping to slow the growth of emissions in the aviation sector, which contributes around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions annually.

Between 1990 and 2019, air travel for both passenger and freight quadrupled, according to Hannah Ritchie, Deputy Editor of Our World in Data at the University of Oxford’s Oxford Martin School.

At the same time, aircraft became twice as energy efficient.

The net result: Research published in Nature shows that aviation emissions have more than doubled since 1990.

A study in Science Direct, which analyzed aviation emissions data from sources including historical flight records, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization, reached similar conclusions.

The European Union also reported that aviation emissions in Europe have doubled since 1990.

The industry itself has admitted that progress has been slow.

The sector hadn’t “made as much progress” as it wanted, “or is needed, on decarbonizing the aviation sector,” said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director Willie Walsh in December.

Greener Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Falling Behind

Future emissions will depend on whether aviation can maintain the efficiency gains and transition to low-carbon fuels, Ritchie said.

“So far, the sector has made almost no progress on the latter,” Ritchie wrote in a report on aviation emissions.

Many airlines have committed to using SAF to help reduce emissions. But concerns remain over its limited supply.

Kitcher acknowledged this during her presentation. “We need to find a way to stimulate the capital,” she said. “It will all come down to the business case. We've got to get an attractive business case for our airline customers, for suppliers, for banks to be able to really make a difference.”

Meanwhile, air travel demand continues to rise. IATA reported record high global demand in 2024. And Airbus projects that air traffic will more than double in the next 20 years.

Much of the growth is expected to come from regions like India and China.

Some experts worry that slower adoption of climate policies in these regions could delay decarbonization efforts. Kitcher said she remains optimistic about progress in these markets.

“We shouldn’t underestimate what is happening in China and India when it comes to renewable fuel,” she said. “Connectivity, economic growth, reducing emissions - there’s a lot happening.”

During the summit, the company provided an update on its plans for a hydrogen powered aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030’s.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 percent quota in 2025 and aiming for 70 percent SAF in all EU airports by 2050.

Led by France-headed Elyse Energy, a pioneering industrial SME specializing in the production of sustainable fuels and low-carbon raw materials, the BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels per EU RED definition and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) or electro-fuels (eFuels).

The technology brings proven process building blocks that have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium, comprising Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles, TotalEnergies, and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change, said Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy.

Detailed engineering phase

Axens signed a license agreement for BioTfueL technology in 2024, which includes a “PRENFLO” gasification technology from thyssenkrupp Uhde, a “GASEL” Fischer-Tropsch and syngas upgrading technology from Axens with a basic engineering completed in November 2024 and currently being within the detail engineering phase.

Axens, along with our parent company IFP Energies Nouvelles, has invested significant capital in demonstrating technologies at a semi-commercial scale and advancing the energy transition, particularly in SAF processes. We are thrilled to be part of the BioTJet project, which is strategic for Axens and our longtime partner thyssenkrupp Uhde. The BioTJet project leverages a breakthrough technology, BioTfueL, underscoring our commitment to innovative solutions in the energy sector, said Quentin Debuisschert, CEO of Axens.

Robust and proven gasification technology

With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO gasification technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility and can handle a wide range of feedstocks.

With over 100 gasifiers successfully realized, thyssenKrupp Uhde is both a pioneer and world leader in gasification technology.

PRENFLO is a pressurized, entrained-flow gasification technology developed and first demonstrated by thyssenkrupp Uhde in the late 1980s.

Brussels: Major European airlines on Thursday urged the European Union to reconsider green targets for the sector unless production of renewable fuels picks up and costs can be brought down.

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU will require airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

But airlines complain SAF is not widely available and too expensive, hampering competitiveness.

""We don't have enough SAF, and the SAF that we have is very expensive,"" Luis Gallego, CEO of the IAG airline group bringing together Iberia, British Airways and other carriers, told a press conference.

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels.

EU rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 and then soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

But a study published by A4E estimates SAF production would be 30 percent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030, according to Gallego.

""It is now clear that SAF supply will not be sufficient to meet the six percent target by 2030,"" said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030"" target, added Gallego.

Contributing to almost three percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

SAF -- a biofuel that produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel, made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat -- is seen as a crucial ingredient to hitting emissions targets.

It is expected to provide 65 percent of aviation's ""net zero"" mitigation by 2050.

The chief executives of Ryanair, Aer Lingus and British Airways ower IAG, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM AIRF.PA told an annual industry conference in Brussels that the requirements for sustainable aviation fuel were adding to regulatory burdens that risked European aviation falling behind global competitors.

""We urgently need an EU aviation strategy in order to have SAF at competitive prices unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030 SAF mandate to the right,"" said Luis Gallego, the CEO of IAG.

The head of industry group Airlines for Europe said regulatory costs had tripled between 2014 and 2024.

SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply. European airlines are this year expected to use 2% of SAF in their jet fuel mix, with the mandate rising to 6% in 2030.

A Boston Consulting Group report published today found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of revenue or budget allocation to SAF.

US President Donald Trump's call for more fossil fuel investment is adding to pressure on the fledgling green fuel market.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the oil majors - the biggest likely producers - were already cutting back their SAF programmes.

The airlines said the European Union's sustainability rules created an unfair cost burden on them, giving an advantage to international carriers that do not have to meet sustainability mandates and can fly longer routes.

""Our market shares are going down not only to government-owned carriers in the East but also private competitors and some partners in the US. European aviation is falling behind,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said.

As with the car sector, aviation could benefit from an easing of sustainability requirements, executives said.

""We all know we started with a Green Deal that now has been moved into a clean deal. And I think we also need a lean deal"", said Spohr.

The European Commission proposed last month in its ""Simplification Omnibus"" to cut the burden of climate-related reporting but the focus was to relieve the pressure on small and medium companies.

Meanwhile, the CEO of IAG also said today that Heathrow was not meeting expectations, given the high costs of operating out of the British airport.

Stephen Forshaw, chief representative of Airbus in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific, says that aviation has a pressing need to decarbonise, as only this will give it the “licence” to continue operating in the decades ahead, especially as consumers become more conscious about their carbon emissions.

He also observes that 80% of Australia’s jet fuel was imported in 2024, compared with just 50% a decade ago. This creates an energy security issue.

On how to resolve these issues, Forshaw says that Australia is extremely well placed to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) given the ready availability of feedstocks.

In addition to providing energy security, a robust Australian SAF capability will also provide jobs and, most important, reduce the emissions associated with flying.

Boeing used the show to make a presentation about Cascade 2.0, a publicly available climate impact model that lets users adjust a range of variables to help map out the industry’s decarbonisation journey.

Demonstrating Cascade to reporters at Boeing’s stand, the company’s vice-president of environmental sustainability Ryan Faucett manipulated factors such as air traffic growth, fuel type, aircraft type, and operational efficiencies to help assess their long-term impact on reducing emissions.

By way of demonstration, he laid out one hypothetical whereby sustainable aviation fuel, offsets, new aircraft types, and operations combined to vastly reduce emissions by 2050.

Faucett says the tool can help policy makers and other industry participants gauge the impact of the various factors involved in the industry’s reduction of emissions.

“It paints a picture of exactly what it would take on all sets of removals to get all the way to net zero,” says Faucett.

In addition, discussions advanced on ethanol-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which could benefit Brazilian agribusiness -particularly the country's sugar-energy industry- and the development of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, dubbed “flying cars,” which are expected to enter operation by 2027 through a joint venture between Embraer and Japanese companies.

The Brazilian delegation announced Wednesday the purchase by Japanese carrier All Nippon Aiways (ANA) of 20 E-190 aircraft. The company also intends to buy another five aircraft, it was explained.

Brazil's Minister of Ports and Airports Silvio Costa Filho said that the partnership with the Japanese will serve as a kind of seal for new sales to other countries, further expanding Embraer's business horizon.

“And with the sale of aircraft to international markets, we will need to prepare Brazilian labor, structuring our great plan to prepare our young people for this new job market that is emerging in Brazil, which is aviation,” he added. To this end, Brazil is already developing qualification and training programs for this job market, he further noted.

“This will generate jobs and income. It will stimulate the economy,” the minister also said, adding that all the Japanese companies he had spoken to had assured him that they would make Embraer a priority for their business.

Negotiations have also progressed with a view to the Japanese aviation sector adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an alternative to fossil-based aviation fuel. According to the Brazilian government, this fuel can be obtained from various sources. Among them, ethanol produced from sugar cane.

“SAF is a fuel that consists of ethanol. It is, therefore, significant for the Brazilian agribusiness industry. In addition, we are working alongside all the ministers in Japan, including the Prime Minister, to ensure that 10% of the fuel here in Japan is made from ethanol,” the Brazilian official also mentioned.

This fuel can also be obtained from agricultural waste, used cooking oil, fats, and corn, among others, pure or mixed, according to technical safety specifications. According to the Planalto, Brazil has “extensive expertise on the subject.”

“As well as boosting aviation fuel here in Japan, we will stimulate Brazil's sugar-energy industry, which is in dialogue with sustainability, through this fuel of the future that Brazil has presented to the world,” added the minister.

Also part of the Brazilian delegation, Embraer President Francisco Gomes Neto said that the Japanese were also interested in developing the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), a 100% electric vehicle known as a “flying car.”

This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.
In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.
The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism.
Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, says, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.","Airbus is taking a significant step toward scaling the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by testing a new “Book and Claim” approach. This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in third-party facilitation of such integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, says, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”",https://memuknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unnamed-4-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 11:57:23.642782

Background and significance

Japan is among the leading countries in terms of forest resources worldwide, with high expectations that thinning materials and residues generated from wood usage can be leveraged as sustainable raw materials due to their potential volume. In addition, the use of wood in large-scale wooden buildings, including high-rise buildings, is currently in the spotlight from the perspective of resource circulation, and it is expected that there will be an increase in opportunities to utilize the residues generated as a result of such initiatives.

Current status and initiatives of the aviation and chemical industries:

Overview of the pre-feasibility study

This study envisions the potential use of manufacturing technology developed by Licella*1 to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues, which will then be reformed and refined for use in making products such as SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel towards the building of a domestic supply chain. This supply will leverage a model involving local consumption of locally produced products. Specifically, the study will assess the economic viability of the business; consider the raw material supply and processing system as well as the manufacturing process; and evaluate product logistics and effectiveness in reducing CO2 emissions.

Problems in Solutions CalPERS does indeed classify a small proportion of its investments in oil and gas companies as providing climate solutions, confirmed Peter Cashion, managing investment director for sustainable investments, speaking during the investor’s mid-March board meeting.
He also reiterated the importance CalPERS places on engaging with oil and gas companies to promote sustainability at these corporations.
Witness how CalPERS $5 billion allocation to a Climate Transition Index underweights oil and gas companies with no transition plan.
California Common Good also called for more details on the private equity, private debt, infrastructure and real estate holdings CalPERS classifies as climate solutions.","CalPERS has hit back at criticism from a coalition of environmental advocates and public sector unions, California Common Good, that its flagship $53 billion sustainable portfolio which it hopes to double to $100 billion by the end of the decade includes a $3.5 billion allocation to many of the world’s biggest polluters.

The organisation used public records, including filing a California Public Records Act request, to highlight that CalPERS’ climate adaptation, transition, and mitigation investments include holdings in 52 of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters. The report aims most of its criticism at CalPERS’ inclusion of seven oil and gas companies in the portfolio.

“Unfortunately, the report raises unfounded concerns that CalPERS isn’t serious about addressing climate change. Even worse, it could be construed as suggesting that CalPERS is intentionally misleading its 2.2 million members and the public about the intent of our climate investing program,” said CEO Marcie Frost in a statement.

Problems in Solutions

CalPERS does indeed classify a small proportion of its investments in oil and gas companies as providing climate solutions, confirmed Peter Cashion, managing investment director for sustainable investments, speaking during the investor’s mid-March board meeting.

Specific business lines at these companies amount to $67 million worth of investments in activities that qualify as climate solutions like developing green biodiesel, carbon capture technology and sustainable aviation fuel.

CalPERS measures portfolio companies’ green business activity using a taxonomy that tracks climate solution investments across three categories – mitigation, adaptation and transition. Under the transition umbrella, Cashion said it is possible for high emitting companies in hard to abate sectors to qualify as providing a climate solution if they have transition strategies that support pro-climate activities.

Using this approach, CalPERS values 1 per cent of its $234 million Saudi Aramco holding as a climate solution, for example. Elsewhere the investor classes its $12.6 million investment in Indian coal giant Adani Group’s Green Energy subsidiary as a climate solution.

CalPERS uses a variety of globally recognised data providers to measure companies’ green activity including Financial Times Stock Exchange, HSBC and MSCI and Blomberg. The CalPERS team have sought out best practices supported by the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

Cashion said the allocation reflects CalPERS belief that “a green asset is a green asset regardless of corporate ownership” whereby even if a green asset sits on the balance sheet of an oil producer, it is still viewed as green.

He also reiterated the importance CalPERS places on engaging with oil and gas companies to promote sustainability at these corporations. Witness how CalPERS $5 billion allocation to a Climate Transition Index underweights oil and gas companies with no transition plan.

Frost said that CalPERS’ approach to assessing climate solutions has been iterative in a reflection of the emergence of best practices and additional data. “We wish things were easier. CalPERS has long supported clarity and consistency in climate investing definitions. We reject any suggestion that our methodology wasn’t well researched or independently authenticated,” she stated.

She also reiterated why CalPERS does not support climate divestment, something she called a “a symbolic act that not only ignores the value of climate transformations and investor engagement, but a possible breach of our fiduciary duty as required under the California Constitution.”

Her response underscores the challenges investors face balancing financial returns with their climate commitments. CalPERS believes that its influence can push polluting companies toward greener practices and support funding clean energy technologies. Yet transition progress is slow – and remaining invested is an essential return stream for CalPERS 2 million beneficiaries.

California Common Good also called for more details on the private equity, private debt, infrastructure and real estate holdings CalPERS classifies as climate solutions. The lobby group said this was particularly important given CalPERS has announced plans to increase private holdings to 40 per cent of its portfolio.",https://media.top1000funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MF_B7164.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:07.452987

However, many airlines have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, reported Reuters.

The report found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of their revenue or budget allocation to SAF, indicating that high production costs and fuel prices remain major challenges to adoption.

“We are going in the positive direction, but clearly not at the speed we need,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada told Reuters, talking about his executives at about 200 aviation-related companies.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel and we see that trend very clearly, there is slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” added Losada.

While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.

A Roadmap for Collaboration Achieving 2030 SAF targets will require overcoming key adoption challenges through ecosystem-wide collaboration.","Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have massive potential to decarbonize the commercial aviation industry, but most players can do more to capture that opportunity. Despite rapid growth in SAF production over the past few years, the industry is projected to fall short of its 2030 sustainability targets.

To identify the challenges and opportunities related to SAF adoption, we recently surveyed more than 500 executives at approximately 200 companies across the global aviation ecosystem. Our sample included aircraft and engine OEMs, system and component manufacturers, airlines, lessors, and SAF project developers—the majority from North America and Western Europe but covering other regions as well. Among the key findings:

Roughly two-thirds of companies across the value chain are taking a measured approach to SAF, and most anticipate being an observer, rather than a market leader, by 2030, signaling a need for greater ambition.

Aircraft OEMs and project developers are investing a higher share of revenue to develop the SAF market, with airlines and lessors investing less.

Eighty percent of companies say they are confident they can achieve their 2030 targets, but only 14% feel well-prepared to overcome challenges along the way.

The lack of a clear business case for expanding use of SAF is the biggest barrier to investment.

Critically, the results also point to specific recommendations for stakeholders across the aviation value chain to make faster progress on SAF adoption. A common thread is the need to create a virtuous cycle in which SAF supply increases demand and vice versa. Decarbonizing commercial aviation is a massive challenge; the industry is tightly integrated and currently oriented around fossil fuels, and no individual segment wants to take the lead on SAFs without knowing that others will join them. Success will require coordination among many moving parts in the aviation ecosystem. By working together, all participants can create a stronger business case for future investment in SAFs, and ultimately for cleaner skies.

Strong Growth in SAF Production—But More Is Needed

In relative terms, SAF production is growing fast. Over the past three years, supply has increased 1,150% worldwide. (See Exhibit 1.) This remarkable surge has been driven by supportive policy frameworks, expanding corporate commitments, and early investments among early adopters, signaling a strong push to decarbonize aviation.

In absolute terms, however, the picture looks different. The dramatic increase in supply occurred against a very small base. SAF represented just 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and new production capacity is slowing. Project announcements for new SAF facilities declined 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023, due primarily to economic uncertainty and higher energy and operating costs that squeezed company margins. (See Exhibit 2.)

While there is some renewed momentum in 2024 and 2025, commercial aviation faces a real risk that it will fall short of decarbonization goals.The industry had set a 2030 SAF production target as part of the sector’s broader effort to limit global warming to 2°C above preindustrial levels, and currently it will fall short of that target for the two main types of sustainable aviation fuels.

Bio-SAF (produced from natural oils or biomass) has emerged as the preferred technology for many market players due to its relative maturity, lower costs, and quicker deployment timelines. However, supplies of bio-SAF are projected to fall 30% short of 2030 targets.

e-SAF (produced from a thermochemical process involving carbon and hydrogen) is potentially more transformative, but also more complex and costly to produce, with technologies at earlier stages of maturity. Supplies of e-SAF are projected to fall 45% short of 2030 targets.

This shortfall is compounded by the sluggish pace of project approvals, with fewer than 30% of SAF initiatives reaching a final investment decision (FID). Given that facilities typically take three to five years after being funded to start producing at-scale, the risk of failing to meet 2030 targets is mounting.

Global economic uncertainty has further compounded these challenges, pushing companies to prioritize cost management and supply chain resilience over long-term investments in sustainability. Legislative delays have also hindered progress. In the European Union, for example, final SAF eligibility criteria under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative and clarifying implementation timelines were delayed, slowing new project announcements. These setbacks have raised concerns about the reliability of regulatory-driven demand.

Key Survey Results

The results of our survey indicate substantial levels of uncertainty and hesitancy among industry leaders, presenting challenges to reaching 2030 targets. Respondents also see carbon pricing playing a role in the transition to SAF.

Investment levels have been uneven, with no clear market orchestrator.

Overall, about half of commercial aviation players now allocate more than 4% of their revenue or budget allocations to SAF investments. But some segments are ahead of others. Project developers and aircraft and engine manufacturers have led the charge, channeling significant resources to develop the market. (See “Aircraft OEMs Are at the Forefront of SAF Adoption.”) In contrast, airlines and airports, constrained by tighter financial margins, have invested just 1% to 3%, often prioritizing aircraft fleet renewal over riskier SAF projects. (See Exhibit 3.)

Most of the industry is in “wait and see” mode.

Among respondents, about two-thirds say they are interested in SAFs but waiting for the market to take off. (See Exhibit 4.) More alarming, a similar share anticipates being an observer in the SAF ecosystem in 2030. Only a small subset of players has shown active leadership, and this trend is unlikely to shift without significant incentives or mandates. The lack of bold, coordinated action risks exacerbating the current shortfall, leaving the industry reliant on reactive responses to regulatory changes.

Individual organizations may not realize the scope of the challenge ahead.

Our results also show a stark gap between confidence levels about sustainability and preparedness to meet those goals. Among respondents, 80% of companies are confident that they can achieve their 2030 SAF objectives. Yet only 14% feel well-prepared to overcome challenges along the way. Airports and lessors are particularly lagging, with just 6% and 0% readiness, respectively. (See Exhibit 5.) This lack of preparedness among key stakeholders threatens to undermine the industry’s ability to close the SAF supply gap and meet decarbonization goals.

The lack of a clear business case is a major obstacle to greater investment.

Production costs and fuel prices remain the top obstacles, cited by 52% of SAF producers1 1 SAF producers include SAF project developers, energy companies, and banks and financing companies. and 49% of off-takers.2 2 SAF off-takers include manufacturers (OEMs, system and component suppliers, military), passenger airlines, air-freight players, airports, and lessors. The result is a vicious cycle: Limited supply keeps prices high, which in turn dampens voluntary demand and willingness-to-pay, undermines the business case for SAF, restricts supply development, and delays the critical learning needed to reduce costs.

A related challenge is that developers face difficulties securing financing for SAF projects due to the reliance on non-binding memoranda of understanding (MoUs) rather than binding, long-term off-take agreements. Current technology cost curves suggest that the cost premium for SAF over conventional A1 jet fuel may persist well beyond 2030, perpetuating the cycle of limited adoption, constrained investment, and delayed scaling of SAF technologies.

Industry players say that carbon pricing could spur adoption.

Outside of regulatory mandates, the industry sees carbon-pricing as a potential solution. By placing a financial cost on the externalities of fossil fuels, carbon pricing schemes could reset the economics of SAF versus conventional jet fuel, making SAF investments far more attractive. Considering other industries that are already under carbon pricing schemes and the potential industry-wide development of this mechanism for airlines, carbon pricing could stimulate voluntary demand for SAF by aligning economic incentives with sustainability goals, creating a more robust foundation for long-term investment.

SAF Is Ready to Take Off

Despite the challenges highlighted in our survey, the long-term momentum for structural change in the aviation industry remains strong. European regulators set the first tranche of SAF mandates at the beginning of 2025. As interest rates stabilize and inflation normalizes, product costs will decrease. Additionally, substantial policy momentum is building, with key legislative frameworks finalized in 2024 across Europe, North America, and South Asia.

In the European Union, the Renewable Energy Directive has clarified criteria for certain types of renewable fuels, while the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requires companies to establish robust climate transition plans.

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act, passed in May 2024, introduces enhanced funding and policy measures to support SAF infrastructure and research.

These developments can accelerate the aviation industry’s decarbonization journey by improving market liquidity and boosting investor confidence. But industry stakeholders must also take action to capitalize on improving market conditions.

A Roadmap for Collaboration

Achieving 2030 SAF targets will require overcoming key adoption challenges through ecosystem-wide collaboration. Unlike other industries like steel, where fierce competition often hinders collaboration, the commercial aviation sector’s integrated structure offers a unique opportunity to drive transformational change through collective action.

Specifically, greater SAF adoption requires creating a virtuous circle between supply and demand. Stronger and more predictable demand for SAF will improve the business case for project developers and financiers to invest in new facilities, thus increasing supply and advancing production technologies. As supply goes up, pricing comes down, which will further stimulate demand.

To create this dynamic, stakeholders in commercial aviation should focus on four catalytic, collective actions—two focused on demand and two addressing supply. Together, these actions can have an impact far exceeding what any individual player could achieve on its own.

Demand side: Aggregate demand.

Long-term, firm demand is essential to de-risk projects, attract investment, and increase production capacity. Mandates will help. The industry needs a full-fledged marketplace that can consolidate demand across a wide range of players to send strong demand signals to improve investor confidence and accelerate project timelines. Unlike supply-side factors, aggregating demand is less capital-intensive but plays a crucial role in creating the virtuous circle. Notable examples include:

Airbus's “book and claim” initiative gives aircraft and helicopter operators with limited SAF access the ability to buy SAF certificates through a centralized registry.

United Airlines’ Eco-Skies Alliance, which pools demand from over 30 global corporations (primarily corporate travel customers), enables the airline to secure more favorable SAF offtake terms and improve supply reliability.

While these programs are noteworthy, they are also relatively small-scale—serving primarily as a proof of concept and a foundation for more ambitious measures that can help the industry achieve critical mass.

Demand side: Set industry-wide standards for SAF markets.

The nascent stage of the SAF market entails fragmented, peer-to-peer transactions. Standardized frameworks can set consistent standards for SAF—including eligibility, contracting, and trading—leading to a transparent, liquid, scalable market.

Standards should also set clear criteria for SAF pathways, feedstocks, and decarbonization potential.

The adoption of common contracting schemes, trading practices, and indexes will simplify deal-making and enhance market liquidity, creating a more attractive environment for investors.

Supply side: Scale SAF projects.

To scale SAF production effectively, industry players must collaborate through consortiums that optimize capex and leverage economies of scale through mega-production facilities. In bio-SAF, numerous jumbo projects have already been announced, notably by Cepsa, Chevron, bp, DG Fuels, and truAlt alongside consortium partners—each targeting an output of several hundred (or even a million) kilotons of production. At the same time, bio-SAF is also more technologically mature, meaning that the cost-reduction potential through scale is lower.

In e-SAF, lower technology maturity and higher risk mean that most announcements have been for smaller projects, each producing a few tens of kilotons per year. Ramping up to bigger projects will require large consortiums bound by joint risk-sharing initiatives that can develop projects on time, achieve economies of scale, advance along the cost curve, and spur greater demand. Executing this kind of project will require a lineup of highly motivated and skilled partners to mitigate risks at every step, along with providing the capital needed.

The need for a bold vision in terms of e-SAF is growing, given that European mandates will require e-SAF as part of the overall jet fuel mix by 2030. Boeing is a good example. The company recently signed a strategic partnership with European provider Norsk e-Fuel to develop one of the continent’s first industrial-scale facilities to produce e-SAF.

Supply side: Collaborate on SAF innovation beyond 2030.

As the market continues to grow beyond 2030, the commercial aviation sector must secure access to breakthrough technologies to sustain momentum, reduce costs, and meet escalating demand. Advancing underfunded areas, particularly e-SAF, will be crucial to scaling non-biomass-constrained, high-performing fuels that align with stricter decarbonization mandates. For example, breakthrough innovations such as advanced carbon capture technologies or methanol-to-jet pathways to produce e-SAF hold the potential to push the cost of SAF closer to that of fossil fuels.

Across all four catalytic actions, success requires that some entity take a leading role in orchestration. Although this could fall to multiple segments in the commercial aviation value chain, we believe that aircraft and engine OEMs are potentially the most likely candidates, as they have the size, financial strength, and credibility that some airlines may not currently have. In addition, they have strong relationships across the value chain (for example, dealing directly with airlines in ways that project developers do not).",https://web-assets.bcg.com/dims4/default/39b2500/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2880x1512+0+54/resize/1200x630!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fboston-consulting-group-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2F08%2F27ca4fc44e76915f2793f77d1d6b%2Fsustainable-aviation-fuel-needs-faster-takeoff-rectangle.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:33.962705

Airbus is taking an important step toward promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by testing a “book and claim” approach. This initiative aims to increase both supply and demand for SAF worldwide and offers a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

SAF: Introduction to the Book and Claim Model

Airbus has introduced a process that allows buyers to “book” a specific amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reductions, even if the fuel is used for other purposes. This innovative model is intended to increase the accessibility of SAF, particularly for customers with limited quantities and distant delivery points.

Collaboration and support from the industry

The first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by other companies such as AerCap and Comlux. These partners have expressed interest in collaborating, underscoring the broad industrial ambition to increase the adoption of SAF. Airbus acts as a facilitator by acquiring SAF certificates and managing the associated sustainability attributes.

Objectives of the pilot program

The pilot program, which runs until 2025, is intended to provide crucial insights into the capacity and reliability of this mechanism. Airbus expects these tests to explore and foster market demand for third-party support of integrated SAF solutions. The company plans to use the results to further advance the adoption of this model in voluntary and regulated markets.

Access to SAF: Benefits for smaller operators and the markets

Many smaller operators face challenges accessing SAF, depending on the quantity required. Through this initiative, Airbus aims to simplify the process for operators and mitigate risk for SAF suppliers by securing financing for the certificates upfront. This allows for greater flexibility and supports short-term demand for SAF.",https://www.luftfahrtmagazin.de/lfm/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/airbus_saf_1.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:49.403206

(Reuters) – The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry is falling short of its 2030 targets with production not ramping up quickly enough, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found in a report published on Thursday.

European airlines are this year expected to meet a mandate of 2% SAF use in their jet fuel, with that set to rise to 6% by 2030. But many have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

The report found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of revenue or budget allocation to SAF, with high production costs and fuel prices remaining the major challenges to adoption.

“We are going in the positive direction, but clearly not at the speed we need,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada said of his findings in the co-authored report that surveyed more than 500 executives at about 200 aviation-related companies.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel, and we see that trend very clearly, there is a slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” Losada said.

Reuters reported last month that low consumption and a lack of policy guidance have led to delays of some SAF projects in China.

While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.

BCG’s report highlights that while SAF supply increased 1,150% worldwide over the last three years, announcements for new production facilities fell by 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023.

BCG says this was largely due to economic uncertainty and higher energy and operating costs.

It now projects supply to fall 30% to 45% short of commercial aviation’s 2030 targets.

Losada said many industry participants had adopted a mentality of “others will solve the problems for me”, and he called for cross-industry collaboration.

The project aims to establish a fully-integrated Ethanol to Jet (EtJ) facility that converts bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite into 100% SAF, using proprietary PureSAFSM technology supplied from KBR, while also generating all of the project’s energy requirements from renewable sources. This unique vertically integrated and energy self-sufficient approach sets it apart from other SAF and EtJ projects globally.

The facility is expected to produce up to 96 million litres of SAF annually which will be supplied to nearby airports. Early modelling indicates a potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 70 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.[1]

For the airlines, this project aligns with the broader Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways in October 2024. The MoU cemented their intent to collaborate on sustainability initiatives that aim to reduce carbon emissions in air travel, and advance the use of SAF and Low Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) in Australia.

In further encouraging support from the broader aviation ecosystem, The Boeing Company (TBC) has endorsed the project through a positive letter of support to RDA and in which TBC outlines its commitment to collaborate in a number of areas, including policy advocacy and the contribution of technical expertise, where relevant.[2]

The project, currently in pre-final investment decision stage, aims to deliver SAF from early 2029.

To receive the funds, however, applicants will be required to remove “harmful DEIA and “far-left climate features” from project proposals.

According to the USDA, funding recipients will have 30 days to review and voluntarily revise their project plans to align with President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order issued on Jan. 20, 2025. The agency said the the revision process will give applicants “the opportunity to refocus their projects on expanding American energy production while eliminating Biden-era [diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA)] and climate mandates embedded in previous proposals.” USDA Rural Development will individually inform awardees about the revision requirement. Respondents will also be asked to answer several questions and provide a short narrative description of any proposed changes.

The USDA said the “updated guidance reflects a broader shift away from the Green New Deal and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and toward practical energy investments that prioritize the needs of rural communities.”

The Unleashing American Energy Executive Order directed all federal agencies terminate the “Green New Deal” by immediately pausing the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and review whether those disbursements are in line policy guidelines outlined by the Trump administration. Within 90 days, the heads of each federal agency were to submit a report to the National Economic Council and the White House Office of Management and Budget detailing the findings of their reviews. The impacted IRA funds would be eligible for disbursement only after the OMB director and assistant to the president for economic policy determined that such disbursements are consistent with the administration’s goals.

This electric Tri-Converter demonstration has a capacity that is more than 50 times larger than the previously demonstrated pilot plant. The results represent a breakthrough for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The electric Tri-Converter converts waste carbon feedstocks into the syngas that supplies the downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) unit in the Aether Aurora process. The purpose of the demo was to prove that the electric Tri-Converter can continuously produce syngas at an increasingly larger scale using a mix of real-world feedstocks, including biogenic CO2, renewable natural gas (RNG), and green hydrogen. The program is part of Aether’s program to build and operate a fully integrated demonstration plant (the “Demo Plant”) producing more than one barrel per day of sustainable fuels. Aether plans to complete the construction of the Demo Plant later this year.

The demonstrator is a joint project between Aether and GTI Energy. Aether Aurora integrates technology elements first developed by GTI Energy in a gas-to-liquids program, which is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Aether has licensed the relevant technologies from GTI Energy and leverages the laboratory and demonstration spaces at its Chicago-area campus. Aether has subsequently taken over responsibility for future Aether Aurora development and commercialization, including expanding its R&D team.

The results of the demonstrator validate that the electric Tri-Converter is ready for

integration into the Demo Plant. More critically, they demonstrate the solution’s capability

to use a wide range of abundant feedstocks to create sustainable fuels—a breakthrough

that can potentially shatter a key barrier to scaling production.

This milestone was celebrated yesterday at the Aether and GTI Energy demonstrator site

where Aether investors and feedstock executives joined federal, state and local officials to

view the technology, meet the team, tour Aether’s R&D center and GTI Energy lab spaces,

and learn how the innovations will accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels. State

Senator Laura Murphy (IL-28th) was on hand to deliver opening remarks.

The Syngas Generation Engine for Next-Gen Sustainable Fuels

Aether Aurora optimizes the well-established FT process to create drop-in liquid hydrocarbons leveraging its novel electric Tri-Converter and Upgrading technologies. As the solution’s “syngas generation engine”, the electric Tri-Converter improves and streamlines the process where feedstocks and the internally recycled downstream byproducts are converted into syngas. This is achieved via novel catalysts and a reactor that uses electricity instead of combustion to generate the reaction heat. Where typical syngas production requires multiple reactors to convert the same mix of inputs, Aether Aurora employs just one. The streamlined equipment configuration reduces CAPEX while the electrification innovations generate higher energy efficiency and yields than a conventional combustion reactor.

Aether’s demonstrator is supported by suppliers that include bp for RNG, Invenergy for clean hydrogen production, and Certarus Ltd for low carbon energy supply and logistics.

State Senator Murphy remarked, “The road to the future is paved in sustainable practices, and GTI Energy and Aether Fuels are at the forefront of this future. They are leading the way in developing energy solutions that will transform how we power industries, transportation and everyday life. Their innovation not only drives us forward, it drives economic growth that supports every hardworking Illinoisan.”

Aether CEO, Conor Madigan, said, “This is an exciting milestone for Aether and a tribute to our R&D experts and our partners at GTI Energy. The aviation and ocean shipping industries need affordable sustainable fuels at scale and the electric Tri-Converter technology is a transformative step forward. It drives critical process simplification and enables cost-efficient feedstock flexibility. When integrated into our Aether Aurora solution we’re making SAF production more scalable and cost effective.”

GTI Energy’s VP of Carbon Management and Conversion, Don Stevenson, said, “GTI Energy has a long history of pioneering advanced energy solutions, and we’re proud to see technologies incubated in our labs being integrated into solutions for scaling low-emission fuels. Through collaboration with DOE and companies like Aether Fuels, GTI Energy helps unlock the potential of waste carbon streams while creating economically viable fuels solutions for industries.”

Elie Fayad, Aether’s senior director of R&D, noted, ""Today’s milestone represents nearly a decade of dedicated innovation and significant R&D investment by GTI Energy and Aether Fuels. The electric Tri-Converter is one of the breakthroughs in our Aether Aurora solution that drastically improves SAF economics and brings large-scale deployment within reach.”

Airbus is taking a significant step toward the large-scale adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) by piloting a new ""Book and Claim"" approach. This initiative seeks to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, offering a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate its adoption.

The first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intent to increase SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim system allows the buyer to ""reserve"" a certain amount of SAF and ""claim"" the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot program running through 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, especially those with limited volumes and those far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) registry, a recognized sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and

helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot program is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in third-party facilitation of these integrated SAF solutions.

2. Hydrogen aircraft technologies:

During the Airbus Summit 2025, Airbus presented an updated roadmap for leading the future of commercial aviation in the coming decades, outlining plans for a next-generation single-aisle aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030s, as well as revising its

Project ZEROe plan to mature technologies associated with hydrogen-powered flight.

At the event, Airbus reiterated its commitment to bringing a commercially viable hydrogen aircraft to market and presented some of the key technological elements that will enable the arrival of a fully electric, fuel-cell-powered commercial aircraft, a path that is emerging as the most promising after years of research into hydrogen aviation.

Bruno Fichefeux, Head of Future Programs at Airbus, said: “Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonizing aviation. While we have adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we have seen in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the long-term potential to revolutionize air travel for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

These technologies were presented as part of a new theoretical hydrogen aircraft concept powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion motors, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel cell systems will be fueled by two liquid hydrogen tanks. This concept will continue to be refined in the coming years as additional testing helps mature the technologies associated with hydrogen storage and distribution, as well as the propulsion systems.

3. Advances in the next generation of single-aisle aircraft:

Airbus also presented an updated roadmap for leading the future of commercial aviation in the coming decades. The company presented potential technological building blocks for preparing a next-generation single-aisle aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030s, as well as its updated roadmap for maturing technologies associated with hydrogen-powered flight.

Airbus today previewed details of the key technological components that could enable the entry into service of a next-generation single-aisle aircraft, with an expected 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared to the current generation, as well as the ability to fly on up to 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus also unveiled new design concepts for the different configurations being studied for this future aircraft, highlighting the various potential solutions being explored to achieve this significant leap forward in aircraft efficiency and support the aviation sector's roadmap towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Technologies include more efficient engines, with innovative open-fan designs; long, folding wings that enable significant aerodynamic improvements; next-generation batteries to enable hybrid architectures in which electricity is increasingly used to support both propulsion and non-propulsion functions onboard the aircraft; and lightweight materials and integrated systems for a connected aircraft.

Last year, Aether Fuels announced a partnership with Illinois-based GTI Energy to work together to commercialize, scale and produce sustainable fuels from low-value waste streams like feedstock.
The location of Aether Fuels' next scaled-up manufacturing plant is still under consideration.
Incentives and other support offered, or a lack there of, will likely play a role in Aether Fuels' ultimate decision.
Government support has helped Aether Fuels get to this point.","Conor Madigan, founder and CEO of Chicago climate-tech company Aether Fuels, thinks the United States could — and should — be a leader in sustainable aviation fuel manufacturing, but first it has to get the policy right.

""We can make it a great manufacturing opportunity for the U.S., where we build plants [and] create jobs, not only at the factories but also to source all the feedstocks — something which disproportionately benefits rural communities,"" he told Chicago Inno at a media event this week. ""It's a great opportunity. The key to it, though, is that you have to have the best manufacturing technology because it's a commodity product. It's not like 'My SAF is better than your SAF.'""

Becoming an industry leader is going to be all about which companies — and the countries they operate out of — have the best technology to develop the cheapest and most efficient manufacturing plants, he added.

And right now, supporting local technological innovation in certain industries such as climate tech does not appear to be as big of a national priority for the current administration. Threats to national scientific funding sources have left some researchers and tech startups in the sector facing funding uncertainty.

Established in 2022 as a spinout of Xora Innovation, a Singapore-based early-stage deep-tech venture firm, Aether Fuels is working on technology that is considered a potential breakthrough for SAF production by converting waste into fuel. Last year, Aether Fuels announced a partnership with Illinois-based GTI Energy to work together to commercialize, scale and produce sustainable fuels from low-value waste streams like feedstock. The climate-tech startup announced a $34 million Series A raise in 2024.

Aether Fuels celebrated an important milestone on Tuesday, unveiling a new research-and-development center near Chicago O'Hare International Airport where it will look to scale-up SAF production. At the event, Madigan demonstrated for investors and other company stakeholders the company's electric tri-converter technology, which Madgian thinks has the potential to transform the sustainable fuels industry by accelerating large-scale deployment.

Aether Fuels plans to complete the construction of a demo plant later this year. After that, the company will look to continue to scale up in 2025.

What's next for Aether Fuels and why national policy will play a role

Madigan anticipates that by the end of the year, Aether Fuels will be announcing the location of its first commercial plant that will have the capacity produce more than 50 barrels per day.

The company's current pilot plant at GTI Energy's corporate campus in Des Plaines can produce 1.5 gallons per day — a fraction of a barrel, which in the U.S. oil industry is defined as 42 gallons. The demo plant at the same campus, which is slated to be operational this year, will push that to more than a barrel per day.

The location of Aether Fuels' next scaled-up manufacturing plant is still under consideration.

""Right now we're identifying candidate sites, talking to feedstock suppliers, off-takers [buyers] and strategic partners to assemble our top two, three [or] four options,"" he told Chicago Inno. ""By the end of the year, we will have selected and announced where that first commercial plant will be that we want to be in commercial operation by 2028.""

While Madigan is keeping his cards close to his chest right now on where the company might be looking, he did say Aether Fuels is considering sites both in the U.S. and internationally. Aether Fuels has offices in Chicago and Singapore.

""Our strategy definitely has a big focus here in the U.S., but we also have quite a focus in Southeast Asia,"" he said.

Incentives and other support offered, or a lack there of, will likely play a role in Aether Fuels' ultimate decision. Government support has helped Aether Fuels get to this point. The company's joint project with GTI Energy has been aided by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, including funding through the Bioenergy Technologies Office.

""It definitely accelerated that project by two years for us to be able to get it to that scale so right off the bat we were way ahead of the game than a peer company that may not have had access to that kind of funding,"" Madigan said.

Still, Madigan knows government grant funding is always ""inherently unpredictable,"" and the company is prepared to push forward with or without new grant opportunities. However, he worries that if grant programs designed to incentivize commercial-scale facilities freeze, it could create a disincentive for a period of time to build commercial plants in the U.S., because companies like Aether Fuels may be able to get more support elsewhere.

Other countries like the U.K. and Japan have stricter SAF milestone objectives moving forward, with Japan aiming for 10% SAF use by 2030 and the U.K. requiring 2% of jet fuel to be SAF in 2025, increasing to 22% in 2040.

""This is a product where the majority of the demand is actually outside of the U.S. right now,"" Madigan explained. ""So while we're not the major consumer, what we can be is the biggest producer. This is a high-value product that people are desperate to get their hands on.""",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12949004/dsc04476*1200xx6000-3381-0-46.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 17:56:26.283452

Christchurch, NZ and Brisbane, Australia, 26 March 2025 – Stralis Aircraft, Fabrum and Ara Ake are collaborating to advance hydrogen-powered aviation by designing, developing and testing liquid-hydrogen storage tanks and a fuel system for Stralis aircraft. The partnership aims to enable Australasia’s first liquid-hydrogen-powered flight – and support the transition toward zero-emission aviation.

Australian company Stralis Aircraft, which develops high-performance, low-operating-cost hydrogen-electric propulsion systems, will integrate Fabrum’s tanks and fuel system into its aircraft. New Zealand company Fabrum, which specialises in zero-emission transition technology, will provide lightweight composite tanks and dispensing systems, essential enablers for hydrogen-powered aircraft. The project is supported by Ara Ake, New Zealand’s future energy centre, and aligns with Fabrum’s recently announced hydrogen testing facility at Christchurch International Airport.

Christopher Boyle, Managing Director of Fabrum, said:

Our hydrogen liquefier provides readily available liquid hydrogen onsite, allowing the capability to access the critical fuel source to prove and test the tanks and fuel system we are developing for Stralis and their fixed-wing fuel-cell electric aircraft,

“With Ara Ake support, we are excited to be delivering our light-weight composite tanks and fuel system for Stralis to advance the future of hydrogen-powered flight.”

The collaboration also aims to strengthen industry ties between New Zealand and Australia. The project will build expertise in liquid-hydrogen storage refuelling, and aircraft integration, contributing to New Zealand’s growing role in hydrogen aviation.

Cristiano Marantes, CEO of Ara Ake, said:

This project is a strong example of Ara Ake’s role in connecting leading organisations across countries to advance real-world clean energy solutions,

“By enabling this initiative, we’re supporting the first hydrogen-electric demonstration with liquid hydrogen and positioning New Zealand as a global testbed for sustainable aviation innovation.”

Stralis’ fuel-cell technology is significantly lighter than existing alternatives, potentially enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its hydrogen-electric propulsion systems with a team that has deep expertise in electric-aircraft development.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft, said:

This project is a significant step forward for Stralis as we test and refine our hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and build our liquid hydrogen capability,

“We look forward to advancing hydrogen-electric aviation and fostering new partnerships in New Zealand.”

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis of water using renewable electricity. With an energy density three times higher than sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and over 100 times greater than batteries, hydrogen can offer a credible alternative for aviation[1].

The support from Ara Ake has enabled Stralis and Fabrum to accelerate the development of this technology, with the goal of achieving Australasia’s first liquid-hydrogen-powered flight. This collaboration represents not just a technical milestone, but a pivotal step toward making zero-emission aviation a commercial reality in Australasia and beyond.

“Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market,” said Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removals.
As with other ‘Book and Claim’ initiatives, Airbus’ model allows operators to book a certain amount of SAF and claim the corresponding emissions reduction, no matter where the fuel is uplifted.
Challenges with Book and Claim While the Book and Claim approach offers a promising way to accelerate SAF adoption, it still comes with several challenges, one of which is regulatory uncertainty.
Educating stakeholders about how Book and Claim supports real emissions reduction will be key to the success of Airbus’ approach.","While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) isn’t currently widely available at most airports, Airbus hopes its Book and Claim approach will help broaden the adoption of SAF.

The airframe manufacturer’s initiative aims to increase both supply and demand for SAF globally by providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate its wider adoption across the industry. “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market,” said Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removals.

Facilitating SAF purchases

Airbus’ programme, which will see the OEM purchasing SAF certificates upfront and managing them through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) registry, has already gained industry support with SMBC Aviation Capital signing the first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup. While Airbus will acquire SAF certificates directly many other Book and Claim models rely on third-party brokers or carbon offset marketplaces to handle transactions.

As with other ‘Book and Claim’ initiatives, Airbus’ model allows operators to book a certain amount of SAF and claim the corresponding emissions reduction, no matter where the fuel is uplifted. The objective is to improve SAF accessibility for customers who are located far away from supply points or who require limited volumes. The challenge here is that the success of Book and Claim still depends on having enough SAF production in the first place.

Airbus is piloting its model throughout 2025 to help evaluate the viability of its Book and Claim system and assess market interest in third-party facilitation of SAF transactions. Airbus’ model is also designed to support smaller operators, including business aviation customers and helicopter operators as well as larger airlines.

“For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them,” explained Manhes.

Challenges with Book and Claim

While the Book and Claim approach offers a promising way to accelerate SAF adoption, it still comes with several challenges, one of which is regulatory uncertainty. Some governments and industry regulators do not yet recognise Book and Claim as a valid carbon reduction mechanism. In addition, SAF incentives and regulations vary across regions, creating inconsistencies in how Book and Claim is treated in carbon accounting and compliance methods. Customer perception is another hurdle with some airlines and customers still preferring to refuel with a physical supply of SAF over indirect credits, while others may be skeptical about using SAF certificates.

The new body will function as a centralised platform to foster collaboration across governments, airlines, manufacturers, fuel providers, and other key stakeholders.

Tackling one of aviation’s biggest challenges

CADO aims to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, advance zero-emission technologies, and establish global policy alignment to support the industry’s climate goals.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh said, “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.”

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour,”

The organisation’s mandate includes creating frameworks for financing green aviation projects, accelerating the certification of SAF and hydrogen technologies, and facilitating public-private partnerships to close the gap between ambition and action.

Why it matters now

The launch of CADO comes at a pivotal time for the aviation industry.

While passenger numbers are recovering post-pandemic, pressure is mounting from regulators, environmental groups, and travellers demanding more sustainable air travel.

Yet infrastructure gaps, supply limitations, and policy inconsistencies continue to slow momentum.

IATA hopes CADO will streamline international cooperation and drive policy incentives to accelerate decarbonisation efforts—particularly in developing economies and high-growth markets.

A regional opportunity for the Middle East

For the Middle East—a region home to some of the world’s fastest-growing airlines and aviation hubs—CADO presents a chance to shape the global conversation on green aviation.

With carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Saudia investing in next-generation fleets and exploring SAF partnerships, the region is poised to play a leading role in the transition.

The “Book and Claim” system allows aviation stakeholders to purchase SAF certificates, effectively claiming the associated emission reduction benefits, even if the physical SAF is utilized at a different location. This decoupling of physical fuel flow from emissions reduction claims is crucial for enabling smaller operators and those located far from SAF supply points to participate in decarbonization efforts.

The company has already garnered significant industry support, with SMBC Aviation Capital signing the first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Subsequently, AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup have also expressed their commitment to joining this collaborative initiative, signaling a strong industry-wide desire to accelerate SAF adoption.

The pilot program, scheduled throughout 2025, aims to provide vital insights into the functionality and scalability of the “Book and Claim” mechanism. It will assess the market's appetite for third-party facilitated SAF solutions and evaluate the robustness of the system in managing sustainability attributes.

Julien Manhes, Airbus head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, emphasized the significance of this initiative, stating, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

The challenges associated with SAF adoption are multifaceted, including limited production capacity, high costs, and logistical complexities related to distribution. By decoupling the physical flow of SAF from its environmental benefits, the ""Book and Claim"" system addresses these challenges, enabling broader participation in SAF usage.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-26 14:56:43.603411

The imported biofuel is now available at its facility at the Tom Jobim International Airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro.

With this move, Vibra becomes the first company to supply sustainable aviation fuel in the country.

SAF is a central component of the aviation sector’s strategy to reduce CO₂ emissions. Brazil is seen as a potential global player in SAF production given its expertise in ethanol. However, the country has yet to produce the fuel domestically.

The Galeão terminal facility recently obtained International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), ensuring sustainability tracking across the entire supply chain—from raw materials to bio-refinery production and final distribution at the airport via BR Aviation, Vibra’s aircraft fueling business unit.

Produced from renewable sources, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

First shipment from Belgium

In January, 23 iso-tank containers carrying approximately 550,000 liters of SAF departed from the Port of Antwerp in Belgium bound for Rio de Janeiro.

The SAF supplied by Vibra is derived from used cooking oil (UCO), one of the lowest-carbon-intensity feedstocks since it is a waste product.

Initially, the fuel will be blended at a 10% SAF to 90% conventional jet fuel ratio. Higher blend percentages, up to the internationally permitted limit of 50%, may be introduced in the future.

“We are ready to expand SAF availability in the Brazilian market, leveraging our infrastructure in over 90 airports and our expertise in delivering safe and competitive solutions,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s chief operating officer, in a statement.

Industry targets net-zero by 2050

According to projections from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production reached approximately 1.9 billion liters in 2024—three times the volume produced in 2023.

The fuel is a key component of the aviation sector’s goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, in 2024, SAF accounted for just 0.53% of the industry’s total fuel demand, highlighting the sector’s challenge in attracting investment and public policies to boost production.

Beyond limited availability, SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Depending on the region, its price can be more than five times higher. Vibra has not disclosed details about SAF pricing in Brazil.

Fuel costs currently represent about 30% of an airline’s operating expenses worldwide, rising to 40% in Brazil.

As America races toward a greener future, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has never been higher. Minnesota is seizing the opportunity to break into this emerging industry before the competition, leveraging its agricultural strength to kickstart a hub that could establish the state as a pioneer in SAF production.

The Minnesota SAF Hub, a coalition comprising the Greater MSP Partnership, Bank of America, Delta Air Lines, Ecolab, Xcel Energy and other stakeholders, is on a journey to develop a fully integrated SAF supply chain in Minnesota.

A “Demand Consortium” including Bank of America, Deloitte, Delta and Ecolab will purchase the first several million gallons of SAF each year, starting during the second half of 2025. Each participating company is providing funding to scale production, drive down costs, increase continued demand and reduce carbon emissions associated with their employee business travel.

“While Delta has committed to purchasing millions of gallons of SAF, there isn’t enough being produced today to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for a single week,” said Peter Carter, Delta’s executive vice president of external affairs, in September. “That’s why this blending facility is so important — it’s like hanging an ‘Open for Business’ sign to SAF producers to consider doing business in Minnesota, where we see SAF as a great opportunity for all players across the value chain.”

Plant-Powered Progress

Minnesota SAF Hub partners at the University of Minnesota Forever Green Initiative are also developing a novel crop called winter camelina seed, which can be used for various purposes, including producing oil for conversion into SAF. It has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores among the many feedstocks used for producing SAF today. Corn, soybeans, canola, continuous living cover crops, agricultural biomass, woody biomass, hydrogen, waste oils and fats are also used to produce SAF, all of which are available in Minnesota.

Cargill, an American multinational food corporation based in Minnetonka, is collaborating with the university on this project, expanding its active role in growing the Midwest’s supply of this versatile crop.

In 2023, Cargill worked with Minnesotan and North Dakotan farmers to plant 2,000 acres of winter camelina. In September 2024, the first 7,000-gallon shipment of blended SAF made from these crops arrived at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport fueling facility.

“This initial SAF delivery is another example of how we are making SAF real in Minnesota and showing the world how to do it right,” said Peter Frosch, president and CEO of the GREATER MSP Partnership. “We are highlighting the first SAF flight from MSP International as another major milestone in our push to build a SAF economy anchored in Minnesota. This ambitious effort is moving fast and gaining momentum due to the bold leadership of Minnesota SAF Hub partner organizations. The Minnesota SAF Hub is on track to create thousands of good jobs for Minnesotans by delivering a climate solution the nation and world urgently need.”

In January, through its Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the University of Minnesota $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand (OILSEED) project led by Mitchell Hunter, PhD, co-director of the university’s Forever Green Initiative. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture, U of M, Cargill and North Dakota State University are providing a combined $2.5 million in additional funds.

“Winter oilseed crops like camelina and pennycress have the potential to be adopted on millions of acres in our region in the coming years and decades,” Hunter said, citing a recent report that found widespread adoption of camelina, pennycress and other crops that provide over-winter cover could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23% and soil erosion by 35%. “The winter oilseeds can preserve topsoil, protect water quality, feed pollinators and, by producing low-carbon fuel, help fight climate change, all while giving farmers a new source of income.”

Sustainable Growth

While building a strong network from within is essential, the true test of a hub’s potential comes when a newcomer decides to join the club. Through initiatives such as the SAF Tax Credit, the coalition is actively working to bring producers of all sizes and varying feedstocks to the state. DG Fuels’ decision to locate a manufacturing facility in Moorhead, expected to generate $50 billion in economic impact, marked a major milestone for the Minnesota SAF Hub, cementing the state’s reputation as a rising leader in the industry.

Attracting a project of this magnitude will make significant headway in addressing the demand for SAF at MSP International Airport, which currently outstrips supply. DG Fuels expects this new facility to produce 193 million gallons of low CO2 lifecycle emission SAF each year, representing nearly half of the fuel used at the airport.

As of November, the Minnesota SAF Hub was working with DG Fuels and the City of Moorhead on the next set of requirements to advance this project, including aggregating feedstocks. DG Fuels’ manufacturing process uses cellulosic biomass in the form of lower-value agricultural by-products such as corn stover and timber waste as its feedstock. It also incorporates various forms of clean hydrogen feedstock to produce near-zero carbon fuel.

Accessible labor and logistics helped the company choose Moorhead, DF Fuels Chairman and CEO Michael Darcy told Site Selection’s Ron Starner in January. “We can rail aviation fuel to refineries in Minnesota to feed our customers at the airport. That is a barrier in the rest of the country. Minnesota helped us with the logistics.” The state also helped with attitude: “Having a proactive state is always a good thing for a project,” Darcy said. “Minnesota on its own worked out a deal to have SAF refined there. We wish more states did that.”

Located within the Red River Valley, Moorhead and its neighboring communities in Clay County are surrounded by some of the nation’s most fertile land, bolstering a thriving agricultural sector that provides a strong foundation for SAF production. In addition to this wealth of natural resources, Moorhead boasts Minnesota’s largest shovel-ready industrial park, the MCCARA Industrial Park, adding to the area’s attractiveness and growing business climate.

On Tuesday (March 25), we were excited to deliver the first of 99 F404-IN20 engines to our valued customer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft Mk 1A fight jet. It is an important milestone in our 40-year relationship with HAL and in our efforts to ensure a strong future for India’s military by developing next-generation fighters while enhancing the country’s defense manufacturing capabilities.

GE Aerospace has a strong history of military jet propulsion collaboration in India. After collaborating with the Aeronautical Development Agency in the 1980s, GE Aerospace’s F404-IN20 engine was selected for the single-engine Tejas in 2004. This was an important breakthrough for both India and GE Aerospace.

Our F404 engine family, one of the most successful in military aviation history, powers thousands of combat aircraft worldwide. The F404-IN20 engine is a tailored design for India’s single-engine fighter with the highest thrust within F404 family and a higher-flow fan, unique single-crystal turbine blades, and numerous special components. GE Aerospace and Tejas teams collaborated closely for several years to customize it for the needs of Indian Air Force. The F404 demonstrated it was an excellent fit for the Tejas LCA. On its first test flight in 2008, the aircraft climbed to numerous mission altitudes and achieved Mach 1.1 speed.

By 2016, GE Aerospace fulfilled its commitment to HAL and delivered 65 F404-IN20 engines for the Tejas LCA. With no additional engine orders on the horizon, the production line for F404-IN20 was shut down. However, when HAL ordered an additional 99 engines in 2021 for the Tejas Mk1A LCA, our team began the complex task of restarting the F404-IN20 production line, which had been dormant for five years, and re-engaging the engine’s global supply chain.

Restarting a jet engine production line is a challenging process. Restarting the F404-IN20 engine line during the COVID pandemic was even more challenging. With a high focus on safety and quality, and a remarkable commitment from our supply chain teams and our suppliers and partners, we have managed to restart the line. Our proprietary lean operating model, FLIGHT DECK, helped us alleviate bottlenecks and identify solutions to improve manufacturing processes and turnaround time. Today, we are working closely with our suppliers to ramp up production on parts and materials for the F404-IN20.

We will continue to work together with our suppliers to keep the production line efficient, maintain the highest standards of safety and quality, and deliver to our customer. This week’s first engine delivery is a testament to what we have accomplished with HAL over the past 40 years, and a symbol of our combined potential to ensure a strong future for India’s military.",https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/aerospace-1200x650-1.jpeg,N,,2025-03-26 12:57:23.323411

This electric Tri-Converter demonstration has a capacity that is more than 50 times larger than the previously demonstrated pilot plant. The results represent a breakthrough for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The electric Tri-Converter converts waste carbon feedstocks into the syngas that supplies the downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) unit in the Aether Aurora process. The purpose of the demo was to prove that the electric Tri-Converter can continuously produce syngas at an increasingly larger scale using a mix of real-world feedstocks, including biogenic CO2, renewable natural gas (RNG), and clean hydrogen. The program is part of Aether’s program to build and operate a fully integrated demonstration plant (the “Demo Plant”) producing more than one barrel per day of sustainable fuels. Aether plans to complete the construction of the Demo Plant later this year.

The demonstrator is a joint project between Aether and GTI Energy. Aether Aurora integrates technology elements first developed by GTI Energy in a gas-to-liquids program, which is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Aether has licensed the relevant technologies from GTI Energy and leverages the laboratory and demonstration spaces at its Chicago-area campus. Aether has subsequently taken over responsibility for future Aether Aurora development and commercialization, including expanding its R&D team.

The results of the demonstrator validate that the electric Tri-Converter is ready for integration into the Demo Plant. More critically, they demonstrate the solution’s capability to use a wide range of abundant feedstocks to create sustainable fuels—a breakthrough that can potentially shatter a key barrier to scaling production.

This milestone was celebrated yesterday at the Aether and GTI Energy demonstrator site where Aether investors and feedstock executives joined federal, state and local officials to view the technology, meet the team, tour Aether’s R&D center and GTI Energy lab spaces, and learn how the innovations will accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels. State Senator Laura Murphy (IL-28th) was on hand to deliver opening remarks.

The Syngas Generation Engine for Next-Gen Sustainable Fuels

Aether Aurora optimizes the well-established FT process to create drop-in liquid hydrocarbons leveraging its novel electric Tri-Converter and Upgrading technologies. As the solution’s “syngas generation engine”, the electric Tri-Converter improves and streamlines the process where feedstocks and the internally recycled downstream byproducts are converted into syngas. This is achieved via novel catalysts and a reactor that uses electricity instead of combustion to generate the reaction heat. Where typical syngas production requires multiple reactors to convert the same mix of inputs, Aether Aurora employs just one. The streamlined equipment configuration reduces CAPEX while the electrification innovations generate higher energy efficiency and yields than a conventional combustion reactor.

Aether’s demonstrator is supported by suppliers that include bp for RNG, Invenergy for clean hydrogen production, and Certarus Ltd for low carbon energy supply and logistics.

State Senator Murphy remarked: “The road to the future is paved in sustainable practices, and GTI Energy and Aether Fuels are at the forefront of this future. They are leading the way in developing energy solutions that will transform how we power industries, transportation and everyday life. Their innovation not only drives us forward, it drives economic growth that supports every hardworking Illinoisan.”

Aether CEO, Conor Madigan, said: “This is an exciting milestone for Aether and a tribute to our R&D experts and our partners at GTI Energy. The aviation and ocean shipping industries need affordable sustainable fuels at scale and the electric Tri-Converter technology is a transformative step forward.

,,2025-03-26 15:35:24+00:00,Deloitte,Sustainability Briefing: sustainable aviation fuels | Deloitte Germany,"Prof. Dr. Bernhard Lorentz, Ines Österle",,,,,https://www.deloitte.com/de/de/our-thinking/sustainability-briefings/sustainability-briefing-sustainable-aviation-fuels.html,"Aviation biofuels are projected to scale rapidly.
Synthetic aviation fuels (also known as e-kerosene) are not yet available on the market but production is projected to ramp up rapidly by 2040.
But its high production costs mean SAFs are not cost competitive with fossil kerosene, hindering its market uptake.
Building a competitive and sustainable aviation industry in the EU The mandatory fuel quota in place since January 1, 2025, has the EU aviation industry embarking on an ambitious journey towards a climate-neutral yet competitive future.
Major challenges include reducing the price gap and scaling SAF production in the EU and globally.","A net-zero aviation future requires large quantities of SAF

Global aviation accounts for around 2.5% of CO2 emissions.4 Strong growth in aviation demand is outpacing aircraft fuel efficiency, causing emissions to rise relentlessly.5

To reduce aviation-related emissions, SAFs offer a practical solution. Chemically similar to fossil kerosene,6 these drop-in fuels can be used in high proportions in existing aircraft, can be produced globally, and transported to demand centers using existing infrastructure. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the leading global industry body representing all actors across the aviation value chain, estimates that SAFs could drive 65% of the emission reduction needed to achieve the body’s net-zero emission goal by mid-century.7 The remaining emission reductions will be met by new aircraft technologies, continued improvement in air-traffic management and aircraft operations, and carbon capture and offsetting.8

Creating a net-zero aviation industry thus requires large-scale production and use of SAFs. Deloitte estimates that in a net-zero scenario, total production volumes of SAFs will need to reach 37 million tons by 2030 and 297 million tons by 2050. In the long-term, these volumes will consist of nearly equal shares of biofuel and synthetic fuel, the two main SAF categories (Figure 1).

Aviation biofuels are projected to scale rapidly. They are primarily produced from oils and fats using the so called HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) production pathway, which has long been in use, particularly for biodiesel production. Biofuels can also be produced from other renewable feedstocks, but various sectors compete for their deployment and feedstock is limited, throwing up a barrier to scale production.

Synthetic aviation fuels (also known as e-kerosene) are not yet available on the market but production is projected to ramp up rapidly by 2040. These fuels are produced from clean hydrogen and sustainably sourced carbon dioxide (CO2) (see box 1), and offer greater scalability than biofuels, since CO2 is more abundant than biogenic feedstocks.2

The EU sets ambitious quotas to enable scaling of the SAF market

SAFs represent a crucial decarbonization solution for the EU aviation industry to reach the Union’s goal of a 90% reduction of transport-related emissions by mid-century. But its high production costs mean SAFs are not cost competitive with fossil kerosene, hindering its market uptake. To move SAFs beyond their nascent market stage, the EU is stepping in with ambitious fuel quotas under the ReFuelEU aviation regulation (Figure 2). Starting January 1, 2025, aircraft fuel suppliers must comply with these quotas.

With fuel quotas set to reach 70% by 2050, the EU is taking the global lead in regulatory measures for establishing the SAF market. At the global level, key stakeholders recognize the importance of SAFs in reaching climate targets, and SAF mandates are already being planned and implemented in several countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Canada, Türkiye, and Indonesia.12 However, only the United Kingdom has introduced a fuel mandate that approaches the level of ambition of ReFuelEU aviation. On January 1, 2025, it implemented a mandatory SAF share that will rise to 16% by 2035, but only to 24% by 2050.13

A major barrier to market introduction is the high production cost of SAFs

The SAF mandate aims to accelerate the adoption of alternative fuels by ensuring a steady demand path within the EU, but high production costs remain a challenge for their uptake. In 2023, the average market price of HEFA SAF in the EU was EUR 2,768 per ton – 340% higher than the price of fossil kerosene.2 Based on these prices, the quota now in place is estimated to lead to a 5% increase in fuel cost.

While HEFA SAF will play a key role in meeting the quota in the coming years, synthetic fuels must be in use by 2030. A review of cost estimates in the literature shows that production costs are expected to decrease over time as production scales and technologies further mature. However, the cost of SAFs produced with CO2 from direct air capture (DAC) will still be 30% to 280% higher by 2050 compared with the price of conventional jet fuel in 2023 (Figure 3).14 SAFs produced with DAC are more expensive than those produced with CO2 from point sources such as industrial facilities. However, as decarbonization progresses, this CO2 source will become increasingly scarce.2

The main cost drivers of synthetic fuels are stringent energy requirements that lead to significant operating costs, followed by high capital expenditure. Financing costs further contribute to overall expense. Deloitte estimates that the cost of capital for solar power projects, such as those providing the renewable electricity needed to produce synthetic fuels, varies from 7% in Western Europe to about 18% in Sub-Saharan Africa.15 A key strategy for reducing the cost of the debt and equity and improving SAF bankability is to mitigate risk, including political, regulatory, technical, market, and financial risks.

Building a competitive and sustainable aviation industry in the EU

The mandatory fuel quota in place since January 1, 2025, has the EU aviation industry embarking on an ambitious journey towards a climate-neutral yet competitive future. Major challenges include reducing the price gap and scaling SAF production in the EU and globally.

Several instruments can help reduce costs and improve the bankability of SAF projects, one of which is offtake contracts. These are long-term purchase agreements (typically up to 20 years) with SAF producers that ensure stable revenue streams. Such contracts help mitigate price fluctuation and demand uncertainty, making it easier for producers to secure funding and scale production. For instance, the largest contract in 2024, measured in SAF volume,16 secures IAG’s European airlines a long-term supply of e-kerosene produced by Twelve in the US.17

Meanwhile, none of the planned European production of e-kerosene has yet passed final investment decision.18 The EU’s Clean Industrial Deal promises a window of opportunity, and the European Commission has announced a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan prioritizing short- and medium-term support for sustainable aviation fuels.3 Specific instruments to reduce the price gap for domestically produced synthetic fuels have been announced for the longer term.19

The journey to widespread SAF adoption is challenging, and strategic policy measures, innovative financing solutions, and long-term investment will play a crucial role in preparing sustainable aviation for take-off.

Bruno Fichefeux, Airbus Head of Future Programmes, said:

“Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonise aviation. While we’ve adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with that figure potentially rising dramatically over the coming decades if no action is taken. Several initiatives are being pursued in order to address the climate impact of the industry, typically involving efforts to improve aircraft efficiency, develop sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), or create aircraft utilizing low or zero carbon propulsion systems such as electric or hydrogen-based.

While many initiatives are currently targeting areas allowing for more rapid sector decarbonization, such as electrified propulsion or SAF, hydrogen is viewed by some in the industry as a more promising long-term solution, given its potential to be produced through carbon-free methods, and its energy attributes, containing significantly more energy per weight than jet fuel.

Airbus had previously announced a goal to develop the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035, stating that it had identified hydrogen as one of the most promising zero-emissions solutions, as it emits no carbon dioxide when generated from renewable energy, with water being its most significant by-products.

The company launched its ZEROe program in 2020, exploring the feasibility of hydrogen propulsion technologies, based on either hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. While not ruling out future investments into hydrogen combustion, Airbus said that it has selected hydrogen fuel cell technology as the propulsion method for its future aircraft, following the results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, which supported the viability of the technology.

The new aircraft will feature an electric propeller propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells that convert hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy through a chemical reaction, producing only water as a byproduct. The aircraft will be powered by four, 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system, and supplied by liquid hydrogen tanks.

Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, said:

“Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airbus-Hydrogen.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 10:56:29.949875

This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for sustainable aviation fuel worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase the adoption of alternative fuels.

Book and Claim approaches for adopting SAF use

In simple terms, the Book and Claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of sustainable aviation fuel and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and who are far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body.

These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, therefore stimulating the short-term demand for SAF.

Scaling up the market for alternative fuels

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative Book and Claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in the third-party facilitation of these integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, said: “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.

“For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to sustainable aviation fuel can be challenging, depending on the amount needed.

“Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and de-risk the process for operators and SAF suppliers by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them.

“This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate that Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

Further Airbus initiatives to achieve net zero

Airbus aligns with global and binding decarbonisation programmes, in addition to other market-based measures, to help cap the aviation industry’s CO2 emissions.

This supports and contributes to the industry-wide ambition to implement global market-based measures for the aviation industry.

The aviation industry, including Airbus, has committed to an industry-wide decarbonisation movement that includes the following key targets:",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2563538061-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 09:56:09.046433

The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations to minimise the environmental footprint of aviation.

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) to study the aviation sector's non-CO2 emissions with a focus on contrails.

Recent studies suggest that the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAFs.

The project will test a range of fuels under controlled conditions, with consistency in combustion parameters and hardware. Lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center will extend to full-aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse in France.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.

It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

The fantasy that the renowned author Jules Verne envisioned in his novel, The Mysterious Island, is close to becoming reality thanks to low-emission hydrogen, and particularly green hydrogen. This fuel created through the electrolysis of water (decomposition of the H2O molecule into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable energy sources could hold the key to the decarbonization of some sectors in which direct electrification is still very complicated, such as heavy transport or certain industrial processes.

Some of the biggest benefits of green hydrogen include its versatility, its low level of harmful emissions, and minimal waste. “Green hydrogen is a replacement for gray hydrogen (produced using natural gas and other polluting hydrocarbons) and greatly diminishes emissions compared to other options. Its use is crucial to the decarbonization of the steel sector, and other sectors that use natural gas or coal, such as the aluminum or cement industries. It also holds the key to the decarbonization of the shipping and steel sectors through the production of green methanol, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” explained the engineer Gotzon Gómez Sarasola, Head of Spain and Portugal for the Stegra Project. This Swedish startup is dedicated to the decarbonization of the economy, and has become one of the leading companies in the production of green hydrogen in Europe.

According to estimates in the European Union report Hydrogen Roadmap Europe: A sustainable pathway for the European Energy Transition, clean hydrogen could prevent 560 million tons of CO2 annually in Europe by 2050. The EU believes that it has the potential to generate around 2,250 TWh of hydrogen across all sectors, or one-fourth of Europe’s total energy demand. This energy could power approximately 42 million large cars, 1.7 million trucks, or more than 5,500 trains. It would also heat the equivalent of 52 million homes and cover up to 10% of energy demand for buildings. Furthermore, combining captured carbon or biomass with 120 TWh of hydrogen could produce synthetic feedstock for 40 million tons of chemical products by 2050.

This is one of the reasons that Brussels is one of the biggest defenders of this technology. The EU set a goal of producing 10 million tons by the end of this decade.

Challenges remain

However, several challenges must be overcome before it can be established as a real alternative to fossil fuels. At the moment, the high cost of this gas compared to the fuels it seeks to replace is one of the biggest obstacles. Gómez Sarasola stresses that financing for projects of this kind is conditioned by the high value of the so-called ‘green premium’, or the higher price consumers are willing to pay for a sustainable, but more expensive alternative compared to a cheaper, more polluting one. “Many green hydrogen production projects do not get off the ground due to a lack of buyers willing to assume this ‘green premium’ over gray hydrogen,” he warned.

Gómez Sarasola (Stegra): “Green hydrogen holds the key to the decarbonization of the shipping and steel sectors”

Rafael Cossent, a researcher at the Institute of Technological Research (IIT) of the ICAI School of Engineering at Comillas Pontifical University, is one of Spain’s leading experts in hydrogen. He currently co-directs the Chair of Hydrogen Studies at ICAI-ICADE, a prestigious educational institution linked to the University. The expert explains that the investments related to green hydrogen are high because they often entail also making adjustments to the equipment so they can use this fuel. “New engines, furnaces, and burners for industry are needed… It means developing supply structures and creating new facilities.”

Reducing investment costs is a priority, but the same applies to operating costs, this expert noted. “Cheaper electricity is needed, as well as reducing consumption per kilogram generated, improving the efficiency of electrolysis and enhancing plant design to optimize processes.”

Another issue that must be addressed is how to get this fuel to consumers. “Transportation in trucks is already a reality for small volumes and short distances, but establishing a large-scale open hydrogen network has to deal with uncertainty surrounding the development of sufficient demand”, Cossent argued.

Franz Bechtold (Lhyfe): “The massive adoption of renewable energy and government aid will both be key elements”

Franz Bechtold of Lhyfe, a pioneering business group that opened the world’s first green hydrogen production plant directly connected to a wind farm in 2021, pointed to other factors that are hindering the change. “The lack of infrastructure is blocking many projects and raising the final production cost of others.” The same goes for the absence of “clear administrative guidelines regarding what will occur in the future in terms of both emission taxes and other medium-term aid,” he warned.

Momentum in Europe

Despite these obstacles, the potential of this technology to decarbonize heavy industry means that green hydrogen projects are on the rise. Lhyfe, which is present in 11 European countries, is also developing projects in the Iberian Peninsula, such as the Vallmoll plant (Tarragona), and intends to weave a renewable hydrogen network throughout the country. Besides, Gómez Sarasola from Stegra confirms the potential of the Iberian Peninsula for the deployment of this technology: “Spain and Portugal are the only countries, apart from northern Scandinavia, that have the capacity to produce renewable electricity in large volumes and at a competitive price. The electricity grids of the two countries are expected to have 80-85% renewable energy by 2030,” he argues.

The European Hydrogen Bank —an initiative created by the European Union with the aim of promoting the renewable hydrogen market through subsidies for companies to cover the cost difference between renewable hydrogen and fossil fuels— recently completed a pilot auction for €720 million, benefiting seven projects: three in Spain, two in Portugal and the remaining two in Norway and France.

For Betchtold, “the massive adoption of renewable energy and government aid will both be key elements in order to make hydrogen one of the most viable solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Another factor that could accelerate this time frame, Gómez Sarasola added, is “reinforcing grid interconnections between generation plants and consumption projects.”",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bbva-sostenibilidad-ethic-hidrogeno-verde-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 11:56:28.414819

Along with a consortium of 10 European partners, PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) aims to bridge the gap in understanding aviation's non-CO2 emissions by testing a range of fuels under controlled conditions.

The project is expected to ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to full aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions. It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

Airbus said the project ‘will ultimately help define new fuel specifications aimed at reducing aviation’s climate and air quality impact while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable aeronautics.’

In a statement, Airbus CTO Sabine Klauke said: ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight. Through collaborative science-based approaches and innovative technologies, we're committed to minimising these effects while maintaining operational efficiency.

“The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions.

,,2025-03-26 09:00:20+00:00,I by IMD,"People, Culture, and Strategy: The Board's role in transformation - IMD Business School","Jay Clark, Chair of its People, Remuneration Committee, People & Culture, the University of Oxford",,,,,https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/governance/people-culture-and-strategy-the-boards-role-in-transformation/,"This was a comprehensive strategic shift that required the organization to fundamentally rethink its structure, its culture, and its talent pipeline.
As Executive Vice President of HR, Hannele Jakosuo-Jansson knew she would have a critical role to play in aligning the company’s policies, leadership development, and talent strategy with its new direction.
Key enablers of transformation: culture and people When a company undergoes a major transformation or shift in its strategy, it is crucial to bring organizational culture and key people-related issues into close alignment with the evolving strategy.
As Jakosuo-Jansson puts it: “Culture and people are the key enablers of transformation.” The board of directors plays a critical role in this process.
I have witnessed executives coming from completely different industries who haven’t focused enough on the company culture and business complexity.","Back in 2006, Neste made a big decision. After 75 years in oil and gas, the company opted to make the transition to renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, a move that would position it globally as a future leader in the renewable fuel sector.

The shift to renewables wasn’t simply about Neste adopting new technologies or entering new markets. This was a comprehensive strategic shift that required the organization to fundamentally rethink its structure, its culture, and its talent pipeline.

Big questions arose, among them: what capabilities were they going to need to make this transition successfully? How would culture and talent management have to evolve? And did they have the right people in situ to successfully execute the new strategy?

As Executive Vice President of HR, Hannele Jakosuo-Jansson knew she would have a critical role to play in aligning the company’s policies, leadership development, and talent strategy with its new direction.

From the outset, hers was an approach grounded in open communication and unwavering integrity, together with the ability to accurately assess leadership quality and capabilities, while simultaneously managing sensitive interactions and discussions.

Key enablers of transformation: culture and people

When a company undergoes a major transformation or shift in its strategy, it is crucial to bring organizational culture and key people-related issues into close alignment with the evolving strategy. As Jakosuo-Jansson puts it: “Culture and people are the key enablers of transformation.”

The board of directors plays a critical role in this process.

While boards must avoid getting into management’s operational responsibility, they instead have a very important role in promoting a strong and resilient culture, and in facilitating leadership development that maps to the organization’s strategic needs, says Jakosuo-Jansson.

“Boards must define a set of clearly articulated profiles in terms of future leadership, effectively translating the organization’s broader strategy into its new leadership requirements. And this involves regularly reviewing and updating succession plans to reflect evolving business priorities.”

Boards must also oversee talent across the entirety of the organization – and with a broader scope and longer time horizon than management. And this means engaging in detailed discussions around workforce planning, recruitment, and leadership development.

“While boards do not manage talent directly, they must nonetheless ensure that the right systems and processes are put in place to develop and retain the organization’s future leaders,” she adds, “And they must make sure that sufficient time and energy are given to these efforts.”

CEO succession planning and the importance of cultural fit

CEO succession planning is critical, and it must be an integral element of risk management. Jakosuo-Jansson’s advice? Start as early as possible.

“Planning should begin as soon as a new CEO takes office. It should be part of regular board discussions and not treated as a sensitive topic to be discussed behind closed doors. Open dialogue with the current CEO fosters trust and ensures alignment on leadership needs.”

In times of transformation, leadership pipelines need to have great flexibility.

A dramatic change may require external insights or leadership with new capabilities, prompting boards to look beyond internal succession plans. Sometimes, hiring an external candidate with fresh perspectives is essential for success in a new direction. But it’s critical not to underestimate cultural fit here, says Jakosuo-Jansson.

“Even if the ideal CEO candidate exists, you must also look at their character. I have witnessed executives coming from completely different industries who haven’t focused enough on the company culture and business complexity. That’s why we should not underestimate the importance of cultural fit.”

Ultimately, success lies in being able to identify leaders who have both strategic vision and execution capabilities, but who are also capable of developing a strong performance and organizational culture.",https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/People-Culture-and-Strategy-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 07:56:39.330891

Electric propulsion

The company showcased a notional concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. Two liquid hydrogen tanks would support the system. Further testing will refine the concept, focusing on hydrogen storage, distribution, and propulsion systems.

“Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts before selecting this fully electric concept,” said Glenn Llewellyn, head of the ZEROe project. “We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”

In 2023, Airbus demonstrated a 1.2-megawatt hydrogen propulsion system, followed by end-to-end testing in 2024 of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters, and heat exchangers.

The project was carried out at RPD Technologies’ facilities in Crosby, Texas, from August to December of last year.
Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies, highlighted the broader implications of the pilot: “This project’s impact goes far beyond technical validation.
A key advantage of Flexiforming is that it enables SAF to be fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM certification is achieved.
This process is critical for verifying the fuel’s safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its suitability for commercial aviation.","To support the goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and enhance feedstock availability, Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) has successfully completed a five-month pilot project. The initiative showcased the effectiveness of the company’s Flexiforming technology, demonstrating its ability to produce SAF chemically similar to conventional jet fuel from a variety of renewable feedstocks. The project was carried out at RPD Technologies’ facilities in Crosby, Texas, from August to December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, indicating that the technology is ready for scaling. The project specifically focused on converting methanol and ethanol into SAF, as well as ethanol mixed with paraffinic renewable naphtha produced through Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) into SAF. The SAF samples produced by Unifuel’s Flexiforming technology have undergone extensive testing and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening, the first step in the SAF certification process.

Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University, emphasized the importance of advancing SAF technologies: “As an industry, we must continue to explore new technologies that enhance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel. The ability to produce aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single platform not only streamlines SAF production but also lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible to producers and airlines.”

The pilot resulted in two distinct types of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential component for blending paraffinic SAF with fossil kerosene, and a fully synthetic, 100% drop-in SAF with the necessary aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International. This aromatic component, derived from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) naphtha, can be combined with the primary paraffinic SAF stream, creating an opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units. This simplifies logistics, reduces costs, and aids in broader industry adoption.

Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies, highlighted the broader implications of the pilot: “This project’s impact goes far beyond technical validation. A key advantage of Flexiforming is that it enables SAF to be fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM certification is achieved. Because of its aromatic properties, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT processes and sold directly to airlines, without the need for additional blending. As the aviation sector faces growing pressure to reduce its environmental footprint and manage costs, innovations like Flexiforming could play a crucial role in scaling up SAF production to meet demand.”

Flexiforming offers flexibility in SAF production, with the pilot validating several production routes, including ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ). The technology’s lower energy and hydrogen requirements mean that Unifuel estimates Flexiforming costs to be about half of current ETJ processes. Additionally, it enables renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, which can be blended into fully synthetic, drop-in-ready jet fuel.

Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor at the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, noted, “The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise for full certification as aviation turbine fuel.”

After more than a decade of research and testing, Unifuel is now preparing samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the pilot project for submission to ASTM for certification. This process is critical for verifying the fuel’s safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its suitability for commercial aviation.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2025-03-26 04:56:16.913363

It is planning to launch a flight-test programme using the open-fan design on an A380 test article before decade’s end.","Airbus is teasing technologies that could enable its next-generation single-aisle jet, including innovative engine and wing designs aimed at boosting efficiency.

The Toulouse-based airframer provided an update during the 2025 Airbus Summit on a new narrowbody product that it envisions delivering sometime in the second half of the 2030s.

Airbus has previously stated that it would launch such a programme before the end of this decade.

But it did not get specific on when it plans to finalise the design of its next-generation narrowbody. Airbus is seemingly in no rush to market as Boeing attempts to gain momentum with its 737 Max programme – allowing more time for engine and wing concepts to mature.

Reuters reports that Airbus chief Guillaume Faury said during the event that its next narrowbody platform would be “evolutionary rather than revolutionary”, with renderings suggesting the aircraft could take a familiar-looking form.

Boeing is still attempting to achieve Federal Aviation Administration certification of the Max 7 and Max 10 – the smallest and largest variants of the Max family, respectively.

Already badly delayed, those programmes are being further hindered by issues related to the stall management yaw damper system on both the Max 7 and Max 10.

Airbus, meanwhile, started delivering its long-range variant of the A321neo to airline customers in October.

”We have the most advanced aircraft portfolio in the market and the A321XLR is at the very forefront of today’s single-aisle aircraft technology,” says Bruno Fichefeux, Airbus’ head of future programmes.

”Now we are taking the best of what we’ve done and preparing another jump to make our single-aisle aircraft even better and pioneer the future of flight, when the time is right.”

Airbus has also experienced recent setbacks on the innovation front. Last month, it pushed back the service-entry target for a hydrogen-powered aircraft developed under its ZEROe project by up to 10 years.

With its next narrowbody jet, Airbus is targeting a 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared with A320neo-family aircraft.

Airbus is exploring various airframe configurations, including “long foldable wings allowing for significant aerodynamic gains”, a concept it is studying through its Wing of Tomorrow technology research programme.

Such a design would provide the aircraft ”a longer wingspan in flight, increasing lift and reducing drag, while still making it compatible with airport gates,” Airbus says.

”Imagine a new Airbus single-aisle aircraft with wings designed with advanced aerodynamics and biomimicry in mind to generate significantly more lift, reducing fuel consumption and increasing efficiency.”

It is also seeking to gain ground on engine efficiency, pointing to ”disruptive open-fan designs”, such as CFM International’s advanced open fan concept RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines).

”An open-fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades that generate thrust are larger and not contained by a nacelle, the cowling that contains the fan in current-generation engines,” Airbus says. ”This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.”

Airbus is partnering with CFM on the RISE open-fan engine demonstrator, which could reduce aircraft emissions by 20% compared with today’s most efficient single-aisle jets. It is planning to launch a flight-test programme using the open-fan design on an A380 test article before decade’s end.

The company is also exploring hybrid technology that could supplement burning conventional or sustainable aviation fuel with batteries or fuel cells. Such an approach could potentially reduce carbon emissions by up to 5%, Airbus says, by ”using otherwise wasted energy to power non-propulsive functions”.

”These batteries could be used to power the aircraft while taxiing on the ground, as well as during flight for onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting,” it says.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/7/9/108879_airbusnextgensingleaisle_62003.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 02:56:36.060749

The tourism industry contributes nearly 8% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions according to Sustainable Travel International, with aviation alone accounting for 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, as noted by the World Economic Forum.

With summer around the corner, March is an ideal time to start planning a vacation. According to McKinsey, demand for leisure travel is increasing as their research indicated that the leisure industry was expected to make a full recovery at the end of 2024, following its 75% decline in value during the 2020 pandemic. This upward trend makes early booking crucial for securing better prices and availability while ensuring more sustainable choices. A 2024 Vacasa report found that booking summer trips by early April secures the best deals, as search volume rises soon after. With March nearly over, there's still time to plan strategically. This article will show you how to reduce your environmental footprint while enhancing your travel experience.

1. Choose Low-Carbon Vacation Transportation

Air travel remains one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions. According to the International Air Transport Association, sustainable aviation fuel could reduce aviation emissions by up to 80%, yet the December 2024 IATA report indicated that it currently accounts for less than 0.3% of global jet fuel production. As a result, even if you want to fly using SAF, it would be limited, so to offset your impact, consider the following where possible:

Choose non-stop flights whenever possible, as they consume less fuel and produce fewer emissions than connecting flights. This is because the most fuel-intensive phases of a flight are takeoff and landing. When planning a sustainable trip, prioritize flights with fewer connections to reduce your carbon footprint.

Where feasible, consider rail travel which is significantly more greenhouse gas efficient than road transport and aviation. According to the European Environment Agency, rail travel emits just 35g of CO₂ per kilometer, compared to 246g per kilometer for a domestic flight and 154g per kilometer for a short-haul flight, as reported by Our World in Data.

2. Stay in an Eco-Certified Vacation Hotel

Just like your home, hotels and vacation rentals generate emissions from energy use, with heating, air conditioning, water heating, and electricity consumption being major contributors. Larger resorts and hotels typically have higher emissions due to their extensive amenities, whereas smaller lodgings, such as homestays and guesthouses, tend to have a lower environmental impact. By conducting energy audits, these accommodations can assess their energy demand and implement efficiency measures, leading to both environmental and financial benefits. Accommodation accounts for nearly 2-5% of global CO2 emitted by the tourism sector according to UN Tourism. Here’s how you can select sustainable accommodations or be sustainable if the accommodation is not:

Look for certifications like LEED, EarthCheck, or Green Key, which ensure sustainability standards.

Choose accommodations that use renewable energy, waste reduction programs, and water conservation initiatives.

Opt for locally owned eco-lodges and resorts instead of large international chains that contribute to over-tourism.

Choose temperature settings that are comfortable and avoid over cooling and overheating the rooms.

Turn off heaters, or air conditioners when not in the rooms.

3. Eat Sustainably on Vacation

Food accounts for a significant portion of a vacation’s carbon footprint. A 2024 United Nations Climate Change article estimates that food waste accounts for nearly 8-10% of global emissions and costs UDS 1 trillion annually. Here is how you can eat sustainably while on vacation.

Support farm-to-table restaurants that source local, organic ingredients.

Choose plant-based meals where possible, as they tend to have a lower carbon footprint than meat-based dishes.

Reduce waste by ordering only what you can eat, especially when staying in all inclusive resorts.

4. Engage in Responsible Vacation Activities

Mass tourism often damages local ecosystems and cultures. Over tourism happens when a destination receives more visitors than it can handle sustainably, resulting in issues like overcrowding, environmental harm, infrastructure strain, and a lower quality of life for locals. Essentially, it is what happens when a place becomes a victim of its own popularity. Here are tips to engage in responsible vacation activities:

Choose ethical wildlife experiences (e.g., sanctuaries over zoos or animal rides).

Support local businesses and vetted local tour guides to boost the tourism industry’s contribution to local economies.

Avoid activities that contribute to over-tourism in fragile ecosystems like coral reefs.

5. Pack and Travel Responsibly for Your Vacation

Sustainable packing and mindful habits during vacations play a crucial role in reducing environmental impact. According to the EPA, plastic pollution accounts for 60-80% of marine debris, posing a severe threat to marine ecosystems. Making eco-conscious choices helps travelers significantly minimize waste.

To reduce waste while traveling, consider packing reusable essentials. Bring a durable, refillable water bottle and fabric shopping bags to minimize single-use plastics.

Opting for reef-safe sunscreens is another important step. Traditional sunscreens contain chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which harm coral reefs. Choosing mineral-based sunscreens with non-nano zinc oxide helps protect marine life.

Using solid toiletries can also make a difference. Replacing mini plastic bottles of liquid shampoos, conditioners, and body washes with solid bars reduces plastic waste and makes packing more convenient.

6. Shop Sustainably for Vacation Clothes

Instead of buying new clothes for your vacation, check your closet first to see if you already own suitable outfits. This helps reduce textile waste and overconsumption. If you need new pieces, consider shopping sustainably by thrifting or choosing ethically made clothing. The fashion industry contributes approximately 10% of global carbon emissions, so opting for second-hand or sustainably produced items helps lower your environmental impact.

Sustainable travel revolves around making mindful decisions that lessen your environmental impact while enhancing the travel experience. Opt for eco-friendly transportation, stay in energy-efficient accommodations, choose sustainable dining options, participate in responsible tourism, pack consciously, and shop for clothes and gear sustainably. Every small action adds up as demand for travel rises, helping secure a greener future. Planning ahead and adopting these sustainable habits ensures a fulfilling vacation without compromising the planet’s well-being.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e196162c92e2da2afad386/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-03-25 19:56:56.121608

Sustainable aviation fuels represent the most viable near-term pathway for decarbonizing aviation. Produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, and algae, they can mitigate up to 80% of carbon dioxide emissions in lifecycle compared to conventional aviation fuels5. Key production technologies include Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids, Fischer-Tropsch, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Power-to-Liquid, which convert diverse feedstocks into energy-dense fuels tailored for aviation.

Sustainable aviation fuels are typically blended with conventional ones (up to 50%), ensuring compatibility with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Advances in feedstock optimization through biotechnology, renewable energy integration in conversion processes, and cost-effective supply chain development are essential to scaling the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels, reducing production costs, and meeting the growing global demand for sustainable aviation solutions.

Develop zero-emission technologies

Achieving zero-emission aviation requires a holistic approach, integrating advancements in propulsion systems, aircraft design, and materials. Hydrogen-powered aircraft, emitting only water vapor, represents a transformative solution for long-term decarbonization, relying on advancements in fuel cell technologies and cryogenic storage systems6. Electric propulsion provides a complementary pathway for short-haul and regional flights, reliant on breakthroughs in battery energy density and power-to-weight ratios.

Hybrid-electric systems represent a critical transitional step as they reduce fuel burn in conventional engines while advancing electric technologies. Moreover, novel aircraft designs, such as blended-wing bodies and laminar flow technologies, improve aerodynamic efficiency. Lightweight materials, such as advanced composites and metallic alloys, enhance the overall performance7.

Improve efficiency of flight operations

The optimization of flight operations, airspace management, and ground activities is a practical pathway for reducing fuel consumption and emissions8. The adoption of continuous descent operations and performance-based navigation can allow smoother and more direct flight paths9. The use of dynamic air traffic flow management can help minimize delays and holding patterns. The reduction of aircraft weight through improved loading practices can also contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.

On the ground, single-engine taxiing, electrification of ground support equipment, and minimization of the use of auxiliary power units further enhance fuel efficiency. Additionally, the use of real-time data analytics for predictive maintenance and fuel optimization can significantly contribute to sustainable operations.

Implement policies that incentivize sustainable practices to achieve net zero emissions

Driving aviation sustainability requires a robust policy framework based on carbon pricing and stringent criteria10. The International Civil Aviation Organization targets net-zero emissions for global aviation by 2050, supported by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.

The European Union aims for a 55% reduction in aviation emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050, leveraging sustainable aviation fuels and emission trading systems. The United States similarly targets net-zero by 2050 through initiatives like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge. China plans to peak aviation emissions before achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, focusing on green airports and sustainable aviation fuels. Japan and the United Kingdom also target net-zero by 2050, with strategies emphasizing sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen-powered aircraft, and optimized air traffic management. These efforts highlight global actions for promoting sustainable aviation.

Promote alternative transports

Leisure and social air travel are the largest and fastest-growing contributors to long-distance emissions11. In particular, private aviation is increasingly contributing to climate change, with direct emissions reaching at least 15.6 megatons of carbon dioxide in 202312. Airport operations electrification, renewable energy investment for ground services, and urban air mobility integration—for example, electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles—are emerging areas that complement broader aviation sustainability goals.

Integrate digital technologies

The integration of digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and digital twins, offers an opportunity to optimize operational processes across aviation systems, from aircraft operations to air traffic management. These technologies can improve fuel consumption efficiency and reduce emissions through enhanced predictive analytics and real-time operational decision-making. Furthermore, the incorporation of renewable energy sources and the principles of circular economy in airport infrastructure design and operations can play a pivotal role in reducing aviation’s broader environmental footprint.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02222-3/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2222_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-03-25 19:57:00.761742

According to the report, the economic impact of the U.S. biofuels sector could grow to as high as $123 billion by 2030, up from approximately $55 billion in 2024.
The biofuels sector, however, is also experiencing uncertainty around government mandates and policies, including IRA tax credits.
The economic impact of the biobased material and polymers sector could reach as high as $38 billion by 2030, according to the report.","The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, in partnership with Kearney, a global management consulting firm, on March 24 released a report showing the U.S. bioeconomy currently contributes $210 billion in direct economic impact to the U.S. economy, excluding healthcare. Indirect benefits push the total impact beyond $830 billion.

The sector currently supports 430,000 jobs across various industries, including biobased materials and polymers, biobased industrial chemicals, biofuels, and biobased food ingredients and additives.

By 2030, the report predicts the full economic potential of the bioeconomy could reach $400 billion, nearly doubling its current impact. According to BIO, the report’s findings reinforce the bioeconomy’s status as an essential economic driver.

""The power of biotechnology in food, agriculture, and manufacturing plays a pivotal role in fostering long-term economic growth and enhancing our national security,"" said John Crowley, president and CEO of BIO. ""The U.S. must now take a series of bold measures to modernize the regulatory frameworks that govern the review and approval process of new biotechnologies to ensure that our nation continues to lead the world in agricultural innovation.”

“For the first time, we have a comprehensive, data-driven analysis that quantifies the economic impact of this critical segment of the bioeconomy,” said Sylvia Wulf, interim head of BIO’s Agriculture and Environment Center of Excellence. “This report highlights the immense economic contributions of plant, animal, and biobased product innovations. These insights underline the urgency of public policies and investments that will unlock the bioeconomy’s full potential.”

The U.S. industrial biobased products industry had an estimated economic impact of $172 billion in 2023. The report predicts the economic impact of the industry could expand to $247 billion to $345 billion by 2030, depending on the impact of key market drivers and barrier to growth. The industry is defined to include biofuels, industrial chemicals, biotech-based materials and polymers, and biotech-based food ingredients and additives.

According to the report, the economic impact of the U.S. biofuels sector could grow to as high as $123 billion by 2030, up from approximately $55 billion in 2024. Factors driving expected growth in biofuels include higher mandates around the world, strong ethanol exports, a potential move to E15, increasing focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, and Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

The biofuels sector, however, is also experiencing uncertainty around government mandates and policies, including IRA tax credits. The report notes that developers and investors are concerned about potential modification to tax credit policies, which could significantly impact project financing and market stability.

The economic impact of the biobased material and polymers sector could reach as high as $38 billion by 2030, according to the report. The economic impact of the sector was less than $25 billion in 2024. According to the report, government policy and consumer awareness, emerging bioidentical polymers, and emerging technologies are driving growth in the sector. Price competitiveness, the lack of a universal carbon tax credit and a lack of logistical advantage in the U.S. are some factors that could limit growth in the sector.
