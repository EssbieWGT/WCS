Embraer Joins Forces with Polish New Mobility Association to Drive Sustainable Regional Aviation in Central Europe

Embraer, a world-renowned aircraft manufacturer and a global frontrunner in sustainable aviation innovation, has recently become a member of the Polish New Mobility Association (PSNM). This strategic partnership underscores Embraer’s commitment to advancing the decarbonization of air transport, with a particular focus on the regional aviation sector — a key area for developing low-emission mobility solutions for the future.

Accelerating Decarbonization in Aviation

The global aviation industry faces significant challenges in reducing its carbon footprint. Air travel contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions, and the pressure to meet international climate goals has never been greater. Embraer’s collaboration with PSNM is perfectly aligned with the ambitious targets set by global and European policymakers aiming for carbon neutrality in transport by 2050.

To meet these goals, Embraer and PSNM are focusing on several critical areas. One major priority is the advancement and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which has the potential to drastically reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions compared to traditional jet fuels. Additionally, the partnership is exploring new propulsion technologies, including electric and hybrid-electric systems, which represent the future of clean, efficient air travel.

Moreover, improving operational efficiency throughout the sector remains vital. By optimizing flight routes, enhancing aircraft performance, and integrating smarter air traffic management, emissions can be further minimized. These efforts will be complemented by innovations in digital travel planning and the integration of air transport with emerging zero-emission ground mobility options.

Embraer’s Leadership in Regional Aviation and Sustainable Technologies

Embraer is one of the largest aircraft manufacturers worldwide and a dominant force in the regional aircraft market. The company’s dedication to sustainable aviation goes beyond rhetoric; it is actively investing in research and development to create the next generation of cleaner, greener aircraft.

One of Embraer’s pioneering ventures is through its subsidiary, Eve Air Mobility, which focuses on electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL). These innovative electric aircraft promise to revolutionize urban and regional mobility by offering quieter, emission-free options for short-distance air travel and urban air taxis. The technology represents a significant leap toward reducing aviation’s environmental impact and improving accessibility in congested metropolitan regions.

Embraer’s comprehensive approach combines these cutting-edge technologies with ongoing enhancements in conventional aircraft design, striving to make every flight more sustainable. The company’s portfolio includes new propulsion architectures and materials that contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient planes without compromising safety or performance.

The Role of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Technological Innovation

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that by 2050, the aviation sector can reduce its CO₂ emissions by up to 65% through widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This biofuel alternative is derived from renewable sources and can be used with existing aircraft engines and fuel infrastructure, making it a critical near-term solution.

In addition to SAF, around 13% of emission reductions are expected to come from new propulsion technologies such as electric, hybrid, and hydrogen-powered aircraft. These technologies, while still in various stages of development and certification, represent the long-term pathway toward zero-emission flights.

The remaining emissions cuts will be achieved through operational improvements, including route optimization, air traffic management, and the use of carbon offset mechanisms to balance unavoidable emissions. The holistic approach highlights the complexity of aviation decarbonization, which requires innovation, infrastructure, and collaboration across multiple sectors.

Strengthening Regional Air Connectivity in Poland and Central Europe

Embraer’s entry into the PSNM opens the door to deeper cooperation with Polish institutions, technology firms, and regional airport operators. Poland, strategically located in Central Europe, is experiencing growing demand for regional air travel, driven by business, tourism, and economic development.

By working closely with local stakeholders, Embraer aims to foster the expansion of sustainable regional air networks. This includes encouraging the adoption of low-emission aircraft and alternative fuels, modernizing airport infrastructure, and integrating air travel with other eco-friendly transportation modes.

Such initiatives not only support climate objectives but also enhance accessibility and connectivity within the region. Improved regional air links can stimulate local economies, facilitate trade, and provide efficient travel options for communities less served by major international airports.

Integrating Aviation with the Future Mobility Ecosystem

Beyond aircraft and fuels, Embraer and PSNM recognize that the future of sustainable transport lies in an interconnected mobility ecosystem. Aviation must work in harmony with ground transportation, digital travel platforms, and smart infrastructure to offer seamless, low-carbon journeys.

This vision includes integrating zero-emission road transport—such as electric buses and vehicles—with airports, enabling smooth first- and last-mile connectivity. Digital travel planning tools can help optimize routes, reduce wait times, and offer passengers greener alternatives.

By positioning aviation as a vital component of this broader mobility landscape, Embraer and PSNM are laying the groundwork for a future where air travel complements other sustainable transport modes, contributing to a cleaner, more efficient transportation network.

Poland is driving a major transformation in regional aviation by partnering with Embraer to promote cutting-edge technologies and sustainable air travel. This initiative strengthens Poland’s commitment to green mobility and a carbon-neutral future.

Before the BTC expired, Canadian fuel was able to be sent to the U.S. where it was blended to receive the BTC.
In the past, U.S. renewable fuel producers would import Canadian feedstock to make biodiesel or renewable diesel, then sell the fuel into Canada.
Hybrid vehicles’ decarbonization potential when combined with renewable fuels offers drivers a cheaper option to pursue a lower carbon footprint.
The potential for a robust Canadian renewable fuels industry is there, but experts agree that the government needs to take action, ensuring that Canadian fuels get a fair shot.","Trade turbulence supplies both new challenges and opportunities as tensions with the United States, Canada’s closest trading partner, remain high. Meanwhile, provincial governments are increasingly recognizing their local renewable fuel producers and looking for ways to encourage local use of Canadian-made fuels. According to Canadian industry experts, however, the expiration of the U.S. Biodiesel Blenders’ Tax Credit and the implementation of its subsequent replacement, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, will harm the Canadian industry. Unlike the BTC, 45Z is paid to the domestic (U.S.) producer, and the fuel is exportable to Canada. Before the BTC expired, Canadian fuel was able to be sent to the U.S. where it was blended to receive the BTC.

The federal and provincial support structures built to promote renewable fuels production and usage in Canada are part of the country’s strategy to decarbonize. Each year, Advanced Biofuels Canada commissions a study to track the state of the country’s biofuels industry. Titled the “Biofuels in Canada Report,” prepared by Naivus Research, it assesses the impact of low-carbon fuel policies across the country. Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, explains that his organization has commissioned this report series to track the state of the biofuels industry in Canada since 2010. The study’s longitudinal tracking provides helpful context to newly collected biofuel use information. The 2024 report reflects on data from 2023 and provides a helpful jumping-off point for deeper dialogue with government entities looking for data about renewable fuels.

One of the study’s key data points is the change in clean fuel consumption each year. The report shows that ethanol consumption increased by 13% from 2022 to 2023, and biomass-based diesel consumption grew by 68% with much of that increase due to a “surge” in renewable diesel usage.

Production Volumes

Canada possesses over 2 billion liters (approximately 530 million gallons) of installed ethanol capacity and 1.9 billion liters of biomass-based diesel capacity, which includes both renewable diesel and biodiesel. The biodiesel sector produces 550 million liters per year, and the two renewable diesel facilities have the collective capacity to produce roughly 1.2 billion liters yearly, according to Dany Laferriere, vice president of communications and outreach with the Canadian Biofuels Association. The country’s biomass-based diesel production volume will likely expand in 2025 when the new Imperial Oil RD facility, located near Edmonton in Strathcona, Alberta, comes online with a production capacity of 1.16 billion liters.

A total of 16 biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facilities are either under construction or producing fuel in Canada, according to research from Biodiesel Magazine’s data specialist, Chloe Piekkola. The country’s production portfolio includes five operational biodiesel facilities and 11 RD or SAF facilities, six of which are under development, two under construction and three operational facilities.

The report reflects the impact that Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations have had on the fuel supply since they came into effect in June 2022, explains Ghatala. The CFR received support from a broader base of constituents because the regulations contain compliance pathways “that are an opportunity for the refining sector,” Ghatala says. Refineries are able to generate Category 1 compliance credits by implementing refinery improvements. “There are lots of ways that you can nip and tuck emissions around a refinery and that can generate compliance credits,” Ghatala adds.

To date, most of the volume obligations under the CFR have been met through imports, explains Laferriere. He describes the Canadian low-carbon fuels industry as “small but growing.” Renewable diesel projects make up much of the industry’s development focus at the moment. Canadian biorefineries have room to grow in order to meet the projected demand of 4 billion liters by 2030. ABFC’s report shows that the nationwide blending for biomass-based diesel reached 6.5% in 2023, projected to increase up to 7% when 2024 numbers are released.

In 2030, the volume demand for renewable fuels in the national gasoline pool is expected to reach 7 billion liters. The Canadian ethanol industry likely will not be able to supply this volume on its own. “We could be just about self-sufficient on the diesel side, but we are forecast to continue being importers on the gasoline side, which generally reflects Canada’s agricultural landscape,” Ghatala says. “Because of our canola sector, we are larger lipid producers than we are sugar producers—we simply don’t grow as much corn as the U.S. does[.]”

Provincial Standards

Canada’s plethora of provincial clean fuel standards stand alongside the country’s CFR. In recent months, however, economic pressures led Prime Minister Mark Carney to remove the consumer carbon tax, which was an achievement of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s environmental agenda.

Provinces across the country have enacted renewable fuel and clean fuel regulations with different structures. Because 95% of fuels supplied in Canada are covered under a provincial regulation, producers are able to stack compliance credit values in some provinces, explains Ghatala. Renewable fuel programs exist in “every province [from] Quebec and west [of it],” he says.

In 2023, renewable diesel blend rates hit above 20% in British Columbia—far exceeding the province’s 4% minimum volumetric blending requirement—in order to meet carbon intensity reduction requirements. When 2024 numbers come out, Ghatala anticipates that B.C.’s numbers will stand at around 30%. After the trade turbulence began, B.C. increased the minimum volume obligation to 8%, along with a requirement that the obligated volumetric portion must be met with domestically produced renewable fuels. The requirement came into effect on April 1.

“We see the renewable and lower-carbon fuels being pulled to markets that have this visible credit price,” Ghatala says. “Of all the provinces, British Columbia’s policy has the most transparent compliance credit market.”

Most other provincial programs, such as those in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, have volumetric requirements without any compliance credit trading. Manitoba’s clean fuel mandates for 2025 are set at 5% for diesel and 10% for gasoline. Saskatchewan’s blending mandate stands at 2% for diesel and 7.5% for gasoline.

Quebec holds the highest minimum volume requirements of any province, with the 2025 minimum set at 12% renewable content in gasoline and 5% renewable content in diesel; the requirements are set to increase to 15% and 10%, respectively, by 2030.

Ontario’s 2025 volume requirements are set at 11% for gasoline and 4% for diesel. Alberta’s requirements are lower on the gasoline front this year, standing at 5%, with diesel at 2%.

ABFC’s report found that the renewable fuels industry saves Canadians half a cent per liter of fuel. Ghatala explains that this calculation originates from the price for renewable diesel and biodiesel being more expensive than conventional fuels by five cents, and ethanol being cheaper by six cents. “We’re seeing the average cost of carbon abatement through renewable fuels to be about $123,” he says.

Coprocessing Production

Coprocessing constitutes a small portion of Canada’s renewable fuels volume, but it provides a cost-effective option to increase renewable fuel production, according to Laferriere. This process uses renewable content such as vegetable oil or animal fats and requires mixing with a crude oil input at a petroleum refinery. Depending on where the renewable material is inserted into the refinery’s hydrotreater or fluid catalytic cracker unit, the renewable material ends up in one of the refinery’s products.

Provincial regulations across the country include methodologies for calculating credit generation, such as carbon-14 dating and a monitoring, measurement and verification program, he explains. According to ABFC’s report, 100 million liters per year of coprocessing capacity are available.

Refineries across the country are limited in the amount of organic content they can add, Ghatala explains. For example, jet fuel can only have 5% organic feedstock added. “Policymakers, I think, view the opportunity that coprocessing provides as an additional means through which to pursue reducing emissions of liquid transportation fuels. The fact that we have coprocessing diesel, renewable diesel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and related products like biodiesel distillation bottoms [and] arctic-grade renewable diesel, and that those fuels can be used in different transportation modes means that we have the tools at hand to address transportation emissions growth.”

Opportunities and Obstacles

Policy structures for increasing biofuel usage across Canada are present at both the provincial and federal level. However, implementation of the U.S. 45Z tax credit constitutes a significant challenge to the Canadian biofuels industry. “Our domestic sector has been negatively impacted by the 45Z tax incentive and its exportability to the Canadian market, along with other factors,” Ghatala says. Concerns abound as to whether Canadian producers can compete with U.S. imports and Canadian policies are durable enough to handle the influx of foreign fuel.

The shift away from the Biodiesel Blenders’ Tax Credit to 45Z’s Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit has triggered a “rationalization” in the North American biomass-based diesel market, Ghatala explains. In the past, U.S. renewable fuel producers would import Canadian feedstock to make biodiesel or renewable diesel, then sell the fuel into Canada. In light of 2025’s trade turbulence, Canadian federal and provincial governments started looking for strategies to encourage energy security and domestic resilience. Rather than crossing the border, Canadian feedstocks are used to produce biofuels at home, and those fuels are sold into local markets. “We are seeing renewable fuels be a big part of that conversation because they link so many things in our economy together,” Ghatala says. “They link agriculture with industry, they link agriculture with oil and gas refining, with greenhouse gas targets and energy security, and all of those things tied together is a very formidable consortium to encourage action.”

Even before trade turbulence, renewable fuels grew in popularity as the conversation around decarbonization has shifted in recent years, and policymakers have realized how long the road to full electrification is, Ghatala explains. A growing understanding that other options are needed to attain the net-zero target—especially for Class 7 and 8 vehicles—has brought renewable fuels back into the spotlight. “Renewable fuels do provide the ready-made, available now, commercially distributed technology that can reduce emissions immediately and pairs very well with electrification,” he says. Hybrid vehicles’ decarbonization potential when combined with renewable fuels offers drivers a cheaper option to pursue a lower carbon footprint.

Mandated volumes of SAF provide a firm basis for the growth of the country’s domestic SAF industry, another positive for the biofuels space. B.C. has implemented the first SAF mandate in North America, starting in 2026. The province’s revised LCFS regulations, which came into effect January 2024, mandate a 2% carbon intensity reduction for aviation fuel in 2026, increasing to 10% in 2030. A volumetric mandate begins in 2028, set at 1%, and increases to 3% in 2030.

The potential for a robust Canadian renewable fuels industry is there, but experts agree that the government needs to take action, ensuring that Canadian fuels get a fair shot. “Canada is well-positioned to lead globally in low-carbon fuel production, thanks to its abundant natural resources, existing infrastructure and technical expertise,” Laferriere says. “To realize this potential, CFA supports clear, stable and technology-neutral policies based on carbon intensity. These principles are critical to attracting long-term investment and building a resilient clean fuel sector.”

Otherwise, they say, we run the risk of ignoring the problem.

Who bears the most responsibility?

Experts warn that global governments are on track to exceed the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

Burning fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, releases CO2 and other molecules into the atmosphere which trap heat close to the Earth’s surface, resulting in a greenhouse effect, warming the planet. This human-induced climate change is leading to ocean acidification, rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and is even a risk to health.

The Paris Agreement requires greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2025 and drop by 43% by 2030.

Some researchers have suggested that a “net-zero carbon debt” should be applied to assess which groups are responsible for overshooting the goals of the Paris Agreement. A framework for this is detailed in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“As we near the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit, the question is not just about when we will exceed it, but also how we collectively deal with the consequences in the subsequent period,” says lead author Setu Pelz, a researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, based in Austria. “To guide efforts that minimise overshoot and establish who should pay for harms caused during this period, we measure who is responsible and to what extent under a range of scenarios and approaches.”

“Our findings reveal how the lack of global cooperation prolongs climate harms,” the authors of the paper write. “Moreover, they show how responsibilities persist beyond budget exhaustion, informing the need for increased international support, ambitious mitigation targets, and reparative measures for those most affected.”

The research highlights the disproportionate effects of climate change on younger generations and regions which have contributed less to emissions.

Example: E-fuels for aviation

Global aviation is responsible for about 2.4% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – about the same as the historic emissions of Canada. The mix of gases produced by aeroplanes translates to about 4% of human-induced global warming.

An increasing role is being played by private aviation.

Small reductions of global aviation – as little as 2.5% – could lead to future contributions of aviation to global warming being halted, according to one study. There is also research into carbon-neutral fuels for aeroplanes.

The European Union (EU) even has a roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels. They say these synthetic “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” will make up 2% of the supply in Europe by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050.

Recent research has shown improvements in the process for making carbon-neutral aeroplane fuel. But even this is likely not enough according to some experts.

Other experts warn that the focus on e-fuels highlights a major disparity in the way that people of different socioeconomic backgrounds are treated in the energy market.

This “energy injustice” means poorer people who need energy for every day life are priced out of being able to use energy while corporations can use their resources and direct link to governments to make the most of energy subsidies and “green energy” initiatives.

Unequal approach harms the most vulnerable

New research published in the Climate Policy journal, for example, explains that working-class and poor people are disproportionately affected by energy tax policies during the transition to renewable sources for aviation.

The paper focuses on the EU’s energy policies.

The wealthiest 1% of the EU’s population is responsible for 66% of the distance currently travelled by air, while air travel is almost non-existent for the poorest 50% and limited for the bottom 90% of EU citizens.

In fact, this is a global phenomenon. Estimates vary, but research suggests that about 90% of the world’s population does not fly in a given year. And frequent flying is restricted to the wealthiest.

The Climate Policy findings indicate that the bottom 90% of people in the EU emit less than 0.1 tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions per person, per year. Meanwhile the top 1% emit about 20 tons per person/year.

On the other hand, electricity costs for primary needs such as heating and lighting is up to 3 times more expensive than electricity for long-distance travel.

Electricity serving household and local mobility needs cost about A$341 per MWh (Australian dollars per megawatt-hour) – or €194 per MWh. Meanwhile, e-fuel for aviation costs just A$115 per MWh, or €65.5 per MWh.

EU tax policies accounted for A$211/MWh (€120/MWh) of this cost in the case of household and local mobility fuel needs but only A$19.70/MWh (€11.2/MWh) in the case of aviation.

“As e-fuel, along with other energy carriers based on electricity, is still within its infancy, it’s time for policy-makers to address the potential social injustices which may arise when formulating e-fuel policies,” says author Jean-Baptiste Jarin, an expert on decarbonisation from the University of Pau and the Adour Region in France.

“Electricity for basic needs such as heating or cooking benefits everyone but using it for air mobility mostly benefits the upper classes.”

“And that is what I find most worrying about the findings from within my paper, that, essentially, low carbon policies could foster energy injustice to people across society,” Jarin adds.

“Sadly, a massive production of e-fuel – especially when dedicated to aviation – could mean that tax inequalities, along with volume inequalities, spread the gap between the very wealthiest and the rest. That is why policy makers need to pay close attention.

“In the Global South, but also within the EU, during winters of 2022 and 2023, electricity bills were so high in most EU countries that people had to – and even were asked to by some – reduce heating and other appliances consumptions.”

A collective approach

A chemical engineer at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures in Australia, Maartje Feenstra, agrees that there is discrepancy between household users and industry.

“In general, industrial users use electricity that is less expensive than what households use. There’s an interaction there with politics and keeping the industry there. So that’s a difficult topic, of course, with all kinds of different aspects of that problem,” Feenstra tells Cosmos.

“The technical challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. So, they’re the only sustainable solution we have, but they’re also a factor 2 to 6 more expensive than our conventional fossil fuel-based fuels.”

University of Adelaide researcher and global expert on energy policy. Tracey Dodd, emphasises the importance of collective action to reduce carbon emissions, rather than individually-based solutions which can result in ordinary people feeling “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2 emitting aircraft.

“We have to have what we call a “just transition” [to clean energy sources],” she says. “I think that it’s really hard. You want to make sure that that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive, and that it’s not going to price certain people out of the market to fly, or price certain people out of the market of things like flowers or coffee that we ship.

Stoesz said Tk’emlúps band members can still have their say into the project if they missed Monday’s information session.
While she wouldn’t release details, Stoesz added it was “was well attended,” with nearly 100 attendees either in-person or online.

The other two locations being considered are Portage la Prairie, Manitoba and Port Colborne, Ontario. According to federal government data, Azure got $10 million for front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies, with $5 million going to each study.

Sc.wenwen Economic Development Corporation Manager, Krista Stoesz, told CFJC Today that the Kamloops facility was the recipient of similar funding “early in the life of the project.”

“Some of this work applies to the facility, wherever the location may be (all sites), and some of it is location specific,” Stoesz said in an email.

In a Jan. 2024 news release, Azure said it was working towards developing a facility that would produce approximately 20,000 barrels of predominantly sustainable aviation fuel per day.

“Our ambition is to develop the first SAF-dedicated renewable fuel production facility of scale in Canada, by utilizing Canadian skillsets and natural resources to achieve first production in 2027,” Azure CEO Douglas Cole said in the release.

“We have established critical partnerships with leaders in their respective industries that are required to successfully construct and operate a facility of this nature. At the same time, we have worked closely with federal, provincial and Indigenous governments to adhere to all regulations and requirements.”

That Azure news release also said that it had partnered with Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc “to co-develop a facility on their ancestral lands” and that it was continuing to advance discussions with Indigenous groups in Manitoba and Ontario.

“Azure has sought to maximize optionality by pursuing a multi-site strategy through developing three Canadian SAF-focused renewable fuels production facility sites in parallel,” the company said. “All FEED work for each of the three sites will be complete by the end of 2024, positioning Azure to reach a Final Investment Decision (‘FID’) in the first half of 2025 as to enable an in-service date in 2027.”

Stoesz told CFJC Today that there was some misunderstanding in the community regarding the number of facilities being proposed across Canada, and that only one of the three projects was “ever intented to move forward.”

“For a number of strategic and operational reasons, the B.C. location remains the most desirable of the three,” Stoesz said. “The project location in Tk’emlúps is a desirable site and the partnership with TteS is one of those reasons.”

CFJC Today has also reached out to Azure Sustainable Fuels for more on its plans and the status of the proposed project.

If it moves ahead, the Kamloops facility is slated to rise on a plot of land across the North Thompson River from Westsyde. An exact location wasn’t specified, but it’s expected to be alongside the CN Rail tracks south of Rayleigh.

“We’ve been working with Tk’emlúps since about 2021,” Vanessa Vredenburg, Azure’s Director of Indigenous and Stakeholder Relations, told a Kamloops committee meeting in December.

“Our founders were looking along Google Maps and found this nice chunk of land along the railway and that’s where our partnership kind of started, and it’s really progressed from there.”

While there has been some pushback from residents in the Westsyde and Rayleigh area owing to concerns about things like pollution, odour and impacts to the environment, others say the project is necessary as it will bring high paying jobs to the area.

According to Vredenburg, the facility is expected to create around 1,500 jobs during construction and about 150 when it is up and running.

The project, known as the Used Cooking Oil to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (USAF) initiative, is led by Pertamina’s subsidiary, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI). It began at the Cilacap refinery in Central Java — the country’s largest oil processing facility — and will now be extended to the Dumai refinery in Riau and the Balongan refinery in West Java.

“This project shows how serious we are about not only supporting the country’s energy needs but also investing in greener alternatives,” said KPI Executive Director Taufik Aditiyawarman on Tuesday, according to local reports. “It aligns with our goal to promote new and renewable energy sources that are better for the environment.”

The USAF effort started in 2020, when the Cilacap refinery produced its first batch of Bioavtur J2.4 using palm kernel oil. In 2021, the plant-based fuel was successfully tested in a CN-235 aircraft. In 2023, it was used in a commercial flight operated by Garuda Indonesia on the Jakarta-to-Solo route.

The new deadline is 9 July.

For US exports, the EU has already drafted a list of targets for retaliatory tariffs, part of its second round of €95 billion in tariffs on US imports. A full list of all the proposed imports can be found here.

This is on top of the first round of €21 billion in tariffs on US imports. A full list of all the proposed imports can be found here.

In all, the EU could impose tariffs on nearly every major polymer from the US, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

The EU is also considering tariffs on US imports of surfactants, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and tall oil, a feedstock used to make renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable naphtha.

The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.
“We don’t have to guess about that.” In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives.
Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.
“They met their most recent target three years early.” In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic lawmakers rallied alongside clean fuel advocates on Tuesday at the State Capitol to push legislation that could slash greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 20% within eight years. The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, S1343A/A472A would create an incentive system that rewards using cleaner fuels while generating billions for electric vehicle infrastructure.

The proposal would require all fuel companies—including providers, refiners, blenders, and electricity suppliers—to lower the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced per unit of fuel energy their products consume or emit. That dirtiness is called carbon intensity, which they’d lower through a credit trading system, just like in California, Oregon, and Washington. Under the legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Kevin Parker and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, providers who hit emissions targets would be able to earn credits they could then sell off to companies that miss the mark.

Transportation produces more than 34% of New York’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s largest pollution source, according to State Senator Pete Harckham, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill outlines the initial target as a 20% reduction by 2033.

The full lifecycle emissions assessment, measuring all pollution from a fuel from start to finish, would include all stages from fuel production through consumer use—including growing crops for biofuels, and refining, transporting, and burning the fuel. Providers would have also have to meet transparency requirements and submit annual reports. Alternative fuel examples include electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or agricultural products, biofuels made from plant materials, and renewable natural gas from farm waste.

Beyond 2033, the Department of Environmental Conservation would set specific reduction targets every five years, with limits based on new technology and stricter climate requirements under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Companies providing electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel, or advanced biofuels would generate the most credits. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline and diesel suppliers would have to buy credits offsetting their environmental impact or be subject to penalties.

When utilities or government agencies earn money by selling credits, they must spend 40% of that amount on clean transportation projects in disadvantaged communities, including electric school buses, truck charging stations, and multi-family housing charging infrastructure. The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.

According to Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters, that money would flow directly to transportation electrification projects without requiring new state spending. She said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, would receive approximately $20,000 per electric bus annually through credit sales.

“The clean fuel standard will improve air quality tomorrow, especially for our environmental justice communities, taking harmful pollutants out of the air,” Harckham said at the press conference. “It does this in a tax-neutral way.”

Dairy farmer David Fisher from the New York Farm Bureau said his operation already produces renewable natural gas equivalent to 2,500 gallons of diesel daily through anaerobic digestion of manure. That means that bacteria break down the manure to produce methane that’s used as fuel. Currently, about 12% of New York’s cows produce renewable natural gas that could replace diesel fuel, he said.

The legislation includes sustainable aviation fuel as a credit generator because European regulations require planes leaving their airports to use jet fuel made from renewable sources like waste oils or plant materials instead of petroleum, producing fewer emissions.

But flights departing New York airports still rely on traditional jet fuel. “They’re leaving Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia dirty. It doesn’t make any sense,” Woerner said. Here’s the Assemblymember on those tougher airline regulations:

Aviation fuels are exempted due to federal preemption, but sustainable aviation fuel can opt-in for credits. Spokesperson Patricia Ornst endorsed the legislation on behalf of Delta Airlines, saying it would bring suppliers to New York by creating market incentives.

And, “We’ve seen what’s happening in California and Oregon and Washington state,” Tighe said, noting those programs showed minimal impact on fuel prices while generating substantial clean energy investment. “We don’t have to guess about that.”

In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives. Their transportation fuels also produce 15% less greenhouse gas pollution per gallon compared to when the program started. Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.

The Golden State boasts that nearly 30% of new car sales are electric, compared to under 10% in New York. “They’ve met their transportation goals several years in advance,” said Michael Lerner from the nonprofit Energy Vision research group. “They met their most recent target three years early.”

In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said. But despite 96 Assembly cosponsors, the legislation has stalled in the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, Woerner acknowledged.

“There are some environmental groups that are really convinced that eliminating internal combustion engines is the only path to achieving our climate goals,” Woerner said.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2024/09/GettyImages-954558336-e1715959219184_79f904.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-27 17:57:10.293845

The move comes as operating expenses rise but revenues fall, per quarterly reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as the company plans to halve its rented space at Skokie’s Illinois Science + Technology Park.
LanzaTech filed plans to lay off 44 to the Illinois Department of Commerce on May 12, offering “mass layoff” as the reason.
LanzaTech was founded in New Zealand and has headquartered in Skokie since 2014 in the Illinois Science + Tech Park, according to previous reporting.
The decision to downsize the company was not influenced by the political climate regarding green energy, nor the tariffs, she added.","Skokie-based clean energy company LanzaTech Global, Inc., which has been heralded in TIME magazine and by Prince William’s global environmental competition, plans to lay off 44 of its 383 employees in the first two weeks of June, per state of Illinois filings.

The move comes as operating expenses rise but revenues fall, per quarterly reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as the company plans to halve its rented space at Skokie’s Illinois Science + Technology Park.

Last month, the company acknowledged it received an offer from Carbon Direct Capital Management to buy the carbon recycling company at $0.02 a share, according to a press release from LanzaTech. In January 2023, the stock was valued at $10.43 a share, per Nasdaq.

LanzaTech filed plans to lay off 44 to the Illinois Department of Commerce on May 12, offering “mass layoff” as the reason. The first layoff date is scheduled for June 1, per state filings.

LanzaTech was founded in New Zealand and has headquartered in Skokie since 2014 in the Illinois Science + Tech Park, according to previous reporting.

The company’s SEC filing said it “transforms waste carbon into the chemical building blocks for consumer goods such as sustainable fuels, fabrics, and packaging that people use in their daily lives.”

“We are a gas fermentation company,” Dr. Zara Summers, chief science officer at LanzaTech previously told Pioneer Press. “You might know about sugar fermentation if you drink beer or wine. We use a bacterial catalyst that takes gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and convert those to ethanol at a commercial scale.”

TIME Magazine named LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren to its worldwide Top 100 Climate Leaders for Business for 2023, and it was named the sole United States finalist for Prince William’s November 2022 Earthshot prize, which honors the best solutions worldwide for tackling climate change.

In its recent quarterly SEC filing, however, the company wrote, “We have not achieved operating profitability since our formation. Our net losses after tax were $19.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $25.5 million for the prior year period. As of March 31, 2025 we had an accumulated deficit of $988.8 million compared to an accumulated deficit of $969.6 million as of December 31, 2024. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until we sufficiently commercialize our technology.”

Kate Walsh, LanzaTech’s VP of Investor Relations and Tax, told Pioneer Press that LanzaTech is in a transition phase and is ready to put into practice the research knowledge it has gained these past few years.

“We’re pivoting the company from a Research and Development hub to one that’s commercially focused on deploying our proven technology,” Walsh said. “…So there’s a transition that comes along with that.”

Walsh said the downsizing and the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel, especially with regulated markets in the UK and the EU, will help make the company profitable.

The decision to downsize the company was not influenced by the political climate regarding green energy, nor the tariffs, she added.

LanzaTech also will save money by cutting in half the space it rents at the Skokie tech park, from 106,661 to 53,616 square feet, effective July 1, per SEC filings.

Per the filings, LanzaTech said it was unsure how the layoffs will affect health of the company overall, “and may result in significant adverse consequences.”

As LanzaTech moves forward, the group also runs into danger of having its stock delisted from the Nasdaq due to its low valuation, per the filing. Delisted companies generally face steep challenges in raising money.

The village of Skokie’s Director of Communications and Community Engagement Patrick Deignan released a statement on behalf of the village.

“Innovative companies like LanzaTech play a vital role in strengthening Skokie’s local economy, supporting high-quality jobs and enhancing the Village’s longstanding reputation as a center for scientific advancement. The Village remains committed to fostering a strong climate for innovation and will continue supporting the success of LanzaTech and other companies contributing to our community and beyond.”

“LanzaTech is an important part of Skokie’s science, technology and local business landscape,” said Mayor Ann Tennes in a statement emailed to Pioneer Press. “Although we’re disappointed that the company’s strategic actions will result in a reduction in their local workforce, we remain confident in LanzaTech’s future and the continued impact they’ll make here in Skokie and around the world.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/12/13/KNDBCIZHKFGQXPGVVWG26Y7IKU.png?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-05-27 16:56:33.261933

Organised by Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK), LOT Polish Airlines, and Business & Science Poland, the event called for aviation to be recognised as a strategic sector for the EU economy – and warned that without action, Europe risks a systemic loss in global competitiveness.

While celebrating Poland’s infrastructure ambitions – not least the planned construction of CPK – industry leaders warned that the EU aviation sector faces growing competitive pressures. LOT Polish Airlines, which recently published business and decarbonisation strategies up to 2030, pointed to rising costs driven by environmental regulations. The Draghi Report estimates decarbonisation will cost the sector €61bn annually from 2031 to 2050, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) requirements escalating to 70% by 2050.

SAF remains three to four times more expensive than traditional fuel, however, and Poland currently lacks local SAF production facilities, placing additional financial strain on carriers such as LOT. In 2025, LOT’s SAF-related costs are expected to reach €40m, rising to €100m by 2030. These factors threaten the global competitiveness of European airlines compared to carriers from regions with looser environmental rules.

Michał Fijoł, CEO of LOT Polish Airlines, said: “I’m here to speak on behalf of the entire European business sector. We believe in our intelligence and our advanced technologies. That’s why we can be extremely successful. But we must have equal opportunities – the same chances as our competitors from around the world.

(Synhelion) The Lake Lucerne Navigation Company (SGV) AG has used solar fuel from Synhelion for the first time. The steamboat Gallia was symbolically fueled with solar diesel from Synhelion’s industrial scale plant DAWN – a milestone for more sustainable mobility on the water. -- The over 110-year-old steamboat was symbolically fueled by Synhelion with the first barrel of solar diesel. The solar fuel comes from Synhelion’s first production plant DAWN in Jülich, Germany, which has been producing sustainable, synthetic fuels on an industrial scale since summer 2024. The fuel is fully compatible with conventional combustion engines. This makes SGV the first shipping company in the world to use Synhelion’s solar fuel. The symbolic first fueling took place as part of the launch of SGV’s new premium experience “Legends of Lake Lucerne.”

Renewable fuels key to sustainable shipping

The renewable fuel used in this historic ride was produced at DAWN, Synhelion’s first industrial-scale demonstration plant. With plant DAWN, Synhelion has successfully validated its technology in an industrial setting, proving that the technology is now ready for large-scale deployment. Synhelion uses solar heat to drive a thermochemical process that turns a biogenic carbon source and water into synthetic drop-in fuel, namely sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), gasoline, and diesel. Unlike fossil fuels, Synhelion’s solar fuels are nearly CO2-neutral, emitting only as much CO2 as was used to produce them. Synhelion’s technology presents a solution available today for defossilizing transportation without requiring modifications to existing infrastructure, engines, or vehicles.

SGV a pioneer in shipping

The navigation company plans to regularly purchase solar fuel from Synhelion in the future and has already signed a five-year offtake agreement. As a pioneer customer, SGV is making an important contribution to scaling up Synhelion’s technology. “Sustainability is a key priority for us. Synhelion’s solar fuel offers us a concrete solution to reduce our CO2 emissions,” says Stefan Schulthess, Managing Director of SGV.

Further applications for Synhelion fuels planned

By successfully starting fuel production at its industrial plant DAWN, Synhelion has demonstrated that its technology is ready for market ramp-up. The fuels produced at DAWN will now be gradually introduced into other means of transport to showcase their potential in driving the transition to a net-zero transportation sector. The world’s first motorcycle ride powered by Synhelion’s solar gasoline already took place recently. At the same time, the company is working intensively to expand its production capacities in order to supply commercially relevant quantities of renewable fuels in the future.

The collaboration will use the Port of Rotterdam — Europe’s largest energy port and a key entry point for hydrogen carriers — to transport green fuels from India.

The partnership aims to support the supply of sustainable bunkering fuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). It also includes plans to assess infrastructure needs for terminals in Rotterdam and along the broader European supply chain.

Anil Chalamalasetty, Founder of AM Green and Greenko Group said,

“This partnership is part of our ambitious global growth strategy in green fuels including 5 MTPA of green ammonia and 1 MTPA of SAF. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in establishing a global carbon-free energy ecosystem. It will enable the seamless movement of green molecules and fuels from India to Europe, reinforcing AM Green’s position as a global clean energy transition platform and accelerating industrial decarbonization globally.”

Why India Is Betting Big on Green Hydrogen?

India’s Green Hydrogen Revolution report reveals that the country spends over USD 90 billion each year to meet more than 40% of its energy needs from other countries.

Thus, India is focusing on green hydrogen to reduce its dependence on imported fuels and cut carbon emissions. Furthermore, domestic production would also be cost-effective.

Reaching Emission Goals

India is the world’s third-biggest carbon emitter, responsible for nearly 7% of global CO₂ emissions. Earlier, it had promised to reduce its emissions intensity by 33–35% under the Paris Agreement. Now, the goal is even higher—45% by 2030.

India also aims to be energy independent by 2047 and reach net-zero emissions by 2070. To get there, green hydrogen will play a major role. It’s clean, renewable, and can help the country meet its climate targets while supporting industries.

Notably, green hydrogen is made using renewable energy like solar and wind. It can help power industries and vehicles while lowering the need for imported fossil fuels.

National Green Hydrogen Mission

To support this vision, the Indian government launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission in January 2023. This mission provides a full action plan to grow the green hydrogen sector in India. It includes steps to attract investments, build the needed infrastructure, and promote research and development.

Many countries have already introduced hydrogen strategies as part of their clean energy plans. By moving early, India hopes to become a global leader in green hydrogen production and exports.

With this mission, India is working toward a future that’s cleaner, greener, and more energy secure.

Rotterdam’s Green Gateway Role

The Port of Rotterdam plays a crucial role in energy security and trade for the Netherlands and all of Europe. Thanks to its strategic location, top-tier infrastructure, and excellent inland connections, Rotterdam is a powerhouse for global commerce. The Port Authority is deeply committed to sustainable development, safe port operations, and efficient logistics.

Their long-term goal is to transform Rotterdam into a climate-neutral, future-ready logistics and industrial hub, aligning economic strength with environmental responsibility.

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam Authority, stated,

“We are delighted to collaborate with AM Green BV to further strengthen our commitment to the energy transition. This agreement marks an important step towards establishing a robust supply chain for low-carbon fuels and chemicals. With India’s vast potential for green hydrogen production, combined with Rotterdam’s strategic location and advanced infrastructure, the collaboration will lead to a robust and sustainable green energy supply chain between the two regions.”

Powering the EU’s Net-Zero Target

The supply chain has the potential to export up to 1 million tons of green fuels annually, supporting trade valued at around $1 billion.

Initial production is expected to begin in Kakinada, India. Meanwhile, the Port of Rotterdam will continue its role as Europe’s hydrogen gateway, already handling about 13% of the continent’s energy demand.

Together, AM Green and the Port of Rotterdam are setting the stage for a clean energy corridor that supports India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission and helps Europe hit its climate goals.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2482745469.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:56:44.827593

In other words: It’s not an outright ban throughout the entire county, but it is as it relates to the aquifer.
SP: It’s not just this company under the leadership of X, Y, or Z CEO.
SP: We’re talking about preventing the process of sequestering under the aquifer, but I haven’t seen much talk of how to address things after a leak.
SP: It’s not like these power plants are on renewable energy.","This spring, Smile Politely has been publishing interviews with different organizations that are involved with and knowledgeable about the Mahomet Aquifer and the issues surrounding carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Over the last few months, I’ve interviewed representatives from Prairie Rivers Network (here and here), Prairie Research Institute, and Eco-Justice Collaborative to find out what is going on with the Mahomet Aquifer. I asked about the science and context for the threats to its well being through CCS, and what we can do to keep our sole source aquifer as uncontaminated as possible.

Earlier this year I interviewed Pam Richart, co-director of the Eco-Justice Collaborative. Richart also co-founded the Protect the Mahomet Aquifer collaborative. In part one of our interview, we discussed the Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) carbon capture and sequestration research and development project — that is currently paused — with regards to other CCS projects that are being proposed in the area. In this second and final installment, we talk about potential long term effects of CCS and banning the practice in and around the aquifer.

Just last week, the Illinois House passed a bill to ban CCS in the Mahomet Aquifer; it awaits Governor Pritzker’s signature. Earlier this year, the Champaign County Board decided to place a moratorium on CCS in the county.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Smile Politley: What is EJC’s take on the county board’s decision on a moratorium?

Pam Richart: It was marvelous! It took a long time to get there. Their process is really long. We started in August [2024] for this moratorium that got passed. They did the right thing and we were glad to see it.

SP: What does it mean, exactly?

Richart: A 12-month moratorium will give the county the time it needs to draft an ordinance and that will protect the aquifer. It will ban the injection of CO2 through and storage under the aquifer. By special use you can do it in other parts of the county. In other words: It’s not an outright ban throughout the entire county, but it is as it relates to the aquifer.

That’s something that we’re trying to get other counties to do as well. I’ve been working with Ford County who did a ban the day before Thanksgiving. Their ban prevents injection through; they didn’t get the storage under. The other county is DeWitt. They had prohibited injection in all of their zoning districts. They pretty much did a full ban. It’ll enable them to say: “Not here. If you go here you have to follow our special use criteria. You have to demonstrate that it’s going to be safe, it’s not going to impact water.”

SP: How can people voice their concerns about this?

Richart: What I would like to see is for people talk to their local governments. Folks that I’m working with are talking to Logan County, for example, to see if the first step they would do would be to adopt a resolution that would encourage the state to pass the sole source aquifer ban that we’re talking about. They can talk to their county boards and their elected officials at the municipal level to say please do this. I think that if we have a groundswell of noise from all those who get their water from the aquifer, that’s going to say to the [Illinois] Senate and the House, this isn’t just a few nonprofit organizations who are making noise. These are people who rely on the water.

The other thing they can do is write letters to the editor, and the third thing they can do is to set up meetings and make calls, but also meet with their state rep and the state senators, to say, “I want you to pass this ban. I’m your constituent. I need the water that I’m drinking. You’re probably drinking too. Protect it, right? I’m here to say I care. I’m here to say I expect you to do what’s right by the people here in Central Illinois.”

SP: Is there a way for them to get involved with Eco-Justice Collaborative?

Richart: Oh yeah, heck yeah. We have a multi-county group that meets every Thursday night and we do strategy and get commitments from people to take action. If they’re interested in doing that, that would be great. When there are meetings that are being held — if it’s not far geographically — if you’re in Champaign County, you can go to a meeting in McLean County because we’re going to be talking more with McLean County. [We’re] not quite an hour from Bloomington. Go to their meeting, support the folks who are organizing there. Putting your body on the ground and in those locations would be great.

SP: Where do you see this going in the short- to mid-term?

Richart: I don’t know; it’s going to be exciting. Andrew [Rehn, of Prairie Rivers Network] and I met with Senator Faraci and Governor Pritzker’s Climate Advisor, JC Kibbey, and asked about the governor’s position on the ban. He said he will not oppose it. And he said it was okay to share that information, so I’m sharing it.

Now that doesn’t mean behind the scenes, that he’s not getting all kinds of calls from labor. When you look at what’s at stake for industry here, then I don’t really know where he sits. I think he looks at CCS as a way to attract investments here in Illinois.

SP: It creates jobs, ostensibly.

Richart: Theoretically, it creates jobs. But everything that we’ve looked at, the jobs numbers are always inflated. Everybody says it’s about jobs. Yes, there would be some jobs. You’d have people laying pipe. You’d have people building carbon capture equipment. How many jobs, I think, is crazy. The governor was able to attract a billion dollars to get a hydrogen hub going here with Indiana and Michigan. And then, there’s sustainable aviation fuel.

The interesting thing is that farmers have not wanted CO2 pipelines, do not want sequestration, but they do feel that their markets are being threatened by the electrification of transportation systems. Sustainable aviation fuel, if it’s from ethanol, does require sequestration. And so it’s a very interesting balance in conversations we’re having. It’s like, “I don’t want it here, but it’s okay there.”

Days before Trump took office, the federal government released a rule that would make carbon pipelines safer. And it’s a good rule. It’s got some things that need to be enhanced, but it’s much better than anybody ever hoped for. And now Trump is taking it off the shelf. I don’t imagine it’s going to come back the way it was, and so we’ll all have to work on that.

The EPA [is] going to change under Trump. We’re probably going to look at acceleration and permit review. We’re not going to get anything more stringent. All of this leads to uncertainty. And uncertainty means uncertainty even in the state of Illinois. You have to have post-closure [care, the monitoring of closed sites] for a minimum of 30 years. What happens after that? And who’s reviewing what happens after that? And who’s in charge after that to do that kind of review? And who at the state, after the company goes bankrupt, is going to be able to have the time and the capacity to deal with this stuff?

SP: These are intergenerational issues.

Richart: Oh, they are.

SP: It’s not just this company under the leadership of X, Y, or Z CEO. It’s 30 years, 50 years.

Richart: Navigator CO2 Ventures said in their application, it takes 10,000 years for CO2 in a saline aquifer to become 90% inert. I’ve never read anything except that from them, although I’ve heard that said elsewhere. It’s like a thousand years or more. Under the aquifer, what can happen in a thousand years?

SP: We’re talking about preventing the process of sequestering under the aquifer, but I haven’t seen much talk of how to address things after a leak. Are there conversations being had about what to do to solve some of these problems should things become contaminated?

Richart: I don’t know if there’s anything that can be done. There are filters that remove lead from water. It probably depends on what’s there as to how hard it is and how expensive it is. That would be, at the source where people are drinking it, not necessarily where else it is.

One of the things that we’re looking at is the hydrological connection between an aquifer and a stream or a river. What if the CO2 makes it up and then there’s connectivity with the surface water, and what happens to aquatic life? Nobody’s talking about that. All the scientific papers that I’m reading have to do with the geochemical stuff because there’s a concern, especially in some formations, that over time you’ve got this reactive brine and CO2 and the solution becoming acidic. What will that do over time to a rock? What happens when it gets out and into the water, and they can’t claw it back? That’s the problem. Here we are putting all this crap in our atmosphere to begin with. Now we’re going to say, “We’ve got a problem having it in our atmosphere.” We’ve created a crisis, right? Now we’re going to put it underground where we can create another crisis.

SP: With regard to climate change initiatives.

Richart: Yeah. If we’re trying to meet the target — if we’re trying to keep our species alive, let’s put it that way — we’re still relying on fossil fuels. I think that’s something most people aren’t thinking about. Fossil fuel industry interests are for running the power plants harder, building new plants, building the capture equipment. They know how to do that. They also know how to build the pipeline infrastructure. Although the CO2 pipelines are different for all kinds of reasons, are more prone to running ductile fractures, and they’re more sensitive to water because it forms carbonic acid, which means it leaks, which means you’ve got all this stuff going up in the atmosphere, which displaces oxygen and cars won’t run and people will die.

We’ve got a problem. We’ve got to get our greenhouse gases under control. Capturing carbon does nothing for what’s in the atmosphere already. I think most people think it’s taking it out of the atmosphere. It doesn’t do that. It prevents more from going in. It doesn’t take anything out.

To be able to do CCS, you have to have carbon capture equipment and to run that equipment — you have to build it — there’s a whole life cycle analysis that could be done there. To run it, you have to build a whole new power plant where you’re not capturing the emissions. You use all that energy and you release CO2 doing that, or you have to run it longer and harder. So, and the bottom line is you’re keeping the fossil fuel industry going. At a time when we’re saying we cannot afford to put more carbon in the atmosphere, we’re keeping the fossil fuel industry afloat.

SP: It’s not like these power plants are on renewable energy.",https://www.smilepolitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/484870910_676253538088478_9107323210054892427_n.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 12:56:25.858348

The two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world have made significant commitments to achieving their sustainability goals in the next five years, and where Airbus and Boeing lead, the rest of the aerospace industry follows.","A closer look at what a sustainable future means for Airbus and Boeing.

Sustainability goals for large enterprises are a bit like fitness goals for individuals: ambitious and well-intentioned, but easily put off in the face of more immediate concerns, such as an all-you-can-eat buffet or an executive compensation package consisting mostly of stock options.

The two largest aerospace companies – Airbus and Boeing – both have lofty goals for reducing their carbon emissions and becoming more sustainable, but many of their targets are set for 2050. To put that in perspective, based on average life expectancy in the United States, anyone reading this article today over the age of 53 is unlikely to be alive to see whether or not those targets are achieved.

Apropos of nothing, the average age of a C-suite executive is 56.

So, rather than looking to the far future, let’s focus on the targets for 2030 and what Airbus and Boeing have committed to achieving in sustainability initiatives over the next five years.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in aerospace

While it’s certainly not the only measure of sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – particularly CO2 – is frequently a top line item in the sustainability goals of large enterprises. Airbus and Boeing are no exceptions, with both manufacturers setting targets for their Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.

Scope 1: emissions from sources an organization owns or controls directly

Scope 2: emissions caused indirectly as a result of energy purchased for operations

Scope 3: emissions generated as part of an organization’s supply chain

Airbus has stated that it’s aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 63% and Scope 3 emissions by 46% by 2030, using 2015 as its baseline year. Meanwhile, Boeing has stated that it’s aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 using 2017 as its baseline. The company has also pledged to switch to 100% renewable electricity “purchased directly and via renewable energy credits” by 2030.

For Airbus, that amounts to an average reduction of 4.2% per year for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 3.1% per year for Scope 3 emissions. Coincidentally (but probably not), Boeing’s average annual reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions works out to the same amount: 4.2%.

This puts both companies slightly ahead of the targets from the Paris Agreement in 2015, which settled on a 45% reduction (i.e., 3% annually) in GHG emissions globally by 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel

Arguably the most immediately impactful effort Airbus and Boeing can make involves the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a synthetic jet fuel similar to kerosene but made from renewable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste. According to Airbus, SAF can reduce CO2 equivalent emissions by up to 80% on average compared to traditional jet fuel.

Currently, Airbus aircraft can operate a mixture of up to 50% SAF and traditional jet fuel, but the company has committed to being able to operate on 100% SAF by 2030. Meanwhile, Boeing stated in 2024 that its military aircraft can operate on SAF up to an approved 50% blend limit and has similarly committed to all production commercial airplanes being 100% SAF compatible by 2030.

Of course, there’s a big difference between compatibility and implementation, and a 2023 report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) stated that SAFs accounted for less than 0.1% of all aviation fuels consumed. This may be due, in part, to the fact that SAFs are considerably more expensive than traditional jet fuel – as much as triple the cost, according to some estimates.

Other sustainability efforts in aerospace

Airbus and Boeing have both made a variety of other sustainability commitments. In order of their likelihood to contribute to sustainability over the next five years, these include incorporating recycled parts and materials into new aircraft construction, new propulsion systems that use hydrogen fuel cells or electricity, and investing in carbon capture and storage technologies.

Setting cynicism aside for a moment (with much reluctance), it’s clear that sustainability does matter to the aerospace industry. The two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world have made significant commitments to achieving their sustainability goals in the next five years, and where Airbus and Boeing lead, the rest of the aerospace industry follows.

The product will be commercially available starting August 10 and represents a significant advancement in sustainable fuel technology for the maritime sector, reported Chemanalyst.

Biofuels have been increasingly adopted in shipping due to their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Made from renewable sources such as used cooking oil and agricultural products like grains, biofuels offer a promising path toward greener maritime operations. However, biofuels also present challenges, primarily because of their high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, which make them more prone to oxidative degradation compared to traditional petroleum fuels.

Oxidation leads to the formation of acids and sludge, which can lower fuel quality, reduce engine efficiency, and cause operational issues such as corrosion, blockages, and fouling in fuel systems. To address these problems, Nippon Yuka developed BioxiGuard after thorough analysis of biofuels used in NYK-operated vessels. This specialized antioxidant improves the oxidative stability of marine biodiesel, slowing degradation and helping maintain fuel performance over time.

Laboratory tests showed that adding BioxiGuard at a ratio of 1 part per 500 reduced oxidative degradation by about 50% compared to untreated fuel. This improvement extends the storage life of biofuel onboard ships and supports more reliable and cost-effective operations.

Beyond BioxiGuard, Nippon Yuka continues to develop advanced solutions to tackle challenges associated with marine biofuels, aiming to help ship operators transition to sustainable fuels without sacrificing safety or efficiency.

The launch of BioxiGuard highlights Nippon Yuka’s commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship. By addressing a key barrier to the broader use of marine biodiesel, the product supports the maritime industry’s goals for decarbonization and contributes to a cleaner, more sustainable future for global shipping.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biodiesel-3.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 12:56:50.666385

A majority of the sustainable aviation fuel that will be produced will be exported, said Schueltze.","Once the site of an airfield that trained pilots during World War II, Pecos, Texas is now home to a new plant producing sustainable aviation fuel.

Infinium, a leading producer of commercially available eFuels, has begun construction of Project Roadrunner in Reeves County, near Pecos. Once in operation in 2027, it is expected to become the world's largest eFuewls production facility, producing 23,000 tonnes per year — 7.6 million gallons — of sustainable aviation fuel and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

eFuels are synthetic fuels produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels.

""We do use waste CO2 as an input and have a great partner in Kinetik Holdings,"" said Robert Schuetzle, Infinium chief executive officer.

Project Roadrunner will also provide revenue streams for its oil and gas partners by turning CO2 into a commodity.

He noted the company has built facilities in West Texas before and found it to be a great experience with a great labor market. Reeves County has also been business-friendly, he added.

The project will create a number of jobs in West Texas. Schuetzle said it will create many construction jobs and jobs for its contractors. Long-term, it will create jobs in operations, maintenance, logistics and field management.

Currently under construction, Roadrunner has secured 150 megawatts of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement. Schuetzle said Infinium also has the ability to tap into the electric grid so the plant can run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Infinium selected electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100-megawatt HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have the capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen's chief executive officer and co-founder, told the Reporter-Telegram by email this is the company's first announced project with Infinium and a major milestone for its continued presence in Texas.

""We manufacture our electrochemical stacks in Massachusetts and our plant fabrication and assembly take place in Texas — close to project sites like Roadrunner. This allows our regional manufacturing model to support local industry while accelerating national progress toward clean hydrogen deployment,"" he wrote.

He added that the contract highlights his company's technical innovation and focus on bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen. It also demonstrates that U.S. technology can compete globally and deliver at industrial scale to critical sectors like aviation, trucking and maritime transport.

""Clean hydrogen is happening now and it's being deployed at real scale in real projects, like Project Roadrunner in Texas,"" he wrote. ""The hydrogen economy is here, and Texas workers and manufacturers are key contributors to its continued growth.""

A majority of the sustainable aviation fuel that will be produced will be exported, said Schueltze.

""I see us being similar to the way liquefied natural gas grew — an abundant U.S. resource that generates fuel and exports it,"" he said.

Project Roadrunner will produce aviation fuel but will also produce eDiesel, something Amazon uses in its long-haul trucking fleets, and eNaptha that will be shipped to Europe for use in plastics manufacturing.

It is the company's second Texas facility. In 2023, Infinium became the world's first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi. Schuetzle said the company is looking at other Texas sites.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/static/logo/site_logo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=solid&fill-color=&w=1200&h=627",N,,2025-05-27 10:56:33.505425

If stakeholders act decisively, Japan’s domestic aviation industry can recover and adapt.","Japan is pushing hard to reform the aviation industry in 2025 with its home-based airlines under increased pressure from sustainability-related expenses, continuous supply chain interruptions, and sustained falling demand for passengers. Aeroplanes from around the country are struggling to meet new environmental regulations—as in, sustainable aviation fuel targets—while also grappling with exploding operating expenses fueled by the devalued yen and restricted access to essential plane components. Concurrently, a dwindling and aging population has decreased demand from within the country, especially in regional markets, to make numerous routes unprofitable. These factors combined have compelled government policymakers and stakeholders to speed policy interventions into a beleaguered Japanese domestic aviation market to stabilize and restructure.

Japan’s domestic aviation sector in 2025 faces significant challenges as it navigates economic instability, demographic decline, and rising regulatory demands. The industry, a core component of the country’s transportation infrastructure, struggles to maintain profitability amid rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening passenger demand.

Carriers across Japan, from major airlines to smaller regional operators, find themselves in a turbulent environment that demands rapid adaptation and strategic reform.

Rising Operational Costs Weaken Profitability

Airlines in Japan are dealing with a surge in operational expenses driven by the yen’s depreciation. As fuel, aircraft maintenance, and leasing costs are largely pegged to stronger foreign currencies, domestic carriers are now spending more to keep operations running.

These increased costs pressure margins, especially on domestic routes where ticket prices remain highly competitive. Airlines struggle to raise fares without losing customers, leading to a squeeze on profitability. At the same time, the financial burden limits their ability to invest in new aircraft, advanced technologies, or improved service offerings.

Shrinking and Aging Population Dampens Demand

Japan’s shrinking and aging population continues to shrink the market for domestic air travel. The population fell from 128.5 million in 2010 to about 122.6 million in 2024, and the trend shows no signs of reversal.

Fewer working-age individuals mean fewer business travelers, while the rise in elderly residents reduces demand for frequent travel. Regional routes, which serve smaller cities and rural areas, have seen a significant drop in passenger numbers. These routes become increasingly unsustainable as airlines struggle to fill seats and maintain regular schedules.

Domestic Routes Struggle with Long-Term Profitability

Domestic flights in Japan often operate at a loss. Larger carriers typically rely on international routes to generate profit while absorbing losses from their domestic networks. This strategy has become increasingly fragile as global travel patterns shift post-pandemic.

Without a sharp increase in fares or deep cost reductions, analysts warn that major airlines could face serious losses. The current network model no longer guarantees financial sustainability, especially as demand plateaus and operating expenses rise.

Geopolitical Issues and Supply Disruptions Add Pressure

Global tensions and supply chain disruptions have added new complications. The ongoing closure of Russian airspace has forced airlines to reroute flights to Europe and North America, raising fuel consumption and costs. Though these are international challenges, they impact overall airline budgets, affecting domestic operations as well.

Meanwhile, global supply shortages make it difficult to source aircraft parts, upgrade fleets, or carry out routine maintenance. Airlines now operate with greater uncertainty, as they wait longer for equipment and face higher prices across the board.

Green Targets Introduce New Financial Burdens

Japan’s national goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 requires its airlines to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and reduce carbon footprints. By 2030, carriers must replace 10% of their fuel consumption with SAF.

This transition comes at a high price. SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel, and newer low-emission aircraft require costly investments. For many regional carriers, these green mandates represent an existential challenge as they struggle to meet environmental goals without compromising their financial stability.

Workforce Shortages Threaten Operations

A nationwide labor shortage further threatens the sector. Airlines lack pilots, technicians, and ground staff, as the workforce continues to age and younger professionals avoid aviation careers.

Layoffs during the pandemic broke the talent pipeline, leaving gaps in training and recruitment. Airlines now scramble to attract skilled workers and keep operations running smoothly. This shortage impacts flight schedules, service quality, and the overall passenger experience.

Opportunities Emerge Despite Uncertainty

Despite these headwinds, opportunities exist. Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has launched a task force to develop policies that address systemic weaknesses and support long-term recovery.

Technology could also play a vital role. AI-driven route optimization, predictive maintenance, and fuel-efficient aircraft offer cost-saving potential. Government incentives for regional travel and subsidies for remote areas may also help airlines maintain routes that are currently unprofitable.

Outlook: A Sector at a Crossroads

Japan’s domestic aviation sector stands at a critical point. Airlines must navigate a complex mix of economic, demographic, and environmental challenges while preparing for an uncertain future.

Japan is advancing aviation sector reform in 2025 as domestic airlines struggle with rising sustainability compliance costs, disrupted access to aircraft components, and declining passenger demand caused by an aging, shrinking population. These combined pressures have made many domestic routes financially unsustainable, prompting urgent policy action.

The path forward requires policy reform, innovation, and strategic investment. Airlines must restructure operations, adopt new technologies, and balance sustainability with financial stability.

If stakeholders act decisively, Japan’s domestic aviation industry can recover and adapt. But without immediate action, the sector risks further erosion of its operational capacity and market relevance.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-27T123941473.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:56:37.580967

Variable and costly C1 feedstocks Before advancing with the industrialization of C1 biomanufacturing, it is crucial to assess the availability of feedstocks.
One critical aspect of C1 biomanufacturing is the variability of raw materials, including the supply volume, composition, and cost.
Additionally, TEA can assist in identifying the revenue-maximizing by-product obtained from the C1 biomanufacturing to reduce economic costs78,79,80,81,82.
By adopting these tools, the refined framework would elucidate complex relationships in scaling up C1 biomanufacturing, supporting more informed strategic decision-making.","The historical development of chemical engineering has been fundamental to industrial advancement. Pioneering chemical engineers significantly advanced the field by founding large-scale chemical facilities. These plants have grown essential in several sectors of society, acting as a foundational element of the industry. They have facilitated the commercial manufacture of a diverse range of chemicals, materials, and products that are vital for modern society1. However, the current chemical production processes rely heavily on fossil resources, resulting in a surge of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and resource depletion2. The global economy is connected by fossil fuels, operating under a linear model: from extraction to production, followed by consumption, and ultimately disposal (Fig. 1). In light of growing environmental awareness, it is imperative to pursue alternative circular pathways for a smoother transition from traditional petroleum-based processes to renewable and sustainable routes that can yield the same products. A strategic shift towards recycling of wastes, notably one-carbon (C1) feedstocks, can pave the way for bio-based chemical production, supporting the de-fossilization of chemical processes and enhancing production safety3.

Biomanufacturing utilizes biological systems, including microbes and enzymes, to produce valuable compounds, presenting the potential to substitute fossil-derived chemicals and materials with renewable and drop-in alternatives, while simultaneously sequestering carbon. C1 substrates have emerged as preferred feedstocks in the biomanufacturing sector, gaining attention for their natural abundance, cost-effectiveness, and potential to reduce the impacts of climate change, particularly when accessed as industrial by-products4. This shift represents a promising strategy for achieving sustainable and eco-friendly chemical production, as shown in Fig. 1. A sustainable system employing C1 resources can be integrated into circular processes with minimal waste. The formation of a circular bioeconomy reliant on C1 feedstocks requires the development of entirely novel industrial processes. However, the implementation of C1 resource upcycling technologies is currently limited to laboratory or pilot scales, hampered by various techno-economic challenges5. Addressing these barriers requires the development of sustainable, cost-effective solutions along with collaboration among key stakeholders6.

To effectively design a sustainable and economically viable future based on the upcycling of C1 resources, it is essential to focus on two primary objectives (Fig. 1): (1) identifying and addressing the techno-economic driving forces that hinder the industrialization of biomanufacturing from C1 substrates; and (2) developing strategies to mitigate the environmental risks associated with this technological transition.

To assess and evaluate C1 biomanufacturing for producing platform chemicals and to identify the principal economic obstacles to industrialization, we selected established C1 biomanufacturing case studies and conducted a comprehensive TEA and LCA, as depicted in Fig. 2b. 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a significant building block and platform chemical, functioning as a valuable monomer and precursor for bioplastic synthesis15,16. Numerous microbiological strains have exhibited the capacity to synthesis 3-HP17,18, prompting several corporations to develop pilot facilities for its production; however, commercialization has not yet been realized15. The potential cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits of bio-based 3-HP synthesis make its practical implementation highly anticipated. Hence, we propose two sustainable synthesis routes for producing 3-HP from C1 feedstocks (Fig. 3): (1) a two-stage biological system utilizing steel mill off-gas17, and (2) an integrated hybrid approach combining electrochemical conversion of atmospheric CO2 to methanol with subsequent microbial conversion to 3-HP18 (Supplementary Figs. 1–3, Supplementary Tables 1–9, Supplementary Notes 1–2). The latter route employs solar-driven renewable energy to power electricity-generating green hydrogen, a key reactant for transforming CO2 into methanol. This methanol then serves as the substrate for microbial biosynthesis of 3-HP, establishing a fully renewable pathway19. Production parameters for both routes are derived from validated laboratory or pilot-scale data17,18,19,20,21, with detailed assumptions on yield, energy inputs, and costs provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Low carbon yield of C1 utilization

Despite noteworthy advancements in utilizing C1 feedstocks for biomanufacturing via engineered microorganisms or electrocatalyst technologies, the overall carbon conversion rate remains inadequate for meeting the techno-economic requirements essential for industrialization. A number of reviews have thoroughly examined various conversion technologies and provided examples for C1 valorization22,23,24. Our results derived from Aspen Plus, a widely recognized process modelling software, demonstrate that the C1 feedstock-to-chemical conversion efficiency for both bio-cascade and electro-bio-cascade routes remains below 10% (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 3), relatively lower than the efficiency achieved by conventional fossil-derived routes25. While C1 utilization offers considerable potential, the challenges of low carbon yields must be addressed for the successful transformation of traditional petroleum refinery systems into 3G biomanufacturing.

From a techno-economic standpoint, the low carbon-to-product yield in C1-to-chemical systems presents a major barrier to economic viability. This issue leads to increased capital expenditures (CAPEX) by requiring larger-scale infrastructure to offset productivity losses as additional (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Note 4). For example, the scale of sterilization infrastructure necessary for bioreactors and associated pipelines must expand proportionally to meet the rising demand for increased bioreactor capacity driven by low carbon yield. Moreover, limited carbon yields need a greater supply of C1 raw materials to produce equivalent quantities of chemicals, directly inflating total operating expenditures (OPEX). Economic analyses of converting C1 feedstocks into fuels or chemicals through biological fermentation consistently underscore the need for significant investment in bioreactors10,26,27,28, which represent the largest expenditures in equipment and installation. For instance, the fermentation-related equipment in our case study accounted for the highest equipment costs in the production of acrylic acid from CO, more than 92% (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, Supplementary Tables 10 and 11, Supplementary Note 5). The expenses associated with fermentation systems are closely tied to the productivity of the target product and the operational fermentation volume required. Optimizing the performance of cell factories to enhance carbon conversion efficiency represents a promising avenue for improving yields and minimizing costs related to bioreactor procurement26,29.

Variable and costly C1 feedstocks

Before advancing with the industrialization of C1 biomanufacturing, it is crucial to assess the availability of feedstocks. In contrast to the established supply chain for crude oil, C1 biomanufacturing encounters challenges due to the decentralized nature of C1 resources. A thorough economic analysis is essential prior to scaling up operations in order to address regional variations in availability and quantity effectively. For instance, the production of stranded CH4 from various industrial sources in the United States varies significantly, with wastewater treatment plants averaging less than one ton per day and landfills averaging 31 tons per day10. The variations result in variable market potentials for the same technology, driven by economies of scale. Larger production capacities tend to be more cost-effective, emphasizing that the variability in availability or composition of C1 feedstocks introduces greater economic risks compared to conventional petrochemical refineries, which benefit from a centralized and continuous supply chain.

In addition, the pricing of chemicals is sensitive to fluctuations in raw material costs, with fossil-based chemicals often following change in the prices of their crude oil-derived precursors30,31. In traditional biomanufacturing, the cost of raw materials, including sugar-based feedstocks from the 1st generation and biomass-based feedstocks from the 2nd generation, accounts for around 50% of the total OPEX of a biomanufacturing32,33. Likewise, our research finds that the expense of CO and CO2 feedstocks accounts for the predominant share (exceeding 57%) of OPEX (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, Supplementary Tables 12 and 13). The preceding discussion indicates that the advancement of technology enabling the utilization of waste streams as raw materials will enhance the economic viability of C1 biomanufacturing by providing a more cost-effective feedstock source34, such as food waste26, municipal solid waste35,36, and biomass34,37.

The utilization of C1 feedstocks as carbon substrates for chemical production holds significant potential for improving sustainability. However, current investment priorities continue to favor conventional petroleum refineries, which benefit from superior cost competitiveness, reliable material supply chains, and lower financial risks. Nowadays, chemicals derived from C1 feedstocks currently face a higher minimum selling price than that of fossil-based alternatives (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Supplementary Note 6). To overcome these obstacles, we propose a roadmap to accelerate the transition from lab-scale innovation to industrial-scale C1 biomanufacturing, which structured around four strategic steps as detailed below (Fig. 4).

Technology advances to accelerate commercialization

Technological advancements aimed at improving carbon conversion efficiency are critical for reducing both equipment and feedstock costs, facilitating an accelerated shift from laboratory study to industrial-scale application. A promising approach involves the development of cell factories with industrial characteristics, concentrating on enhancing the efficiency of metabolic pathways and the robustness of engineered strains as depicted in Supplementary Figs. 7b, c. However, numerous challenges persist in improving carbon conversion rates within synthetic biology. Notably, the effective integration of heterologous C1-utilization pathways into native systems is essential38,39. Current limitations, such as inadequate acceptors, cofactors, and enzymes, constrain the efficient use of feedstocks in engineered strains40,41,42,43. Additionally, managing the tolerance of these strains in the presence of toxic feedstocks and intermediates requires attention44,45,46. Microorganisms should be capable of adapting rapid changes in the environment of large bioreactors, which include elevated levels of toxic products44. Besides, integrating the concept of Industry 4.0, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, into C1 biomanufacturing is vital for advancing our understanding of microbial cells and streamlining workflows for predicting optimized strains47,48,49.

Building on the “liquid sunshine” concept, coupling electrocatalysis with biocatalysis provides a practical way to enhance carbon utilization efficiency, thereby increasing economic potential50. Our TEA shows that electro-biocatalytic cascades could reduce production costs by up to 39% compared to traditional bioprocesses (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Supplementary Note 6). The potential for CO2-based biomanufacturing is further amplified by advances in direct air capture (DAC) technology. With commercial-scale DAC operations entering the market, the sourcing cost of CO2 is expected to decline51,52,53. Targeted R&D efforts focused on sorbent optimization, energy demand reduction, and supporting policies will be crucial in driving down costs51,54,55,56. In addition, developing new cathode materials, electrolytes, and modular reactor designs, along with gaining mechanistic insights into reaction mechanisms, remains essential for improving catalyst performance and product selectivity57,58.

Currently, the efficiency of microbial-based valorization processes does not match the theoretical yields of traditional petroleum-based alternatives22,59,60. For instance, in two different tandem systems utilizing CO and electrocatalytically processed CO2, the production yields of 3-HP are 0.21 g·g−1 and 0.23 g·g−1, corresponding to 21% and 25% of the theoretical yields, respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, sugar-based processes closely approach their theoretical yields28,61. Our single-point sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 6) demonstrates that increasing the CO-derived 3-HP yield from 0.21 g·g−1 to 0.35 g·g−1 reduces the minimum selling price from $6.09 kg−1 to $3.66 kg−1. Similarly, elevating CO2-derived 3-HP yield from 0.23 g·g−1 to 0.29 g·g−1 decreases minimum selling price by 20%. These findings indicate that higher yields can significantly improve the chances of successful commercialization. Although the technologies explored thus far, along with recent findings, remain a distance from our ideal targets, there is strong optimism that continued advancements can help bridge this gap in the near future.

Cooperate more for C1 feedstock supply stability

To improve the feedstock supply stability of C1 biomanufacturing and overcome existing constraints, a key strategy is to encourage collaboration among stakeholders and research institutions to increase the availability of carbon sources. While advancements in technology have the potential to address issues concerning carbon conversion rates, the inconsistency in the quantity and quality of C1 resources remains a significant barrier to the effective implementation of C1 bioconversion technologies. Gaining direct access to more affordable and reliable carbon sources can help mitigate these challenges. Strengthening partnerships between stakeholders and research institutions requires three key components: feedstock supply, joint technology development, and profit sharing. Industrial partners, particularly raw material suppliers for C1 biomanufacturing, are essential for ensuring feedstock reliability10. Academic and R&D institutions should drive innovations in process efficiency and carbon yield to advance industrial scalability. Lastly, transparent profit-sharing mechanisms and non-financial incentives are important to balance common interests. As technology advances and productivity increases, the availability of carbon resources will improve, which will attract more investment and create a positive cycle, thus consequently accelerating the adoption of low-carbon biomanufacturing platforms.

Strategic collaboration between investors and technology innovators is essential for securing C1 feedstocks, such as syngas, mine gas, abandoned petroleum-derived gas, and methane hydrates62,63,64. A practical approach to maximize resource efficiency involves integrating underutilized streams from industry, agriculture, mining, and urban waste management. Localized adaptation of these feedstocks, particularly those discarded or scattered across regions, can stabilize supply chains and improve the reliability of on-site conversion technologies62,63,64. An example of this approach was developed by Lanzatech, which leveraged anaerobic acetogens to transform syngas into jet fuel65 and collaborated with China Shougang Group Co. Ltd. on a 10,000-ton commercial project in 2024 to biosynthesize ethanol from steel mill gas, demonstrating a scalable model for industrial de-fossilization. Besides, China’s “liquid sunshine” initiative, developed by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and industrial partners, employs solar power, water electrolysis, and CO2-to-methanol catalysis to showcase renewable methanol production, aligning with C1 biomanufacturing goals21. These successful commercialization efforts underscore that addressing the sourcing and availability challenges of C1 feedstocks through cooperation with upstream industries can accelerate the industrialization of C1 biomanufacturing.

Leveraging carbon tax policies to raise income

Recent research in synthetic biology and fermentation engineering indicates that C1 biomanufacturing is well-positioned to contribute to carbon capture and sequestration66,67,68. For example, research indicates that the photoautotrophic microbes (such as Synechococcus elongatus) may convert CO2 into useful chemicals via biomanufacturing, resulting in an overall reduction of −17.20 to −1219.03 tons CO2-equivalent to produce 1 ton of end products69,70,71. Various studies have highlighted the potential positive effects of carbon tax policies on the development of biomanufacturing72,73,74. Under cap-and-trade systems, industries exceeding emissions limits need to purchase allowances, while those operating below thresholds generate tradable credits through carbon utilization initiatives75,76. This market-driven mechanism enables cross-sector credit transfers, thereby enhancing the economic viability of carbon-negative C1 biomanufacturing by turning revenue streams for emission reductions.

The European Union’s Emission Trading System permits participating facilities to trade in CO2 allowances, with permit prices escalating from €24 to over €100 per ton of CO2 between 2020 and 202372, and the CO2 price is expected to rise rapidly in light of the imminent worldwide de-fossilization objectives. The economic benefits of carbon pricing mechanisms are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Note 7. As carbon credits increase from $0 to $1000 per ton, the break-even price of the final product decreases by more than 22%, signifying considerable positive consequences. Hence, as C1 biomanufacturing improves its carbon conversion efficiency from feedstocks to target products, the transition from laboratory research to large-scale applications will gain momentum due to the prospective revenue from carbon tax policies. This progression underscores the importance of supportive policy frameworks in realizing a sustainable future for biomanufacturing.

Techno-economic analysis to decrease investment risks

In moving toward a viable industrial C1 biomanufacturing, it is necessary to conduct a TEA to identify key factors that affect return on investment. This analysis allows for adjustments to risk elements during the early stages of project development, thereby facilitating the incorporation of new technology into industrial production processes. By pinpointing areas that require optimization or modification of process parameters, TEA plays a crucial role in significantly reducing investment risks77. One critical aspect of C1 biomanufacturing is the variability of raw materials, including the supply volume, composition, and cost. TEA can assess the influence of carbon source supply on production investment. Through computational simulations, potential risks can be identified and addressed before practical implementation, enabling more informed decision-making regarding resource management (Supplementary Fig. 7). Additionally, TEA can assist in identifying the revenue-maximizing by-product obtained from the C1 biomanufacturing to reduce economic costs78,79,80,81,82. For example, cell mass generated during fermentation can be marketed as single-cell protein or transformed into fertilizer26. When determining the most beneficial by-product to pursue, it is essential to consider not just its market value but also the investment required for its treatment and processing. Employing a TEA allows investors to effectively navigate the downstream dimensions of the process and make informed choices that enhance value. By utilizing an “investment-return” framework, stakeholders can better manage the economic variables intrinsic to C1 biomanufacturing operations, leading to more sustainable and profitable practices in the industry.

Following the fundamental “investment-return” framework, the integration of latest methodological advancements can make TEA more precise. For example, integrating uncertainty analysis, such as Monte Carlo methods77, could enable systematic assessment of parameter sensitivity and variability, thus improving the reliability of TEA outcomes. Additionally, advanced data analysis techniques, like Pareto curve analysis to identify the best balance between different performance goals or targeted process optimization to maximize system efficiency, could yield practical insights83. By adopting these tools, the refined framework would elucidate complex relationships in scaling up C1 biomanufacturing, supporting more informed strategic decision-making.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-60247-w/MediaObjects/41467_2025_60247_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-05-27 05:56:08.710449

Rotterdam, Netherlands, 16th May 2025, 7am CET – Swiss aviation technology company Metafuels AG is to develop a new synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) production plant in the Port of Rotterdam, marking another key milestone in the commercial deployment of its proprietary aerobrew methanol-to-jet technology.

Metafuels and Evos Rotterdam are working together to take the next steps to progress the development of the project. Evos is a leading liquid energy and chemicals storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol – its planned production facility in Denmark. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

Metafuels’ rapid growth is fuelled by strong investment support. In just over two years, the company has raised $22 million, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, making it one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe. It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonisation is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative e-SAF pathways.

Affordable, scalable production of e-SAF

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion. The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes.

The justification for such technology is clear. The aviation sector accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions—some 800 million tonnes. When accounting for additional greenhouse gases and complex climate co-factors resulting from the nature and altitude of emissions, the sector’s total contribution to global warming rises to approximately 3.5%.

aerobrew SAF plants can process bio-methanol or e-methanol interchangeably, allowing the production of bio-SAF or e-SAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals.

Bio-methanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while e-SAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonisation.

Scaling SAF production in line with global and EU mandates

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a Final Investment Decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or e-fuels, driven by strong regulatory support. Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050.

Saurabh Kapoor, CEO of Metafuels, commented:

We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its commercial deployment.

“We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Christiaan Kop, Managing Director at Evos Rotterdam, commented:

Metafuels is addressing one of the aviation sector’s most urgent challenges.

“With our robust infrastructure, utilities, and operational expertise, we are poised to support the deployment of Metafuels’ sustainable aviation fuel project. This cooperation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the implementation of scalable, efficient solutions that will drive the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.”

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO Port of Rotterdam, commented:

We are delighted that Metafuels, as an innovative producer of e-SAF, has chosen Rotterdam for the development of a new production facility.

“We welcome their collaboration with Evos, allowing Metafuels to use Evos’ existing methanol infrastructure. This development contributes to the climate goals for aviation and further strengthens Rotterdam’s position as a leading hub for renewable fuels.”

(UPM, Helsinki, May 27, 2025 at 11:00 EEST) – Following extended technical, commercial and strategic evaluations UPM plans to discontinue the development of its potential second biomass-to-fuels refinery at the Port of Rotterdam. As a result, UPM plans to halt all engineering work related to the CAPEX investment in Rotterdam and to withdraw from all site-related commitments associated with the Rotterdam investment.

At the same time, UPM will continue to seek growth in biofuels by advancing the development of proprietary technologies enabling the extension of feedstock options to other forms of competitive and sustainable biomass and the work related to the qualification and commercialization of Crude Tall Oil (CTO)-derived UPM biofuels for jet engine fuels.

”Renewable fuels and renewable chemicals are the central elements of UPM’s long-term growth in decarbonization solutions. The Lappeenranta biofuels biorefinery will remain the nucleus of our growing biofuels platform”, says Harald Dialer, Executive Vice President, UPM Biorefining and Technology.

Aligned with this strategic direction, UPM is focusing on three targeted growth areas in its biofuels business:

Evaluating the potential to debottleneck the Lappeenranta Biorefinery in order to capture low capex expansion opportunities and further leverage the strong market performance of CTO-derived biofuels.

Enabling the qualification of CTO-derived UPM biofuels as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This strategic direction is supported by successful SAF trials conducted with Austrian aircraft manufacturer Diamond Aircraft using Austro Engine propulsion, and by continued progress in the technical acceptance process at the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), where results from trials and stakeholder reviews have been consistently positive.

Continuing feedstock technology development to qualify and enable the use of additional competitive and sustainable biomass, supporting the cost-efficient production of high-quality biofuels for both road and aviation applications.

“We continue seeing strong long-term market potential for biomass-based fuels, especially in Europe, where greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments continue driving the need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels across transport modes but specifically in road and aviation”, says Harald Dialer. “Our biofuels portfolio is well-positioned through our access to strategic feedstocks, its superior GHG savings potential and strong regulatory acceptance. We are in an advanced position to deliver scalable commercial growth with sustainable biofuels.”

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable.

The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.","The “Big, Beautiful Bill” that Republicans are pushing under President Trump would roll back almost all the clean energy incentives that Democrats enacted under President Biden, shredding federal support for solar, wind, nuclear, electric vehicles, and other climate-friendly technologies. But it would make a lavish exception for one supposedly green form of energy that isn’t green at all: farm-grown jet fuels.

Aviation, which generated about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, is a notoriously difficult sector to decarbonize, and the U.S. aviation industry has committed to using so-called “sustainable aviation fuels” to reach its net-zero climate goals. But using crops like corn and soybeans to produce fuel instead of food not only increases food prices and global hunger, it spurs farmers around the world to tear down more forests and plow up more grasslands to create new farmland to replace the lost food. That’s why farm-grown biofuels have been a climate problem masquerading as a climate solution for cars, and they would have the same problem in planes.

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable. That would be like banning consideration of smokestack emissions when calculating which power plants are sustainable. And in legislation that otherwise slashes energy spending, the biofuels giveaway would cost U.S. taxpayers an extra $45 billion.

The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because its land-use effects are so devastating.

But such is the power of U.S. agricultural interests, which are increasingly worried that electric vehicles will crush demand for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel on the road and have been furiously lobbying Washington to create new demand in the sky. In case there was any confusion about the purpose of the biofuels provision, it’s not in the energy policy section of the Big Beautiful Bill: It’s in the section that claims to “Make Rural America Grow Again.”

The political twist is that it’s not just a Republican provision. While the overall bill has no Democratic supporters, and even some Republicans have objected to its assault on other energy subsidies, the biofuels carve-out has strong backing from farm-friendly Democrats, who created the original tax credit for SAFs in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. There’s always been broad bipartisan support for the federal mandate requiring corn ethanol to be blended into gasoline, and even though the overall Big Beautiful Bill aims to dismantle Biden’s climate policies and extend Trump’s tax cuts, its biofuels language was lifted from a bipartisan “Farm to Fly” bill explicitly designed to get ethanol to qualify for SAF credits of up to $1.75 a gallon.

“It’s shocking but it’s not surprising,” says Dan Lashof, a climate scientist and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. “Agriculture has an extremely well-oiled lobbying machine. So even as Congress guts all these things that reduce emissions to save money, they get Congress to spend lots of money to expand the one thing that increases emissions.”

The impacts on the global landscape could be dramatic. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute concluded that producing about 10 percent of U.S. jet fuel from SAF by 2030 — an explicit Biden Administration goal — would require about half the U.S. soybean crop, occupying enough farmland to cover the state of Nebraska. Princeton senior research scholar Tim Searchinger has calculated that using vegetable oils like soybean for one fourth of global aviation fuel would require 40 percent of global cropland, an area twice the size of India. Flying a plane with corn ethanol would be particularly inefficient; it takes 1.7 gallons of ethanol to make a gallon of jet fuel, and producing ethanol uses almost as much fossil fuel as ethanol replaces.

The world is already losing a soccer field worth of tropical forest every six seconds, most of it to agricultural expansion, and heightened demand for feedstocks like corn, soy, canola, and palm could overrun vast swaths of forests and undeveloped land, releasing its sequestered carbon and eliminating its ability to absorb atmospheric carbon in the future. The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because the land-use effects are so devastating, but even when Biden was still president, the U.S. farm lobby was fighting to make sure that didn’t happen here.

Currently, most of the world’s aviation fuel classified as sustainable is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly.

At one Biden cabinet meeting in 2023, agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack handed treasury secretary Janet Yellen a one-page briefing document, flagging it as a high-priority issue. Yellen’s high-priority issues usually involved inflation, threats of recession, and global economic crises, so she was perplexed to read a page of acronym-laden biofuels-industry talking points about the methodological superiority of the GREET computer model over the CORSIA model for calculating carbon emissions from ILUC.

“Can someone tell me what this is about?” she later asked her top aides.

It was about billions of dollars, because the CORSIA model put enough emphasis on “indirect land-use change,” known as ILUC, to make crop-based aviation fuels ineligible for tax credits, while the farm-friendly GREET model downplayed ILUC enough to give corn and soybeans a chance to look sustainable. The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.

As I recount in my forthcoming book We Are Eating the Earth, the working group held weekly meetings that were clearly less about improving climate analytics than justifying the creation of a lucrative new market for farmers. “Nobody talked about the elephant in the room,” one administration official recalled. “It was theater of the absurd.”

The GREET modeling implied that all of Iowa’s corn production could be converted to ethanol while inducing virtually no farmers anywhere on Earth to expand their fields to grow more grain, but the results didn’t have to make sense when Biden was declaring at an Iowa ethanol plant that “we want to see facilities like this all over the Midwest.”

In 2024, the Biden administration agreed to use GREET — and since even GREET didn’t make ethanol look quite climate-friendly enough to qualify for credits, Vilsack secured several additional conditions that made the model even more favorable for farm-grown fuels. He barely even pretended the decision was driven by science in his public statement, hailing it as “a great beginning as we develop new markets for… home-grown agricultural crops.” The initial U.S. biofuels mandate for cars, in 2007, unleashed a torrent of deforestation in the Amazon, but Nikita Pavlenko, director of fuels and aviation for the International Coalition for Clean Transportation, says the farm lobby’s influence in Washington helped persuade the White House to ignore fears of a reprise. “We spent two years wrangling,” he says, “and in the end everyone who wanted to take land-use change seriously got steamrolled.”

It’s hard to imagine politicians bucking the powerful agriculture lobby over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change.

Today, only 0.3 percent of the world’s aviation fuel is classified as sustainable: Most of it is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly because it doesn’t use farmland or spur deforestation. United Airlines has an ad campaign touting its commitment to making SAF from waste instead of crop-grown feedstock, featuring Oscar the Grouch as its “Chief Trash Officer.” Environmentalists also hope to see planes fly on “green hydrogen” produced with clean energy; pongamia oil made from the seed of a climate-friendly tropical tree; and electricity, at least for short-haul flights.

But for the airlines, the most scalable alternative fuel opportunity would be subsidized crop-based fuels, which is why they have joined farm interests to push the current Congress to extend the SAF credit and make it even easier for farm-grown SAF to qualify. The Biden team had already diminished the role of indirect land-use change in its emissions analyses — the critics say its ILUC value should have been at least five times higher, and perhaps 40 times higher — and the U.S. has already built enough biorefineries since 2021 to increase its production capacity for crop-based SAF sixfold. Still, the industry lobbyists wanted to make sure that ILUC would pose no threat whatsoever to fuels brewed from crops, and they got what they wanted on page 208 of the Big Beautiful Bill: “the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land-use change.”

This is like Congress dictating that financial regulators can’t look at how much banks owe their creditors when determining whether they’re solvent; one environmentalist compared the provision to a legislative decree that pi equals nine.

“There’s a lot of hype about how this kind of legislation can jumpstart SAF and make a lot of money for farmers, and I think that’s right,” says Dan Blaustein-Rejto, who runs the Breakthrough Institute’s food and agriculture program. “I just don’t think that’s good.”

Abraham Lincoln liked to tell a riddle: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg? His answer was four: A tail is still a tail, even if you call it a leg. And using farmland to grow fuel still induces the expansion of farmland elsewhere to grow more food, even if emissions analysts aren’t allowed to acknowledge those indirect land-use changes. The brazen ban on even evaluating indirect land-use change could create problems for airlines that want to sell carbon credits for using alternative fuels, since a Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, funded by Jeff Bezos, is working with environmental groups to make sure the credits are scientifically credible. But it’s not clear how much buyers like Microsoft and Meta really care about scientific credibility.

In any case, the biofuels lobby tends to get its way in Washington. The Biden administration issued an “emergency waiver” to get more ethanol blended into gasoline last summer, and the Trump administration plans to issue the same waiver this summer. The first specific item the Trump White House mentioned in a May 8 press release hailing its preliminary trade deal with the U.K. was increased access for U.S. ethanol, with celebratory quotes from the U.S. Grains Council, the Renewable Fuels Association, and the National Corn Growers Association. Those groups have a lot of influence, and it’s hard to imagine politicians bucking them over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change in life-cycle analyses.

“It’s hard to build a constituency for addressing an issue that seems so technical,” Lashof says. “And even if we could, it’s even harder to fight the farm lobby.”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/Corn-Ethanol_AP-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1748014090&s=ed5aa80ddb2b10abdc07d70ef2239b72,N,,2025-05-27 06:00:52.975778

SAF is made from sustainable biomass, such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil, municipal solid waste, and non-food biomass. In recent years, SAF has emerged as the central solution to combat carbon neutrality and global climate objectives. The need for enhancing regulatory support, net-zero commitments by the aviation industry, and increased investments in SAF manufacturing technologies drive sustainable growth within this market globally.

Neste (Finland), Shell (UK), TotalEnergies (France), OMV Group (Austria), and World Energy, LLC (UK) are some of the key players operating in the sustainable aviation fuel market. These key players offer connectivity applicable to various sectors and have well-equipped and strong distribution networks across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America.

The business & general aviation segment is estimated to account for the second-largest share in 2025.

Based on aircraft type, the sustainable aviation fuel market is categorized into commercial aviation, military aviation, business & general aviation, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The business & general aviation segment is projected to account for the second-largest market share in the sustainable aviation fuel market. Business & general aviation, which covers charter flights, private jets, and non-commercial aircraft, has increased its focus on carbon footprint.

As a result, operators and manufacturers are increasingly turning to SAF to meet regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for greener operations. To serve regulatory mandates and customer expectations for cleaner aviation, operators and manufacturers prefer SAF as their solution. Major business jet companies, such as Bombardier, Gulfstream, and Dassault, are actively promoting SAF adoption by certifying their aircraft for SAF compatibility and incorporating it into operations. With the growth of the commercial aviation industry as the largest consumer of SAF, quick uptake and significant per-flight fuel consumption of business and general aircraft are projected to boost the segment's growth during the forecast period.

The airliner segment is estimated to account for the largest share in 2025.

Based on end user, the airliner segment is estimated to be the largest market by 2025 due to the ongoing expansion of air travel for tourism and business purposes. Airlines are expanding their fleets and replacing older aircraft with more efficient and technologically superior to meet increasing passenger volumes and environmental requirements. In addition, the need for new routes and higher frequencies of flights is fueling investments in aircraft acquisition, maintenance, and onboard services, all of which contribute to the market strength of the airliner segment.

Furthermore, the airliner segment benefits significantly from substantial economies of scale and long-term strategic alliances with manufacturers and service providers. Airlines increasingly focus on improving passenger experience and operational efficiency through digitalization, such as integrating AI, IoT, and advanced analytics. With these developments, the airliner segment is set to continue its position as an aviation industry leader, contributing the largest share of the SAF market.

Europe is estimated to account for the second-largest share in 2025.

Europe is projected to account for the second-largest market due to robust regulatory support, aggressive climate policies, and a well-developed aviation infrastructure. The European Union has been leading the way in supporting SAF through measures like the ReFuelEU Aviation proposal, which requires rising SAF blending ratios over time. Moreover, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) encourages airlines to lower emissions further, compelling carriers to use cleaner fuel options such as SAF.

The Netherlands, France, Germany, and the UK are already investing in SAF production plants and setting up supply chains to cater to future demand. The presence of major SAF producers, such as SkyNRG and Neste, also characterizes Europe. In addition, European airlines are increasingly using SAF in aircraft as fuel, increasing their availability to commercial and general aviation planes. These collective efforts and infrastructure preparedness make Europe the second-largest market share in 2025.

“And so, you’ve got a really clear competitive landscape.” For ACR, camelina meal is just as exciting as, if not more than, the oil.","John Cusick has seen many doors open and close in his 20-year career in biofuels. The most recent of these has been the opportunity to serve as CEO of Ash Creek Renewables, a renewable fuel feedstock startup based in Connecticut. ACR is making steady progress, its most recent milestone being the securing of exclusive licensing rights from Montana State University for a high-performance camelina seed variety.

Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a nonfood oilseed variety that is low-carbon and high-energy, requiring very little input and providing a secondary revenue stream for farmers. Camelina shows significant drought and spring freezing tolerance, a resistance to flea beetles, and potential to serve as a beneficial addition to small grain crop rotations, according to MSU. And ACR is just getting started. “We were patient to share what we’ve come up with and what we think we have until we got there,” Cusick says. “We effectively have one of the two new camelina seed licenses Montana State has developed and issued into the private sector, with Sustainable Oils, who has been in Montana for 13 years, getting the other one.

“That was a very big win for a new company and market entrant,” Cusick says. “But the real win for us isn’t the license as much as the opportunity we found for the [camelina] industry with the bioplastics IP, because that is what unlocks the opportunity to scale camelina and create meaningful volumes of camelina oil to decarbonize aviation fuel.”

Maneuvering the Field

Ash Creek’s story begins with Cusick’s previous work in the biomass-based diesel veins of several commodity and renewable energy companies. Many of the insights he’d learn on the business and trade side of the industry would carry into his next venture as a senior analyst and co-owner of The Jacobsen Publishing. “I’m a biodiesel caveman who’s trying to find his way into the innovative future of the world,” Cusick says. “I have a lot of history and experience running large biodiesel trading, large ag reach, heavy trading boots, and dancing amongst the credits and all the various moving pieces of that world for most of my career.

“Ash Creek was founded as I was selling The Jacobsen,” he continues. “While I was doing that, I was starting to get some feelers from the usual recruiters, and there were a bunch of jobs starting to pop up for strategy guys who understood feedstock markets and renewable fuels.”

Cusick called on his connections in private equity from his time at The Jacobsen, resulting in ACR. A young startup, ACR put its eggs in several baskets of interest; this broad excitement paid off when Tailwater Capital, a private equity firm, absorbed ACR. “I had this really amazing couple of years of work with The Jacobsen that parlayed beautifully into strategy and insights into how to build the midstream company between those converted sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and [renewable diesel] refineries and the feedstock origination,” he says. “So that was our very narrow focus with Ash Creek. The shift in biomass was diesel to biodiesel to renewable diesel and into SAF, and there were these huge refineries being converted that have traditionally been fed by pipelines and big ships,” he explains. “These whole new supply chains would need to be created to feed these other agricultural inputs, so that was the thesis.”

To begin with, ACR worked on soybean oil. “We had an enzymatic process on the Mississippi River for soybean oil, and we were taking all the metals out of crude soybean oil, making it perfect for renewable diesel, shipping it down to Diamond Green,” Cusick continues. A significant drop in the soy industry due to Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits crashing encouraged ACR to switch its focus to something greater.

“We started ... at 10 feedstocks, and where we are two years later is looking at two,” Cusick says. “We’ve narrowed our focus to used cooking oil because it’s so relevant and so highly valued, and it’s liquid so we can participate today. And then the other high mark we went to is camelina—that’s been something I’ve been excited about since 2007.”

Cusick cites ACR’s next-generation feedstock lead, Mike Logan, as crucial to the success of ACR and its acquisition of camelina. “We came in [to Ash Creek] with a really, really strong team and set of practical experience that we thought was unique in the market, and we continued to build that out over the past couple years,” Cusick says.

A Seed of Many Uses

Camelina has been a hot topic at MSU since its first appearance on campus in 2004 when the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, a team of faculty and staff focused on crop and animal production research and outreach programs, began its initial work on the crop. MSU’s focus on the oilseed has been broad since the start, and its work has resulted in the earning of several grants in the process. “We believe [camelina’s] necessary. We believe that to decarbonize stuff, you must have the readily available starting points like camelina catch on fire, because the food versus fuel debate will stop SAF, and there aren’t enough waste oils that can be protected from fraud and supply chain authenticity,” Cusick says. “It’s gotta be camelina. I don’t see another option. I don’t know what camelina’s lifespan is before something better comes, but it’s the only thing that’s baked into EPA pathways, and it’s the logical starting point right now.”

It’s camelina’s oil percentage that truly sets it apart from other oilseeds. MSU reports a 30% to 40% oil content on a dry matter basis, which offers a pathway to biofuel production for tracks like SAF. But despite its impressive numbers, the seed’s oil content doesn’t solve everything—it instead makes things a little more interesting. “It’s impossible to scale camelina oil purely on the available credit stack that’s there today,” Cusick explains. “Now, the credit stack started to really shine 10 years ago, when the carbon intensity (CI) value of 16 was attributed to camelina bicarb. That’s when the lights came on for camelina.”

This uphill climb to scalability has led ACR to turn to the rest of the crop to find a balance. The plant meal, too, has potential to serve several areas, including animal food quality improvements, home heating and bioplastics, which Cusick says has become an encouraging area. “Luckily, those two things stand on their own feet where we’ve landed, and what we’ve found is that camelina meal makes an excellent bioplastics input.

“So, by us being able to buoy meal value and show that’s the answer to scale, others are going to chase us—others are going to follow us, innovate around and beyond us. We’re unlocking this to make this work now,” Cusick says.

ACR conducted successful pilot grows in 2024 and is increasing acreage in Montana and North Dakota this spring to grow its newly licensed, received variety, Logan adds. “And I think our original grow last year was super advantageous for us in regard to building a seed inventory, and also to create volume for us to do intense [research and development] into the meal and send down to our partners, Elementa Foods, in Argentina.”

Unexpected challenges have turned ACR into an evolutionary company, an added benefit from its young age. “Right now, quite frankly, it’s really hard to suggest super strong forward earnings from the biofuels market in America,” Cusick says. “So, if we can feed some hog farms and make some money off bioplastics this year, we look like smart guys in the room.”

Reap What You Sow

Receiving exclusive licensing rights for one of two seed varieties isn’t just impressive—it’s a badge of honor. “Ash Creek, two years old with [an initial appetite for] wide feedstock and strategy has now narrowed to yuca and camelina and positioned itself in a really exciting place amongst the present competitive landscape,” Cusick says.

ACR’s competition extends outside of the U.S. all the way to Argentina, where ACR’s partner, Elementa Foods, thrives. “Down there we’ve got Sustainable Oils, Dreyfus, Bungee and Chevron ... So what do we have that differentiates us as the smallest, least tenured player?” Cusick asks. “We’ve got a bunch of smart, creative people. We’ve got amazingly great partners around the U.S., companies like Eni, Macquarie, Tailwater Capital, partners like Montana Renewables, supporting us all along the way,” he says. “And so, you’ve got a really clear competitive landscape.”

For ACR, camelina meal is just as exciting as, if not more than, the oil. “We’re focused on the development of camelina and scaling the cultivation of camelina, and we see that being done by figuring out more innovative and genius ways to create a higher value for the meal,” Cusick explains. “And we have found one in bioplastics, but we’ve got three others we’re going to find, too. And we hope everybody chases us so that we can have camelina, 10 years from now, as a cover crop all over the globe.”

Airlines like Japan Airlines (JAL), All Nippon Airways (ANA), and smaller carriers such as Skymark face mounting challenges that threaten profitability and growth.

From economic pressures to demographic shifts, these hurdles demand innovative solutions to ensure the sector’s sustainability. We explore the key issues impacting Japan’s domestic aviation industry in 2025.

Japan’s Domestic Aviation Sector: The Challenges

Economic Pressures and High Costs

One of the most pressing challenges is the high cost of operations, worsened by the yen’s depreciation. Many expenses, such as aircraft maintenance and fuel, are priced in foreign currencies, making them costlier for Japanese airlines.

For example, Skymark Airlines recently reported a dip in operating profit despite higher passenger revenue, largely due to foreign exchange losses.

These financial strains make it harder for airlines to maintain competitive fares, especially on domestic routes where price sensitivity is high.

Rising costs also limit investments in fleet upgrades or new technologies, further complicating the path to profitability.

Shrinking Population and Demand

Japan’s declining and aging population is another major hurdle. The country’s population fell from 128.5 million in 2010 to 122.6 million in 2024, reducing the pool of potential travellers.

With fewer working-age individuals and a growing elderly population, demand for domestic flights is shrinking, particularly on regional routes.

This demographic shift challenges airlines to fill seats and maintain viable schedules. Smaller carriers, reliant on these routes, face the greatest risk, as low demand threatens their financial stability.

Structural Profitability Issues

The domestic aviation network struggles to generate consistent profits. Major carriers like Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) typically rely on international routes and government subsidies to offset domestic losses.

Without significant fare hikes or cost-cutting measures, industry experts warn that these airlines could face losses as early as the next fiscal year.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has acknowledged these structural issues, noting that shifts in post-pandemic travel patterns have further complicated the sector’s recovery.

Geopolitical and Supply Chain Woes

Geopolitical tensions, particularly the closure of Russian airspace, have increased flight times and fuel costs for routes to Europe and North America.

This indirectly affects domestic operations by straining overall airline budgets. Additionally, global supply chain disruptions limit access to aviation parts and jet fuel, hampering fleet expansion and maintenance. These constraints make it difficult for airlines to scale operations or replace aging aircraft with more efficient models.

Sustainability and Regulatory Demands

Japan’s commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 adds further pressure. Airlines must adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), targeting 10% of total fuel use by 2030.

While environmentally necessary, SAF is costly, and transitioning to low-carbon aircraft requires significant investment.

These regulatory mandates challenge airlines to balance compliance with financial viability, especially for smaller carriers with limited resources.

Labor Shortages

A shortage of skilled workers, including pilots and technicians, is another critical issue. An aging workforce has seen Japan face difficulties in attracting young talent.

This has been exacerbated by pandemic-era layoffs, have left the industry struggling to meet operational needs. This talent gap threatens service reliability and long-term growth.

Opportunities for Recovery

Despite these challenges, opportunities exist. The MLIT’s expert council, set to convene in May 2025, aims to propose solutions for stability and growth.

Digital technologies, such as AI-driven route optimization, and fuel-efficient aircraft could help reduce costs. Government support for regional routes and inbound tourism may also bolster demand.

Japan’s domestic aviation sector faces a complex landscape, but with strategic interventions, it can chart a path to recovery.

Addressing economic, demographic, and environmental challenges will be key to ensuring a resilient future.

These key players offer connectivity applicable to various sectors and have well-equipped and strong distribution networks across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America.

The business & general aviation segment is estimated to account for the second-largest share in 2025.

Based on aircraft type, the sustainable aviation fuel market is categorized into commercial aviation, military aviation, business & general aviation, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The business & general aviation segment is projected to account for the second-largest market share in the sustainable aviation fuel market. Business & general aviation, which covers charter flights, private jets, and non-commercial aircraft, has increased its focus on carbon footprint.

As a result, operators and manufacturers are increasingly turning to SAF to meet regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for greener operations. To serve regulatory mandates and customer expectations for cleaner aviation, operators and manufacturers prefer SAF as their solution. Major business jet companies, such as Bombardier, Gulfstream, and Dassault, are actively promoting SAF adoption by certifying their aircraft for SAF compatibility and incorporating it into operations. With the growth of the commercial aviation industry as the largest consumer of SAF, quick uptake and significant per-flight fuel consumption of business and general aircraft are projected to boost the segment's growth during the forecast period.

The airliner segment is estimated to account for the largest share in 2025.

Based on end user, the airliner segment is estimated to be the largest market by 2025 due to the ongoing expansion of air travel for tourism and business purposes.

Also called electrofuels or solar fuels, e-fuels combine green hydrogen with waste carbon to produce drop-in replacements for fossil fuels.
AM Green has set a capacity goal of 5,000,000 tons of green ammonia by 2030 for the Kakinada campus, which it states is the equivalent tof 1,000,000 tons of green hydrogen.
The Green Hydrogen Revolution Continues While all this is happening, China has also emerged as a global green hydrogen leader, reportedly nailing down about 50% of global production capacity as of earlier this year and plenty more is on the way.
California-based Infinium, for example, has announced plans to expand its existing green hydrogen and e-fuels footprint in Texas, including export opportunities for both green hydrogen and e-SAF.","Last Updated on:

Oopsies indeed. Energy professionals advise that Europe needs to import more green hydrogen to meet its decarbonization targets. That would be a golden opportunity for US producers, except for the meddling fingers of the malevolently incompetent Commander-in-Chief who occupies the White House. In one early warning sign, the Port of Rotterdam has just skipped right over US producers to ink a significant new green hydrogen deal with the leading Indian firm AM Green.

The Green Hydrogen Solution

Europe needs more clean energy, and the US is now in a poor position to help supply it now that the US has committed to a fossil-centric energy policy. Whether intentionally or not, US President Donald Trump keeps proving his worth as a Russian asset every day. One need look no farther than his disconnect with US allies in Europe and his murderous waffling over Ukraine.

Europe has been scrambling to reduce its dependence on Russian energy ever since Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked attack on the country in February of 2022. After three years of brutal war, international sanctions have helped pressure Russia to pull back, but this week Trump declined new opportunities to force Putin’s hand.

Against this backdrop, Europe does present opportunities LNG (liquid natural gas) producers around the world, at least over the short term. However, the EU is also seeking to decarbonize its economy. Green hydrogen offers an alternative to LNG that can help set Russia back on its heels and help decarbonize the global economy all at once.

Hydrogen Analysts To EU: Focus, Focus, Focus

The EU has adopted a jack-of-all-trades strategy that embraces green hydrogen as a clean transportation fuel as well as a substitute for natural gas in buildings, only to meet with resistance from off-takers dissuaded by high costs among other factors.

The US think tank Rocky Mountain Institute is among those advocating for a more focused approach that leaves vehicle and building decarbonization to the electrification field. Instead, they advise EU policy makers to target the low-hanging fruit of industrial applications for hydrogen, where electrification is difficult if not impractical.

Even so, RMI advises that a domestic green hydrogen supply gap will persist in Europe over the coming years even under a more restrained goal-setting scenario. The solution, of course, is to seek additional supplies overseas.

Trump To US: No Green Hydrogen For You!

US green hydrogen producers should have been among the first in line to fill the green hydrogen supply gap in Europe. After all, the US already has long term fuel supply chain relationships with stakeholders in Europe including the Port of Rotterdam.

The US green hydrogen industry also received a burst of adrenaline during the Biden administration, when the Energy Department oversaw the creation and funding of the new $7 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. The main focus was on green hydrogen gas pushed from water with renewable electricity. Biomass extraction was another renewable hydrogen avenue supported by the program It. also included a carve-out for natural as as required by law, but most of the emphasis was on renewable resources and supply chain diversification.

The stage was set for the US to export green hydrogen to Europe, but red flags began to pop up after the election of Trump to a second term last fall. A consortium of investors has already been pursuing green hydrogen export opportunities from North Africa to the EU via pipeline across the Mediterranean Sea for example. Belgium was also pursuing sustainable H2 supply options with Canada by the time Trump took office on January 20.

Then there’s Ukraine, which has been advocating for EU admission partly on the strength of its ability to export sustainable H2 to points west, including biomass as well as wind and solar energy.

Sure enough, upon taking office in January Trump put the Hydrogen Hubs program on ice, dampening investor enthusiasm on the idea of producing green hydrogen in the US.

Meanwhile, Over In India…

India is one of the nations that has continued to pursue a strong, consistent green H2 policy, and all that hard work is beginning to pay off. On May 26, the India-based green hydrogen producer AM Green and the Port of Rotterdam Authority announced a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on a new “green energy supply chain” between the two nations.

The two partners drew attention to the growing hydrogen infrastructure at the Port, referring to Rotterdam as “a key hydrogen carriers entry point,” while also taking note of the need for related adjustments to Port facilities.

“Furthermore, the partnership will jointly support the development of strategic port infrastructure for safe distribution of hydrogen-based fuels and products, and link India’s Net Zero Industrial Clusters to Europe, enabling exports of up to 1,000,000 tons annually,” they explained.

“The envisaged supply chain can enable trade of green fuels up to USD 1 Billon between the two economies,” they elaborated.

The immediate aim of the partnership is enlist offtakers to support AM Green’s green ammonia operation in Kakinada, in India, leveraging Rotterdam’s position as a “critical logistics and hydrogen hub” that serves as the point of entry for about 13% of total energy demand in Europe. Am Green anticipates that the green ammonia will be deployed to produce SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) in Europe through the e-fuels route. Also called electrofuels or solar fuels, e-fuels combine green hydrogen with waste carbon to produce drop-in replacements for fossil fuels.

AM Green has set a capacity goal of 5,000,000 tons of green ammonia by 2030 for the Kakinada campus, which it states is the equivalent tof 1,000,000 tons of green hydrogen.

The Green Hydrogen Revolution Continues

While all this is happening, China has also emerged as a global green hydrogen leader, reportedly nailing down about 50% of global production capacity as of earlier this year and plenty more is on the way.

As for the US, there is plenty of bad news to spread around. However, US presidents come and go, and Trump is on track to leave the White House — peacefully — on January 20, 2029, which is just around the corner.

During a BloombergNEF energy conference in New York City earlier this year, analysts observed that the global green hydrogen industry is floundering in many markets. However, nations like India and China are in it for the long haul. Momentum also continues to build in Europe. In addition to Ukraine, other former Soviet satellite nations are leaning on domestically sourced, sustainable H2 to buttress themselves against further Russian aggression.

All is not lost for US producers. California-based Infinium, for example, has announced plans to expand its existing green hydrogen and e-fuels footprint in Texas, including export opportunities for both green hydrogen and e-SAF. After all, US presidents come and go…",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/green-hydrogen-rotterdam.png,N,,2025-05-26 18:56:38.811976

That is still the lowest of the five major feedstocks, which are soybean oil, canola oil, tallow, used cooking oil, and distillers corn oil.
However, it would very much put canola oil back in the game.
Zandar Capozzola, principal consultant for renewable fuel with Argus Media, said 45Z has been a disaster for the U.S. biofuel sector.
Canola oil accounted for five per cent of total feedstock use in February, down from 11 perc ent a year ago.","Canola oil would be one of the main beneficiaries of proposed changes to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit making their way through U.S. Congress, says an analyst.

The feedstock is not eligible for the credit under the current rules because of its unfavourable carbon intensity (CI) score.

However, under new rules contained in the budget bill that recently passed through the U.S. House of Representatives, canola’s carbon intensity score drops to 38.5 grams of carbon dioxide per megajoule from 54.9.

That means it would qualify for the credit because of new rules that eliminate the indirect land use change (ILUC) penalty, which is responsible for a large chunk of canola’s poor CI score.

It means canola would receive a 45Z tax credit of US$0.19 per gallon for biodiesel, $0.22 for renewable diesel, and $0.39 for sustainable aviation fuel.

That is still the lowest of the five major feedstocks, which are soybean oil, canola oil, tallow, used cooking oil, and distillers corn oil.

However, it would very much put canola oil back in the game.

Zandar Capozzola, principal consultant for renewable fuel with Argus Media, said 45Z has been a disaster for the U.S. biofuel sector.

It replaced the blender’s tax credit, which gave biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers a $1 per gallon credit irrespective of what feedstock they were using.

The 45Z credit is based on a shifting scale of value based on feedstock and production process. Its average value has been $0.43 per gallon since it was introduced on Jan. 1, 2025.

“That’s a 57 per cent reduction in the tax value afforded to producers,” he said during a recent webinar.

Renewable diesel and biodiesel producers responded by slashing production. January’s output was 20 per cent below a year earlier with plants running at 47 per cent of capacity, down from 93 per cent in December 2024.

Things have improved since then with plants running at 63 per cent capacity in April, but it is still well below 2024 levels.

“The market has been hit really hard by this transition to the 45Z credit,” said Capozzola.

Biodiesel margins turned negative at the start of 2025, declining 75 per cent year over year through May. Renewable diesel margins fell 50 per cent over the same period.

Canola-based fuel was hardest hit because the feedstock doesn’t qualify for 45Z.

Tallow, used cooking oil and distillers corn oil have been the biggest beneficiaries, with corn oil earning an average $0.75 per gallon credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel production.

Foreign used cooking oil is not eligible for the credit (except for sustainable aviation fuel), pressuring domestic supplies of the feedstock.

The upshot is that 45Z has caused a move away from crop-based feedstocks. Canola oil accounted for five per cent of total feedstock use in February, down from 11 perc ent a year ago.

Tallow has surpassed soybean oil to take top spot, accounting for 31 per cent of feedstock compared to 26 per cent a year ago.

Total feedstock use in February was down 27 per cent compared to a year ago as many plants shuttered or paused production.

The 45Z policy changes contained in the draft budget proposal would be a boon for crop-based feedstocks.

For instance, soybean-oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules compared to $0.22 under the existing regulations.

“We could see a tremendous reshuffling of the feedstock slate should this draft bill move forward in its current state,” said Capozzola.

The numbers for waste-based feedstocks would stay the same because they don’t face any ILUC penalty under the existing rules.

The draft budget bill also extends 45Z through 2031 and restricts feedstocks to the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is also good news for Canadian canola growers.

Capozzola noted that the proposed new 45Z rules would not “play well” with California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which caps crop-based feedstocks at 20 per cent.",https://dht7q8fif4gks.cloudfront.net/2025-05/canola_bloom%20-%20the%20Western%20Producer.jpeg,N,,2025-05-26 15:56:06.946457

Top media outlets, CNN, BBC, The New York Times, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal remain trusted sources globally. Each continues to adapt to digital platforms while upholding core journalism values: accuracy, impartiality, and transparency.

As per the latest media reports and surveys, the following media outlets have stood out in 2025, delivering excellence and credible news.

CNN remains a global leader in breaking news and real-time reporting, with a strong international presence and digital reach.

BBC is recognized for its journalistic integrity, impartiality, and expansive global network, making it one of the most trusted and fastest-growing news websites.

The New York Times continues to set editorial standards with investigative journalism and in-depth analysis, maintaining a vast digital subscriber base and global influence.

Reuters is a primary source for unbiased business, financial, and world news, with a massive global footprint and syndication to other outlets.

The Wall Street Journal is a key resource for business and financial insights, trusted by professionals and recognized for its factual reporting and market analysis.

Misinformation spreads rapidly online. So trust is more critical than ever, and readers certainly prefer unbiased news. Such reporting not only builds public confidence but also keeps governments, institutions, and corporations accountable.

However, as media shifts from print to digital, its environmental impact also evolves. So here we would discuss the carbon footprint of these media giants and their sustainability efforts to meet net-zero targets.

The Media Industry’s Carbon Footprint

While switching from print to digital cuts down paper waste, it also creates carbon emissions. Online publishing, video streaming, and real-time updates rely on large data centers that use a lot of energy.

Thus, the carbon footprint of media outlets, especially those with significant digital and streaming operations, has become a major environmental concern.

Research from Futuresource and InterDigital estimates that the TV and video streaming industry accounts for 4% of total global emissions.

Print editions, like those from The New York Times, still generate emissions from production and delivery. Meanwhile, parent companies like Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN) are adopting renewable energy and reducing waste across operations.

Also, AI-driven reporting cuts travel emissions but adds energy demand. To remain sustainable, the media industry must invest in green data infrastructure and transparent carbon reporting.

1. CNN Rides Warner Bros.’ Green Goals

CNN hasn’t published a standalone carbon footprint or its own emissions report. However, its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, has committed to clear sustainability goals that influence CNN’s operations.

Digital Shift Drives Emissions

CNN runs energy-heavy operations, including streaming, news gathering, and data centers. Its shift to digital-first content reduced paper waste but increased electricity use.

Streaming, a key part of CNN’s digital platform, drives global demand for data. Experts estimate that video streaming alone may cause up to 1% of global carbon emissions.

Thus, CNN benefits from its parent company’s broader sustainability plan. Warner Bros has taken steps to cut environmental impact and lower greenhouse gas emissions by:

Invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency across operations

Support industry-wide environmental standards

Rolled out waste reduction initiatives across its media brands.

Leading with Climate Coverage

CNN plays a vital role in climate journalism. It consistently reports on climate change, carbon emissions, clean energy, and sustainability innovation.

Its stories spotlight technologies like carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable power, keeping the public informed and engaged. CNN also covers major policy moves, such as the EU’s push for sustainable aviation fuel and the global net-zero by 2050 target.

These company-wide actions help reduce CNN’s indirect environmental impact.

2. BBC Targets Net Zero by 2050 with Strong Emissions Cuts

The BBC aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with the UK government’s climate goals. It has outlined its environmental sustainability strategy, emphasizing its commitment to becoming Net Zero and Nature Positive.

It plans to cut direct emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 46% and value chain emissions (Scope 3) by 28% by 2030, using 2019/20 as the baseline. The SBTi approved both short- and long-term goals.

Its total emissions amounted to 374,063 tons CO₂e in 2023/24, up 7% from the 2019/20 total of 350,893 tons.

The increase is attributed to value chain emissions as they remain a growing challenge.

However, by 2023/24, it reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 21%, exceeding its target of 17%. It achieved this by upgrading buildings, cutting gas use, and reducing diesel in production.

Notably, the media company now requires all non-news TV productions to meet the BAFTA Albert sustainability standard. Producers must submit carbon action plans and measure emissions. As of January 2024, the BBC ended mandatory offsetting and redirected efforts toward direct decarbonization.

With these initiatives, they remain committed to sustainable operations and credible climate reporting.

3. New York Times’ (NYT) Emission-Cutting Strategy

The New York Times has taken steps to lower its environmental impact by improving energy efficiency across its facilities and using more sustainable methods in printing and distribution.

It measures its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions using the financial control boundary method defined by the GHG Protocol. This approach helps identify emission sources and areas for reduction. The company bases its carbon reduction target on the GHG Protocol’s market-based method.

Between 2019 and 2023, the company reduced its purchased electricity use by 16%. However, Scope 2 location-based emissions rose by 18% during the same period. This increase mainly resulted from a less renewable power mix in New York City.

The company’s progress toward its carbon-neutral target depends, in part, on the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) reaching its goal of 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and a zero-emission grid by 2040.

4. Thomson Reuters: Climate Action and ESG Progress

Reuters operates in over 200 locations, providing accurate, fact-based reporting.

Thomson Reuters sees ESG as important for long-term success. The board oversees key ESG areas, but employees lead efforts in sustainability, inclusion, and community work.

It supports global standards like the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It also works to promote UN Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.

Environmental Commitments and Climate Goals

The company continues to reduce its global environmental impact by using 100% renewable electricity across all operations. This is done by matching energy use with renewable energy credits worldwide. Thomson Reuters also works with suppliers to lower emissions across its value chain.

In 2020, it joined the SBTi, and its key goals include:

Cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline)

Reducing Scope 3 emissions from energy, travel, and commuting by 25% by 2025 (from a 2019 baseline)

Ensuring 65% of supplier spending aligns with science-based targets by 2025

Since 2020, it has sourced 100% renewable power and reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by over 93% from 2018 levels. Business travel emissions are down 63% from 2019. Currently, 41% of its suppliers (by spend) have committed to science-based climate targets.

Thomson Reuters uses carbon offsets for its remaining emissions and to stay carbon neutral. It also spends 7% of its U.S.-based budget with diverse suppliers and plans to maintain this level through 2024.

5. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Carbon Footprint Not Separately Reported

The Wall Street Journal is owned by Dow Jones & Company, which in turn is a subsidiary of News Corp.

There is no publicly available, standalone carbon footprint report specifically for WSJ as of 2025. Any emissions data or sustainability disclosures would be included under the broader corporate reporting of Dow Jones or News Corp, not as a separate WSJ-specific document.

News Corp aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, WSJ’s environmental impact is mainly from digital and print operations, but specific figures are not published.

A study from The Business Research Company revealed that the global media market is set for strong growth in 2025, rising from $2,616.7 billion in 2024 to $2,833.22 billion in 2025, with a CAGR of 8.3%.

This upward trend is expected to continue, reaching $3,814.84 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 7.7%.

Growth is fueled by a rising global population, rapid tech advancement, media mergers, and increased mobile video consumption.

Meanwhile, Statista projects the global digital newspapers and magazines segment will generate $41.28 billion in 2025, growing to $44.54 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 1.92%. The U.S. will lead with an expected $16.73 billion in revenue. Subscription-based models are gaining popularity as audiences seek premium content.

We have set out below an overview of the current regulatory frameworks governing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the key jurisdictions of the UK, EU and USA.

SAF has emerged as a critical component in the global drive to decarbonise the aviation sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF offers substantial reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions by incorporating renewable feedstocks and innovative production technologies.

Recognising its potential to drive sustainable growth, policymakers across the UK, EU, and USA are actively shaping regulatory frameworks to accelerate its deployment and adoption.

Note that this is an evolving regulatory landscape that is subject to change – however, this overview sets out the current regulations and initiatives of each of the UK, EU and USA – and strongly indicates the direction of travel of each of these jurisdictions.

We conclude with a comparison of these jurisdictions and analyse their strengths and limitations in fostering market growth. We also examine potential pathways for future development, including harmonisation of international standards, technological advancements, and policy synergies.

By presenting such analysis and exploring projected trends, this overview offers insights into the role of regulation in shaping the trajectory of SAF as an essential enabler of sustainable aviation.

United Kingdom

The UK SAF landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

The UK's SAF industry is progressing rapidly, driven by a number of policy measures that integrate SAF into the UK's broader decarbonisation goals. With increasing regulatory and financial support, the UK aims to position itself as a global leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use.

A key component of this strategy is the SAF Mandate, alongside other legislative and market-based incentives designed to accelerate SAF adoption. Under these principles, SAF is defined based on achieving a minimum level of greenhouse gas emission reductions and specific sustainability criteria.

The key features include the introduction of compulsory, incrementally increasing SAF supply requirements, a buy-out mechanism to enforce compliance, and funding incentives to support industry growth.

The Jet Zero Taskforce (JZT) (building on the previous Government's Jet Zero Council) was announced by the UK Government in November 2024 to advance sustainable aviation. Members include UK Government ministers, industry leaders and academics. Established to accelerate the transition to net zero aviation by 2050, the JZT aims to streamline aviation decarbonization priorities and support the development, production, commercialisation and use of SAF in the UK and globally.

Legislation

The UK is at the forefront of SAF development as the one of the first countries in the world to legislate for mandatory SAF requirements. The UK's key policy to decarbonize aviation and secure demand for SAF is the SAF Mandate.

SAF Mandate

Key terms (2025 onwards):

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024 came into force on January 1, 2025. This introduced compulsory SAF requirements for suppliers of at least 15.9 terajoules (c.468,000 litres) per year of aviation fuel to the UK: from 2025, SAF is required to make up 2% of the total UK aviation fuel mix, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

SAF suppliers earn Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for SAF supplied to the UK that meets certain GHG emission reductions and sustainability criteria (SAF must comprise fuel that achieves minimum GHG emission reductions of 40% relative to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel). Evidence of the SAF supplied to UK needs to be provided to the Department for Transport to assess and award corresponding certificates. The number of certificates issued will be proportionate to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered (i.e. the greater the reductions, the greater the number of certificates issued). Suppliers can either use their certificates to demonstrate that they have complied with their obligations or trade them to other suppliers.

HEFA Caps (2027 onwards):

SAF produced through hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) can contribute 100% of SAF for the first 2 years of the Mandate and thereafter decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

This is due primarily to HEFA's emission reduction inefficiencies (when compared to SAF alternatives) and feedstock sustainability concerns.

Power to Liquid (PtL) Obligations (2028-2040):

A separate PtL obligation requires 0.2% of UK aviation fuel to be sourced from PtL commencing in 2028 and thereafter rising to 4.4% by 2040.

PtL requires energy-derived production of aviation fuels (from e.g. green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide).

Buy-out Mechanism (2025 onwards):

Fuel suppliers unable to meet their SAF Mandate requirements must pay a buy-out price determined by their SAF or PtL shortfall amounts.

The aim is to create a financial incentive to prioritize SAF, with the buy-out prices (currently £4.70 per litre for SAF and £5.00 per litre for PtL) being set at a level to encourage the supply of SAF over the use of the buy-out.

SAF Revenue Support

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill (2024) was announced in the King's speech on 17 July 2024, proposing a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers investing in UK-based facilities. A number of funding options were proposed and, in January 2025, the UK Government confirmed that the Guaranteed Strike Price mechanism was the preferred option.

The Guaranteed Strike Price is envisaged to operate akin to a contract-for-difference (as utilised in the UK renewable power sector), offering price stability for UK SAF producers. The mechanism will operate through a private law contract between a UK SAF producer and a designated Government agency, establishing a strike price (being the guaranteed price the producer will receive for eligible SAF over a specified period). If the reference price surpasses the strike price, the producer reimburses the Government agency for the difference, and, if the reference price falls below the strike price, the Government agency compensates the producer for the shortfall.

In line with the ""polluter pays"" principle, the UK Government has confirmed that it intends for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by aviation fuel suppliers.

Further SAF Incentives

To further promote UK SAF development, the UK Government has implemented various financial incentives:

Advanced Fuels Fund: First launched in 2022 with £165 million of grant funding available, the Advanced Fuels Fund aims to support the establishment and development of first-of-a-kind SAF projects in the UK.

SAF Clearing House: Any new aviation fuel must meet strict specifications and undergo testing to meet industry standards; the cost and complexity of which can be a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. The UK SAF Clearing House provides technical support and funding to SAF producers.

Furthermore, aircraft operators can reduce their obligations under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by using eligible SAF, which qualifies for emissions reductions under the scheme.

Projections and Insight

It is estimated that, by 2050, the global aviation industry will need approximately 400 million tonnes of SAF annually to meet international decarbonization goal and, whilst the SAF market is still in a nascent stage of its development, the UK is positioned to play a significant role in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The development of SAF production facilities in the UK are key for the successful implementation of the UK Government's SAF goals.

The SAF Mandate has only just come into force and the revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers has yet to be finalized and take effect. As such it remains to be seen whether these mechanisms will be sufficient to meet international decarbonization goals and position the UK as a leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use:

The success of the buy-out mechanism in incentivizing the production and use of SAF will depend on the future production costs of SAF. Whilst the buyout rates are currently projected to exceed SAF production costs, if the buy-out price is set too low (for example, if production costs spiral), suppliers may choose to simply pay the buy- out price.

With respect to the revenue certainty mechanism, there are a number of questions and policy decisions that remain outstanding: what will be used as the ""reference price"" (unlike in the power market where there is a published market price for electricity, no such benchmark exists for SAF)? How will the strike price adjust over time? Precisely how will the mechanism be funded? At a most fundamental level, the deployment of significant capital into SAF development will require further clarity regarding the revenue certainty mechanism.

For further clarity on the information above, we set out below (at Figure 1) a timeline of key projected regulatory developments in the UK SAF market.

European Union

The EU SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Despite efforts to curb its growth, commercial flights in the EU could rise by up to 42% by 2040 compared to 2017. Recognizing the pressing need to address the climate impact of the aviation sector, the EU has prioritized the development of a SAF market. By leveraging the collective action potential of its member states, the EU is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF implementation.

SAF is defined by the EU as a ""drop-in"" aviation fuel, including advanced biofuels or biofuels produced from sustainable feedstocks, recycled carbon fuels, or synthetic fuels.

With mandates introduced in 2023 and effective as from January 2025, the European Union is meticulously crafting a policy framework to stabilize the SAF market, foster innovation, and create a level playing field, driving progress toward its Fit-to-55 climate goals.

Legislation

The European regulatory framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been shaped by two key legislative milestones: the Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

The RED have progressively established binding renewable energy targets across the EU, including for the transport sector, and have increasingly integrated SAF into the broader energy transition strategy. From RED I (2009), which set initial renewable energy targets, to RED II (2018), which introduced incentives for SAF, and finally RED III (2023), which reinforced sector-specific mandates, these directives have paved the way for SAF regulation.

Complementing this framework, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in 2023, marks a decisive shift in SAF development by imposing direct obligations on fuel suppliers at EU airports. Unlike the RED directives, this regulation is immediately applicable across the EU and imposes a progressive incorporation of SAF into jet fuel, with binding quotas extending to 2050. Together, these two instruments define the roadmap for SAF deployment, balancing long-term policy incentives with immediate regulatory requirements.

RED Directives

RED served as the cornerstone for establishing the EU's shift toward greener fuels.

Adopted on April 23, 2009, the RED I Directive introduced ambitious renewable energy targets across EU Member States:

General Targets: Each Member State was assigned a binding target to achieve 20% renewable energy in its final energy consumption by 2020. These targets varied for each country: Some countries were optimistic about their renewable energy potential and set ambitious targets, such as Sweden with 49% by 2020, Denmark with 30%, and France with 23%. Others, however, were more cautious, with the Netherlands setting a target of 14% and Italy aiming for 17%.

Transport Sector: A specific target of 10% renewable energy was set for the transport sector by 2020. This included biofuels and other renewable fuels but did not explicitly address aviation.

Impact on SAF: While RED I did not explicitly include SAF, it established a foundation for their future integration by defining sustainability criteria and promoting advanced biofuels.

Entering into force on December 11, 2018, the RED II Directive strengthened the EU's renewable energy framework in response to increased climate ambitions:

Revised Targets: The overall binding target for emissions reduction was raised to 32%, with a renewable energy target of 14% for the transport sector.

Promotion of SAF

AdvancedBiofuelsand RFNBOs:The RED II Directive encouraged the use of advanced biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), explicitly including SAF. Advanced biofuels refer to biofuels produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to land-use changes that could negatively impact biodiversity. They are typically derived from waste and residues, or non-food crops such as algae and plant fibers. As for RFNBOs, they are fuels produced from renewable electricity rather than biological sources.

IncentiveMultipliers

Biofuels derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX (including advanced biofuels) count twice their energy content towards renewable targets, meaning that for every unit of energy produced from these fuels, it counts as two units towards the target.

Fuels supplied to the aviation sector (including RFNBOs) count as 1.2 times their energy content, meaning that for every unit of energy from these fuels, it counts as 1.2 units toward the target.

Limitations on Food-Based Biofuels: These are capped at 7% to mitigate adverse effects on land use and food production.

Adopted on October 18, 2023, the RED III Directive was a decisive step towards integrating SAF into the EU's energy framework, by:

Enhanced Targets: The share of renewable energy in the EU's overall energy consumption must reach 42.5% by 2030, with a binding target of 29% for the transport sector.

Sectoral Sub-Targets: Specific targets were introduced for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs, solidifying SAF's role as a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization.

Aviation Catalyst: RED III emphasized increased SAF integration into national energy strategies while supporting emerging technologies, such as synthetic fuels.

Directives are legal acts that generally need be transposed into national law by EU member states, meaning that each country must adopt its own legislation to achieve the directive's objectives. Therefore, the RED directives' provisions need to be transposed into national law. There is generally an 18-month deadline for member states to do so, with an occasionally shorter deadline for some provisions.

Member States successfully met the RED I targets, despite varying national goals, demonstrating the EU's commitment to renewable energy. This progress laid the foundation for the more ambitious targets in RED II and RED III, and Member States are on track to achieve these goals. In particular, the push for SAF under these directives is progressing well, with ongoing efforts to scale production and expand infrastructure. While challenges remain, Member States are well- positioned to meet the targets for both renewable energy and SAF by 2030, especially with the introduction of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

ReFuelEU Aviation regulation

Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of October 18, 2023 through ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU Aviation) represents a cornerstone of the EU's strategy to decarbonize aviation in line with the Green Deal objectives and the Fit-for-55 package. This regulation establishes a comprehensive legal framework to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the EU.

Finalized in 2023, most of its provisions entered into force on 1 January 2024, with Articles 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 becoming applicable from January 1, 2025. As an EU regulation, ReFuelEU Aviation is directly applicable in all Member States without requiring transposition into national law.

The regulation imposes binding SAF blending obligations on aviation fuel suppliers, requiring them to progressively integrate SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandated SAF share begins at 2% in 2025 and will increase incrementally to 70% by 2050, of which a dedicated sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels starts at 0.7% in 2030, reaching 35% by 2050 (see Figure 2). For instance, the goal for 2040 is to achieve a 42% share of SAF in the aviation fuel supplied to EU airports, with 15% of that being synthetic.

To be eligible, SAF must comply with the sustainability and emissions reduction criteria set out in RED I. Acceptable SAF sources include advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels derived from renewable hydrogen, and recycled carbon aviation fuels. Fuel suppliers may also utilize hydrogen for direct aircraft propulsion or synthetic low-carbon fuels.

Within this regulatory framework, synthetic fuels—particularly e-kerosene—are set to play an increasingly prominent role, with a specific mandate ensuring their integration into the fuel mix.

EU airport operators are required to facilitate access to SAF, while aviation fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators must systematically collect and report data to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and national competent authorities to ensure regulatory compliance.

The regulation further establishes enforcement mechanisms, designating national competent authorities responsible for supervision. Fuel suppliers failing to meet their SAF blending obligations will face financial penalties and must compensate for any shortfall by supplying the missing volume the following year.

By setting clear, long-term SAF quotas through 2050, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation creates a stable and predictable market framework, reinforcing the EU's ambition to achieve a more sustainable aviation sector.

Figure 2:SAF Mandate Levels in the ReFuelEU Directive

Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and Financial Incentives for SAF

In addition to the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, the EU's climate strategy for the aviation sector is reinforced by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established under Directive 2003/87/EC. As a ""cap-and-trade"" mechanism, the EU ETS aims to progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on total emissions while allowing market- based trading of emission allowances. Initially, free allowances were allocated to aircraft operators based on the average emission of the sector and their historical performance. In 2023, approximately 22.5 million aviation allowances were allocated for free, while about 5.7 million were auctioned.

To accelerate decarbonization, the EU has initiated a phased reduction of free emission allowances for aircraft operators:

In 2024, free allowances were reduced by 25%;

In 2025, they will be further cut by 50%;

By 2026, all free allowances will be phased out, requiring operators to fully cover their emissions through auctioning.

This transition is designed to incentivize the adoption of SAF, as airlines can lower their compliance costs by integrating SAF into their fuel mix. To support this shift, the EU has introduced targeted financial incentives within the EU ETS framework:

A dedicated SAF allowance mechanism provides 20 million allowances (valued at approximately €1.7 billion) until 2030, rewarding aircraft operators based on SAF usage. This mechanism helps bridge the price gap between conventional aviation fuel and SAF. SAF remains significantly more expensive to produce. However, by reducing compliance costs for airlines under the EU ETS, it makes SAF adoption more financially viable, supporting the transition to cleaner aviation fuels while maintaining competitiveness in the sector.

SAF that meets RED sustainability criteria is attributed zero emissions under the EU ETS, reducing the number of allowances airlines must purchase.

Beyond emissions trading, the EU has also introduced monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) measures for non-CO₂ aviation effects, with additional policy proposals expected by 2028.

Financial Support Mechanisms for SAF Development

Recognizing the financial and technological challenges associated with SAF production, the EU has established several funding instruments to support research, innovation, and large-scale deployment:

EU Innovation Fund (EUIF): A €40 billion fund aimed at de-risking SAF production across various technology readiness levels. For example, the Innovation Fund awarded in 2023 a €167 million grant to the Biorefinery Östrand project, which seeks to develop, construct, and operate the world's first large-scale biorefinery dedicated to producing renewable SAF and naphtha, in Östrand, Sweden.

Horizon Europe: The EU's flagship €95.5 billion research and innovation program, which funds SAF-related projects.

InvestEU: A €26.2 billion initiative supporting sustainable infrastructure investments, including SAF production facilities. One of the most notable projects funded by InvestEU is the INERATEC synthetic fuel production facility in Frankfurt. Backed by a €70 million investment, this initiative is supported by a €40 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million non-repayable grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The funding will help develop Europe's largest carbon-neutral synthetic fuel plant, set to open in 2025.

Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking: A €1.7 billion public-private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautics industry to accelerate the development of new aviation technologies.

Projections and Insight

While the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation establishes a robust framework and clear mandates for SAF adoption, several policy areas will require further clarification and potential amendments. The regulation's overall timeline is generally aligned with industry expectations, but additional interventions may be necessary to ensure a smooth and effective implementation:

Penalty enforcement and cost volatility: The current penalty mechanism for suppliers failing to meet SAF quotas is directly tied to SAF costs, which remain highly volatile due to potential supply shortages. If SAF prices surge, penalties could become unsustainable, adding financial pressure on suppliers while delaying compliance. Additionally, without a price cap mechanism, rising SAF costs could impact air travel affordability, potentially triggering public and industry backlash.

Exploring a tradable SAF system: Under Article 15 of ReFuelEU, the European Commission is mandated to assess additional measures to enhance SAF market liquidity and ensure supply stability. One key consideration is the creation of a book-and-claim system, which would enable fuel suppliers and aircraft operators to purchase SAF credits and allocate them flexibly across EU airports. As of January 2025, the Commission's report on these measures remains pending.

Beyond regulatory refinements, the political landscape in the EU is evolving, with recent electoral shifts favoring parties historically opposed to Green Deal policies. As EU policymakers shift their focus toward an Industrial Deal, maintaining strong momentum for SAF adoption will be critical. Ensuring a stable regulatory environment and continued financial support will be essential to securing the long-term success of SAF integration within the aviation sector.

The effectiveness of SAF regulations in the EU stems from the fact that they are binding, compelling operators to take immediate action and enhance their performance.

Despite its relatively high cost, airlines and operators are eager to contribute and even exceed their obligated SAF targets as early as possible. They understand that this is the only way to assert themselves in the market and to ensure the long- term sustainability and viability of the industry, which must adapt to greener practices to secure its future.

United States of America

The U.S. SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Aviation represents roughly 3.3% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and jet fuel consumption is forecasted to increase by 2-3% annually through to 2050. This obviously presents significant opportunities for SAF investment, and the market has responded: projects have been announced in recent years that are projected to meet over 10% of U.S. jet fuel demand. Nonetheless, the biggest challenge SAF faces in the U.S. is that it is not cost-competitive with fossil jet fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, SAF currently costs two to ten times more than fossil jet fuel. Consequently, the federal and state incentives discussed in this section are playing and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of SAF in the U.S.

Federal Support for SAF

The U.S. government supports SAF development in several ways: annual renewable fuel regulatory mandates; tax policy; and grants. Several of these incentives are in flux, however, given the shift in the balance of political power in the U.S. Congress and the White House.

Regulatory Mandates:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issues annual regulations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program that require the national pool of transportation fuel to contain a certain percentage of alternative fuels such as SAF. Production and use of biofuels under these mandates is tracked using a system of tradeable credits (Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs). Among other requirements, eligible SAF must have lifecycle GHG emissions that are at least 50% below a 2005 fossil fuel baseline.

Although compliance with the program's mandates falls on fossil fuel producers and importers, RINs implicitly subsidize biofuels such as SAF. Depending upon the feedstock and production process, SAF can generate RINs that may be used to meet the biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel or cellulosic biofuel mandates and value of the RIN varies by type. RINs generated by producing SAF can be ""stacked"" with federal tax credits for SAF, such as those provided by the 2022 IRA, as well as state credits relevant to SAF.

Tax Policy:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has a significant impact on the SAF market in the U.S. by offering comprehensive support to encourage the production and adoption of this fuel. Instead of setting mandates, the IRA offers SAF credits for qualified neat fuels and provides grants for SAF production and distribution.

The IRA supports SAF through two credits. First, IRA created a new SAF blender's tax credit under Internal Revenue Code section 40B, available through to the end of 2024. Then, from January 1, 2025 through to December 31, 2027, the IRA made available a new technology neutral production credit for clean fuels including SAF, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The section 45Z credit provides a tax credit for the production of clean fuels that are ""suitable for use in a highway vehicle or aircraft"" and meet a specified threshold for emissions reductions. The credit is worth up to $1.00 per gallon for transportation fuels and $1.75 or more per gallon for SAF, provided that prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The 45Z credit is claimed by the producers of SAF, rather than the blenders, but can be transferred or sold to third parties as a means of monetizing the credit.

Since August 2022, significant work has been done by a multi-disciplinary task force including the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, the Energy Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the White House to implement the section 45Z credit and publish tax guidance. Most recently, on January 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2025-10 and Notice 2025-11, establishing an intent to propose regulations and clarifying annual emissions rates for the credit. At the same time, the 119th Congress is currently reviewing tax legislation that may include revisions to several clean energy tax credits established by the IRA, including section 45Z. As a result, airlines, SAF producers, and conventional energy companies are queuing up to talk to Congress and Trump tax officials about the future of federal tax support for clean fuels, since the current production credit is set to expire at the end of 2027.

Grants:

IRA Section 40007 establishes a grant program for eligible U.S. entities involved in SAF production, transportation, blending, or storage, administered by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition (FAST) grants program.

Section 324 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 2023 allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to pilot SAF usage, with a plan to be implemented by FY2028, while permitting waivers under certain conditions.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023 and 2024 authorize discretionary grants for airport infrastructure that supports SAF's distribution and storage, provided they meet the 50% lifecycle GHG reduction requirement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Energy for America program also provides grants and loan guarantees to rural businesses and agricultural producers for renewable energy projects, including SAF production facilities.

State Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

State-level policies further support SAF production and consumption by allowing producers to generate and sell credits to fossil jet fuel suppliers. In 2009, California established the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions in the state and develop a range of low- carbon and renewable alternatives to reduce petroleum dependency. This market-based program sets an annual average carbon intensity (CI) benchmark for all fuels – fossil and renewable – produced or imported into the state. Fuels with a CI below the benchmark (such as eligible SAF) generate credits that producers can sell to other fuel producers in the state as a revenue stream. Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted similar fuel programs.

In other states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska – per-gallon SAF production tax credits promote SAF alignment with national objectives.

Projections and Insight

By 2030, domestic SAF production is expected to reach 3 billion gallons annually – a 130-fold increase from 2030 consumption. By 2050, production could rise to 35 billion gallons per year, reflecting a 12-fold increase from the 2030 target.

The shift towards SAF represents a long-term transition in the aviation industry. Given the international nature of air travel, SAF is a clean fuel whose market drivers are largely insulated from the political swings of the US; and American airlines and airports will need to access this fuel to comply with global emissions standards. Driven by discretionary grants from the FAA, significant investments in airport infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage are anticipated. This could lead to an improved supply chain and logistics, facilitating broader SAF availability at major airports by 2025. Increased funding through grants and tax credits may accelerate research and development of new SAF feedstocks and production technologies, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This could also lead to advancements in alternative feedstocks, potentially doubling production efficiency by 2030. As government initiatives and incentives ramp up, it is likely that the market share of SAF in total jet fuel consumption will increase significantly from the current less than 0.1%. Projections estimate reaching 5 -10% market share by 2030, depending on regulatory support and industry adoption.

The incentives enacted under the IRA constitute a good beginning in establishing the support necessary for overcoming barriers to SAF adoption. With investors comparing the short three-year timeline of the IRA's section 45Z clean fuel production credit to ten-year timelines for other clean energy technologies, producers and airlines are making a long-term legislative extension of the credit a top priority for 2025. State level initiatives, like the California LCFS program, look to play a critical role in driving SAF adoption. Other states may follow suit, creating a patchwork of supportive policies that could incentivize producers while also fostering competition among states for SAF leadership.

Conclusion: Comparative Analysis of SAF

Regulatory Frameworks in the UK, EU, and US

The regulatory approaches adopted by the UK, EU, and US to promote SAF reflect distinct policy priorities, economic

structures, and aviation market dynamics. Whilst all three jurisdictions recognize the need to scale SAF production to achieve net-zero aviation emissions, their methods for incentivization, mandate enforcement, and industry engagement exhibit some notable divergences.

Key Similarities

Despite differences in policy mechanisms, several overarching themes emerge across all three jurisdictions:

Mandatory Blending Requirements: The UK, EU, and US each employ a mix of blending mandates and incentives to encourage SAF adoption. The UK's SAF Mandate (starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 22% by 2040) aligns with the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which also begins at 2% in 2025 but escalates to 70% by 2050. Although the US lacks a direct federal blending mandate, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs create market-driven demand for SAF.

Financial Incentives: Each jurisdiction incorporates financial incentives to lower SAF's production costs and bridge the price gap with fossil-based jet fuel. The UK's proposed Revenue Support Mechanism, the EU's SAF Allowance Mechanism under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the US's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits all aim to de-risk SAF investment. Notably, the US offers the most aggressive tax-based support via the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which directly rewards SAF producers.

Technology-Specific Targets: Recognizing the need for diversification in SAF production pathways, the UK and EU establish dedicated quotas for Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels and synthetic fuels, whereas the US allows greater flexibility in feedstocks, as seen in its Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and LCFS programs. The UK's PtL obligation has similar aims to the EU's sub-target for synthetic fuels, indicating a shared commitment to emerging technologies.

Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms: Each jurisdiction incorporates a credit trading system to enhance compliance flexibility. The UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs), the EU's ETS allowances and (if to be applied) book-and-claim system, and the US's RIN (Renewable Identification Number) market under the RFS facilitate compliance while stimulating a secondary market for SAF credits.

Key Differences

Despite these similarities, the jurisdictions differ in several key respects:

Direct v Market-Based Approach:

The EU and UK impose direct mandates on fuel suppliers, ensuring binding obligations for SAF blending. The UK's buy-out mechanism acts as a penalty for non-compliance, while the EU enforces fines and requires compensation for missed SAF quotas.

The US primarily relies on market-driven incentives, with no direct SAF blending mandate at the federal level. Instead, state-based programs such as California's LCFS and financial incentives like the IRA credits encourage voluntary SAF adoption.

Policy Longevity and Stability:

The EU offers the longest regulatory certainty, with ReFuelEU Aviation's SAF mandates extending to 2050. The UK's SAF Mandate provides clarity through 2040 but leaves open questions regarding future expansion.

The US approach is, potentially, more politically vulnerable. The IRA's Section 45Z tax credit is set to expire by the end of 2027, raising questions about long-term investor confidence. This contrasts with the EU's more predictable long-term regulatory trajectory.

Scope of SAF Eligibility and Feedstock Restrictions

The UK and EU impose stricter sustainability criteria, progressively limiting HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) (or similar) feedstock eligibility. The UK caps HEFA at 92% by 2027, declining to 35% by 2040, while the EU limits food-based biofuels to prevent indirect land-use impacts.

The US allows broader feedstock eligibility, including corn ethanol-derived alcohol-to-jet SAF, which the EU explicitly excludes. This reflects the political influence of the US agricultural sector, leading to a pragmatic approach to scaling SAF production with available resources.

Enforcement Mechanisms and Market Oversight

The EU employs oversight through the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and national regulatory bodies, ensuring strict compliance through direct penalties. The UK SAF Mandate will be administered by the UK's Department for Transport and will be responsible for enforcing the scheme with power to revoke certificates or issue civil penalties.

The US relies on tax compliance mechanisms and voluntary participation in state-based LCFS (or similar) markets, which, as an incentive-driven approach results inleading to comparatively less stringent enforcement as can be expected in the EU and UK.

Comparative Insights and Future Implications

Each jurisdiction's SAF strategy reflects its unique regulatory philosophy and economic priorities. The EU's highly structured, mandate-driven approach aims to achieve rapid SAF integration but places cost burdens on fuel suppliers and buyers. The UK's hybrid model, combining mandates with revenue support mechanisms, seeks to balance regulatory certainty with investment incentives. Meanwhile, the US favors a market-driven, incentive-based model, fostering innovation but opening up potential regulatory uncertainty due to shifting political landscapes.

This evolving landscape reflects a multi-faceted approach, balancing stringent emissions reduction targets with mechanisms that incentivise investment and production. The UK has introduced ambitious mandates within its Jet Zero strategy, while the EU's Fit-to-55 package integrates SAF quotas through the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Meanwhile, the USA leverages tax credits and grant programs under initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act to stimulate domestic SAF production. These diverse regulatory tools aim to address the significant challenges of scaling SAF, including high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure constraints.

Looking ahead, international policy harmonization will be critical to ensuring the global scalability of SAF. The International Civil Aviation Organization and industry stakeholders may push for greater alignment between EU- style mandates and US-style incentives, potentially influencing future SAF policies. Additionally, ongoing bilateral agreements between the UK, EU, and US on carbon accounting, emissions reporting, and SAF certification will play a crucial role in fostering a globally integrated SAF market.

Despite their differences, the UK, EU, and US share the common goal of scaling SAF production to enable a net zero aviation future. While their paths to achieving this differ, their collective efforts will be instrumental in driving the technological and economic transformation needed for sustainable aviation. As regulatory frameworks evolve, continued cross-border collaboration and policy adjustments will be essential to maximizing SAF's impact on global decarbonization goals.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/MondaqThumb.png,N,,2025-05-26 09:56:32.998635

The Air Force plans to use the plane both as a military cargo transport and as a long-range refueling aircraft.
Both of these grants are in support of the company’s main contract with the Air Force.
This coming week, it faces a critical design review in conjunction with the Air Force and NASA.
JetZero also plans to target the air freight market, with a plane similar in interior design to the military transport.","The future of commercial aviation could be taking shape inside a hangar next to Long Beach Airport.

This is where Long Beach startup JetZero Inc. is developing a “flying wing” aircraft that’s shaped like a B-2 Stealth Bomber, can seat up to 250 passengers and fly across the country using up to 50% less fuel.

If successful, the new plane would mark the first fuel-efficient aircraft to hit the mainline commercial aviation market. Many of the prior efforts to produce more energy-efficient aircrafts have involved zero-emission or hybrid power trains; they are initially using smaller planes aimed at the short-haul market with a range of less than 500 miles.

“Until now, there’s been no next-generation plane in the middle-market, capable of carrying up to 250 passengers and traveling in the 3,000-mile to 5,000-mile range,” said Tom O’Leary, JetZero’s chief executive. “Ours is the most efficient airplane possible at this time.”

Interest from airlines

Instead of focusing on the engine or the powertrain of the plane, JetZero is concentrating on the overall design. This means the all-wing configuration that has greater lift and improved airflow to reduce drag, thereby achieving up to 50% fuel savings compared to the conventional tube-and-wing design of all commercial jets flying today. And because the jet engines are mounted on top, much of the noise they generate would be deflected away from the ground.

On the inside, the all-wing configuration allows for larger cabin space and more varied seating arrangements, improving passenger access and comfort. These include wider pathways, modular setups, more entrances and exits, and higher ceilings that allow for more carry-on luggage capacity, among other things.

“Just changing the shape of the aircraft addresses every major need this industry faces,” when it comes to reducing fuel costs and improving the passenger experience, O’Leary said.

He added that all this can be done using existing engines and equipment.

Already three major commercial airlines have either invested in, or placed orders with, JetZero, even though the first test flight of the aircraft, known for now as the Z4, isn’t planned until late 2027:

• Alaska Airlines, a unit of Seattle-based Alaska Air Group Inc., announced last summer it was investing in JetZero. The investment includes an option to place an order for an unspecified number of JetZero planes;

• Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. announced in March it was also investing an unspecified sum in JetZero; and

• Chicago-based United Airlines Inc. announced in late April that it is also investing an unspecified sum in JetZero; its investment includes a path to order 100 JetZero aircraft with an option to purchase another 100 planes.

Air Force contract

These deals are just on the commercial side. Since 2023, JetZero has also had a $235 million contract with the United States Air Force to fast-track the development of a full-scale demonstration plane. The Air Force plans to use the plane both as a military cargo transport and as a long-range refueling aircraft.

“Right now, the most critical need for the Air Force is for a longer-range refueling aircraft,” O’Leary said.

The Air Force has been deploying in recent years the Boeing KC 46 Pegasus refueling tanker based on the Boeing 767 aircraft, with a range of up to 7,000 miles, though considerably less with a full payload. O’Leary said JetZero’s aircraft, would use up to 50% less fuel than the KC 46, allowing for a significant boost in range. This could be crucial as the Air Force and other military branches try to boost their force projection to the Western Pacific to counter the rising military threat from China.

Under this contract, JetZero has committed to having a demonstrator plane ready for a test flight by the end of 2027.

JetZero also has a $9 million grant from NASA and an $8 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration. Both of these grants are in support of the company’s main contract with the Air Force.

Billions needed

In all, including both the federal contracts and the airline investment, JetZero has raised more than $300 million to date. O’Leary said the company is in the midst of a series B raise with a target “well into the nine-figure range.”

But it’s going to take billions of dollars to produce enough planes to meet the potential orders that have already been announced.

“We’re talking in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion,” said Ben Marcus, co-founder and managing partner of Up.Partners, a Santa Monica-based venture capital and venture studio firm that helps build companies.

JetZero is not the only company in the race to develop a flying wing.

San Diego-based Natilus Inc. is developing two such planes. Known as the Kona, one aircraft would be for regional cargo flights. The other one, called Horizon, would be for the airline passenger market. The Horizon aircraft, unveiled last fall, would have a passenger capacity of about 200 and a range of about 3,000 miles, enough to cover most transcontinental flights. These aircraft would use about 25% less fuel than traditional planes. Natilus has said it is targeting 2030 for the first commercial flights.

Given this, JetZero has a lot riding on the 2027 test of its full-scale demonstrator plane that it’s preparing to build. This coming week, it faces a critical design review in conjunction with the Air Force and NASA.

“The moment that demonstrator plane flies, it will unlock a lot of capital,” Marcus said.

But if the demonstration test falls behind schedule or is not fully successful, then JetZero could lose its edge in the race to come up with a more fuel-efficient plane for the transcontinental market.

All-wing design dates back 30 years

The benefits of an all-wing configuration have long been recognized for its increased surface area to generate more lift and improved air flow that reduces drag. Sporadic attempts were made at various points over the past 100 years, but the tests either failed or the concept abandoned as the wing-and-tube design took hold.

The most serious effort at what became known in the industry as the “blended wing” approach took place in the early 1990s at McDonnell Douglas (since acquired by Boeing Co.), in partnership with NASA and Stanford University. That effort went as far as the successful test of a 17-foot scale model. But McDonnell Douglas and then Boeing declined to invest the capital necessary to develop and test a full-scale plane.

“The major aircraft manufacturers have little incentive to invest in something as revolutionary as this because it has such potential to cannibalize their existing business,” Marcus said.

Since aircrafts can have lifespans of up to 30 years, if the prospect of a new and better technology is in the offing a few years out, airlines may be unwilling to buy new conventional aircraft, he added.

That leaves the field open to new players – provided they can raise the capital.

In 2020, Mark Page, who led the McDonnell Douglas design effort, teamed up with O’Leary, a serial entrepreneur in both the aviation and auto industries, to launch JetZero.

Dual-market approach

The new company targeted both the commercial and the military markets from the outset.

On the commercial side, Marcus said there has been a growing frustration among commercial airlines about the lack of environment-friendly alternatives to traditional aircraft. He noted that at European airlines especially, there have been increased incidents of “flight shaming,” where environmentally-conscious consumers have targeted greenhouse gas emissions from planes. Switching to biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel has yielded only incremental benefits and is still more expensive than conventional fuel, he said.

Another factor spurring airline interest since the pandemic has been the delay in getting new conventional tube and wing planes into operation as Boeing has grappled with multiple issues, including quality control, supply chain disruptions and a culture that has been sharply criticized for not focusing enough on safety. All this has led to a backlog of nearly 11 years from the time an order is received to delivery of the plane, according to a recent analysis from Forecast International. (Airbus, the European manufacturing consortium, has a similar backlog.)

JetZero also plans to target the air freight market, with a plane similar in interior design to the military transport.

Early 2030s for first commercial flights

O’Leary said that assuming the 2027 test flight for the Air Force is successful, the next target will be FAA certification for commercial use. “We hope to achieve that by the end of 2030,” he said.

After that, assuming sufficient funds can be raised to scale up the manufacturing process, the first all-wing planes could be put into service by airlines in the early 2030s.

“It is going to be a gradual process,” he said.

The hope is that 10 years from now, the number of JetZero-made planes will number in the low hundreds – “enough that general passengers will use them on a regular basis.”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PG01_JetZero_Tom_OLeary_pcThomWasper19-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-05-26 09:57:00.574278

With support from investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, the facility promises to bring skilled jobs to Texas and help solidify U.S. leadership in energy innovation.

eFuels, made from waste CO2 and renewable energy, can replace petroleum-based fuels without changing engines or infrastructure. Infinium made history in 2023 with Project Pathfinder in Corpus Christi, becoming the first to ship commercial eFuels to the U.S. and Europe.

Roadrunner has secured major commercial agreements and financing, including 150 MW of wind energy from a NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary. Electric Hydrogen will supply its 100 MW HYPRPlant for green hydrogen production.

eFuels Set to Power Sustainable Aviation with Global Backing

The Roadrunner project will serve both U.S. and international markets. Under a deal with IAG, eSAF will be shipped to the UK to meet the UK SAF Mandate, requiring 10% of jet fuel from sustainable sources by 2030. “This represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said IAG’s Jonathon Counsell.

Commercial operations are expected by 2027 and backers say the project is a model for how next-gen climate tech can scale quickly. Brookfield’s Laura Hellman called the investment a strategic move to decarbonize aviation, while BE Catalyst’s Mario Fernandez praised the project’s finance-readiness.

Although they can be carbon neutral, e-fuels are the most expensive option due to high carbon capture and electrolysis costs.
Camille Mutrelle, an aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment, believes e-kerosene could drastically reduce aviation sector's carbon footprint.
Unlike bio-based SAF, which is limited by feedstock availability and land use concerns, e-kerosene can be scaled up sustainably to meet aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.
Twelve's first commercial demonstration plant, AirPlant One, is set to open in Washington state this year, with plans to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.","Sustainable aviation fuels are broadly classified into two types: bio-based SAF and e-SAF.

Bio-based SAF is made from organic materials like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, while e-SAF (also called electrofuels or e-kerosene) is made from renewable hydrogen and CO2 captured from the air.

Although they can be carbon neutral, e-fuels are the most expensive option due to high carbon capture and electrolysis costs.

Camille Mutrelle, an aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment, believes e-kerosene could drastically reduce aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Unlike bio-based SAF, which is limited by feedstock availability and land use concerns, e-kerosene can be scaled up sustainably to meet aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.

However, e-fuels are still more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

Carbon capture fuels provide an eco-friendly alternative to conventional biofuels, which are often based on monoculture crops such as sugarcane.

These crops can negatively impact biodiversity and compete with food production.

E-fuels use CO2 from the atmosphere or industrial emissions, along with hydrogen obtained from water through electrolysis with renewable electricity.

The end product is a synthetic jet fuel that can be used in current aircraft engines, recycling carbon instead of contributing more to the atmosphere.

California-based start-up Twelve is leading the charge with its low-temperature CO2 electrolysis method.

The energy-efficient process transforms CO2 and water into synthetic gas, the building block of synthetic fuel.

According to representatives at Twelve, these ""air-based fuels"" can cut emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil jet fuel—without the environmental toll of drilling, refining, or transporting oil.

Twelve's first commercial demonstration plant, AirPlant One, is set to open in Washington state this year, with plans to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.

United Airlines is a major supporter of this initiative. The company has also signed a deal to supply 260 million gallons of SAF over 14 years to Europe's International Airlines Group (IAG).

Despite the promise of e-fuels, moving from fossil fuels to genuinely sustainable aviation is a complicated affair due to current investments in oil, politics, and regulatory speed.

""Economies of scale are needed to lower prices, but the high upfront costs discourage airlines from adopting SAF widely,"" says Dublin City University aviation management professor Marina Efthymiou.

However, experts think flying on air-fuel could be a reality sooner than we think with continued investment and policy support.",https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l15420250526174126.jpeg,N,,2025-05-26 09:57:13.165710

The deal was signed in Hanoi during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Vietnam. Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Airbus International President Wouter van Wersch signed the agreement in the presence of both President Macron and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong, reported Travel and Tour World.

This new order is part of Vietjet’s long-term plan to grow its international flights. The new wide-body aircraft will allow the airline to increase the number of flights on busy routes across Asia and begin new long-distance routes, including to Europe.

Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said that Vietjet will continue to grow with support from modern Airbus aircraft, which help the airline save fuel and operate more efficiently. She added that the airline is committed to offering more travel options and environmentally friendly services to people around the world.

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry from Airbus said Vietjet is one of the world’s fastest-growing airlines and that Airbus is proud to support the airline’s future growth.

Vietjet currently operates 115 narrow-body aircraft from the Airbus A320 series and seven A330-300 aircraft. With the addition of the 40 new A330-900 planes, the airline is preparing to increase both short and long-distance services. The airline already flies to countries like Australia, India, and Kazakhstan using its existing A330s. These routes are important for business and tourism, and Vietjet plans to use the new aircraft to serve even more destinations.

The inside of the aircraft also offers more space, better lighting to reduce jet lag, and modern entertainment and internet access, helping passengers enjoy long trips more comfortably. Vietjet’s business class on these planes includes more comfortable seating and improved service.

The aircraft can also fly using up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which helps reduce the environmental impact of air travel. Airbus hopes to make all of its aircraft capable of using 100% SAF by 2030. Vietjet’s order supports this goal and reflects the airline’s plan to grow while being more environmentally responsible.

Airbus has received more than 1,800 orders for its A330 aircraft from over 130 airlines worldwide. For Vietjet, the new order is a clear sign of its ambition to move beyond the regional market and become a major international airline.

Announced during an official state visit, the agreement was signed in Hanoi by Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Wouter van Wersch, President Airbus International. The document exchange took place in the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong, underscoring the deal’s diplomatic and commercial importance.

Strategic Expansion to Europe and Beyond

This latest order will double Vietjet’s total commitment for A330neo aircraft to 40 units. The move supports the airline’s strategic plan to broaden its international network, specifically to boost capacity on routes across the Asia-Pacific and pave the way for new services to Europe. Vietjet currently uses its existing A330-300 aircraft to operate long-haul flights to Australia, India, and Kazakhstan. The upcoming A330-900 jets will enhance this capability, offering improved fuel efficiency, extended range, and a more comfortable passenger experience.

According to Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, “Modern Airbus aircraft, with the latest levels of efficiency and lower fuel consumption, have accompanied Vietjet’s growth and will continue to support our global flight network expansion.”

What Makes the A330neo Stand Out?

The A330neo (new engine option) is Airbus’s latest widebody aircraft, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and designed for long-distance efficiency. Capable of flying 7,200 nautical miles (13,300 kilometers) nonstop, the A330-900 is equipped with Airbus’s award-winning Airspace cabin. This cabin concept includes more space, enlarged overhead bins, a new lighting system, and advanced in-flight entertainment and connectivity options. It also features up to 50% compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with plans to reach 100% SAF usage by 2030.

'Aviation is in its fourth revolution. After mastering flight, ensuring its safety and making air travel accessible, the next frontier for aviation is decarbonisation,' postulated Airbus in its briefing ahead of the company’s recent summit on the future of sustainable aviation.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer and Communications at Airbus, stated boldly all Airbus aircraft are already certified to fly with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This has the potential to reduce lifecycle CO₂e emissions by up to 80% on average for their Scope 3 emissions, claims the company.

The next generation of Airbus aircraft are pledged to fly with a blend of up to 100% SAF.

But Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Hudson was clear that to continue this trajectory, government has an important role to play in driving demand and supply. Kitcher pointed to a 'chicken and egg situation' because SAF is three-to-five times the price of kerosene.

She described the alcohol-to-jet-fuel SAF innovation as 'promising' and noted mixed-blend SAF can be developed at scale without needing new refineries, but there is still a 'green premium'.

There needs to be a 'convergence of innovation and capital', she said. 'This is an opportunity to develop a new industry.'

Ilona Sitova, Vice Chair of FABEC SC ESO MUAC, asserted, 'We are not policymakers…We do our best to share our knowledge.' She saw a need for those in government to take a leap of faith. She believes if policymakers set the pace, then industry will find ways of keeping up. 'We do need someone to set the pace here and say, guys, get this done.'

Hudson added, 'I think the consumer of the future is going to make choices based on sustainability.'

Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaJet, believed there is a 'need [for] scalability, supportive policy and risk-happy capital'. Although he is encouraged by what he sees, he still felt things are moving too slow. Asserting, 'someday is now'.

Booking a ticket

In a step towards scaling SAF adoption, Airbus is testing a ‘book and claim’ approach to boost supply and demand within the sector. The system allows a buyer to ‘book’ a certain amount of SAF and claim the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus seeks to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

The first memorandum of understanding was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup.

Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

Elena Schmidt, Executive Director at RSB, believes ‘book and claim’ makes SAF more affordable and accountable.

While Julia Fidler, in charge of environmental sustainability, carbon reduction, fuels and materials decarbonisation at Microsoft, suggested the ‘book and claim’ system will enable long-term contracts to be signed for SAF.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, added, 'Supporting the SAF ‘book and claim’ mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.

'For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them.

'This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate ‘book and claim’ is reliable and its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.'

Gabrielle Walker, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at CUR8, a platform that helps global companies buy and manage carbon removals, asserted there is 'massive capacity for development in all parts of the world. Don’t forget how expensive it is to do nothing.'

Counteracting contrails

Mark Bentall, Head of Research and Technology at Airbus, shed light on another milestone for the firm in assessing contrail formation and the impact of fuel composition on particle emissions.

There are flights with atmospheric payloads on board, but these cannot measure what is left in the air once the aeroplane has landed, causing uncertainty about impact.

Steven Barrett, Regius Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University, asserted, 'This is not the Manhattan project.'

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC (Particle emissions, air quality and climate impact related to fuel composition and engine cycle) to study the aviation sector’s non-CO₂ emissions with a focus on contrails. The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations.

Recent studies suggest the use of SAFs could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAFs.

The project will test a range of fuels under controlled conditions, with consistency in combustion parameters and hardware. Lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center will extend to full-aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse in France.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.

It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

The Hydrogen Blue Condor experiment is now being analysed. Results are anticipated for the fourth quarter of the year.

Barrett noted, 'We have a strong research base for a generation of research', but he encouraged action rather than burying their heads in the sand. Barrett shared how the current data suggests contrail elimination will mitigate about 2% of global warming. Adding that even if this is wrong and the benefit is small, it might be worth the risk.

However, changing one flight path to mitigate contrail impact has a ricochet effect, so it is not a simple process and may create a safety and capacity issue.

While ironically, the summit highlighted how older, less-efficient aircraft create more heat and, conversely, fewer contrails, so more efficient aircraft will necessitate contrail-avoidance mechanisms. Further research will enable the industry to respond on a tactical basis.

A foldable flight future

Sue Partridge, Airbus Commercial Aircraft UK Country Manager and Head of its Wing of Tomorrow Programme, highlighted the need for wing designs to be longer and slenderer for improved performance, but this had been constrained by gate size. She revealed Airbus was designing foldable wings.

Airbus is also proposing advances in propulsion. It is working with CFM International on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open-fan engine demonstrator, which aims to show how this technology could reduce fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions by 20% compared to today’s most efficient single-aisle engines. Airbus plans to flight test RISE on its A380 aircraft by the end of the decade.

They are also working on advancing hybrid-electric propulsion, which supplements conventional jet fuel or SAF with electricity from batteries or fuel cells.

The EcoPulse demonstrator, a joint project between Airbus, Daher and Safran, gave significant insight into the use of lithium-ion batteries onboard an aircraft with a high-voltage network. While the potential of solid-state batteries is also being explored.

High hopes for hydrogen

Airbus reconfirmed its commitment to bring to market a commercially viable hydrogen aircraft. It presented some of the key technology building blocks at the summit that will enable the advent of a fully electric, fuel-cell powered, commercial aircraft – a pathway they say stands out as the most promising, following years of research into hydrogen aviation.

Airbus Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux, said, 'While we’ve adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the SAF pathway.'

These technologies were showcased as part of a new, notional concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four, 2MW, electric-propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel-cell systems would be supplied via two liquid hydrogen tanks.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, Glenn Llewellyn, added, 'Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept.",https://www.iom3.org/static/7552e0d6-35c6-43a2-bc8621c8f22c8428/opengraphimage_83f4e8796336604b59d7216d0ecd81a5_4a7c7e45a350/shutterstock2300524269.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 09:57:47.049602

Vietnamese low-cost carrier Vietjet has finalized a major deal with Airbus for twenty A330-900 widebody jets, reinforcing its long-term strategy to grow internationally over the next ten years.

The agreement was formalized in Hanoi, where Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Airbus International President Wouter van Wersch signed the order. The contract exchange took place during the official visit of French President Emmanuel Macron, witnessed by both him and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.

This significant fleet addition marks a pivotal step in Vietjet’s broader expansion roadmap. The widebody aircraft will empower the airline to boost frequency on heavily traveled routes across the Asia-Pacific and lay the groundwork for launching new long-haul services, including anticipated future connections to Europe.

Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “Modern Airbus aircraft, with the latest levels of efficiency and lower fuel consumption, have accompanied Vietjet’s growth and will continue to support our global flight network expansion. Vietjet remains dedicated to delivering greater connectivity and sustainable air travel for millions of passengers and around the world.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales Commercial Aircraft at Airbus said: “Vietjet has established itself as one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, bringing low fares with warm Vietnamese hospitality. We are proud that the carrier has selected the A330neo as its widebody aircraft of choice to build on its success, and we look forward to continuing our partnership as Vietjet expands its reach.”

Vietjet Doubles A330neo Order to Forty Aircraft in Strategic Expansion of Its Long-Haul Ambitions

Vietjet is making bold moves to solidify its position in the global aviation market by doubling its firm order for the Airbus A330neo wide-body aircraft. The Vietnamese low-cost carrier has now committed to a total of forty A330neo aircraft, marking a significant expansion from its previous order. This strategic decision not only enhances Vietjet’s long-haul capabilities but also reflects its broader vision to transform from a regional operator into a formidable player in international markets.

This new order complements Vietjet’s existing order of ninety-six A320neo Family aircraft, demonstrating a balanced approach in building both short-haul and long-haul operations. Currently, the airline’s operational fleet consists of one hundred fifteen Airbus A320 Family narrow-body aircraft and seven A330-300 wide-bodies, underscoring its strong and exclusive relationship with Airbus. Vietjet’s reliance on an all-Airbus fleet ensures operational consistency, cost efficiency, and simplified maintenance procedures—key factors for sustained profitability and growth.

Vietjet’s A330-300s are already active on several popular international routes, including long-haul destinations such as Australia, India, and Kazakhstan. These routes are particularly significant as they align with the airline’s goal of tapping into high-demand travel corridors and meeting the needs of both leisure and business travelers. Onboard, passengers benefit from a premium experience, especially in Business Class, where they enjoy superior comfort, more spacious seating, and a wider selection of inflight services. Vietjet’s commitment to customer satisfaction is evident in how these wide-body aircraft are configured to elevate the overall flying experience.

With its expanding A330 fleet, Vietjet is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the international air travel market. The A330-900, which is part of the Airbus A330neo family, represents the latest in aviation technology. It is powered by advanced Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and offers an extended range of up to 7,200 nautical miles—or about 13,300 kilometers—on a single flight. This range allows Vietjet to connect Vietnam with far-flung global destinations without compromising on efficiency or fuel economy.

Inside, the A330neo features the cutting-edge Airspace cabin—Airbus’s signature design known for maximizing passenger comfort and setting new standards in cabin experience. The Airspace interior offers wider seats, increased personal space, larger overhead bins, customizable ambient lighting to reduce jet lag, and access to the latest in inflight entertainment and high-speed connectivity options. These features make long-haul travel more enjoyable and underscore Vietjet’s aspiration to provide premium experiences at low-cost prices.

Environmental responsibility is also a key aspect of the A330neo’s appeal. The aircraft is built with sustainability in mind and is currently certified to fly using up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus has set a goal to achieve 100% SAF capability by the year 2030, aligning with global efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. Vietjet’s choice of the A330neo fits within this broader framework, helping the airline reduce emissions while expanding operations.

As of April 2025, Airbus had received more than 1,800 orders for the A330 Family from over 130 airlines worldwide. The popularity of the aircraft reflects the confidence airlines have in its versatility, efficiency, and passenger-friendly features. For Vietjet, doubling its A330neo order is not just a fleet expansion—it is a statement of intent. The airline is clearly preparing for a new phase of growth, one that will see it compete more aggressively in long-haul markets while offering enhanced services and maintaining its cost-competitive edge.

With global air travel continuing to rebound and expand, Vietjet’s investment in the A330neo is both timely and visionary. As passenger demand rises and expectations for onboard experiences grow, Vietjet is equipping itself with the tools to not just keep up—but lead the charge into a new era of international aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-2025-05-26T111756404-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 02:56:09.475140

Montevideo | BioEconomía* | Todo El Campo | La escena podría parecer salida de una novela de ciencia ficción ecológica: residuos de construcción convertidos en combustible para aviones. Pero no se trata de una utopía, sino de una realidad en desarrollo en Japón, donde Sumitomo Forestry y Rengo Co. se han aliado para producir bioetanol a partir de madera, con el objetivo de abastecer la creciente demanda de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Sumitomo Forestry, uno de los mayores conglomerados japoneses en gestión forestal, arquitectura sustentable y desarrollo de viviendas de madera, aportará los residuos provenientes de sus obras de construcción. Por su parte, Rengo Co., una histórica empresa con sede en Osaka dedicada al packaging, el reciclaje de papel y el desarrollo de materiales de biomasa, liderará el desarrollo tecnológico y la producción.

BIOETANOL A PARTIR DE MADERA: HOJA DE RUTA Y ESCALA INDUSTRIAL

El proyecto contempla establecer una alianza estratégica entre ambas compañías para diciembre de 2025, con vistas a alcanzar una producción anual de 20.000 kilolitros de bioetanol a partir de 2027. La materia prima serán residuos de madera certificada según el esquema internacional Corsia (**), lo que garantiza su origen sostenible para el uso en aviación.

La conversión del material lignocelulósico a etanol se llevará a cabo utilizando tecnología desarrollada por Biomaterial in Tokyo, una filial de Rengo especializada en innovación química a partir de biomasa. La producción tendrá lugar en la sede y planta de Taiko Paper, otra subsidiaria de Rengo que actualmente se dedica a fabricar papel para embalaje y reciclar residuos industriales.

MÁS QUE BIOCOMBUSTIBLE: UN MODELO CIRCULAR.

Lo que distingue a esta iniciativa es su ambición de ir más allá del biocombustible. En paralelo al etanol, se generarán subproductos como lignina, un componente clave de la madera que podría transformarse en pinturas residenciales y otros insumos para la construcción sostenible. De este modo, las empresas buscan cerrar el ciclo del uso de recursos forestales, maximizando su aprovechamiento en línea con los principios de la bioeconomía circular.

UNA TENDENCIA QUE CRECE.

El interés japonés por el bioetanol no se limita a esta alianza. A comienzos de este año, Nippon Paper Industries -una de las mayores compañías papeleras del país- se unió a Sumitomo Corporation, gigante del comercio y la inversión internacional, y a Green Earth Institute (GEI), una empresa biotecnológica que desarrolla tecnologías fermentativas para convertir biomasa en productos renovables. Juntos formaron la empresa Morisora Bio Energy.

El objetivo de esta nueva sociedad es construir una planta semi-comercial en la fábrica de Nippon Paper en Iwanuma, en la prefectura de Miyagi. Allí se emplearán recursos forestales sostenibles de la región de Tohoku -como restos de aserraderos- para producir más de 1.000 kL de bioetanol al año a partir de 2027, utilizando procesos fermentativos patentados por GEI.

LECCIONES DE JAPÓN: ¿PUEDE EL RESIDUO FORESTAL SER ORO LÍQUIDO?

Este doble avance muestra una hoja de ruta clara: con infraestructura, tecnología y visión, los residuos de madera pueden transformarse en un activo clave para la transición energética. El enfoque integral de empresas como Sumitomo Forestry y Rengo, sumado a las capacidades biotecnológicas de GEI, plantea un nuevo paradigma donde el bosque no solo da sombra y madera, sino también energía limpia para volar.

En un mundo que necesita soluciones urgentes para descarbonizar el transporte, el ejemplo japonés propone una alternativa concreta, replicable y sustentable: mirar al residuo como el punto de partida de la innovación.

A relatively new plant to Australia called Carinata is changing the biofuels industry, and trials are happening now west of the Great Dividing Range.

Cotton growers have been giving it a go as a rotation crop.

The results are pretty golden so far.

Carinata oil, when refined, is considered a 'drop-in' replacement for existing fossil fuels: the biofuel can be used without updating or retrofitting current machines, and blends with existing fossil fuels.

Biofuels: replacement fossil fuels, usually bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, made out of sustainable biogenic resources. Everything from wood offcuts, to agricultural by-products, used cooking oil or beef tallow and even algae can be turned into biofuels.

Queensland Government's definition of Biofuels

Cream of the Crop

Carinata looks similar to canola; bright yellow flowers on towering green stems.

It's grown in winter and suits drier soil types.

It boasts lower water needs than Canola, due to a longer rootstock.

The crop is being pitched as an emerging option for broadacre farmers over winter.

Having a 'cover crop' is being adopted by many growers looking to reduce topsoil losses, in between their traditional cropping seasons.

The oil from the Brassica family plant is classed as non-food: unlike Canola, it can't be consumed by humans.

Harvest and crushing

Currently, once matured and harvested, Carinata is shipped to Europe for processing. There are no operational processing facilities in Australia yet.

The grain is processed into two products: biofuel, and high protein plant feed for stock.

Biofuel use has already been written into EU's aviation fuel regulations, and Asia has indicated it will follow.

In Australia, Qantas has committed to using 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its overall fuel mix by 2030.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Produced from sustainable feedstocks and is very similar in its chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.

BP's definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry has shown serious interest in Carinata-derived biofuel.

Plant Power

The plant's pre-commercial trials in Australia are being overseen by Nufarm.

Rachel Palumbo is Nufarm's Global General Manager for seeds, and is hopeful Australia could become a world-leader.

""Australia has the land, resources, and expertise to lead in renewable fuels, sustainable agriculture, and homegrown manufacturing,"" she said.

""In South America, farmers already produce low-carbon fuel at scale. With the right support Australian growers can do the same.

Growers benefit from having a profitable break crop that improves soil health

Government support needed

Earlier this year, the Australian Government announced it would invest $250 million into low-carbon liquid fuels.

""This funding will drive innovation and open new opportunities for farmers to supply feedstocks like Carinata,"" Ms Palumbo said.

The Queensland Government has also shown interest in the blooming industry, recently commissioning Deloitte to review global SAF markets.

The 2024 report found:

""Australia's SAF industry is still in its infancy and this is unlikely to change on the scale needed to support decarbonisation without government intervention and a proactive industry.""

Ms Palumbo also pointed to government-driven SAF mandates as a crucial step to fostering a local biofuels industry.

""We need a clear policy framework so Australian-grown biofuels can support local industries, just as Australian-grown canola already does for European biofuels.""

""This is a proven, sustainable, and scalable option for securing our fuel future while supporting growers and cutting emissions,"" Ms Palumbo said.",https://farmers.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carinata-in-flower.png,N,,2025-05-26 00:56:41.264883

Σύμφωνα με εκτιμήσεις του κλάδου η αυξανόμενη ζήτηση καυσίμων τα επόμενα χρόνια θα οδηγήσει σε αύξηση των επενδύσεων έως το 2030, παρά το γεγονός ότι τη διετία 2023-2024 σημειώθηκε σημαντική κάμψη.

Τα «πράσινα» καύσιμα αναμένεται να βρεθούν στο επίκεντρο αυτών των επενδύσεων καθώς η πρόσμιξη τους στις βενζίνες, το ντίζελ, τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα και τα καύσιμα ναυτιλίας, αποτελεί υποχρέωση που επιβάλλουν οι κανονισμοί της ΕΕ όχι μόνο για τους χρήστες αλλά και για τους παραγωγούς που πρέπει να προετοιμαστούν κατάλληλα.

Αεροπορικά καύσιμα

Στο επίκεντρο των συζητήσεων αυτή την περίοδο βρίσκονται τα «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα μέσω της εφαρμογής του ευρωπαϊκού κανονισμού ReFuelEU από το 2025, με αρχικό ποσοστό πρόσμιξης SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) 2%. Το ποσοστό αυτό προβλέπεται να αυξηθεί στο 6% το 2030, για να φθάσει σταδιακά στο 70% το 2050.

Οι ελληνικές εταιρίες διύλισης HelleniQ Energy και Motor Oil ήδη από τις αρχές του 2025 διαθέτουν αεροπορικά καύσιμα με πρόσμιξη 2% SAF.

Μάλιστα η HelleniQ Energy από το 2021 εφάρμοσε ένα πιλοτικό πρόγραμμα διαθέτοντας καύσιμα με πρόσμιξη SAF στην Aegean για τις πτήσεις της από το αεροδρόμιο Μακεδονία της Θεσσαλονίκης. Το καύσιμο προέρχονταν αρχικά από τη φιλανδική εταιρεία Neste, αλλά ο ελληνικός όμιλος συνεργάζεται πλέον με ολοένα και περισσότερους προμηθευτές.

Το SAF είναι αεροπορικό καύσιμο που παράγεται από ανακυκλωμένα έλαια, λίπη, ή οργανικά απόβλητα και μπορεί να μειώσει τις εκπομπές έως και κατά 80%, χωρίς να απαιτείται τροποποίηση στους κινητήρες των αεροσκαφών.

Για την παραγωγή του η HelleniQ Energy προωθεί τη δημιουργία μονάδας για «πράσινα» αεροπορικά καύσιμα με παραγωγή 150.000 τόνων ετησίως, ποσότητα που υπερβαίνει τις ανάγκες της ελληνικής αγοράς γεγονός που σημαίνει ότι σημαντικές ποσότητες θα κατευθυνθούν σε εξαγωγές. Η μονάδα θα βασιστεί σε πρώτες ύλες όπως τα υπολείμματα τροφών, τα τηγανόλαδα και τα ζωικά λίπη, ακολουθώντας το ευρωπαϊκό μοντέλο που αποκλείει προϊόντα που ενδέχεται να επιβαρύνουν την τροφική αλυσίδα.

Παράλληλα στη Θεσσαλονίκη, η HelleniQ Energy δημιουργεί το Green Hub North Project το οποίο στοχεύει να εξελιχθεί σε κόμβο παραγωγής υγρών καυσίμων χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιο-αιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ. Εξάλλου η επεξεργασία πρώτων υλών φυτικής προέλευσης στις υπάρχουσες μονάδες αποθείωσης, επιτρέπει την παραγωγή «πράσινου ντίζελ».

Στον ναυτιλιακό τομέα, η Helleniq Energy έχει ξεκινήσει την παραγωγή μείγματος ναυτιλιακού καυσίμου (mazut) με βιοντίζελ, χρησιμοποιώντας αποκλειστικά απορρίμματα ελαίων. Η χρήση βιοκαυσίμων στη ναυτιλία εντάσσεται στο πλαίσιο του FuelEU Maritime, με τις εταιρίες να αναζητούν τρόπους συμμόρφωσης ενόψει της ενσωμάτωσης του τομέα στο Σύστημα Εμπορίας Εκπομπών.

Παραγωγή βιοκαυσίμων

Σε ανάλογο μήκος κύματος η Motor Oil προωθεί τη δημιουργία εγκαταστάσεων προηγμένων βιοκαυσίμων, με στόχο την παραγωγή άνω των 250.000 τόνων ετησίως. Επιπλέον, βρίσκονται στα σκαριά επενδύσεις για την ανάπτυξη e-μεθανόλης, με προγραμματισμένη παραγωγή 25.000 τόνων έως το 2029.

Το 2022 ο όμιλος εξαγόρασε την Elin Verde με αντικείμενο την παραγωγή και εμπορία βιοκαυσίμων, η οποία διαθέτει εργοστάσιο παραγωγής βιοντίζελ στη ΒΙ.ΠΕ Βόλου, ενώ ελέγχει και την «Πράσινο Λάδι» που δραστηριοποιείται στη συλλογή και εμπορία χρησιμοποιημένων μαγειρικών ελαίων και ζωικών λιπών (που αποτελούν την πρώτη ύλη για τα βιοκαύσιμα).

Το κόστος των συγκεκριμένων καυσίμων αλλά και κυρίως η ανεπάρκεια πρώτων υλών είναι από τα κυριότερα προβλήματα στην παραγωγή και τη χρήση τους. Αξίζει αναφερθεί ότι το κόστος του SAF αρχικά ήταν πενταπλάσιο από το απλό καύσιμο αεροπορίας και σήμερα είναι διπλάσιο. Βεβαίως το χαμηλό ποσοστό πρόσμιξης μειώνει δραστικά την επίπτωση στην τελική τιμή του προϊόντος.

Persidangan Kemuncak ASEAN 2025 yang bakal berlangsung pada 26 dan 27 Mei 2025 di Pusat Konvensyen Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) menjadi titik tolak penting dalam sejarah rantau ini. Dengan Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN, perhimpunan ini membawa satu naratif besar melalui temanya – “Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan”. Tema ini bukan sahaja mencerminkan aspirasi serantau, malah selari dengan prinsip Malaysia MADANI yang diterajui oleh YAB Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

Peranan Sejarah Malaysia dalam ASEAN

Malaysia merupakan negara pengasas ASEAN sejak tahun 1967. Sepanjang dekad-dekad yang lalu, negara ini telah memainkan peranan penting dalam mempromosikan kerjasama serantau, keamanan dan pembangunan ekonomi. Sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN buat kali kelima, Malaysia membawa pendekatan progresif yang menggabungkan elemen kemanusiaan dan keterangkuman sosial. Hal ini merupakan satu pendekatan yang amat diperlukan dalam dunia pasca-pandemik dan perubahan iklim yang drastik.

Makna Tema “Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan”

Tema ini menggabungkan dua nilai teras:

 Keterangkuman (Inclusivity) menekankan kepada penyertaan menyeluruh semua golongan masyarakat tanpa mengira latar belakang – termasuk wanita, golongan orang kurang upaya (OKU), belia, warga emas, dan masyarakat luar bandar. Keterangkuman ini juga mencakupi penglibatan negara-negara anggota ASEAN dalam membuat keputusan kolektif tanpa dominasi oleh negara tertentu.

 Kemampanan (Sustainability) pula merujuk kepada pembangunan yang menjaga keseimbangan antara keperluan ekonomi, kelestarian alam sekitar, dan kesejahteraan sosial. Dalam erti kata lain, kemajuan mesti diwarisi oleh generasi masa depan tanpa menjejaskan sumber sedia ada.

Langkah-Langkah Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025

1. Pengukuhan Ekonomi Digital dan Rantaian Bekalan Inklusif

Malaysia memimpin inisiatif Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA), satu rangka kerja pertama di ASEAN bagi menyelaraskan ekosistem digital antara negara anggota. Ini bukan sahaja membuka peluang pekerjaan dan pelaburan, malah memberi akses kepada masyarakat luar bandar dan golongan mikro-PKI untuk terlibat dalam ekonomi digital.

Selain itu, pihak kerajaan turut menekankan ekonomi gig dan pembelajaran sepanjang hayat bagi memastikan semua golongan, termasuk belia dan OKU, tidak tertinggal dalam perubahan ini.

2. Agenda Alam Sekitar dan Tenaga Lestari

Malaysia telah mengemukakan beberapa inisiatif termasuk pengeluaran Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), pelabuhan hijau, dan grid tenaga karbon rendah merentas ASEAN. Usaha ini diselaraskan dengan Pelan Peralihan Tenaga Nasional dan aspirasi Net-Zero 2050. ASEAN turut menyokong pembangunan ekopelancongan dan pertanian lestari sebagai sumber pertumbuhan hijau baharu.

Selain itu, Malaysia juga akan mengadvokasi kerjasama serantau yang lebih erat dalam tindakan iklim, tenaga hijau dan pembangunan mampa. Lebih memberansangkan, Malaysia kini merupakan hab utama global bagi pengeluaran komponen solar fotovoltaik (PV), dengan enam daripada sepuluh syarikat pengeluar PV terbesar dunia beroperasi di negara ini.

Hal ini melambangkan menifestasi Malaysia yang komited sepenuhnya terhadap peralihan hijau, bukan sahaja dalam negara malah merentasi Asia Tenggara. Kita terus memperjuangkan dasar, teknologi dan amalan lestari yang memberi manfaat kepada ASEAN secara keseluruhannya.

3. Pengarusutamaan Golongan Rentan dan OKU dalam Dasar Serantau

Satu aspek penting yang ditekankan Malaysia ialah penglibatan aktif golongan OKU dalam pembangunan. Melalui pelaksanaan Rangka Tindakan ASEAN mengenai Keterangkuman Sosial (ASEAN Enabling Masterplan 2025), Malaysia mengambil langkah untuk menyediakan infrastruktur mesra OKU, peluang pekerjaan, serta sokongan kesihatan mental dan fizikal.

Antara program yang dilaksanakan termasuk sokongan sosial berbentuk latihan digital, insentif majikan mesra OKU, dan kempen kesedaran di institusi awam dan pendidikan.

4. Pendidikan Inklusif dan Penglibatan Belia

Malaysia menekankan kepada keterlibatan belia sebagai agen perubahan. Pendidikan rentas sempadan, biasiswa ASEAN, dan program pertukaran budaya dijadikan platform memupuk semangat serantau dan toleransi. Dalam masa sama, pendekatan STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) turut digalakkan bagi melahirkan tenaga kerja berkemahiran tinggi yang inklusif gender dan etnik.

5. Pengukuhan Tadbir Urus Serantau dan Rangka Dasar MADANI

Kepimpinan Malaysia dalam ASEAN 2025 juga menjadi pentas untuk mempromosikan nilai-nilai MADANI dalam konteks antarabangsa. Ini termasuklah:

 Kemampanan melalui dasar peralihan tenaga dan ekonomi hijau

 Kesejahteraan melalui agenda sosial yang menyeluruh

 Keterangkuman dalam pembentukan dasar awam dan diplomasi rakyat

Aspirasi MADANI ini diterapkan dalam sidang kemuncak melalui pelibatan pelbagai sektor – awam, swasta dan masyarakat sivil – dalam proses perundingan dan pelaksanaan dasar.

Kajian Perbandingan dan Sokongan Serantau

Negara jiran seperti Thailand dan Indonesia menyambut baik pendekatan Malaysia. Thailand misalnya, menyatakan sokongan terbuka terhadap visi keterangkuman Malaysia, khususnya dalam pelibatan masyarakat tempatan dan penjagaan biodiversiti serantau. Indonesia pula melihat Malaysia sebagai rakan kongsi penting dalam menstrukturkan ekosistem digital dan pemerkasaan komuniti melalui inisiatif ekonomi hijau.

Cabaran dan Syor Penambahbaikan

1. Jurang Digital antara Kawasan Bandar dan Luar Bandar Cabaran:

Melalui laporan Biro Perdagangan Antarabangsa Amerika mengenai Malaysia pada tahun 2024 menyatakan, walaupun kadar penembusan internet di kawasan bandar Malaysia mencapai 92%, kawasan luar bandar masih ketinggalan dengan hanya 68% akses internet. Jurang ini menghalang penyertaan penuh komuniti luar bandar dalam ekonomi digital, pendidikan dalam talian, dan perkhidmatan kerajaan elektronik.

Syor:

 Pelaksanaan Audit Inklusiviti Digital: Menilai dan mengenal pasti kawasan yang memerlukan peningkatan infrastruktur digital.

 Peningkatan Peruntukan untuk Pendidikan Keterangkuman Digital: Menyediakan latihan dan sumber kepada komuniti luar bandar untuk meningkatkan literasi digital.

 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta: Mendorong pelaburan dalam infrastruktur digital di kawasan kurang liputan melalui insentif dan kerjasama strategik.

2. Kesedaran tentang Kelestarian Alam Sekitar dalam Kalangan Industri Kecil dan Sederhana (PKS)

Cabaran:

The Malaysiaan Reserve melaporkan walaupun kesedaran ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) dalam kalangan PKS Malaysia meningkat dari 14% kepada 80% dalam dua tahun terakhir, banyak PKS masih menghadapi cabaran dalam melaksanakan amalan lestari sepenuhnya.

Syor:

 Penyediaan Panduan ESG yang Mudah Difahami: Memperkenalkan panduan ESG yang disesuaikan dengan keperluan PKS untuk memudahkan pelaksanaan.

 Insentif Kewangan dan Sokongan Teknikal: Menyediakan geran, pinjaman mudah, dan bantuan teknikal kepada PKS yang berusaha mengamalkan kelestarian.

 Program Latihan dan Kesedaran: Mengadakan bengkel dan seminar untuk meningkatkan pemahaman PKS mengenai kepentingan dan manfaat amalan lestari.

3. Penglibatan Orang Kurang Upaya (OKU) yang Masih Bersifat Simbolik

Cabaran:

Walaupun terdapat dasar seperti ASEAN Enabling Masterplan 2025, penglibatan OKU dalam pembangunan sosial dan ekonomi masih terhad dan sering bersifat simbolik dan terdapat syor supaya keteribatan OKU mesti dipertingkatkan dengan beberapa syor berikut.

Syor:

 Memperluas Akses Kesihatan dan Infrastruktur Mesra OKU: Meningkatkan kemudahan awam dan perkhidmatan kesihatan yang mesra OKU di seluruh negara.

 Pelaksanaan Audit Inklusiviti dalam Semua Dasar ASEAN: Menilai sejauh mana dasar-dasar sedia ada memenuhi keperluan OKU dan membuat penambahbaikan

yang diperlukan.

 Memperkenalkan Indeks ASEAN-MADANI: Membangunkan penanda aras untuk menilai kemajuan keterangkuman dan kemampanan, termasuk penglibatan OKU, di peringkat serantau.

Dengan mengatasi cabaran-cabaran ini melalui syor-syor yang dicadangkan, Malaysia dapat memimpin ASEAN ke arah masa depan yang lebih inklusif dan lestari, selaras dengan aspirasi tema &quot;Keterangkuman dan Kemampanan&quot; serta prinsip Malaysia MADANI.

Penjajaran dengan Aspirasi Malaysia MADANI

Aspirasi Malaysia MADANI yang menekankan nilai-nilai kemampanan, kesejahteraan, dan keterangkuman sosial sejajar dengan tema ASEAN 2025. Melalui kepimpinan dalam ASEAN, Malaysia berpeluang untuk mempromosikan nilai-nilai ini di peringkat serantau, memperkukuh perpaduan dan kemakmuran bersama.

Kesimpulan: Harapan dan Aspirasi Rakyat Malaysia

Persidangan Kemuncak ASEAN 2025 merupakan medan penting bagi Malaysia memperlihatkan kepemimpinan berwibawa yang bukan sahaja berpaksikan ekonomi dan geopolitik, malah nilai-nilai kemanusiaan dan rahmah. Dengan menekankan aspek keterangkuman dan kemampanan, Malaysia boleh menjadi contoh kepada dunia bahawa pembangunan yang bersifat menyeluruh dan lestari mampu menjadi realiti.

Sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025, Malaysia memainkan peranan penting dalam memacu pembangunan serantau yang inklusif dan lestari. Melalui pelbagai inisiatif dalam bidang Ekonomi digital, kemampanan alam sekitar, keterangkuman sosial, dan infrastruktur, Malaysia berusaha untuk memastikan bahawa tiada siapa yang ketinggalan dalam arus pembangunan. Penjajaran dengan aspirasi Malaysia MADANI memperkukuh lagi komitmen negara untuk membina masyarakat yang adil, makmur, dan berdaya tahan di peringkat serantau.

Rakyat Malaysia, khususnya golongan muda dan OKU, mengharapkan bahawa inisiatif ini tidak hanya tinggal sebagai slogan atau dokumen dasar, tetapi diterjemahkan ke dalam tindakan konkrit dan berkesan.

Kedua langkah tersebut menjadi kunci bagi perusahaan dalam menghadapi situasi geopolitik yang sangat dinamis dalam beberapa waktu terakhir.

Sejumlah kondisi geopolitik masih menjadi sorotan bagi aktivitas perdagangan global. Kebijakan tarif, perang antara Rusia dan Ukraina, ketegangan India dan Pakistan, hingga konflik kawasan di sejumlah negara di Timur Tengah yang tak kunjung mereda, adalah contoh dinamika yang berdampak cukup besar saat ini.

Sebagai antisipasi menghadapi kondisi itu, PIS terus memperkuat lini bisnis dengan strategi terukur. PIS akan mengungkap racikan perusahaan itu secara menyeluruh di ajang Indonesia Maritime Week (IMW) 2025 yang akan digelar pada 26–28 Mei 2025 di Jakarta.

Direktur Perencanaan Bisnis PIS Eka Suhendra menyampaikan, “Ekspansi pasar dan diversifikasi kargo masih menjadi landasan strategi PIS dalam menghadapi dinamika geopolitik yang begitu fluktuatif. Langkah ini kami ambil untuk mencegah ketergantungan perusahaan terhadap suatu pasar dan produk kargo tertentu.”

PIS terus memperluas rute pelayaran di domestik dan luar negeri. Hingga hari ini, rute pelayaran internasional PIS sudah mencapai 65 negara. Selain itu, PIS juga telah memiliki tiga kantor perwakilan di Singapura, Dubai, dan London. Dengan terus memperluas pasar dan layanan, PIS sebagai subholding dan bagian dari Pertamina Group, menegaskan posisinya sebagai pemain global di sektor logistik energi dan maritim.

“Keberhasilan langkah ini terbukti meningkatkan kontribusi pendapatan dari pasar non-captive hingga 64% sepanjang tahun 2024 dibandingkan tahun sebelumnya,” imbuh Eka.

Dalam setiap langkah strategisnya, PIS tidak hanya berorientasi pada pertumbuhan bisnis, tetapi juga pada kontribusi nyata bagi bangsa. Sebagai bagian dari BUMN logistik dan energi, PIS menjalankan peran penting dalam menjaga ketahanan energi nasional melalui rantai logistik laut yang andal dan berkelanjutan.

Dengan memperluas jangkauan dan diversifikasi layanan, PIS turut memperkuat posisi Indonesia sebagai poros maritim dunia serta mendukung terciptanya konektivitas laut yang efisien dan kompetitif, baik untuk kepentingan nasional maupun regional.

Di samping perluasan pasar, PIS juga terus menggencarkan diversifikasi produk. Meskipun tetap fokus terhadap bisnis inti dalam pengangkutan energi, PIS senantiasa menatap sektor lain yang memiliki potensi besar untuk digarap seperti halnya dry bulk.

“PIS aktif mengkaji berbagai produk di luar sektor energi sebagai diversifikasi produk angkutan kami.

A relatively new plant to Australia called Carinata is changing the biofuels industry, and trials are happening now west of the Great Dividing Range.

Cotton growers have been giving it a go as a rotation crop.

The results are pretty golden so far.

Carinata oil, when refined, is considered a ‘drop-in’ replacement for existing fossil fuels: the biofuel can be used without updating or retrofitting current machines, and blends with existing fossil fuels.

Biofuels: replacement fossil fuels, usually bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, made out of sustainable biogenic resources. Everything from wood offcuts, to agricultural by-products, used cooking oil or beef tallow and even algae can be turned into biofuels.

Queensland Government’s definition of Biofuels

Cream of the Crop

Carinata looks similar to canola; bright yellow flowers on towering green stems.

It’s grown in winter and suits drier soil types.

It boasts lower water needs than Canola, due to a longer rootstock.

The crop is being pitched as an emerging option for broadacre farmers over winter.

Having a ‘cover crop’ is being adopted by many growers looking to reduce topsoil losses, in between their traditional cropping seasons.

The oil from the Brassica family plant is classed as non-food: unlike Canola, it can’t be consumed by humans.

Harvest and crushing

Currently, once matured and harvested, Carinata is shipped to Europe for processing. There are no operational processing facilities in Australia yet.

The grain is processed into two products: biofuel, and high protein plant feed for stock.

Biofuel use has already been written into EU’s aviation fuel regulations, and Asia has indicated it will follow.

In Australia, Qantas has committed to using 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its overall fuel mix by 2030.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Produced from sustainable feedstocks and is very similar in its chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.

BP’s definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry has shown serious interest in Carinata-derived biofuel.

Plant Power

The plant’s pre-commercial trials in Australia are being overseen by Nufarm.

Rachel Palumbo is Nufarm’s Global General Manager for seeds, and is hopeful Australia could become a world-leader.

“Australia has the land, resources, and expertise to lead in renewable fuels, sustainable agriculture, and homegrown manufacturing,” she said.

“In South America, farmers already produce low-carbon fuel at scale. With the right support Australian growers can do the same.

Growers benefit from having a profitable break crop that improves soil health

Government support needed

Earlier this year, the Australian Government announced it would invest $250 million into low-carbon liquid fuels.

“This funding will drive innovation and open new opportunities for farmers to supply feedstocks like Carinata,” Ms Palumbo said.

The Queensland Government has also shown interest in the blooming industry, recently commissioning Deloitte to review global SAF markets.

The 2024 report found:

“Australia’s SAF industry is still in its infancy and this is unlikely to change on the scale needed to support decarbonisation without government intervention and a proactive industry.”

Ms Palumbo also pointed to government-driven SAF mandates as a crucial step to fostering a local biofuels industry.

“We need a clear policy framework so Australian-grown biofuels can support local industries, just as Australian-grown canola already does for European biofuels.”

“This is a proven, sustainable, and scalable option for securing our fuel future while supporting growers and cutting emissions,” Ms Palumbo said.",https://farmers.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carinata-feilds-photo-credit-Nuseed.png,N,,2025-05-26 01:56:13.164558

So, what do we know about the changes in the global footprint of companies and government policies towards foreign business and trade?
Business executives would do well to recall Deming’s dictum: stakeholders that claim that the polycrisis changes everything should be asked to provide hard evidence.
For international business nowadays those risks are just as likely to arise at home than from abroad.
But what executives must not do is allow narrative alone to induce a retreat from foreign markets.","One example is a recent speech by Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s deputy prime minister, finance minister and former foreign minister, in which she re-examines the results of spending “three decades building an interconnected global economy” .

The view that flows from some of this thinking is that the international footprint of companies must be rethought because executives failed to take proper account of risks evident in today’s fraught world.

And the drum beat from certain key policymakers is relentless. Apparent “weaponization” of trade ties by China and Russia has put wind in their sails, as Mark Leonard shows in his 2021 book The Age of Unpeace. This has led to calls for supply chains to be designed with “just in case” considerations in mind rather than with “just in time”.

Senior national security officials from Germany, the US, and the UK are on record twisting the knife further – adding an “us versus them” angle to corporate deliberations on supply chain reconfiguration. In a speech in London in July, 2022, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Christopher Wray, said that China posed a “far more complex and pervasive threat to businesses than even most sophisticated company leaders realize” .

Other policymakers are not content with leaving it to international business to adjust (or not) as they see fit; they have begun to take action. US Commerce and Treasury Secretaries now advocate a “friend-shoring” approach to recasting international supply chains. This has been backed up by controversial tax incentives in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the US.

For their part, the European Commission has adopted a policy of “Open Strategic Autonomy,” an approach that puts more emphasis on the last word rather than the first two. One of the first policymakers to call for action was late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose government set up in April 2020 a $2 billion fund to encourage Japanese firms to shift factories out of China..

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added fuel to the fire to those claiming that globalization has gone too far. Western businesses operating in Russia were urged to divest, lest they be accused of “trading with the enemy”. Yet the reality has been more complicated. Straight divestment has consequences. The chairman of one large pharmaceutical company told me that they should not leave Russia and punish their customers, the logic being: why should a sick Russian be denied Western medicines because of Putin’s war?

From the start, forward-looking analysts and executives saw Western government sanctions on Russia and the concomitant pressure exerted on business as a dress rehearsal for the disruption to corporate plans that would follow a future Chinese attempt to forcibly reunite with Taiwan.

The question is whether this drum beat of criticism is actually prompting widespread retreat from globalization in terms of corporate decisions and of government policy capable of shaping those decisions. At this point, there are good reasons for doubting that broad-based retreat is occurring or, perhaps more importantly, on the cards.

Adding to the rhetoric is the awkward fact that most trusted sources of information on business and policy developments publish facts long after key decisions were taken. It was notable that during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments did not have up-to-date information on the where to source medical equipment.

When it comes to the data waymarkers of globalization, the US Department of Commerce publishes quite detailed statistics on the global footprint of American multinationals with a three-year lag. Global cross-border data on goods shipments is obtainable from the United Nations, for example, but comes with a minimum 12-month lag.

Moreover, only twice a year does the World Trade Organization publish reports on the policy steps taken by governments – and much of the policy relevant to business isn’t covered in those WTO reports. No international organization has a mandate to collect detailed information on policies affecting service sectors or the digital economy. In these circumstances, when credible information is either non-existent or delivered very late – and to paraphrase the oft-used maxim – a narrative can get halfway around the world before the truth can get its shoes on.

So, what do we know about the changes in the global footprint of companies and government policies towards foreign business and trade? The best advice here is to pierce the veil of rhetoric and demand hard facts on what is changing on the ground. As renowned US engineer and statistician W. Edwards Deming once said: “In God we trust. All others must bring data.”

Yes, foreign direct investment – a prominent manifestation of globalization – is growing more slowly than domestic capital expenditures. But this has been the tendency since 2005, well before the Global Financial Crisis, the US-China trade war, and the current polycrisis.

Beyond the tariffs imposed during the US-China trade war (where total trade affected amounts to less than 5% of world goods trade) and this year’s Western sanctions on Russia, calculations based on the Global Trade Alert database reveal that just 5.6% of world goods trade is affected by protectionist measures that single out another nation’s exports.

When it comes to government policies towards foreign business and trade, awarding corporate subsidies is the most common form of government favoritism around the world (not just in China). Some of that largesse is designed to shore up competitive positions in home markets, some in foreign markets. But few state incentives exist to repatriate factories from abroad.

When governments put money on the table to reconfigure supply chains, compared to the corporate stakes involved, the sums are trivial. Japan’s scheme mentioned earlier garnered a lot of headlines because of its budget envelope – but it turned out that, on average, Japanese firms that benefited received less than $15 million each. The recent CHIPS and Science Act in the US includes tens of billions of dollars of incentives to set up semiconductor fabs in the country, yet industry analysts are unanimous in saying that these sums are a fraction of the costs borne by business.

At least four studies of sourcing patterns of those medical goods scarce at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic – including a peer-reviewed examination of the issue by me in 2020, and another by European Centre for International Political Economy senior economist Oscar Guinea the same year – revealed very few cases where most supplies came from China. Little remarked upon was the fact that mask shortages and the like quickly subsided once Chinese factories geared up production in mid-2020.

While some Western politicians and foreign policy analysts reckon that the world is on its way to a definitive split between rival democratic and autocratic blocks, the reality is that democratic nations crimp the exports of other democratic nations proportionally more than they do from autocracies. Yet, the reluctance of US and EU officials to contemplate new binding trade deals shuts off one-way democratic nations could form a block that could create meaningful gains for international business.

Many companies said after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that they were exiting or planned to. Some large multinationals did, but a surprising number remain, and some of those that fully divested have even negotiated clauses to buy their assets back later.

What to make of this? Globalization and cross-border supply chains have been traduced. To the extent that trade and investment flows have been weaponized, this is localized and doesn’t merit a systemic rethink. Business executives would do well to recall Deming’s dictum: stakeholders that claim that the polycrisis changes everything should be asked to provide hard evidence. Officials have yet to follow through on their advocacy of decoupling, so there is a mismatch between rhetoric and actions taken. Furthermore, business isn’t retreating wholesale from emerging markets.

FBI Director Wray was right to encourage accurate risk assessments in his speech. But this applies to policy risks as well as to the loss of intellectual property in China. For international business nowadays those risks are just as likely to arise at home than from abroad. Risk assessment should be based on best available evidence. Executives should first identify which emergent geopolitical risks pose the greatest threat to their existing business models (not all do) and then seek out the experts prepared to piece together disparate information and insights on relevant policy dynamics.

From time-to-time, executives and board members should schedule discussions on how they would react to different contingencies and whether to adjust their global footprint to “known unknows” as the late Donald Rumsfeld would have put it.

Globalization will continue to evolve. But what executives must not do is allow narrative alone to induce a retreat from foreign markets.",https://www.imd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alexandr-podvalny-FvBVVf0ctnk-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 22:56:41.376558

Kim Reynolds' desk. A number of those pieces of legislation directly impact agriculture.

Biofuels

In early May, Reynolds increased funding for the Iowa Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Program. In July, the annual support will rise from $10 million to $14 million. The Iowa Soybean Association said the funds will be used to help gas stations and other fueling sites update their equipment to use renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.

“Increasing demand and accessibility for biodiesel is a top priority for Iowa farmers,” Suzanne Shirbroun, ISA president and farmer from Farmersburg, said in a press release. “A strong biodiesel market helps support our state’s thriving agriculture industry by increasing the per-bushel price of soybeans.”

Iowa is the top producer of both ethanol and biodiesel. The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says those fuels account for $5.7 billion of the state's GDP.

Property Taxes

Iowa Corn Growers Association Vice President of Government Relations Kevin Studer said farmers will not see property tax relief this year from the state legislature. He said it's an institutional part of the state's government, but also a place the organization's members would like to see reform.

""It's not a very sexy issue, but it's one that's very vital to our members,"" Studer said. ""It's kind of like, yes, if you have $7 corn, that's awesome, but if you get property taxes and all your input costs and everything keep creeping away at your at your balance sheet, that's always a negative from our standpoint.""

CO2 Pipelines

HF 639, a bill that places more requirements on carbon dioxide pipeline projects, was passed by the state legislature. On Thursday, ethanol industry members and a number of farmers held a press call asking the governor to veto the legislation.

It makes changes to common carrier classification, requires non-renewable CO2 project permits and additional industry input for the pipelines.

Mike Jerke is the CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, an ethanol plant in southwest Iowa. He says all the landowners involved with their CO2 project have agreed voluntarily. He said the permit limit is a deal-breaker.

""The existing language in statute said the maximum was 25 years, but then the death blow is you cannot renew a permit if you're transporting liquefied carbon dioxide. You cannot renew it,"" Jerke said.

Der Industriekonzern treibt gezielte Portfolioanpassungen voran – mit einem klaren Fokus auf nachhaltige Technologien und profitables Wachstum. Doch was steckt hinter den jüngsten Transaktionen, und wie positioniert sich das Unternehmen für die Zukunft?

Ausstieg aus dem Schutzausrüstungsgeschäft

In einem strategischen Schritt hat Honeywell sein Geschäft mit persönlicher Schutzausrüstung (PPE) für 1,325 Milliarden Dollar in bar an Protective Industrial Products verkauft. Diese Entscheidung markiert den vollständigen Rückzug aus dem PPE-Markt und soll das Portfolio des Unternehmens optimieren. Ziel ist es, sich stärker auf Kernbereiche mit höherem Wachstumspotenzial und besserer Cash-Generierung zu konzentrieren.

Milliarden-Deal für nachhaltige Technologien

Parallel zum Verkauf kündigte Honeywell die Übernahme des Katalysatortechnik-Geschäfts von Johnson Matthey für rund 2,42 Milliarden Dollar an. Diese Akquisition soll das Energiesparte des Konzerns entscheidend stärken, insbesondere die UOP-Sparte, die auf Katalysatoren und Prozesstechnologien spezialisiert ist.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Honeywell?

Die Integration des neuen Geschäftsbereichs wird Honeywells Präsenz in den Bereichen Raffinerie und Petrochemie deutlich ausbauen. Besonders im Fokus stehen dabei Technologien für:

Nachhaltige Kraftstoffe wie SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)

Blaue Wasserstoff- und Ammoniakproduktion

CO2-arme Methanolherstellung

Die Transaktion, die voraussichtlich bis zur ersten Hälfte 2026 abgeschlossen sein soll, wird bereits im ersten vollen Geschäftsjahr einen positiven Beitrag zum Ergebnis leisten.

Klare strategische Ausrichtung

Diese jüngsten Maßnahmen zeigen Honeywells Entschlossenheit, sein Portfolio aktiv an zukunftsträchtige Wachstumsfelder anzupassen.

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.
A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.
The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.
The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.","When Formula 1 cars nudge speeds of 330 kilometres per hour next year, hundreds of millions of people will witness existing engines and infrastructure working with a fuel once considered futuristic.

The fuel burning inside the turbocharged V6 engines won't be gutted from the Earth like traditional fossil fuels; instead, most will be chemically synthesised and involve the recycling of existing carbon dioxide — making it close to carbon neutral.

""It would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent,"" Liam Parker said, chief communications officer at Formula 1.

""The technical analysis shows zero drop in performance, so you're racing green, you're providing a solution for the automotive sector and the wider consumer, but you're also giving the public and the fans what they want.""

Five different companies — many of them sponsors — will be supplying the 100 per cent synthetic and biofuel to the 11 teams on the grid, once again positioning Formula 1 as the breeding ground of the kind of innovation that trickles to road cars and other vehicles.

Industry stakeholders believe these low-carbon liquid fuels provide a window of opportunity for Australia, claiming it can help connect the vehicles, ships and planes of today to a net-zero tomorrow, and create a multi-billion-dollar domestic manufacturing industry that would also bolster the nation's fuel security.

""We estimate the Australian low-carbon liquid fuel market could be in the order of $36 billion a year by 2050, and a feedstock market of about $15 billion,"" said Rupert Maloney, executive director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), a Commonwealth-funded investment firm backing green initiatives.

What makes synthetic and biofuel different?

There are two main types of low-carbon liquid fuels: synthetic and biofuel.

Both of them source carbon from the atmosphere when they're being developed, effectively recycling it once it is burned by an engine.

But whereas biofuel is processed from organic material such as sugarcane, used cooking oil and sawmill residue, the latest synthetic fuel doesn't affect food production.

It chemically synthesises the elements that make fuel: hydrogen and carbon.

The hydrogen is split from water in a process powered by renewable electricity, while the carbon is either captured from the air using emerging technology, extracted from algae, or gleaned from sustainable sources like waste.

The domestic biofuel industry is already growing as local feedstock is exported internationally, but industry stakeholders believe synthetic fuel has greater scale-up potential.

Global companies want to make synthetic fuel in Australia

At least two companies are looking at manufacturing synthetic fuel in Australia — HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) and Zero Petroleum — with each expected to start construction on plants in 2026.

HIF is aiming to produce 100 million litres of synthetic fuel a year once its manufacturing plant is up and running in 2030 — about 500 times more than its concept plant in Chile.

The company, which counts Porsche among its investors, claims it is spending about $2 billion constructing the plant in Tasmania.

""What we look for are locations where the feed stocks that we need to make this product are available and are also cost efficient,"" said Ignacio Hernandez, chief executive of HIF Asia Pacific.

""One of the main ingredients that we need is renewable energy, and Australia is well known globally for having a big renewable energy potential.""

Meanwhile, Zero Petroleum — founded by former F1 engineer Paddy Lowe and chemical engineer Nilay Shah — is examining the feasibility of building a plant in South Australia.

The facility would produce up to 10 million litres of synthetic aviation fuel, gasoline and diesel a year.

It works with our cars today, but will we use it?

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.

But there's disagreement on whether the fuel would be used in the nearly 16 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

How much it costs at the bowser will be a key determinant.

A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.

""The cost of the product will come down, and eventually you're able to transition to 100 per cent synthetic, without impacting materially the cost to the final consumer,"" Mr Hernandez said.

A key factor in the price coming down is the cost of renewable electricity, as wind and solar farms would power the manufacturing process to keep the carbon footprint as low as possible.

""We need very low renewable energy costs in order to get that hydrogen price down,"" Max Temminghoff said, Mineral Resources Lead at the CSIRO Futures.

""And then on the other flip side is the carbon dioxide. Pulling that out of the atmosphere currently is technologically not as mature and is a bit expensive, so that's what the CSIRO is working on.""

Betting on electric vehicles and new infrastructure

Instead, there is a concerted effort to transition cars and the infrastructure powering them to electric — but there's a long way to go to meet the CSIRO's target of 97 per cent by 2050.

The latest data from the federal government, dated January 2024, reveals there are 15.7 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

One per cent — or 159,460 — were electric.

Vehicles powered by petrol or diesel made up 95.5 per cent — or 14,958,462 vehicles.

""There will be an existing fleet of internal combustion engines, we think, still operating at that point [in 2050], and there needs to be a solution for those cars,"" HIF's Mr Hernandez said.

Sustainable fuel could be used in vehicles that are hard to electrify

The demand, policy and money opportunities suggest synthetic fuel will be used to power trucks driving interstate, ships travelling across oceans and planes flying internationally.

""By 2050, about 30 billion litres in Australia will likely be hard to electrify and will likely require low carbon liquid fuels or other decarbonisation technologies,"" the CEFC's Mr Maloney said.

The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.

Qantas imported 1.7 million litres of sustainable fuel in early May, hoping to blend it at a ratio of 18 per cent with traditional jet fuel.

The airline claims it could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland, reducing carbon emissions by 3,400 tonnes.

But it had to shop overseas, importing the biofuel from Malaysia.

""The creation of a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation,"" said Vanessa Hudson, the chief executive of Qantas Group.

Manufactures say updated policy will drive investment

The federal government is hoping to foster a low-carbon liquid fuel manufacturing industry in Australia, announcing $250 million in grants in March.

""Australia has the know-how and skills to meet the crucial task of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation, heavy transport and mining that rely on liquid fuels,"" Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

But the industry is asking for the kind of regulations popping up in other parts of the world, including mandates that would require select sectors to blend a percentage of synthetic fuel with their current fossil stock.

""Some of the mandates that are getting rolled out across Asia are in the order of 1 per cent blend, so it will not have a large impact on end use pricing,"" Mr Maloney said.

""It provides an investment signal back to the production side of the market to develop these facilities, and that brings down the cost.""

HIF's facility could produce enough synthetic fuel to meet a quarter of Tasmania's demand, Mr Hernandez said, but instead it'll likely export supply to other countries.

""There are other markets in the world that have more advanced regulation to support the uptake of these products,"" he said.

Australia relies on liquid fuels for more than half of its energy demand, according to federal government data, but the number of local refineries has dwindled from seven to two.

The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.

""Currently we import about 80 per cent of our refined fuels and we get those fuels through pretty extensive supply chains that are exposed to a range of geopolitical risks,"" the CSIRO's Mr Temminghoff said.

""Being able to produce our fuels locally means that we have more control over the variables that go into the price.

""We really see this opportunity as fleeting.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0bf9183b303ef09f6430416b77d65dfe?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1863&cropW=3312&xPos=4&yPos=92&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-05-25 15:56:07.373927

China’s Excellent Green Hydrogen Adventure

Three weeks ago, S&P Global took note of a new hydrogen report posted by China’s National Energy Administration. Although China continues to produce a prodigious amount of hydrogen from from fossil resources, the nation’s green hydrogen footprint is growing into a market force to be reckoned with.

“China now accounts for 50% of global green hydrogen production capacity,” S&P summarized. The strong showing suggests that competition from Chinese producers is one reason why diversified energy stakeholders in the US and elsewhere have rolled back their plans for renewable H2, to concentrate on their traditional business.

Further wracking nerves among green H2 producers in other regions is China’s pursuit of patents. Earlier this month the Asia-Pacific news organization Recessary was among those taking note of an analysis by the Japanese firm Astamuse, indicating that China has been scrambling to file renewable hydrogen patents at a furious pace since 2020, when the nation announced its carbon targets.

“The large number of patents has driven down the cost of hydrogen production equipment in China to just a quarter of that in Europe,” Recessary noted, referring to electrolyzer systems powered by renewable energy, which deploy electricity and a catalyst to push hydrogen gas from water (see more green H2 background here).

Scaling Up Green Hydrogen For Green Ammonia

Rounding out the news from China, last week the firm Envision Energy announced that the global testing and inspection firm Bureau Veritas has certified its forthcoming 500-megawatt Chifeng facility in Inner Mongolai for industrial-scale renewable ammonia, to be produced with green hydrogen. The facility began limited production last year and is on track to reach full volume this September.

Although much attention has been paid to the role of green hydrogen as a fuel for fuel cell vehicles of various sorts, hydrogen is also an industrial input with a firm grip on the ammonia fertilizer field, and that is where another opportunity lies. Last week Envision reached an agreement with the leading Japanese infrastructure and commodities trading firm Marubeni, indicating that the demand for green ammonia can support industrial scale electrolyzer systems.

“The project uses Envision’s advanced electrolyzer technology, powered by wind and solar, to produce 300,000 tons of green ammonia annually, making it one of the world’s first and largest commercial projects of its kind,” Envision explained.

“It is a testament to how innovation and sustainability can go hand-in-hand – from our advanced electrolyzer technology to the use of 100% renewable power, we’re redefining what’s possible in green hydrogen and ammonia production,” emphasized Envision VP Frank Yu in a press statement.

Meanwhile, Over Here In The USA …

The US is one of those other regions where green hydrogen producers are getting a case of the yips, though not particularly on account of forthcoming competition from China. Instead, the call is coming from inside the house.

Just a few years ago, hydrogen stakeholders were anticipating a bonanza of federal and investor support through the new $7 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. Launched during the Biden administration, the initiative was supposed to stimulate and diversify hydrogen production across the US. The program included space for natural gas extraction as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but much of the emphasis was on renewable hydrogen, including biomass resources as well as water electrolysis.

Trump put the program on ice after taking office, except for the natural gas end of things. Shocker!

Still, outside of the program some green hydrogen projects have wriggled through. Earlier this year, for example, the startup TalusAg launched a green ammonia venture in Iowa, featuring a reproduceable business model aimed at producing ammonia fertilizer locally for rural markets.

The E-Fuels Solution: Follow The Money … To Texas

The emerging e-fuels (aka electrofuels) industry is another source of support for the global green hydrogen market. E-fuels stakeholders began drifting into Texas several years ago, lured by copious wind and solar resources along with access to seaports and inland energy infrastructure.

The e-fuels industry leverages green hydrogen and captured carbon to produce synthetic, drop-in replacements for liquid fuels, with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) being a priority target.

The California startup Infinium was among the first to foray into Texas. The company’s Project Pathfinder e-fuels operation is already up and running in Corpus Christie, and neither competition from China nor the frowning face of the Trump administration has stopped it from moving forward with plans for a second facility.

On May 19 the company dropped word that construction has begun on Project Roadrunner in Texas, near the city of Pecos. The venture was publicized after Infinium closed on financing from A-listers Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products,” Infinium enthused.

Infinium already has offtake relationships with American Airlines here in the US, and with the UK firm IAG, which owns British Airways, Aer Lingus. IAG has already agreed to import its eSAF to the UK.

“Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market,” Infinium emphasized.

If all goes according to plan, production will begin in 2027, with power supplied from a nearby wind farm under the umbrella of NextEra Energy Resources. Infinium also anticipates that the system will overproduce hydrogen, enabling it to pursue additional offtake agreements for green hydrogen as well complete e-fuels.

Green Hydrogen: The Electrolyzer Factor

Infinium has tapped the Massachusetts firm Electric Hydrogen to supply its turnkey “HYPRPlant” electrolyzer system to produce the green hydrogen for Project Roadrunner. According to Electric Hydrogen, the pre-assembled solution can cut the installed cost of green hydrogen by up to 60%, compared to conventional electrolyzers systems. Electric Hydrogen also pre-tests the system before shipping it out, relieving producers from on-site troubleshooting.

In March, Electric Hydrogen announced that its electrolyzer system will be manufactured by the Texas firm Titan Production Equipment. Regardless of global trends, the firm is confident that opportunities persist here on its home turf and in Europe as well.

“The partnership with Titan illustrates how growth in the hydrogen industry creates opportunities for expansion of energy businesses and jobs in Texas,” Electric Hydrogen noted in a press statement.

Perhaps they are on to something. Despite President Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” energy policy, longtime oil and gas stakeholders have been casting around for new business in the clean energy field, and Titan is a good example. The company traces its roots as a manufacturer of oil and gas process equipment back to the 1920’s, and now it is applying that know-how to electrolysis systems.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/green-hydrogen-china-envision-us-infinium.png,N,,2025-05-25 14:56:48.594981

The division boasts strong expertise in catalyst systems that cut emissions, reduce industrial waste, and improve efficiency across chemical manufacturing, refining, and renewable energy.

This move positions Honeywell as a leader in producing blue hydrogen, blue ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel, directly addressing increasing global regulations for cleaner fuels.

Johnson Matthey is using most sale proceeds to reward shareholders and refocus its business strategy, following a streak of divestitures for a leaner operation.

The deal marks a pivotal shift toward large-scale decarbonization and strengthens both companies’ roles in shaping the future of sustainable industrial technology.

A sleek, steel future glimmers on the horizon as Honeywell International positions itself at the heart of the global push for cleaner energy. The industrial titan—long known for shaping industries from aerospace to advanced materials—has made a bold move, agreeing to purchase Johnson Matthey’s catalyst technologies division for £1.8 billion ($2.4 billion). This transaction, executed entirely in cash, signals not just a merger of assets but the convergence of ambition and expertise, shaking up the landscape of sustainable fuel solutions.

Inside the walls of Johnson Matthey’s London headquarters, teams of engineers and chemists have spent decades refining catalyst systems. These innovations don’t just boost profits—they slash waste, curtail emissions, and vastly improve efficiency in chemical manufacturing, refining, and renewable energy applications. With 1,900 employees spread from London to India and the U.S., the unit reported a robust £86 million operating profit last year, notching a nearly 23% increase over the previous period—a testament to the surging demand for cleaner industrial processes.

On the global stage, regulators are sharpening their focus on green mandates. Honeywell’s acquisition is a direct response to mounting pressure: both governments and consumers want cleaner fuels now. Honeywell’s CEO, Vimal Kapur, envisions an energy ecosystem where advanced catalysts play starring roles in producing blue hydrogen, blue ammonia, and renewable aviation fuel—each representing crucial steps in slashing global carbon footprints while fueling economies.

For Johnson Matthey, already a cornerstone of the UK’s FTSE 250, the sale marks an inflection point. By channeling £1.4 billion of the proceeds back to shareholders and retaining a fraction for leaner, more strategic operations, the company is carving out a sharper, more focused identity. This deal follows a decisive streak of divestitures, including a $700 million sale of its medical device components arm in early 2024.

Teams of elite advisers from Latham & Watkins and Slaughter and May are smoothing the legal terrain, while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup orchestrate the numbers behind the scenes. Yet above the legal fine print and boardroom negotiations, the key narrative takes shape: two industrial powerhouses aligning, pooling technology and talent, and accelerating the global race for scalable, commercial clean energy.

The key takeaway: This acquisition isn’t a mere reshuffling of corporate cards. It’s a calculated leap toward decarbonizing some of the world’s most energy-intensive sectors. As catalyst technology takes center stage, Honeywell deepens its commitment to tangible, sustainable innovation, potentially shaping how the world will fuel its future. In a marketplace chasing not just profit but purpose and progress, the stakes have never been higher—or the competitive landscape more exhilarating.

The Iowa Legislature approved House File 639 on May 12. The bill was presented by its proponents as a measure to protect Iowa landowners from the use of eminent domain. The rights of landowners are important, and the state Legislature was the appropriate forum to discuss this issue.

However, House File 639 does not address the matter effectively. Instead of focusing solely on the eminent domain concern, the enacted language will significantly affect — and potentially terminate — projects for reasons unrelated to eminent domain. These provisions will obstruct CO2 sequestration projects that are socially acceptable and beneficial to landowners, ethanol producers, farmers, and citizens.

Therefore, Gov. Kim Reynolds should veto the bill.

Here are some specific issues with House File 639:

Section 9. This provision would alter Iowa Code Section 476.33 to permit intervention in any Iowa Utilities Commission proceeding by state lawmakers, other elected officials, or residents with a ""minimally plausible interest."" There is no definition provided for “minimally plausible interest,” and no geographic restrictions, allowing for potential delays from unrelated entities opposed to agricultural production or proposed projects.

Section 11. This adds insurance requirements for a permittee, in Code Section 479B.13A : “The surety or insurance policy must fully cover … any loss from negligent or intentional discharge from the pipeline.” Insurance coverage for an intentional violation of a permit is not available for purchase, as such a product does not exist.

Section 15. Section 479B.14, subsection 2, would be amended to limit the permit duration to 25 years. It states, ""The commission shall not renew a permit granted to a pipeline that transports liquefied carbon dioxide."" This amendment would eliminate access to markets such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel after the 25-year period.

Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, which we oversee, has been part of the ethanol success story in Iowa since 2009. The company has a significant economic impact on southwest Iowa. The organization employs about 70 people, annually purchases more than 40 million bushels of corn from local farmers, engages with various trades and support entities, and distributes dividends to its 814 shareholders. Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy employees, directors, and shareholders are deeply concerned that the passage of House 639 will have significant adverse effects on our Carbon Capture and Sequestration project currently in progress and will severely restrict the company’s future market opportunities.

Following a comprehensive assessment of sequestration pipeline alternatives, the Board of Directors finalized an agreement with Tallgrass, a leading infrastructure company managing over 10,000 miles of pipelines nationwide. Tallgrass has repurposed an existing pipeline for CO2 transportation that traverses across Nebraska to sequestration sites in Wyoming. Due to Southwest Iowa’s strategic location in Council Bluffs, the company can join ethanol plants in Nebraska to utilize this pipeline.

Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy has already received 100% of the easements from landowners along the pipeline for right-of-way that will allow the pipeline construction. All the easements were voluntary. SIRE and Tallgrass have followed the Iowa Utilities Commission requirements for pipelines that are less than 5 miles long and filed our permit application on Feb. 18, 2025. SIRE has entered into a contract to build the CO2 capture and compression equipment on site at an expected cost of about $45 million. And the company has acquired the necessary equipment and intends to commence construction in the fall of 2025.

The Tallgrass pipeline project, which includes Southwest Iowa, will compensate landowners with an initial payment, and annual royalties based on the volume of CO2 transported through the pipeline. Local communities and fire departments will benefit from Tallgrass’ “community benefits agreement,” which includes $600,000 for training and equipping first responders on the Trailblazer pipeline route and a donation of $500,000 to nonprofits in the counties on the route. The Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy ethanol plant will be able to access low-carbon markets such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel, and farmers will have an improved market for the corn they grow.

House File 639 poses a threat to these developments.

In conclusion, we acknowledge that the Legislature is the appropriate forum for addressing matters such as landowner rights. However, House File 639 fails to consider projects like ours, where all easements are entirely voluntary. The adverse economic impacts to Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy are significant and cannot be overlooked.

It is imperative that Reynolds veto House File 639.

Il Brasile è il settimo produttore mondiale di petrolio ma è anche un Paese capace di estrarre dal cilindro sorprendenti risorse per generare energia pulita. Vale la pena citare il bacino amazzonico, che è la più grande riserva di acqua dolce del pianeta, e l’infinita varietà di piante tropicali messa a disposizione da un territorio immenso e ricco di biodiversità. L’ultima trovata suggerisce un binomio fantascientifico: usare una pianta parente dei friarielli per far volare gli aerei. Spieghiamoci meglio: il cavolo d'Abissinia, detto anche senape abissina (nome scientifico “Brassica carinata”), è della stessa famiglia della colza, dei cavolfiori e dei broccoli, e si può coltivare come sovescio invernale, cioè tra una coltura e l’altra, tanto che in Sudamerica è chiamato «la soia d’inverno» per le sue proprietà oleaginose da sfruttare negli intervalli del raccolto della materia prima più conosciuta, di cui il Brasile è peraltro primo produttore mondiale.

Ora il Paese sudamericano si candida a diventare anche il primo produttore mondiale di “carinata”: secondo Nuseed, l’azienda statunitense che ne detiene la maggiore quantità di germoplasma, la produzione brasiliana esploderà del 900% quest’anno, passando da 10mila a 100mila tonnellate. Da questa pianta praticamente sconosciuta si può estrarre biocombustibile per soddisfare la crescente domanda di Saf - Sustainable Aviation Fuel – e raggiungere l’ambiziosissimo traguardo che il settore aereo mondiale si è posto, cioè di diventare al 100% carbon free entro il 2050. Insomma, una pianta utilizzata per la rotazione colturale può rivoluzionare il trasporto aereo, ad oggi responsabile di circa il 3% delle emissioni globali di CO2 prodotta dall'attività umana. Un dato che può sembrare piccolo ma che in termini assoluti è significativo, considerando che l'aviazione ha raddoppiato le sue emissioni di anidride carbonica dal 1990 al 2019.

Quando la “carinata” è matura, è in grado di assorbire carbonio e restituire nutrienti al terreno, riducendo le emissioni ad effetto climalterante. In 3 tonnellate/ettaro di granella raccolta vi è circa un 36,8% di olio: si tratta di un rendimento inferiore a quello della colza e del lino, però con maggiori concentrazioni di acido erucico, il che rende l'olio non commestibile ma appunto molto adatto ad usi industriali oltre che come fertilizzante naturale dei terreni, facilitando l’attività agricola. La “carinata” infatti è particolarmente resiliente e si adatta a condizioni climatiche estreme, come quelle del Brasile che è uno dei Paesi più esposti agli effetti del riscaldamento globale, registrando continuamente ondate di calore, siccità, inondazioni. La sua capacità di migliorare la salute del terreno è inoltre un grande alleato contro l’uso di fertilizzanti chimici e il Brasile ha bisogno pure di questo, dato che è il primo esportatore mondiale di ben 10 commodities agricole (caffè, carne bovina, zucchero, etc) ma che nel 2024 ha registrato il record di pesticidi: il governo ne ha autorizzati 663, nel 2000 erano solo 82.",https://www.avvenire.it/c/2025/PublishingImages/3d77e0dea76a4704a89a9579350a71e3/cari.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 07:56:13.477122

We guarantee to feed the purchased SAF into flight operations within six months after the respective flight and thus reduce the CO2 emissions of future flights by the corresponding amount.

SAF purchased by you as a customer is purchased in addition to regulatory obligations of Lufthansa Group and therefore does not serve to fulfil legal quotas.",https://www.swiss.com/etc/designs/dcep/logo-lx-og.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 07:56:19.318098
