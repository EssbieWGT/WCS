Consequently, they observed 20 times higher methane emissions in shipping lanes compared to nearby areas that were undisturbed by traffic.

Despite methane being a greenhouse gas 27 times more potent than carbon dioxide, these emissions are often overlooked due to today’s measurement methods.

“Our measurements show that ship passages trigger clear pulses of high methane fluxes from the water to the atmosphere,” explained Amanda Nylund, researcher at Chalmers University of Technology and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, SMHI.

“Pressure changes and mixing of the water mass cause this. Even if the pulses are short, the total amount during a day is significant.”

Shipping emissions caused by fuel choices and high activity

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and concerns about methane emissions from the few ships that run on liquefied natural gas (LNG) are a very hot topic.

The study found that methane emissions in shipping are largely decoupled from the ships’ choice of fuel. This means that all ships can emit greenhouse gases, and shipping’s contribution to these emissions has previously been underestimated.

The researchers note that although methane is naturally present in the sediments, the activity of the ships leads to an extensive release into the atmosphere.

The study focuses on shallow marine areas where the sediments are oxygen-free and rich in organic matter. In such environments, methane is formed, and at high production levels, the gas can leak or bubble up into the water above.

When a ship passes, the pressure at the seafloor changes and methane bubbles make their way out of the sediments more easily.

In combination with the mixing that takes place in the wake of ships, the methane can quickly rise to the surface and escape into the atmosphere.

Impact of ships crucial for improving global methane estimates

The phenomenon of extensive methane emissions in shallow waters was first discovered by chance, in connection with other measurements in Neva Bay, part of the Baltic Sea.

“The discovery of the hitherto unknown impact of ships is important for improving global estimates of methane emissions, not least considering that nine of the world’s ten largest ports are located in waters with similar conditions as Neva Bay,” said Johan Mellqvist, Professor of Optical Remote Sensing, Chalmers, whose group made the unexpected discovery that forms the basis for the new results.

Two of the largest ship types, cruise and container ships, triggered the most frequent and largest measured methane releases; however, slightly smaller ropax vessels (which combine freight and passenger ferries) also account for significant methane releases.

The larger (compared to ropax and container) vessel type, bulk carriers, accounted for lower emissions. This means that it is more complicated than the size of the vessels controlling methane emissions in shipping.

“A possible explanation for the high emissions of ropax vessels is that they have double propellers,” commented Rickard Bensow, Professor of Hydrodynamics, Chalmers, and responsible for the study’s modelling of ship traffic.

Rethinking where methane measurements are carried out

The authors of the current study now emphasise the need to rethink how and where methane measurements are carried out, especially in coastal waters where natural and human factors interact. They place particular focus on further investigating large ports in river deltas.

Ida-Maja Hassellöv, Professor of Maritime Environmental Science, Chalmers, who will lead the follow-up project, concluded: “The next step is to estimate how large these effects can be globally. Major ports in China, Singapore, and South Korea, as well as European ports such as Rotterdam and Antwerp, and river systems in Germany, have similar conditions to those of the Neva Bay.

Developing a better understanding

The CRYSTAL initiative is one that reflects a growing recognition concerning non-CO₂ impacts—including water vapor, aerosols and contrails—which may contribute significantly to aviation’s climate footprint. Yet, unlike carbon dioxide, these emissions are not currently regulated or fully understood. However, by producing high-resolution, real-world emissions data, CRYSTAL has the potential to refine climate models and inform future fuel specifications, engine designs and flight operations. In fact, it’s an undertaking that Catherine Guillemart, Head of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Canada, Airbus, suggests is critical to the future of aerospace innovation.

The Navy Hangar was originally part of a larger proposal to develop 46 acres of land along Hartwell Road into nearly 500,000 square feet of aircraft storage and maintenance space intended for private and corporate leasing.

While the project team has been working on a required supplement to their larger project Draft Environmental Impact Report to satisfy a Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Office (MEPA) certificate issued a year ago, opportunities have evolved for the existing Navy Hangar space.

A Notice of Project Change (NPC) was filed with MEPA on June 2. Wednesday’s information session was one part of the proponent’s outreach on the project. A recording of the session is expected on the project website.

The information session included a presentation of the project by Rick Muse, North Airfield Ventures director of operations, and an overview of the contents and technical studies in the NPC by Lauren DeVoe, environmental review consultant with VHB.

The project plan is to renovate the Navy Hangar, empty for the past 20 years, consistent with Historic Preservation regulations. The hanger would be updated to be used for research and development, medical service, and specialty pharmaceutical delivery service.

A key interest in the project plans is Merlin Labs, an autonomous flight technology company, which plans to lease 70 to 80 percent of the Navy Hangar for their research and development headquarters. Merlin Labs plans to run one to two short duration experimental test flights per day with at least one human operator on board, according to the presentation.

Mark Ward, vice president of test flight operations at Merlin Labs, and one of Merlin’s pilots, said that test flights are planned to move “up and away” from heavily populated areas, as well as the Boston area congested air space. Ward stated that “flights can get to the New Hampshire shore in a dozen minutes or less.”

Most of the project area is already developed, according to DeVoe. The renovation and proposed use of the Navy Hangar space does not trigger a MEPA review, however a Phase One waiver is required to begin construction while the larger development project remains under review.

With Merlin Labs eager to begin in Bedford, plans, contractors, and funding sources are already in the works and awaiting approval expected at the end of August. The approval process will require a few more steps, including an additional public comment period, DeVoe explained. Muse estimates construction would take 10 to 12 months once started.

According to DeVoe’s presentation, an access way from Hartwell Road to a 140-space parking lot with 35 EV charging stations will be created, the current access ramp to an existing Hanscom Field runway will be reconfigured and updated, a small amount of wooded area will be cleared, and 1.35 acres of existing pavement will be replaced with a pervious surface.

The consultants anticipate “negligible” traffic impact to Hartwell Road, use of existing stormwater management, no significant noise impacts, “minimal” greenhouse gas emissions (772 short tons per year of CO2), and the use of sustainable design elements, including installing heat pumps and looking into rooftop solar installation. The team is also taking into consideration the proximity to the Superfund cleanup sites in the plans.

A handful of people commented and asked questions during the Q&A portion of the information session, with a few raising concerns over adding any amount of greenhouse gasses as the state, Bedford, and other neighboring towns work towards Net Zero. The team said that plans for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hanscom Field is in the near future (including in the larger project plan), and the use of clean or electric aircraft is not out of the question, but availability of that technology is not here yet.

Molly Haskell, a representative from the Bedford Arbor Resources Committee made a plea for “finessing” tree removal to safeguard any existing trees.

Russ Arena, executive director for Massachusetts Business Aviation Association (MBAA), commented that MBAA is very excited about the project. Arena was a chief pilot for Raytheon, one of the original tenants of the Navy Hangar, and is excited about the return of research and development and the renovation of the building. “I know there is negativity,” Arena said, but he called the project a “wonderful thing for the state, for the town, and for employment.”",https://cdn.thebedfordcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NavyHangar-Proposed-NPC.png,N,,2025-07-03 05:01:44.721144

BIO-BASED SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) MARKET OVERVIEW

The global Bio-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market was valued at USD 1.59 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to USD 1.99 billion in 2025, reaching USD 27.49 billion by 2033, with a projected CAGR of about 25.7% during the forecast period 2025-2033.

Emerging importantly as the global game changers of aviation industry strategy for environmental footprint mitigation in global aviation, the market for bio based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is produced from renewable, biological sustainable sources including used cooking oil, Agri-wastes, MSW and non-food crops such as algae. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel, subject to the feedstock and production method [1]. Aviation is responsible for about 2–3% globally of the total CO₂ emissions, it is of course going to have to clean up its acts more urgently than ever. SAF through mandates, tax credits and emission trading schemes have been supported by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other bodies of regulation. The policy frameworks combined with consumer and environmental groups mounting pressure are already moving the needle for SAF technologies to be adopted and commercialized.

With the market maturing, there are various technological pathways, such as Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) being scaled to widen the feed-stock conversion of aviation fuel pathways into closely-forced standards for jet fuel. The major fuel producers and also the major airlines are investing into purpose-built biorefineries plus long-term offtake contracts to secure more stable supply. The SAF market though has pile of challenges on its head. As production remains considerably expensive, unable to cross-the-horizon globally thus infrastructure limitations hampering large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, airline profitability, corporate sustainability targets and improved feedstock pathways & conversion efficiencies are predicted to support the growth of market over forecast period. Today, North America and Europe are the front-runners of the SAF development with their heavily industrialised areas and supportive regulatory set-ups, while Asia-Pacific is becoming more active driven by national governments and global alliances aiming at establishing regional supply chains. We have entered a new era of air travel, the bio-based SAF market is moving from niche to mainstream, serving as one of key in re-inventing sustainable flight.

COVID-19 IMPACT

Bio-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Industry Had a Negative Effect Due to Disrupted Air Travel and Delayed Investments during COVID-19 Pandemic

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with the market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden market growth reflected by the rise in CAGR is attributable to the market’s growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.

COVID-19 has affected the bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market with two-sided impacts. Lockdowns, travel restrictions and generally weak consumer demand severely affected short-run global commercial aviation in an unprecedented fashion. The significant decrease in air travel activity led to a contemporaneous decline in jet fuel demand of which SAF was included causing bottlenecks for SAF procurement contracts, project investments and infrastructure expansion plans. Many biofuel producers went off-road to automotive markets or halted production entirely because of financing challenges and ambiguous demand forecasts. Cash flow drag for airlines also constrained their ability and willingness to lock in more expensive sustainable fuels. However, in the longer run, the pandemic was a wake-up call for the aviation industry to speed up decarbonization and work on increased resilience. During the recovery packages and green transition incentives, SAF was rediscovered as a key lever for sustainable recovery. Airlines also announced new sustainability targets and net-zero emission time-frames with considerable attention being paid to their road maps and SAF. This reshaped the market dynamics by turning upside down priority for environmental responsibility and painted a collaborative picture of both fuel producers, as well as airlines & governments in achieving SAF production scaling up in post-COVID recovery era.

LATEST TRENDS

Airline-Producer Partnerships to Accelerate SAF Commercialization to Drive Market Growth

One of the major trends fuelling the bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market going forward is the increasing strategic partnerships among airlines and fuel producers to commercialize SAF as soon as possible. Regulatory bodies and global alliances moving regulatory decarbonization milestones fast, creating long-term offtake agreements with SAF producers so airlines have stable feedstock for low-emission fuels. Those partnerships are aimed at solving one of the biggest problems in industry capacity constraints by offering some level financial certainty and an incentive to build new biorefineries, and also bring innovation infeed stock. Also, such initiatives allow airlines in near term emissions reduction whilst future roadmap for their compliance with the enabling regulations mandating the proportion of SAF blending. These partnerships are also creating federations of research and development, where stakeholders investigate into the use of raw materials like algae and agricultural waste, municipal solid with an aim to decouple from current sources (used cooking oil) in part of the feedstock. In addition, fuel providers are collaborating closely with aviation suppliers to validate new production pathways and support the operational readiness of SAF in current aircraft and their infrastructure. That burgeoning ecosystem of cooperation not only speeds technology uptake, but says loud and clear to the aviation industry that its long-term commitment in sustainable fuel solutions is firmly anchored. This developing trend, as it progresses will undoubtedly drive increased market scalability by driving supply and cost reductions of SAF to create a secure, and sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

BIO-BASED SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) MARKET SEGMENTATION

BY TYPE

Based on type, the global market can be categorized into HEFA, G+FT, AtJ and other

HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids): HEFA is the most mainstream production pathway for SAF, it converts fats oils and grease to fossil-based jet fuel all renewable. With a high degree of compatibility with current aircraft engines and infrastructure, it has massive market growth.

G+FT (Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch): The gasification of biomass and waste feedstock followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthetic gas/pathway to produce so called bio-hydrocarbon. It allows a wide choice of feedstocks but needs more capital expenditure.

AtJ (Alcohol-to-Jet): AtJ technology is capable of turning alcohols e. g. ethanol or butanol into jet fuel. Because it is attracting more attention for processing agricultural residues and cellulosic biomass, with efforts scale-up intend to provide cost advantages.

Other: This includes still-developing routes such as pyrolysis and power-to-liquid processes, both in the embryonic stage but prospective diversification sources of SAF production in future.

BY APPLICATION

Based on application, the global market can be categorized into commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other

Commercial Aircraft: Largest application segments being powered by airlines commitment to reduce carbon emissions. Commercial aviation is increasingly blending SAF in-flight through blend standards and voluntary sustainability programs.

MARKET DYNAMICS

Market dynamics include driving and restraining factors, opportunities and challenges stating the market conditions.

DRIVING FACTORS

Increasing Regulatory Support and Environmental Mandates to Boost the Market

The most important driver for the rising bio-based sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market growth is the huge regulatory backing and global environmental standards. A number of policies at the initiative of governments, aviation regulatory bodies and international organizations to hasten decarbonization to clean jet fuels from fossil-based origins. These involve blending mandates that compel airlines to use a certain volume of SAF in their fuel mix, carbon pricing mechanisms and producer/consumer financial burden reducing tax relief for sustainable fuels. Moreover, emission trading schemes and carbon offset programs create the economic imperative for airlines to seek cleaner fuels as they begin to monetize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In aggregate, this regulatory landscape creates the critical mass of investment in SAF production infrastructure and drives innovation in feedstock diversification and conversion technologies. While North America, and Europe are front-runners by most ergo have seen one of the biggest increases in bio-based SAF market share in these regions as a result of stringent policies to enable SAF commercialisation. This regulatory landscape not only drives market growth, but also reinforces global sustainability yields by setting aviation sector goals in line with broader climate targets and increases stakeholder certainty enabling widespread adoption of SAF.

Rising Airline Commitments to Carbon Neutrality to Expand the Market

The bio-based sustainable aviation fuels market is expected to gain power since the number of airline commitments focus on carbon-neutral growth and net-zero emissions often sounds louder. Given the central role they play in global emissions, many of today leading airlines have set very far-reaching environmental targets to at least halve their carbon emissions by 2030, 2040 or until mid-century at the latest. Such commitments typically require SAF to be incorporated into an integrated strategy that overtakes or substitutes conventional jet fuel because of its substantial carbon saving capacity. Long-term offtake agreements among airlines and fuel producers offer financial certainty as well as incentives to build new biorefineries, lead additional work on scaling existing facilities to secure a long-term supply of SAF. In addition to buying agreements, airlines are cooperating with fuel developers on joint R&D projects to optimize feedstock utilization as well as drive down production costs. Increasing consumer, investor and regulatory pressure on the industry only adds to sense of urgency that airlines are under in order to put sustainable fuel solutions into practice. This increases market for SAF, with the growing demand coupled by this holistic focus on SAF are spurring technological advancements and market expansion as well as increasing OEM acceptance in the aviation industry as ending pathway for bio-based SAF integral part of future sustainable air travel.

RESTRAINING FACTOR

High Production Costs and Feedstock Limitations to Potentially Impede Market Growth

One major inventory constraint on the expansion of bio-based sustainable aviation fuel market is high production costs of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel. Constraining factors, i.e., complex conversion processes and costly feedstocks along inelastic supply chains keep prices disproportionately high for SAF to be competitive without subsidies or regulatory support. Another difficulty in the way is feedstock availability and sustainability. For many bio-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, among others volumes are largely restricted by competition from other industries and must be priced to offset the higher cost. Additionally, land use change, land competition for food and environmental impacts of some biomass sources limit large-scale feedstock expansion. Each of these contributes to the added complexity of production and further complicates the ability for producers to scale up their operations effectively. This creates further impediments on market penetration through, significant capital investment required for new biorefineries and infrastructure and supply chain uncertainties. As long as production costs are high and there is none-to-generally accepted diversity of feedstock types the bio-based sustainable aviation fuel market will face hurdles to reach large scale commercialization cost competitiveness vis-a-vis fossil-based jet fuels.

Congress has a unique opportunity to step in and bolster American manufacturing and energy security – but it can and must act today.","While our international competitors race ahead in biomanufacturing, America’s $210 billion bioeconomy remains at risk. The U.S. has the tools to outcompete China, unleash a manufacturing boom, and achieve energy security—all within its reach today.

But regulatory delays and uncertain tax policy at the federal level are thwarting the ability of innovators to scale these critical American-made industries. In the case of sustainable aviation fuel, these failures are particularly magnified given the ongoing unpredictability surrounding a federal tax credit called Section 45Z.

Bioindustrials represent a revolution in American manufacturing, including fuel production. Unlike traditional manufacturing, bioindustrials leverage microorganisms, like yeast, to harness the power of domestic feedstocks, like corn and soy. These inputs undergo precision fermentation in state-of-the-art bioreactors before being transformed into a range of high-end products, including biofuels that can power our homes, cars, and even U.S. Air Force jets.

For American farmers and ranchers, these biobased markets offer a critical lifeline at a time when they face an unprecedented number of challenges. Agricultural feedstocks not only unlock additional revenue streams for growers but also provide an energy source that’s uniquely rooted in U.S. agriculture. This could mean American energy dominance achieved through a robust biobased economy right here at home.

To put that in perspective, the U.S. stands to unlock $400 billion in the next five years through food, agriculture, and manufacturing biotechnologies alone. Unfortunately, much of the progress achieved thus far and the future ahead are at serious risk today—unless Congress takes action to help build the infrastructure needed to deploy these technologies at scale.

As it stands, American biomanufacturing capacity is falling behind our competitors. One challenge facing pioneers at home is the cost and time it takes to scale current technologies. Commercial-scale facilities can take two to five years to build and cost up to $2 billion. For many early-stage companies, this represents a significant barrier on top of the costs needed to navigate a complicated and frequently duplicative oversight system and lengthy and costly review processes.

Overcoming these challenges is possible—especially with targeted tax incentives that can help ramp up production capacity. One such incentive is the 45Z tax credit, designed to spur the ramp up of American-made clean transportation fuel production. Unfortunately, the incentive is stuck in limbo as part of Congress’s larger tax policy overhaul.

While there is bicameral support for 45Z’s extension until 2031, several limitations remain in current budget reconciliation proposals. Many of these restrictions, such as capping the dollar value of some fuels or phasing out the transferability of the credit early, will do more harm than good.

In fact, adding burden in a sector where cost barriers to scale are already high would likely drive smaller companies and startups out of business. That would mean the death of the very engine of American innovation and bioindustrial growth, and with it, the nation’s global leadership in this growing sector.

The best way forward is the one that keeps America leading on bioindustrials both today and in the future. Before the bill is finalized, Congress must ensure that the 45Z tax credit is not only maintained for its full tax rate in the long term but also that it remains accessible and usable to a wide array of feedstocks. This would guarantee that the tax credit delivers clear, direct benefits to U.S. farmers and rural economies while providing the bioindustrial sector with the necessary certainty to ensure its future is proudly made in America.

Congress has a unique opportunity to step in and bolster American manufacturing and energy security – but it can and must act today.

On July 1, the Senate approved its version of the multi-trillion dollar reconciliation bill (“Senate bill”) known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). OBBBA is a reconciliation bill that includes budgetary provisions relating to the border, defense, energy policy, spending cuts, the debt ceiling, and taxes that were approved. The Senate bill passed by a vote of 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie. The bill will now be reconsidered by the House before final passage. It extends or makes permanent many of the provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), meets many of the tax campaign promises made by President Trump, and adds additional tax provisions, which are summarized more fully below. The bill passed using the current policy as a baseline, which means it will cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years.

Provisions Affecting Businesses

Research and Experimentation (R&E) Deductions: The TCJA required taxpayers to capitalize and amortize domestic R&E over five years, using a midyear convention. Foreign R&E is required to be amortized over 15 years.

OBBBA permanently allows immediate deductibility of R&E expenses rather than five-year amortization for R&E beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. Businesses with annual gross receipts of $31 million or less are allowed to apply this change retroactively for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2021. This means businesses could amend returns and potentially get refunds. Taxpayers with domestic R&E expenses incurred after Dec. 31, 2021, and Jan. 21, 2025, can elect to accelerate the remaining deductions over a one- or two-year period. Foreign R&E remains subject to 15-year amortization.

The Senate bill creates new IRC Section 174A, which would permanently allow taxpayers to either deduct domestic research or experimental expenditures or elect to capitalize and recover domestic research or experimental expenditures ratably over at least 60 months, beginning with the month in which the taxpayer first realizes benefits from those expenditures.

Amounts incurred for the development of software are included in the definition of R&E expenses.

Taxpayers should review their specific tax situations to determine which option may produce the best result. For example, deducting the expenses in the year incurred may not generate the best tax result if it generates excess business losses under IRC section 461(l).

OBBBA also includes rules to coordinate the immediate deductibility of R&E with the research credit.

Bonus Depreciation: OBBBA makes the first-year bonus depreciation provisions of section 168(k) permanent. The allowance is increased to 100% for property acquired and placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. These provisions allow businesses a continued favorable expense deduction timing for property types that qualify under section 168. The Senate bill allows immediate deductions for domestic R&E expenses, maintains 15-year amortization of foreign expenses starting in 2025, and provides the possibility of amended returns to claim refunds for two prior years. Special transition rules for small business taxpayers (gross receipts $31 million or less) apply, including election to make or revoke the reduced Section 41 research credit under section 280C(c)(2) on an amended return.

Qualified Production Property: Manufacturers can claim 100% deduction for the cost of new “qualified production property,” including real property, defined as any property used in a “qualified production activity” (“the manufacturing, production, or refining of a qualified product” which “result[s] in a substantial transformation of the property comprising the product.”). A “qualified product” means any tangible personal property if such property is not a food or beverage prepared in the same building as a retail establishment in which such property is sold. It applies to non-residential real property other than “real property which is used for offices, administrative services, lodging, parking, sales activities, research activities, software development or engineering activities, or other functions unrelated to the manufacturing, production, or refining of tangible personal property.” The change applies to qualified property placed in service after the date of enactment and before Jan. 1, 2031.

Business Interest Limitation: OBBBA reinstates the section 163(j) interest deduction limitation using a calculation of income that excludes the deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. The provision is for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. The Senate bill permanently modifies the definition of “motor vehicle” for purposes of the floor plan financing interest and floor plan financing indebtedness definitions. The Senate bill contains a new ordering rule to calculate 163(j) limit prior to other interest capitalization. In addition, interest capitalized under sections 263(g) or 263A(f) is not deemed interest for the limitation. Subpart F, GILTI, and section 78 gross-ups are excluded from taxable income for purposes of the calculation.

Similar to bonus depreciation, there is bipartisan support for the extension of changes to the section 163(j) interest limitation, as it was previously included in the H.R. 7024 bipartisan legislation in 2024.

Excess Business Losses Limitation: The Excess Business Loss (EBL) rule applies to non-corporate taxpayers and is defined as the amount by which deductions (excluding net operating losses and IRC section 199A Qualified Business Income deductions) related to trades or businesses exceed income from such trade or business. Such net business losses are currently allowed only up to certain thresholds (which for 2025 are $626,000 for joint filers and $313,000 for other filers). Any business losses above these thresholds are EBLs. Any disallowed EBL is carried forward and is treated as a net operating loss in future years, subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation.

Under current law, the EBL rules are scheduled to expire after 2029. The OBBBA makes the EBL rule permanent for years after 2029.

Limit on Executive Compensation: OBBBA provides an aggregation rule to section 163(m) and provides a deduction limit of $1 million for total payments of a controlled group of corporations.

Employee Retention Tax Credit: OBBBA retroactively bars the IRS from issuing refunds for Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) claims for Q3 2021 (and in some instances Q4 2021 (collectively, “affected quarters”) filed after Jan. 31, 2024. The bill also would require ERTC promoters to comply with due diligence requirements with respect to a taxpayer’s eligibility and the amount of an ERTC for affected quarters. In addition, the bill provides a $1,000 penalty for each failure to comply, and it would also extend the penalty for excessive refund claims to employment tax refund claims.

Some commentators have raised doubts about whether such retroactive legislation satisfies constitutional standards. Meanwhile, employers with legitimate ERTC claims for any eligible quarter were already severely disadvantaged by the IRS processing moratorium simply because their claims were submitted on or after Jan. 31, 2024. These employers rightfully feel short-changed, as they submitted legitimate ERTC claims well within the statute of limitations for filing claims. Under current law, taxpayers had until April 15, 2025, to submit claims for 2021 ERTC refunds. Adding insult to injury, many employers have already paid additional income tax by amending their income tax returns, as required, to account for the effects of the ERTC claim while still waiting for their ERTC refunds.

Employers may wish to speak with their legal counsel to evaluate other options that could compel the U.S. government to finally process and pay their refund claim. In October 2024, the IRS extended the time to appeal denial letters beyond the typical 30-day period to the entire two years after the date of the denial letter. However, an appeal will not extend the time to file a refund suit, so taxpayers must be vigilant not to let that deadline pass. Employers may also want to consider filing “protective claims for refund” that would allow them to recoup the additional income tax they paid in anticipation of their ERTC refund in the event the IRS denies some part or all of the ERTC refund after the statute of limitations expires on claiming the associated income tax refund expires. OBBBA extends the amount of time that the IRS has to examine and deny or claw back erroneous or excessive ERTC claims for affected quarters from five years to six years. Also, for employers who claimed the ERTC in 2020 or 2021for affected quarters, but have not amended their tax returns for those years, the IRS will have six years to assess additional tax related to the wage deductions related to the ERTC claims.

Because the Senate bill only changes section 3134, which only applies to the affected quarters, taxpayers may still be able to claim refunds and assert statute of limitations defenses to ERTC claims filed for other quarters.

Payments from Partnerships to Partners: OBBBA makes section 707(a)(2), which addresses payments from partnerships to partners acting other than in the capacity of a partner with respect to services or contributions, self-enacting. Under current law, this type of transaction requires IRS regulations to implement its provisions. This provision is not retroactive, but it is not intended to change the substance of the current law.

Clean Energy: OBBBA makes significant changes that mostly eliminate clean energy credits, with modifications generally based on timing and reduced amounts.

The clean vehicle credit under section 30D is repealed for vehicles acquired more than 180 days after date of enactment. The credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles under section 45W is generally repealed for vehicles acquired more than 180 days after enactment, with vehicles under 14,000 pounds subject to critical mineral and battery component restrictions in section 30D after June 16, 2025. The alternative fuel refueling property credit in section 30C is repealed for property placed in service after date of enactment. The Senate bill also terminates section 179D deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings that begin construction more than 12 months after enactment date.

OBBBA repeals the special five-year cost recovery period in section 168(e)(3)(B) for energy property in sections 45Y(b)(1)(A), 48E(b)(2), and 48E(c)(2) that are placed in service after the enactment date. A last-minute amendment removed a new excise tax and eased some restrictions on the placed-in-service dates.

Under OBBBA, the credit for wind and solar facilities is reduced to 60% of the otherwise available credit for construction beginning in 2026, 20% for construction beginning in 2027, and 0% beginning for 2028. Eliminated the “later of” rule to start phase down and termination of the credit after 2032 and also denies credit for facilities that received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. The Senate bill also disallows credit for wind and solar leasing arrangements.

With respect to carbon sequestration under section 45Q the Senate bill prohibits certain foreign entities from claiming credit beginning the year of enactment. For facilities placed in service after 2022, it enacts a parity credit value of $17 regardless of end use and indexes for inflation. In addition, the Senate bill retains the $36 credit for direct air capture and retains transferability.

OBBBA denies credits for zero-emission nuclear power production under section 45U for taxpayers that are specified foreign entities beginning on the date of enactment. It also denies credit for foreign-influenced taxpayers two years after enactment. It further denies credit for facilities that use nuclear fuel provided by a covered nation or entity (after Jan. 31, 2027) unless a binding written contract was in effect before Jan. 1, 2023.

The section 45V credit for production of clean hydrogen is repealed for facilities that begin construction after Jan. 31, 2025.

The credit in section 45X for advanced manufacturing production adds a new phaseout for critical minerals at 75% for 2031, 50% in 2032, and 25% in 2033. No credit is allowed after 2033. Wind energy components produced and sold after Jan. 31, 2027, are denied. Foreign entity and material assistance restrictions also apply, and transferability is retained.

OBBBA extends the clean fuel production credit under section 45Z through 2031. However, it restricts the credit for certain foreign entities, precludes the credit for entities claiming the sustainable aviation fuel credit, and eliminates section 6426(k) credits after Sept. 30, 2025. Under the Senate bill, fuel producers can utilize feedstock produced anywhere, but the value of the 45Z credit is reduced by 20% for fuel produced from feedstocks produced or grown outside the U.S., effective Jan. 1, 2026. The Senate bill also eliminates the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change would essentially cap the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF. Currently, SAF is eligible for a credit of up to $1.75 per gallon.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (OZ): OBBBA includes a permanent rolling 10-year designation beginning Jan. 1, 2027, maintains the current OZ designation process, and provides strengthened eligibility requirements.

New Market Tax Credits: OBBBA makes these credits permanent.

Employer-provided Child Care: OBBBA permanently increases the credit to help all businesses cover more of the costs of providing child care or supporting employee access to child care services. Additionally, the bill creates a boost for small businesses specifically to help offset a greater portion of the cost. Businesses are provided an increased percentage of qualified expenses of 40%, with a $500,000 cap. Small businesses (gross receipts under $31 million) are given a 50% rate for qualifying expenses with $600,000 maximum credit.

Provisions Affecting Individuals

Tax Rates: OBBBA makes the regular income tax rate schedules under section 1 permanent for individuals as enacted by the TCJA, which generally modifies the indexing for inflation for bracket thresholds by providing one additional year of inflation in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The COLA for regular income tax brackets for 2026 is generally the percentage by which the chained CPI for 2025 exceeds the chained CPI for 2016. The result is that the bracket thresholds are larger than they would otherwise be without the additional year of inflation. These changes both cement current tax rate brackets and provide a more favorable COLA for future years. The Senate bill also provides inflation adjustments for the 10% and 12% brackets.

Standard Deduction: OBBBA makes the temporary increases to the standard deduction permanent as enacted under section 63 of the TCJA and modifies the inflation indexing of the standard deduction by adding one additional year of inflation in the COLA starting in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. OBBBA also increases the amount of the standard deduction in taxable years beginning after 2025. Starting in 2025, the standard deduction will increase to $15,750 for individual filers and $31,500 for joint filers, which are adjusted for inflation.

Personal Exemption: OBBBA makes permanent the personal exemption in section 151 that was temporarily reduced to zero under the TCJA.

SALT Cap: Under prior TCJA provisions, individuals who itemize deductions may only deduct up to $10,000 in state, local, and foreign income, property, or sales and use taxes (the SALT cap). In the past several years, most states with an individual income tax have enacted laws that allow owners of pass-through entities to legitimately work around this limit by imposing an entity-level tax on the business.

OBBBA increases the limit to $40,000 with phase outs beginning at $500,000 of income. The increase is only temporary for five years. In 2026, the thresholds would increase by 1% or to $40,400 for households with income under $505,000. The thresholds would continue to increase by 1% each year through 2029, after which the SALT limit would be permanently reduced to $10,000.

Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET) Deduction: Unlike the House-passed version of H.R. 1, the Senate bill essentially maintains the status quo with respect to PTET deductions. The House version repealed the PTET deduction for specified service trades or businesses and placed restrictions which could limit the deduction by one-half or even more in certain circumstances.

Section 1202 Small Business Stock: OBBBA provides tiered gain exclusion for qualified small business stock (QSBS) of 50% for QSBS held for at least three years, 75% for QSBS held for at least four years, and 100% for QSBS held for at least five years. The change only applies to stock originally issued after the date of enactment. The gain excluded under the three- and four-year rules would not be treated as a preference item for purposes of the AMT if the stock were to be acquired after Sept. 27, 2010.

The per-issuer cumulative exclusion limitation increases from $10 million to $15 million, with an annual inflation adjustment increase. Taxpayers that fully use the limitation as inflation adjusted in any tax year are not eligible for additional inflation adjustments. The conforming amendments ensure married filing separate taxpayers benefit from the adjusted inflation limitations on a per-issuer basis. In addition, OBBBA would increase the “aggregate gross asset” calculation under IRC Section 1202(d) to $75 million from $50 million, that is also subject to an annual inflation adjustment.

Sec 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction: OBBBA makes the QBI deduction, which was scheduled to expire after 2025, permanent. It also makes a number of other structural changes to the law for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. While the House version raised the deduction to 23%, the Senate version returns it to 20% while expanding the limit phase-in range.

Charitable Contributions: The Senate bill creates a permanent deduction for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, non-itemizing taxpayers can claim a deduction of up to $1,000 if a single filer ($2,000, married filing jointly) for certain charitable contributions.

For taxpayers who itemize their deductions, the Senate bill would limit otherwise allowable charitable contribution deductions to amounts in excess of a 0.5% floor over the contribution base (generally, adjusted gross income without regard to net operating losses) for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. New carryover rules apply to amounts not entitled to be deducted. The Senate Bill also permanently extends the increased 60% contribution limit for cash gifts to qualified charities.

Child Tax Credit: OBBBA increases and extends the child tax credit under section 24(h). A maximum child tax credit of $2,200 is allowed for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024.

AMT Exemption: The Senate Bill follows H.R. 1 with some language variations on the inflation adjustment. The sunsetting provisions of the individual AMT exemption amounts and phase-out thresholds under section 55A are repealed in the Senate bill, and the TCJA exemptions amounts are made permanent. This means that taxpayers who would have been subject to an increased additional alternative minimum tax will now continue to have the higher exemption levels previously provided by TCJA.

Limitation of Tax Benefit of Itemized Deductions: OBBBA permanently repeals the “Pease” limitation on itemized deductions and creates a new formula to apply to taxpayers only in the highest tax bracket, generally capping the benefit of otherwise allowable itemized deductions at 35%.

Repeal of Certain Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions: OBBBA permanently suspends certain miscellaneous itemized deductions that were scheduled to expire under TCJA. These include unreimbursed employee expenses, investment advisory fees, tax preparation fees, certain legal fees, hobby expenses, and safe deposit box rentals. However, OBBBA removes unreimbursed expenses for eligible educators from the list.

Loan Limit on Interest Deduction on Principal Residence: The Senate bill follows H.R. 1 but the $750,000 ($375,000 married individual filing separately) limit on principal residence acquisition indebtedness under section 163(h), scheduled to expire under TCJA, is made permanent, as is the exclusion of interest on home equity indebtedness from the definition of qualified residence interest. This provision may limit tax benefits for taxpayers facing rising housing prices and interest rates. OBBBA allows certain mortgage insurance premiums to qualify as deductible interest.

Personal Casualty Losses: The temporary limitation on personal casualty losses in section 165(h)(5) under TCJA is made permanent and includes state declared disasters. TCJA allowed an individual taxpayer to claim an itemized deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a declared federal disaster area. A loss is deductible only to the extent of the sum of the individual’s personal casualty gains plus the amount by which aggregate net disaster-related losses exceed 10% of the individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. For individual taxpayers, personal casualty losses are losses of property not connected with a trade or business, or a transaction entered into for profit, if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, other casualty, or theft. Personal casualty losses are deductible to the extent they exceed $100 per casualty.

Wagering Losses: OBBBA allows deductible expenses incurred in gambling activity beyond 2025 but limits the losses to 90% of the amount in excess of gains from the taxable year.

Moving Expenses: The Senate bill would permanently repeal the deduction for moving expenses under section 217(k), except in the case of a member of the Armed Forces (or their spouse or child) to whom section 217(g) applies. The bill would also permanently repeal the qualified moving expense reimbursement exclusion under 132(g)(2), except in the case of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty who moves pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station.

Tip Income: OBBBA allows an above-the-line deduction for tip income with phaseout amounts beginning at $150,000 ($300,000 married filing jointly) for tax years 2025 through 2028. This applies to both employees and independent contractors in industries that customarily receive this income. A list of eligible industries will be provided by the Treasury.

New Deduction for Seniors: OBBBA increases the House temporary bonus deduction to $6,000 under section 63(f) for all individuals who have attained age 65 (and for each spouse meeting the applicable criteria in the case of a joint return). The bill allows a deduction for taxable years 2025 through 2028 beginning after Dec. 31, 2024, and before Jan. 1, 2029. This additional amount is $6,000 per individual and phases out for taxpayers with income over a threshold amount of $150,000 for taxpayers filing jointly and $75,000 for all other taxpayers.

Overtime Pay: For taxable years 2025 through 2028, OBBBA provides a deduction for qualified overtime pay of $12,500 ($25,000 for married filing joint filers). Qualified overtime compensation is overtime compensation paid to an individual required under section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in excess of the regular rate at which such individual is employed. The deduction phases out for AGI over $150,000 ($300,000 for married filing joint filers).

Interest on Domestic Auto Purchases: For taxable years 2025 through 2028, a deduction is allowed for qualified passenger vehicle loan interest. Individuals are allowed an above-the-line deduction for interest on loans used to purchase American-made cars. The deduction is capped at $10,000, with income phase-outs starting at $100,000 (single filers) and $200,000 (married filing joint filers). OBBBA requires a VIN number and excludes campers and RVs.

Clean Energy: The Senate bill terminates several individual credits, including the clean vehicle credits for new and previously owned motor vehicles, the energy efficient home improvement credit, the residential clean energy credit, and the new energy efficient home credit. The repeal is effective 180 days from the date of enactment, except for the new energy efficient home credit, which is effective 12 months from the date of enactment.

Family Medical Leave and Adoption Credit: OBBBA makes the family medical leave credit available to business under section 45S permanent, makes the cost of family leave insurance eligible for the credit, and lowers the eligible employee tenure from 12 to 6 months. OBBBA makes the adoption tax credit partially refundable up to $5,000 and indexed for inflation beginning in tax years starting after Dec. 31, 2024. The refundable portion of the credit cannot be carried forward.

Section 529 Accounts: OBBBA would allow tax-exempt distributions from Sec. 529 savings plans to be used for additional educational expenses in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school. The bill would also allow tax-exempt distributions from 529 savings plans to be used for additional qualified higher education expenses, including “qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses.”

Trump Accounts: OBBBA creates Trump accounts that allow parents to open accounts for children under 8. Parents and others can contribute up to $5,000 annually (adjusted for inflation) until the beneficiary turns 18. The accounts enjoy preferential tax treatment when amounts are spent on certain qualifying expenses. The trustee can access the account after reaching age 18 and has until age 31 to use the funds in a tax-advantaged manner. OBBBA also provides a pilot federal government complementary contribution of a one-time transfer of $1,000 into Trump accounts for children born between 2025 and 2028. To be eligible, the child needs to be a U.S. citizen at birth with an SSN which must be provided. There are no income limits or phaseouts.

Provisions Affecting Colleges and Universities

Excise Tax on Colleges and Universities: The TCJA required certain colleges and universities with at least 500 students paying tuition and endowments exceeding $500,000 per student to pay an excise tax of 1.4% of their net investment income for the year. This is a flat rate for these institutions. In determining the per student amount, assets which are used directly for educational purposes are excluded.

OBBBA creates a tiered system that ranges from 1.4% to 8%. The rate depends on the ratio of the institution’s assets to students.

Student-Endowment Ratio of up to $500,000 – no excise tax applies

Student-Endowment Ratio of $500,001 to $750,000 – 1.4%

Student-Endowment Ratio of $750,001 to $2,000,000 – 4%

Student-Endowment Ratio of over $2,000,000 – 8%

An applicable education institution must have at least 3,000 tuition-paying students in a prior year, have more that 50% tuition-paying students located in the U.S., not be a state college or university, not be a qualified religious institution, and the student-adjusted endowment is at least $500,000.

Provisions Affecting Trusts, Estates, and Gifts

Tax Rates: The income tax rates and brackets for estates and trusts enacted in the TCJA are made permanent with modifications for inflation. To the extent possible, taxpayers may wish to revisit their estate and trust planning for this change, along with the increased exemption.

Exemption: The unified estate and gift tax exemption is made permanent to an inflation-indexed $15 million per individual for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. The generation-skipping transfer tax exemption is also permanently increased to an inflation-indexed $15 million. The $15 million exemption amount is indexed for inflation with a base year of 2025. Accordingly, the exemption amount is $15 million for decedents dying and gifts made in calendar year 2026 and increases with inflation thereafter. Taxpayers may want to revisit their estate and gift planning in light of these changes.

Provisions Affecting Businesses with International Operations

Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (GILTI): OBBBA modifies the section 250 deduction for GILTI to 40%. The foreign tax credit reduction is 10%. This results in an effective tax rate on GILTI to 14%, higher than the 10.668% effective rate proposed by the House version of H.R. 1. The deduction for QBAI in determining a U.S. shareholder’s GILTI inclusion is eliminated. In addition, the allocation of expenses is limited (before foreign tax credits) for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Foreign-derived Intangible Income (FDII): Similarly, for domestic corporations, OBBBA reduces to 33.34% the currently applicable 37.5% deduction for FDII, which was scheduled to decline to 21.875% after 2025. Therefore, the effective tax rate on FDII is slightly increased to 14%, consistent with GILTI. As under GILTI, Qualified Business Asset Investment (QBAI) is eliminated in determining the FDII deduction. In addition, the allocation and apportionment of expenses is limited to directly related expenses. Furthermore, deduction eligible income (DEI) would not include gains from the sale or other disposition of property that gives rise to rents or royalties.

Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (BEAT): OBBBA permanently increases the BEAT rate from 10% to 10.5%. These changes to the BEAT provisions apply to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) Provisions: OBBBA adds a number of CFC provisions not contained in H.R. 1, including making the CFC look through rule permanent, repealing the 1 month deferral in section 898(c), reinstating section 958(b)(4) to prevent downward attribution from a foreign person to a U.S. person in determining CFC status, adding section 951B to cause certain foreign corporations to be treated as CFCs, and amending the pro rata share rules under section 951A.

Foreign Tax Credits: For section 904 calculation purposes, income from the sale of U.S. produced inventory attributable to an office or other fixed place of business outside the U.S. is foreign source income up to 50% of the total taxable income from the sale.

Provisions that did not make it into OBBBA

There are a number of provisions that were not included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those provisions include lower corporate tax rates (including the 15% rate for domestic manufacturers, increased tax rates for high-income individuals making over $2.5 million annually, the taxation of partnership carried interests, and a corporate SALT cap. In addition, the Senate bill did not include language on some provisions in H.R. 1. Those include the section 899 “Revenge Tax,” legacy section 48 credit, adjustments to section 197 asset basis for sports teams, modification of the section 856 REIT subsidiary, an increased excise tax on private foundations, changes to UBIT, health reimbursement arrangements, cafeteria plans, and employer credit for CHOICE arrangements.

Conclusion

The changes made by the One Big Beautiful Act are significant and will require ongoing examination and planning opportunities.

Now British Airways joins EcoCeres in a strategic move to accelerate the transition toward sustainable air travel by securing a long-term supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This partnership reflects British Airways’ commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and achieving its goal of powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030. By teaming up with Hong Kong-based EcoCeres, which operates an advanced SAF production facility in Jiangsu, China, the airline is reinforcing its global sustainability strategy and supporting innovation in cleaner aviation fuels that significantly cut emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

British Airways Signs Landmark Sustainable Aviation Fuel Deal with EcoCeres to Slash Emissions by 400,000 Tonnes

British Airways (BA) has taken a major step toward its climate goals by entering a significant new partnership with alternative aviation fuel pioneer EcoCeres. This long-term agreement marks a strategic push by the UK’s flag carrier to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from its operations by ramping up the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under this newly signed multi-year agreement, Hong Kong-based EcoCeres will supply British Airways with SAF sourced from its advanced production facility in Jiangsu, China. The airline aims to use the fuel to help meet its ambitious target of powering at least 10% of its flights with sustainable fuel by 2030 — a move that reflects growing momentum in the aviation sector to transition toward cleaner energy sources.

A Bold Step Towards Cleaner Skies

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is made from non-fossil sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-edible biomass. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock and production methods used. British Airways’ deal with EcoCeres is expected to cut emissions by approximately 400,000 metric tonnes, based on the lifecycle of the SAF when compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

To put that into perspective, the emissions saved through this supply deal are equivalent to the carbon produced by 240,000 roundtrip economy passengers flying between London and New York — a staggering figure that underscores the potential of SAF in supporting aviation’s sustainability goals.

EcoCeres: A Key Partner in Asia’s Green Aviation Push

EcoCeres, headquartered in Hong Kong, is at the forefront of renewable fuel innovation in Asia. The company specializes in converting waste-based biomass into high-value biofuels, including SAF. Its Jiangsu facility is equipped with cutting-edge technology designed for large-scale SAF production that meets international safety and quality standards.

The partnership with British Airways elevates EcoCeres’ profile as a reliable SAF supplier to leading global carriers. The company expressed its commitment to supporting the airline’s journey to net-zero carbon emissions through scalable, low-carbon fuel solutions.

In an official statement, EcoCeres emphasized the significance of the agreement as a milestone in expanding the global SAF supply chain and strengthening international cooperation in tackling climate change.

BA’s SAF Commitment: Beyond a Single Partnership

British Airways’ collaboration with EcoCeres is part of a broader strategy by its parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), which has pledged to invest $865 million in sustainable aviation fuels over the next decade. The airline has also partnered with other SAF producers including LanzaJet, which is developing facilities in the UK and the US.

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, USA, is considered a breakthrough project, and British Airways is backing a similar initiative in the UK. These ventures aim to produce SAF at commercial scale using ethanol derived from agricultural waste and other renewable sources.

By expanding its SAF supplier network to include Asia-based producers like EcoCeres, British Airways is not only diversifying its energy mix but also helping to accelerate global SAF production capacity — a critical factor in driving down costs and making the fuel more accessible across the industry.

Why SAF Matters for Aviation’s Climate Strategy

The aviation sector contributes approximately 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, and that share is expected to rise without meaningful decarbonization. With limited near-term options for electrification or hydrogen-based propulsion in long-haul flights, SAF is widely regarded as the most viable solution available today to lower the environmental impact of flying.

However, SAF currently represents less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption, primarily due to high production costs and limited infrastructure. Deals like the one between British Airways and EcoCeres are crucial in signaling long-term demand, encouraging investment in new refineries, and prompting governments to establish favorable policy frameworks.

Scaling Production and Encouraging Adoption

One of the key obstacles in scaling SAF usage is supply. While technological readiness has improved, producers still face challenges in scaling feedstock collection, refining capacity, and certification processes. British Airways’ commitment to working with multiple SAF developers shows a clear strategy of reducing risk and ensuring future availability.

As demand for air travel continues to rebound, the pressure on airlines to deliver emissions reductions without compromising capacity or network reach has intensified. By securing long-term SAF agreements now, British Airways is not only preparing for regulatory changes and potential fuel mandates, but also positioning itself as a leader in sustainable aviation.

A Model for Global Carriers

British Airways’ SAF partnership with EcoCeres sets a strong example for other international carriers looking to deepen their environmental commitments. While government policies like the UK’s “Jet Zero” strategy are pushing for a net-zero aviation sector by 2050, the onus still falls heavily on individual airlines to invest in innovation and seek out credible partners.

This deal may also have a ripple effect across Asia and Europe, encouraging more cross-border collaborations in renewable aviation fuels. Given the scale of emissions involved, the transition to SAF must be global, and partnerships like BA-EcoCeres highlight how cooperation across continents can yield tangible climate benefits.

Conclusion

British Airways’ latest move to secure Sustainable Aviation Fuel from EcoCeres represents more than just a supply agreement — it’s a clear commitment to a lower-carbon future for air travel. With emissions reductions comparable to removing tens of thousands of transatlantic flights’ worth of carbon, the deal not only boosts BA’s sustainability credentials but also reinforces the role of SAF as a cornerstone in aviation’s decarbonization roadmap.

Now British Airways joins EcoCeres to secure a reliable supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, reinforcing its commitment to greener travel and its goal of cutting emissions across global operations. The partnership supports BA’s target to use 10% SAF by 2030 and advances its net-zero ambitions.

This initiative supports compliance with the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation’s emission reduction program, which becomes mandatory in 2027.

Under the new regulations, airlines operating international flights involving Turkey must use enough SAF to achieve the 5% emissions reduction target. Jet fuel suppliers in Turkey will also be required to source SAF to meet this goal, including domestic oil refiners like Tupras.

The authority will set and publish minimum emission reduction targets annually before the end of the third quarter. It will enforce penalties on airlines and fuel suppliers that fail to comply.

Additionally, airlines must load 90% of their required SAF for international flights within Turkey.

According to the International Energy Agency, aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions.

Tupras, Turkey’s largest oil refiner, plans to produce 20,000 metric tons of SAF at a major plant by 2026 and aims to increase production to 400,000 tons by constructing a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending final investment approval.

This bilateral framework will enable both nations to exchange emission reduction credits, supporting Japan in fulfilling its climate commitments.

Japan's goal of achieving net-zero by 2050 and India's 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 highlight the natural partnership between the two countries in decarbonization and economic growth. Japanese companies are increasingly interested in entering the Indian market as a relocation destination for production bases or as an investment opportunity. Therefore, this article explores the potential of partnerships in the carbon market sector.

What is the Joint Credit Mechanism?

Under the JCM, Japanese companies will invest in and deploy advanced carbon reduction technologies in India. In return, Japan will receive carbon credits that can offset its emissions or be traded within its national carbon market. The initiative falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which ensures internationally recognized and verifiable emissions reductions.

Once finalized, carbon credits will be officially registered and tracked. Joint committees will be formed to oversee project implementation and to verify credit issuance through the formulation of a detailed report.

Consequently, this mechanism will assist both countries in meeting their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris framework. A wide range of sectors, including solar thermal energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are expected to benefit from JCM investments.

A Proven Model for International Cooperation

Originally initiated by Japan, the JCM facilitates the transfer of technical expertise and climate-friendly technologies from developed to developing countries. Developed nations benefit by outsourcing their emissions reductions, often at a lower cost. Meanwhile, this supports sustainable development in host countries. It helps mobilize international finance, alleviating the cost burden for the recipient country.

Currently, Japan has established similar agreements with 11 other countries, including Indonesia, Kenya, and Vietnam.

India and Japan had been discussing a JCM partnership since 2014. In 2023, a $600 million fund was jointly launched by India's quasi-sovereign wealth fund, the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to invest in sustainable projects. JBIC contributed 51% of that total, while the remainder came from India.

The fund aimed to invest in sustainable projects in areas such as e-mobility, renewable energy, and waste management. Other key initiatives, such as the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, have facilitated a long-standing India-Japan collaboration in energy efficiency. This partnership has reduced 10 million tons of CO2 emissions, saved 25 million tons of oil equivalent energy, and generated $10 billion in investments.

What are the Benefits?

For a country like India, which is vulnerable to climate change, adopting clean technologies is both essential and urgent. Achieving low or zero carbon emissions necessitates access to these technologies. However, such technologies often come with high upfront costs. This may exceed what the governments of developing countries can currently fund. They are typically expensive or not widely available.

For example, generating electricity from coal is cheaper than using green hydrogen or solar thermal power, despite the environmental cost. In this context, Japan's role becomes critical. It helps to equalize the cost of clean energy with conventional, polluting sources by subsidizing these technologies. Today, problems such as a severed supply chain, amid an unstable global situation, have aligned both countries' efforts and broader climate ambitions to build effective carbon markets.

A Strategic and Economic Game-Changer

Coal continues to dominate India's power mix due to its lower capital costs. However, with Japanese subsidies, alternatives such as energy storage systems and solar thermal plants could become economically viable, thereby accelerating India's energy transition. It has the potential to transform India's energy sector by improving the competitiveness and affordability of renewable energy technologies.

Beyond emissions cuts and costs, the JCM has the potential to generate jobs in both nations by fostering investments in low-carbon technologies. Furthermore, it promises to drive economic growth by creating skilled jobs. India can strategically channel these funds into underdeveloped clean energy sectors, leveraging Japanese expertise to expedite its transition to a low-carbon economy. This aligns with India's dual goals of sustainable development and economic expansion. Meanwhile, Japanese companies gain access to a rapidly growing market for clean technologies.

The initiative is likely to strengthen India-Japan strategic ties, complementing their collaboration in infrastructure, defense, and economic security. It also counterbalances China's growing regional influence, having a ripple effect on different domains of collaboration. However, the ultimate goal is for India to adopt and scale these technologies independently, making JCM a high-stakes and high-impact partnership.

India Fields Itself

India is poised to introduce its long-awaited carbon market by 2026. The market for the sale and purchase of carbon credits does not currently exist in our country. Under this program, those who use fossil fuels or emit carbon would have to buy carbon credits, while those who use power from non-fossil sources would receive carbon credits that they can sell in the market.

The introduction of carbon credits should incentivize manufacturers to adopt green energy solutions, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing compliance with global regulations. India's strong potential in green hydrogen, energy efficiency, waste management, and biogas reaffirms Japan's commitment to supporting these initiatives.

Major Roadblocks

There have been significant roadblocks to warming India-Japan relations in the climate domain. Negotiations with India have been ongoing since 2014, highlighting the complexity of such high-stakes climate agreements. Challenges also remain in ensuring that emissions reductions are not double-counted. This will be crucial to upholding the mechanism's credibility and preventing any compromise of its integrity.

Additionally, there is a concern that Japan might use the JCM to delay more decisive domestic climate actions. Critics argue that developed countries should prioritize cutting emissions at home first, as it feeds into domestic political debate on climate. However, supporters of the mechanism contend that international cooperation through frameworks like the JCM facilitates faster and more cost-effective global progress toward climate goals.

Long-term sustainability is another critical issue. India must ultimately develop the capability to adopt and scale these technologies independently. This will require not only funding but also knowledge transfer, training, and the development of infrastructure.

Without such capacity-building, the JCM risks becoming a short-term fix rather than a foundation for lasting transformation. India must cultivate the ability to sustain and expand these technologies over time.

Toward a Model Partnership

India is the world's third-largest GHG emitter, primarily due to its coal and industrial activities. Similar JCM partnerships, such as those in Vietnam, have already achieved measurable CO2 reductions in key sectors. A similar trajectory can be expected for India by targeting high-emission areas with solutions like sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen. Although the exact emissions reduction targets under the India-Japan JCM have yet to be disclosed, the potential is significant.

The Japan-India JCM could serve as a global blueprint for climate cooperation if implemented effectively. It has the potential to reduce the cost of climate action, accelerate technology transfer, and strengthen diplomatic ties. This should help both nations move closer to their climate goals.

Technological options include the potential of green ammonia, hydrogen, and solar energy in industrial transformation. Carbon dioxide removal technologies are also highlighted as important. There is a need for technology transfer, financing, and strategic partnerships to boost sustainability efforts.

Both nations are committed to climate action. Through innovative technologies and strong policy frameworks, they can create mutually beneficial pathways toward decarbonization. Japan's approach to carbon markets aligns well with India's sustainability goals. Its commitment to strengthening investment ties with India through the JCM framework, which promotes energy security and a low-carbon future, is well-timed.

By aligning sustainability objectives with strategic interests, this partnership can show how developed and developing countries can collaborate meaningfully to address one of the most significant challenges of our time.

“Global airlines are increasingly looking to Latin America and the Caribbean to redirect operations and mitigate geopolitical risks,” says Peter Cerdá, IATA’s Regional Vice President for the Americas.
Increasing connectivity Airlines have certainly delivered on connectivity when the opportunity and framework are there.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, that drops to $3.40—less than half.
“With collaboration, investment, and a shared vision, we can continue transforming how people and goods move across the region,” Cerdá summarizes.","Aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean links more than 670 million people across 33 countries. In 2024, some 481 million passengers took to the skies, marking a 7.8% increase from the previous year.

Conflict and turbulent geopolitics in other parts of the world are feeding into this growth. “Global airlines are increasingly looking to Latin America and the Caribbean to redirect operations and mitigate geopolitical risks,” says Peter Cerdá, IATA’s Regional Vice President for the Americas. “For example, we have seen Canadian and European carriers capitalize on shifting demand away from the United States by launching new routes to the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America, highlighting how our region is becoming a strategic alternative for global carriers.”

Cerdá adds that this should also serve as a reminder for the many Ministers of Tourism who attended WOCA that airlines are looking for partnerships and favorable conditions to start service. In 2024, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the tourism sector contributed $714 billion to the GDP of Latin America and the Caribbean and supported over 28 million jobs.

Increasing connectivity

Airlines have certainly delivered on connectivity when the opportunity and framework are there. In Guatemala, international traffic increased 45% between 2019 and 2024 thanks to an ambitious reform agenda consisting of a new legislation, airport modernization, and a commitment to resolving tax and infrastructure issues.

In Guyana, the administration has reaffirmed its commitment to making aviation a pillar of national development. KLM has opened up a route into Europe and major US carriers have started connecting the country to their major hubs.

Argentina, meanwhile, has prioritized liberalization and competition—signing or renegotiating 14 bilateral air service agreements, opening the ground handling market, and reducing regulatory barriers. By March 2025, this had led to a 26% year-over-year increase in international passenger demand. Aerolineas Argentinas is profitable for the first time in many years.

Overcoming vulnerabilities

“But the truth is that it is still difficult for carriers in the region to make money,” stresses Cerdá. “Globally, in 2025 airlines are expected to achieve a profit of $36 billion or about $7.20 per passenger. In Latin America and the Caribbean, that drops to $3.40—less than half. This razor-thin margin highlights how vulnerable this region is to shocks—from excessive taxation to regulatory burdens and infrastructure constraints.”

Taxes and fees can make up to 40% of the ticket cost in certain countries and these fees are dampening demand and negatively affecting the region. The proposed 26.5% VAT on air tickets in Brazil highlights this onerous tax burden. If the law goes into effect, IATA estimates it could lead to a 30% reduction in demand. So, while the rest of the region increasingly benefits from aviation connectivity, the Brazilian market would contract.

The VAT increase would raise the average cost of flying from $130 to $160 for domestic traffic, and from $740 to $935 for international traffic. This comes on top of the highest litigation rates in the world and import-priced jet fuel, despite local production.

But even in this tough cost environment, since 2015 international airfares in Brazil have dropped 15.3%, and domestic fares 14.9%, showcasing airlines’ resilience and the value they provide.

“There is a small window of opportunity to reduce the VAT and educate the authorities on international best practice,” says Cerdá. “We will explain what a loss of connectivity could mean for the country.”

Regulation and infrastructure

More generally, the regulatory environment needs to be simplified. A particular concern is the rise in consumer protection laws modeled on EU261, even though this clearly isn’t solving the delays seen in Europe.

In Peru, there is a bill aimed at removing airlines’ ability to charge for specific seat assignments and carry-on luggage, which Cerdá likens to “telling a restaurant it can’t charge for drinks or appetizers—only the main course.”

In Colombia, proposed legislation on overbooking and fare caps would drive-up costs and reduce flexibility and similar ideas are under consideration in Brazil, Chile and Mexico.

In terms of infrastructure, there has been a lot of development in the region. Major hubs like Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Lima, Mexico City, Panama City, Santiago and São Paulo have new or expanded facilities. But many of these facilities are already saturated.

“We need a long-term vision—not just for major hubs, but also for secondary and tertiary cities,” Cerdá notes.

In Colombia, a comprehensive airspace/airport optimization study for Eldorado airport in Bogotá was developed collaboratively by IATA, the industry, and the government over two years ago. Although this initiative is now being looked at again, to date only a handful of its recommendations have been implemented. Cerdá says this is typical of the missed opportunities to unlock efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance capacity.

Sustainability

As with other regions, sustainability looms over all developments in the region. When looked at on paper, the region could be a significant producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) because of its natural environment. Although there is no production at present, several countries—specifically Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico—are putting the right framework in place. Securing the investment and kickstarting production will take time, however.

“There is a long road ahead but there is still a lot of countries can do before the SAF supply picks up,” says Cerdá. “There are many small gains that will add up from better infrastructure to air traffic control to improved taxiing at certain airports. There is low hanging fruit still out there.”

Regional integration

Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to grow 3.2% year-on-year until 2044. The region is becoming more attractive and though challenges remain, the opportunities are taking to gain precedence. China Eastern recently announced a new flight connecting Shanghai and Buenos Aires via Auckland, for example.

“With collaboration, investment, and a shared vision, we can continue transforming how people and goods move across the region,” Cerdá summarizes. “There is a rising middle class, increased tourism, and stronger regional integration. We have the chance to build a region that is more connected, more competitive, and more inclusive than ever before.

“And that would mean more jobs, more trade, and more opportunities for millions of people.”

SAF precursors must meet criteria derived from conventional fuels (e.g. Jet A), including complete oxygen removal to prevent jet engine corrosion and a higher heating value (HHV) close to Jet A. Currently, no HTL-derived biocrude meets these. This study, with contributions from researchers at the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), explored using zeolite-supported molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanocatalysts to upgrade wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors that meet all essential criteria for the first time.

Mo2C nanocatalysts were generated in gas phase and dispersed onto zeolite, tested for their ability to remove oxygen from biocrudes, then used to upgrade wet waste-derived biocrude to SAF via HTL. The upgraded biocrudes were characterized against Federal Aviation Administration specifications.

Our data showed complete oxygen removal from the biocrude and a high heating value of 46.5 MJ/kg, comparable to Jet A. Prescreening tests showed the average carbon number of the upgraded biocrude’s distilled SAF fraction was 10.6, close to 11.4 for average conventional jet fuel, and it satisfied all key SAF prescreening standard specifications, including surface tension, density, viscosity, flash point, and freezing point. The metal carbide nanocatalysts were reusable in upgrading tests multiple times and retained their deoxygenation activity.

This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of catalytically upgrading wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors using zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalyst.

The Senate passed its version of the bill in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

But some lawmakers have expressed concern with aspects of the package related to building a new Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The bill includes $1.9 billion to build the ARTCC, but one provision of that budget item states that at least three current ARTCCs must be “divested and integrated” into the new facility. Additionally, $100 million is allocated to establish the ARTCC Realignment and Consolidation Effort, where at least 10 ARTCCs would be “closed or consolidated to facilitate recapitalization of ARTCC facilities” operated by the FAA.

This consolidation effort is one of the major aviation amendments from the original House bill, one that could give many state representatives pause. Potential closures would disrupt jobs across a number of districts. Representatives in these districts might be less apt to vote to pass the bill knowing constituents’ jobs are about to be slashed. Currently, 22 ARTCCs are in operation across the country. Which centers are on the chopping block remains unclear.

The sprawling domestic legislation allocates the $12.5 billion for technological and infrastructural upgrades to the nation’s air traffic control system. First passed by the House of Representatives, the bill now returns to the lower chamber where members will vote on the changes made by the Senate before sending it to the president’s desk for signature. Republicans in the house, holding a razor-thin majority, are hoping for a swift passage.

Included in the Senate-passed package is $7.75 billion to telecommunications infrastructure and radar system upgrades, $1 billion for bolstering terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities, and $500 million for runway safety and surveillance technologies, among other initiatives. Funding will be provided fully upfront and prioritization of which projects will take precedence will be left to the discretion of the FAA. The bill also reduces the tax credit for using Sustainable Aviation fuel (SAF) from $1.75 per gallon to $1.

As part of the up-front funding, the FAA is required to report specific expenditures to Congress 180 days after the bill’s final passage and every 90 days after that.

On X.com, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy implored Congress to send the bill to the president’s desk. In the post he defended the bill, saying that if not passed, the department will “do nothing” on the air traffic control front.

His support is a backtrack of previous comments where he expressed it would require additional funding in order to implement the needed overhauls to air traffic control.

Duffy said at a press conference in May when asked about the bill, “I’m having conversations with [Congress] at a private level about what I think it could be. The $12.5 billion that we have in the House bill; it’s going to be more than that.”

Aviation industry advocates such as the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) have lauded the legislation for the steps taken to revitalize air traffic control. “We thank the Senate for recognizing with this initial funding that a safe and efficient national airspace requires a robust, resilient ATC system that bolsters our nation’s global aviation leadership,” NBAA president and CEO Ed Bolen said in a statement.",https://avweb.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/25-7-3-Congress.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 19:06:40.589743

On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed their version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by a vote of 51 to 50, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie, sending it back to the House for final passage before becoming law. The vote was the culmination of an—at times—tumultuous week for Senate GOP leaders who had to keep a procedural vote on the legislation open for three hours on Saturday night to secure the votes necessary to move forward.

The Senate’s version made several changes to the House bill passed on May 22. Most of the changes came after the Senate Parliamentarian ruled some provisions of the bill were in violation of the so-called “Byrd Rule” in the Senate. That rule requires any legislation considered under the reconciliation procedures to be primarily budgetary and not just a policy change that doesn’t impact the budget or only impacts it secondarily. This required changes to, or jettisoning entirely, quite a few of the House’s spending cut provisions.

While the Senate did make some changes to the House-passed tax title, NACS’ main priorities remained in the bill. The Senate did eliminate the House-passed increase in the 199(A) deduction for pass-through entities, but it preserved NACS’ top priority of making the existing deduction permanent.

The Senate bill also maintained the House language making increases in the Estate Tax and Section 179 expensing thresholds permanent. It also improves the House bill by not only extending 100% Bonus Depreciation and the return to EBITDA for calculating income for the purposes of the business interest deductions, but making those changes permanent as well.

Below is a list of tax features the Senate Reconciliation Bill has updated:

Federal Corporate Tax Rate (C-corps): Remains flat 21%, no rate cut in Senate text

Graduated Rates: The flat rate stays at 21%

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax: Eliminated under TCJA, no new CAMT included in bill

Pass-Through Income (QBI, sec 199A): Makes permanent at 20% (20% deduction legacy was previously set to expire in 2025)

Bonus Depreciation: Permanently extended, was previously 100% through 2025 under TCJA

R&D Expensing (Sec 174): Permanent suspension of capitalization, retroactive

Interest Limitation: Switches to EBITDA cap permanently

Section 179 Expensing: Expanded to $2.5M/$4M limit, was previously $1.16M limit

Estate Tax: Permanently sets exemption at $15M per person, indexed annually

One of the most contentious negotiations among GOP Senators was the same as on the House side—how to deal with the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction. Notable for many convenience retailers, the Senate’s compromise eliminates the House language that invalidated SALT deduction work arounds for businesses that many states had passed since 2018.

On the energy side, the Senate bill also levels the playing field between sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels. This provision will help level the playing field for biofuel production instead of arbitrarily creating winners and losers among the trucking, railway and aviation industries.

Noting the above benefits to our industry, NACS sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) expressing our industry’s support and urging Senators to support final passage of the Reconciliation package.

Due to the changes the Senate made, the bill must now be passed again in the House of Representatives before it can be sent to President Donald Trump. It remains to be seen if the changes made will be acceptable to the House GOP, particularly to budget hard liners in the caucus. If the House makes any further changes, it will have to be sent back to the Senate for another round of voting. Should that occur, the overall viability of the legislation would be in even greater jeopardy. The goal of republican leadership remains to have this package on the President’s desk by July 4, meaning the House will have to be called back from their district work period this week to take the needed votes.",https://www.convenience.org/getattachment/Media/Daily/2025/July/2/2-Senate-Passes-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill_GR/Story-2.png,N,,2025-07-02 18:07:56.781590

Vice President J.D. Vance cast the tiebreaking vote, securing the bill’s return to the House for a final vote.

The newest version of the bill includes a rollback of certain clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act. Under the Senate-passed version, the bill accelerates the sunset of some existing incentives, including the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles and used EV credit, which will expire on September 30, 2025.

The Senate’s version of the bill also shortens the lifespan of the 45V hydrogen production tax credit. Originally enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the 45V credit was designed to provide up to $3 per kilogram of low-emission hydrogen during a 10-year period. Under the Senate-passed legislation, the credit would be phased out entirely for projects not under construction by the end of 2027. Hydrogen facilities that begin construction before the bill’s enactment and are operational by December 31, 2027, would remain eligible for the credit. The change could also affect the future of the Department of Energy’s Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs initiative, which is reliant on the 45V credit to attract private capital and ensure commercial feasibility.

The Senate version of the bill also includes modifications to biofuel and renewable diesel tax credits. It extends the clean fuel production credit — Section 45Z — through 2031, but applies a 20% reduced credit value for biofuels manufactured from feedstocks sourced outside the U.S. The legislation also revives and increases the small agri-biodiesel producer credit, boosting it from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon and extending eligibility through December 31, 2026, and reinstates credit transferability.

For sustainable aviation fuel, the Senate version rolls back the enhanced credit rate for fuel sold after 2025. However, the basic SAF credit remains available through fuel sold in 2029 as part of Section 45Z adjustments.

The House is expected to take up the bill later this week. If successful, President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on or before July 4.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CSPAN-Senate-Vote.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 19:06:44.456543

Full-service airlines, which offer first and business class cabins, tend to have higher emission on an available seat kilometer basis.","Frontier Airlines is the most efficient carrier in North America and the second most efficient in the world, according to a new emissions calculation methodology developed by the airline industry data company Cirium.

Frontier, with carbon dioxide emissions of 54.4 grams per available seat kilometer in 2024, was beat out only by Hungarian discount carrier Wizz Air, which emitted 53.9 grams of CO2 per seat kilometer last year, according to the Cirium analysis.

As a point of comparison, lifecycle emissions of a simple cup of black coffee are 21 grams of carbon, according to CarbonClick, with emissions sometimes ballooning to many times more than that depending upon cultivation techniques, the type of cup used and whether the coffee is consumed with cream or other additives.

Among the world's 10 largest airlines, as measured by total seat miles offered, Ryanair was the top emissions performer, emitting 63 grams of CO2 per available seat kilometer. The four U.S. carriers among the top 10 largest airlines ranked second through fifth respectively, with Southwest leading the way, followed by Delta, American and United.

Southwest was the clear efficiency winner among those U.S. behemoths, with emissions of 68.9 grams per available seat kilometer. The other three were bunched closely together, emitting between 74.4 and 75.4 grams of CO2 per seat kilometer.

How the ranking is calculated

Cirium joins several entities that have developed methodologies for measuring aviation and airline carbon emissions, including Google, IATA, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.K.'s environmental department DEFRA and Cirium's competitor, OAG. But Cirium says its platform, called Emerald Sky, is the first to use real-time flight tracking data for its calculations instead of relying on projected or standard routes or forecasted route averages.

To achieve its emissions estimates, the platform also considers actual air time and atmospheric conditions of a flight; aircraft and engine types; aircraft age; seating configurations; passenger loads; cargo loads; and taxi times.

An airline's usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not yet considered in the Emerald Sky formula because SAF accounts for only a tiny fraction of total jet fuel. Cirium chief strategy officer Kevin O'Toole said the company will include SAF in the algorithm once its accounts for 1% of global fuel consumption, which is about double its current contribution.

Cirim said the methodology had been independently reviewed and validated by PricewaterhouseCoopers and by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Boulder, Colo.-based environmental nonprofit.

Why low-cost carriers are more CO2-efficient

Overall, the Cirium Flight Emissions Review showed that dense seat configurations and modern fleets are airlines' primary levers for efficiency.

All the 10 most efficient carriers have a low-cost model. Frontier achieved its second place ranking largely through its combination of densely configured cabins and a fleet that averages just four-and-a-half years of age.

The other U.S. airline in the top 10 is low-cost carrier Spirit, with a fleet-age average of 6.3 years of age.

As demand surges in the Americas and Europe while regional supply chains buckle under refinery outages and geopolitical tensions, Northeast Asian exporters—led by South Korea—are stepping into the breach. A 26% projected leap in South Korea's July jet fuel exports, fueled by arbitrage opportunities and widening price differentials, underscores a structural shift in energy trade dynamics. Yet, this boom comes with risks: rising freight costs, Middle Eastern competition, and regulatory headwinds loom large. For investors, the question is clear: how to position for this volatile yet transformative market?

The Arbitrage Play: Price Gaps and Refinery Flexibility

South Korea's jet fuel exports to the U.S. hit a four-year high in May 2025, with 4.3 million barrels exported—a 33% year-over-year jump. This surge reflects a stark reality: U.S. refinery shutdowns (e.g., PBF Energy's California fire, Valero's Benicia closure) have created a supply vacuum. Meanwhile, Northeast Asian refiners like SK Innovation and S-Oil are leveraging their idle capacity and proximity to Asian crude markets to exploit price differentials.

Jet fuel in Asia trades at a $10–$15/barrel discount to U.S. prices due to weaker regional demand and oversupply. This gap, combined with freight rates hovering near 2024 lows (despite rising competition), makes arbitrage feasible—for now.

Risks on the Horizon: Freight, Middle Eastern Muscle, and Sustainability

The arithmetic of arbitrage is fragile. Freight costs, though currently manageable, could spike if trans-Pacific demand for tankers surges. Middle Eastern producers—such as Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company—also eye the U.S. and European markets, armed with lower-cost crude and long-haul shipping expertise.

Moreover, sustainability mandates loom. South Korea's 2027 SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) blending rule requires refiners to mix 1% SAF into jet fuel—a hurdle for firms without green infrastructure. Companies like SK, which has partnered with Cathay Pacific on SAF exports, may gain an edge, while laggards face compliance costs.

Investment Strategies: Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Bets

Short-Term: Refiners with Flexibility

SK Innovation (SK 034730.KS) and S-Oil (010950.KS) are prime picks. Their modern refineries can pivot quickly between jet fuel, gasoline, and petrochemicals, capitalizing on price swings. Both have export contracts with U.S. buyers and are expanding SAF capacity.

Logistics Plays: Invest in firms like Hanjin Logistics (086650.KS) or COSCO Shipping (1999.HK), which handle trans-Pacific shipments. Their earnings correlate strongly with tanker utilization rates.

Long-Term: Structural Winners in SAF and Supply Chains

SAF Leaders: Companies like SK E&S (004090.KS), which is building a $1.2 billion SAF plant in South Korea, will benefit as mandates tighten.

Regional Infrastructure: Ports like Busan and Singapore's PSA International (0509.SI) are critical nodes in Northeast Asia's export network. Their valuations may rise if transoceanic trade volumes normalize post-arbitrage frenzy.

Conclusion: Navigating the Turbulence

The Northeast Asian jet fuel boom is a classic case of supply chain arbitrage—a short-lived opportunity to profit from regional imbalances. Investors must balance the upside of current price gaps with the risks of rising costs and Middle Eastern competition. For those willing to be nimble, refiners and logistics firms offer asymmetric returns. But as sustainability rules bite and global supply chains stabilize, only those with green credentials and scale will dominate the next phase of this market.

Stay agile, and keep an eye on those freight rates.

If completed before its South Dakota counterpart, the Richardton facility would be the nation’s first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel plant.

He sees the potential for 100% sustainable fuel use in the future, though not immediately.","RICHARDTON, N.D. — North Dakota Congresswoman Julie Fedorchak visited the Red Trail Energy bioethanol production plant and carbon sequestration facility in Richardton on Monday, June 30.

Fedorchak’s visit came several months after Gevo Inc., a Colorado-based sustainable energy company, purchased the plant for about $210 million and announced plans to add an on-site facility to convert bioethanol into sustainable aviation fuel.

Gevo first announced the acquisition in September 2024. Red Trail’s shareholders approved the sale in December, and the deal closed in early February 2025.

Fedorchak, co-chair of the Congressional Biofuels Caucus, met with Gevo officials to discuss biofuels production, construction timelines, carbon sequestration and the integration of agriculture with energy production.

In an interview with The Dickinson Press, Fedorchak voiced her support for the project.

“North Dakota is an agricultural state, farming is the backbone of our economy,” she said. “Our land is our greatest resource so we always need to be looking at ways to do new and higher value things with our crops, and biofuels are one of our biggest opportunities. We need more energy in our country and in our world. There's a high demand for lower carbon fuels. Biofuels can potentially need that demand.”

Founded in 2005, Gevo Inc. develops low-carbon, sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. The company began planning a sustainable aviation fuel plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, to use the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline for carbon capture .

When Summit failed to secure state permits, Gevo sought an alternative site.

“We decided to take some of our money and go kind of jump start our production capability by finding a site that would really fit in with our business strategy,” said Chris Ryan, Gevo’s president and COO.

Ryan cited the existing ethanol plant, ties to local agriculture, carbon sequestration capabilities and the company’s growth strategy as reasons for selecting Richardton.

If completed before its South Dakota counterpart, the Richardton facility would be the nation’s first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel plant.

The Richardton site currently produces 65 million gallons of corn-based bioethanol annually from 23 million bushels of corn. It also sells co-products like distillers grains, syrup for animal feed and corn oil, which has both culinary and industrial uses.

The site also hosts the first U.S. carbon capture and storage project permitted under state primacy.

“The plant is very efficient. It’s a great team up there, running it. We don’t plan on really changing that,” Ryan said.

Gevo’s new facility would convert ethanol into jet fuel on-site.

“We envision making sustainable aviation fuel there. That’s a key focus for us,” Ryan said. “To do that, we would add a facility that would take the bioethanol and convert it to jet fuel.”

The new plant is expected to create 50 full-time jobs and many more during construction.

Stark County Commission Chairman Neal Messer, a Richardton native and small grains farmer, said the project adds value to local commodities.

“I view it as value added to our farm commodities and anytime you can do that it’s a good thing,” Messer said.

He also disclosed receiving payments for carbon stored under his property.

Messer expressed confidence in the agricultural impact, saying the facility would help farmers diversify and grow.

“It allows smaller communities like my hometown of Richardton to thrive,” he said.

Messer said he wasn’t overly concerned about the impact the new facility would have on the local agricultural community, instead stating his belief it would enable local farmers to grow and diversify their farm commodities.

He ended his interview by saying he believed the project would be a net positive for Richardton.

“It allows smaller communities like my hometown of Richardton to thrive,” Messer said.

In 2021, the International Air Transport Association — which represents about 82% of global air traffic — pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The plan relies on sustainable aviation fuels for 65% of its reductions and carbon capture for 19%.

“The aviation industry is under pressure to do something about their carbon emissions,” Ryan said. “So over the years they have decided to step up and participate in buying lower carbon options.”

The fuel produced at Richardton will be sold to airlines, typically mixed with petroleum jet fuel at 10–50%, depending on regulations.

“You’re basically extending the life of the petroleum jet fuel not only by adding gallons, but you’re also decreasing the carbon score for the entire gallon,” Ryan said.

He sees the potential for 100% sustainable fuel use in the future, though not immediately.

Not all are convinced of the benefits. The World Resources Institute argues sustainable aviation fuels may not reduce net carbon emissions, citing increased demand for cropland and loss of carbon-storing grasslands — a concern in sparsely forested states like North Dakota.

Ryan noted the landscape wouldn’t change significantly due to the site’s existing ethanol plant and that any shifts would have occurred when it opened in the 2000s.

Still, Gevo has discussed expanding ethanol production, potentially increasing corn demand.

“A lot of our supplier farmers attended a launch where we talked to them and asked, ‘Do you have the ability to grow more corn,’ and they said absolutely yes,” Ryan said.

The WRI also criticized the conversion rate — 1.7 gallons of ethanol to make 1 gallon of jet fuel — as inefficient.

Ryan countered that the energy content remains consistent or higher because the conversion process removes water, concentrating hydrocarbons.

Carbon sequestration, while operational, carries risks. The Environmental Law Institute warns of potential leakage into soil or groundwater.

Gevo officials said the risk is mitigated by the site’s placement over the Broom Creek Formation, which is capped by two impermeable rock layers.

Ryan said the facility is in the engineering phase, with construction potentially beginning in 12 to 18 months. Completion is projected for late 2028 or 2029.

Airlines operating in Europe are facing mounting challenges stemming from compliance fees imposed by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producers and suppliers.

While these fees are designed to support regulatory and sustainability goals, they are adding significant financial, operational, and strategic burdens to an industry already navigating tight margins and a highly competitive landscape.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2mn tonnes in 2025, which is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4bn globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh.

The problem with mandates: Most SAF is now heading towards Europe, where the European Union and United Kingdom mandates kicked in on January 1.

“Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging,” IATA says.

For the expected 1mn tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2bn.

Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7bn on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5mn tonnes of carbon emissions.

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation.

“Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7tn should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way,” Walsh said on the sidelines of IATA’s annual general meeting in New Delhi last month.

Global SAF market: To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardised system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

IATA urges governments to focus on three areas:

Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1tn in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived.

Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A holistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India: India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth.

This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.

As the third-largest global civil aviation market, India can strengthen its leadership in biofuels with the accelerated adoption of SAF through progressive policies.

IATA SAF Matchmaker platform: Recently, IATA announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

The growing use of SAF is essential to decarbonising aviation. However, excessive compliance fees in Europe risk undermining adoption by inflating costs and reducing efficiency.

Airlines must balance regulatory obligations with economic realities—something only achievable through smarter, more supportive policy frameworks.

On 20 March, a fire at the North Hyde 275kV substation, which feeds most of Heathrow, resulted in the airport’s closure.
It found that an elevated moisture reading in the bushing had been detected in oil samples taken by the National Grid in July 2018.
Following the report's findings, Ofgem has now launched an investigation into National Grid.
The report states that “Heathrow airport have a plan to deal with this which includes reconfiguring their internal electrical distribution network to take power from the other two supply points”.","A fire at a Heathrow airport substation, owned by the National Grid, was caused by a problem first detected seven years ago but never fixed, according to a final report by the National Energy System Operator (NESO).

On 20 March, a fire at the North Hyde 275kV substation, which feeds most of Heathrow, resulted in the airport’s closure.

Aviation chaos ensued, with more than 1,300 flights cancelled and hundreds of thousands of passengers affected. More than 70,000 other businesses, homes and services were also affected, including Hillingdon Hospital.

Energy watchdog Ofgem commissioned NESO to conduct an investigation, assessing the reasons the fire started in the first place as well as a broader assessment about the UK’s energy resilience and actions that could be taken to prevent similar incidents in future.

The report found that at 11.21pm on 20 March one of three supergrid transformers (SGT3) at the North Hyde substation and its associated circuit tripped. Shortly after, the other transformers (SGT1 and SGT2) tripped. The cause was a catastrophic failure on one of SGT3’s high-voltage bushings, which caused the transformer to catch fire.

This was most likely caused by moisture entering the bushing, causing an electrical fault.

It found that an elevated moisture reading in the bushing had been detected in oil samples taken by the National Grid in July 2018.

According to the National Grid’s relevant guidance, such readings indicate “an imminent fault and that the bushing should be replaced”.

While this elevated moisture reading was recorded in its online system, “mitigating actions appropriate to its severity were not implemented”, the report found.

In addition, in 2022 a decision was made to defer basic maintenance on SGT3.

Fintan Slye, NESO’s chief executive, told the BBC’s Today programme that while the report “did not set out to apportion blame”, the National Grid was responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and ensuring it was fit for operation.

“So when they identified those moisture levels back in 2018, what should have happened is that the transformer should have been taken out of service for a short period of time and that fault effectively repaired.

“That was missed. The moisture got worse over time and ultimately that’s what caused the fire to happen. The story of our report really is probably one of missed opportunities.”

According to the BBC, National Grid said it had “taken further action since the fire”, including “re-testing the resilience of substations that serve strategic infrastructure”.

Following the report's findings, Ofgem has now launched an investigation into National Grid.

The report also found that because of the way Heathrow’s electricity network is configured, the loss of power from the substation – one of three supply points for the airport – led to a power outage to some of the airport’s critical systems.

The report states that “Heathrow airport have a plan to deal with this which includes reconfiguring their internal electrical distribution network to take power from the other two supply points”.

It also found that “energy network operators are not generally aware whether customers connected to their networks are Critical National Infrastructure”.

The report makes a number of recommendations to reduce the likelihood and impact of a similar event in the future. These include resilience of infrastructure with multiple supply points, maintenance actions, electricity safety, quality and continuity regulations, and incident management protocols.

Slye said: “The power outage and closure of Heathrow airport were hugely disruptive, and our report seeks to improve the way parties plan for and respond to these incidents, building on the underlying resilience of our energy system.

“All parties involved are focused on working together to deliver these important recommendations, and much of this work is already under way with NESO’s full support.”",https://cdn2.eandtmagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-03/web_london-united-kingdom-15-july-2024_Credit_WildSnap_shutterstock_2506722765_1600x900.jpg?itok=VqERPk13,N,,2025-07-02 18:08:12.026467

The reversal of the tax, effective July 1, comes as the government seeks to boost the country’s commercial aviation industry.
This move is expected to lower ticket prices, making air travel more affordable and potentially increasing demand, which could boost the competitiveness of airlines.
A majority of Swedes initially supported the air tax, but the environmental impact of the tax has been a subject of debate.","Sweden has reversed its air travel tax policy, which was introduced in 2018 to curb carbon emissions and reduce air travel. The tax, which placed levies on airline tickets based on the distance flown, was part of a broader movement known as ""flight shaming,"" popularized by environmental activists like Greta Thunberg. This movement aimed to discourage air travel due to its significant environmental impact, particularly its contribution to carbon emissions.

The reversal of the tax, effective July 1, comes as the government seeks to boost the country’s commercial aviation industry. The tax had led to a steady decrease in air traffic, particularly to Sweden’s rural airports. A center-right coalition, supported by the far-right Sweden Democrats, presented a 2025 budget proposal that eliminated the tax. This move is expected to lower ticket prices, making air travel more affordable and potentially increasing demand, which could boost the competitiveness of airlines.

Since the tax was implemented, Sweden has seen a significant drop in air traffic. Flights landing in Swedish airports decreased by more than 35%, and Irish airline Ryanair withdrew entirely from Sweden’s domestic market. The tax also contributed to a shift in travel preferences, with train travel passenger numbers jumping to a record high in 2018. A majority of Swedes initially supported the air tax, but the environmental impact of the tax has been a subject of debate.

The reversal of the tax has been met with mixed reactions. Aviation industry leaders are hopeful that the move will stimulate future investments in sustainable technology. Catrin Mattsson, Area Manager for the International Air Transport Association, stated that the previous aviation tax did not support the transition to reducing emissions. With the tax abolished, funds can be redirected towards investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, new technologies, and innovations needed for the transition to net-zero CO2 emissions.

However, environmental activists and the Green Party have criticized the decision. They argue that the removal of the aviation tax is counterproductive to Sweden's environmental goals. The Green Party spokesperson expressed disappointment, stating that the government's policies are stupid and counterproductive. The reversal of the tax sends a mixed message about Sweden's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable travel.

Despite the criticism, the Swedish government maintains that sustainability remains a priority. The focus has shifted from discouraging air travel to reducing emissions through other means. The decision to reverse the tax highlights the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact Sweden's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable travel in the long run.",,N,,2025-07-02 17:06:49.302096

European bio-bunkers: Prices diverge, abatements firm

London, 1 July (Argus) — European marine biodiesel prices diverged as prices in underlying markets also diverged on Tuesday. In prompt biodiesel markets, outright used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and Advanced Fatty acid methyl ester (Fame) 0 barge prices rose sharply at the close. In fossil markets, the front-month Ice Brent crude and gasoil futures contracts diverged again at 16:30 BST. Delivered VLSFO and MGO prices were mostly close to steady in ARA and GAC, except for VLSFO dob ARA, which fell by $10/t. Marine biodiesel blend prices diverged along the type of biofuel used, as prices for Advanced Fame-based blends picked up while Ucome-based blends eased. Calculated B30 Advanced Fame 0 dob ARA prices, which includes a deduction of the value of Dutch HBE-G renewable fuel tickets, gained $2.38/t to $725.70/t. And calculated B100 Advanced Fame 0 dob ARA prices also increased by $31.29/t to $1,215.18/t — a one-year high. B30 Ucome dob ARA values, on the other hand, eased by $5/t to $820/t, reflecting reported market indications. In the west Mediterranean, Argus assessed B24 dob Algeciras-Gibraltar lower by $10/t on the day at $750/t, also in line with indications. Argus assessments for FuelEU Ucome-MGO abatement and Ucome-VLSFO abatement prices firmed by $8.88/tCO2e to $323.80/tCO2e and by $12.89/tCO2e to $363.70/tCO2e respectively. The increase in Ucome fob ARA prices outpaced higher MGO barge levels, while VLSFO fob northwest Europe values edged lower on the day, lending support to abatement prices. EU ETS prices rebounded to $82.40/t from $80.46/t, but ETS-inclusive premiums held by marine biodiesel blends against their fossil counterparts mostly widened. B30 Ucome dob ARA's ETS-inclusive premium to VLSFO dob ARA rose by $3.73/t to $289.11/t. B30 Advanced Fame 0's ETS-incorporated premium to VLSFO gained $11.11/t to $194.82/t, while B100 Advanced Fame 0's premium to MGO firmed by $28.43/t to $379.75/t, a two-month high. But the ETS-inclusive premium held by B24 dob Algeciras-Gibraltar to VLSFO dob GAC narrowed by about $13/t to $184.89/t.

Philippines’ ethanol imports to increase: USDA

Singapore, 1 July (Argus) — The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects the Philippines' fuel ethanol market and imports to grow in 2025, but the country's biodiesel outlook remains unclear. The Philippines' fuel ethanol consumption is expected to increase from 797mn litres in 2024 to 840mn l this year, rising in tandem with the USDA's gasoline consumption growth forecast of 5pc for 2025. The Philippines has a 10pc ethanol blending mandate for road fuel, tying ethanol demand to gasoline consumption. Car purchases rose by 9pc in 2024, the USDA said, while investments in the country's public transportation system have yet to yield results. Reflecting the forecast increase in road fuel consumption, the USDA is predicting that fuel-grade ethanol imports will rise by 10pc to 450mnl in 2025. The relatively steep growth in imported fuel-grade ethanol is the result of limited ethanol feedstock in the country, it said. The Philippines prioritises the use of domestic ethanol in road fuel blending. Fuel suppliers can only import ethanol at times of domestic shortages. Domestic ethanol is produced from sugarcane and molasses, but a recent decline in available sugarcane land has supported sugarcane and molasses prices, pushing up the cost of ethanol. This has resulted in a slowdown in ethanol production growth because of narrower margins. The USDA expects domestic ethanol production to increase at a relatively low rate of 2pc on the year in 2025 because of the feedstock limitations. Sugarcane- and molasses-based ethanol have one of the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction rates among commonly used first-generation or crop-based ethanol feedstocks such as corn. The Philippines' mandate does not stipulate a definite GHG reduction requirement, leading to imports of predominately US corn-based ethanol, which is the most competitively priced in the market. The affordability of US corn-based ethanol encourages a higher blend of ethanol in road fuel. The Philippines approved a voluntary E20 programme in June 2024 and the USDA expects to see higher uptake of this blend in the coming year. Biodiesel The USDA is forecasting that the Philippines' biodiesel production will hit 360mn l in 2025 should the country remain at B3. But it may increase by 50pc from 2024 to 400mn l this year should the B4 mandate be implemented. The progress of the country's B4 programme remains uncertain after members of the national biofuel board (NBB) agreed on 29 May to pass a resolution to suspend the B4 and B5 implementation in 2025 and 2026 respectively. The board cited the relatively high price of seaborne coconut oil as a reason to recalibrate the programme. The Philippines uses domestic coconut oil in its biodiesel production, but coconut oil prices have more than doubled from $1,100/t in 2024 to around $3,000/t in 2025, resulting in a halt to reconsider market economics. The country's energy department has yet to issue an official advisory on the suspension of the B4 programme, leaving the market in limbo. Sustainable aviation fuel The Philippines has yet to publish a roadmap for its SAF mandate but has formed a SAF committee under the NBB. The country's flag carrier Philippine Airlines announced a 1pc SAF target for 2026. Another local airline, Cebu Pacific, has started using SAF and signed an agreement with Finish SAF producer Neste in 2023. The Philippines has yet to produce SAF but is evaluating the situation and considering the feasibility of different pathways.

EcoCeres, British Airways sign SAF supply agreement

Singapore, 1 July (Argus) — Hong Kong-based biofuels producer EcoCeres has signed a multi-year agreement to supply UK's British Airways with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), it announced on 30 June. The SAF is expected to help the airline reduce life cycle carbon emissions by approximately 400,000t, compared with using the same volume of conventional jet fuel, EcoCeres said in its press release. This reduction is also equivalent to the total emissions from flying around 240,000 economy class passengers on return flights between London and New York. EcoCeres declined to share the SAF volumes or time period agreed in the supply deal. British Airways has committed to fuelling 10pc of its flights with SAF by 2030. SAF accounted for 2.7pc of its total fuel use in 2024, and has contributed to a 13pc reduction in carbon intensity since 2019, said the company's director of sustainability Carrie Harris. EcoCeres operates a 350,000 t/yr SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) plant in Jiangsu, China. Its planned SAF and HVO plant in Johor, Malaysia, has a maximum production capacity of 420,000 t/yr and is expected to come on line in the fourth quarter of 2025, market participants said. EcoCeres also manufactured the 500,000 litres of used cooking oil (UCO)-based SAF delivered to Air New Zealand in June 2024 . The SAF was supplied and blended by ExxonMobil.

US Senate bill cuts 45Z extension, boosts crops

New York, 30 June (Argus) — The latest Senate draft of a major US budget bill would extend a biofuels tax break for an additional two years, down from four years in the prior draft, and set far more sweeping limits on foreign feedstocks. The ""45Z"" clean fuel production credit would last until 2029 and be available for only domestically produced fuels produced from North American feedstocks starting next year, according to a draft released over the weekend by Senate leaders that could be voted on as soon as Monday. An earlier Senate draft proposed extending the incentive through 2031 and cutting credit values for foreign feedstocks by just 20pc. The incentive, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, kicked off this year and currently offers a sliding scale of subsidy to US-made alternative fuels through 2027 based on their greenhouse gas emissions. The updated language is a win for farm groups, which have worried that imports of used cooking oil, tallow, and sugarcane ethanol are hurting demand for home-grown crops that can also be turned into biofuels. Refiners that had previously looked abroad for renewable diesel inputs, expanding US production to record levels last year, would have to pay up for scarcer domestic options. A shorter credit extension could frustrate corners of the industry that had emphasized the need for policy certainty — including companies with plans to start producing novel fuels later this decade — although biofuel incentives have a long history of extensions. For instance, the Senate bill would revive an expired tax credit for small biodiesel producers in a major change from earlier drafts. Facilities with capacities of no more than 60mn USG/yr could claim a 20¢/USG subsidy for up to 15mn USG of annual production this year and next year, supplementing tax breaks they can already claim under 45Z. That could keep more biodiesel plants, which have struggled to adapt to policy changes and competition from larger renewable diesel producers, running after a difficult start to the year. Smaller producers also would benefit from the latest Senate draft preserving the ability of companies without enough tax liability to sell tax credits to others. The bill is otherwise similar to earlier versions. It would still bar regulators next year from considering indirect emissions from land use changes, a shift from current law that in effect ups subsidies for fuels made from crops, another top priority for farm groups. If passed, the typical gallon of US dry mill corn ethanol and canola biodiesel would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy — unlike under current rules — and soybean-based road fuels would earn larger credits next year. Aviation fuels conversely would see slimmer subsidies starting next year, since the bill would eliminate extra credit under current law for jet fuels over road fuels. That would be a major disruption to airlines and to those refiners that have invested in upgrading more of their renewable diesel output to instead produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Trucking groups had argued that the imbalance was diverting feedstocks away from road markets to costlier SAF production — and that treating fuel types equally was one way conservative lawmakers could reduce the credit's price-tag. More changes possible The bill could be changed further Monday as the Senate proceeds with a process in which lawmakers can propose amendments. If the bill passes, it would go back to the House for approval. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to finalize the sprawling package this week, an ambitious timeline given lawmakers still disagree on key issues. Any revised 45Z credit would also need final rules from the US Department of Treasury, which still has questions to answer about eligibility this year. The ultimate profitability of biofuels will depend on interactions between the tax credit and other policies that are also in flux. That includes a federal biofuel blend mandate, which the Trump administration wants to revamp to discourage foreign feedstocks, and newly tougher carbon intensity targets in California's influential low-carbon fuel standard market.

This marks another step to the airline’s fleet renewal and future growth plans. The highlight of the possibility to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the aircraft echoes with SAS’s development of more sustainable aviation.

Next Steps: Fleet Renewal, Sustainability and Improved Regional Connectivity

SAS’s record-breaking Embraer order of 55 aircraft is the largest direct order the airline has placed since 1996. The order consists of 45 Embraer E195-E2 aircraft, with purchasing rights of 10 more aircraft. The deal was valued at approximately £3.15 billion, with delivery dates starting in 2027.

Anko van der Werff, CEO and President of SAS, deemed this a ‘defining moment’ for the airline:

“The Embraer E195-E2 is a world-class aircraft, combining outstanding performance with excellent fuel efficiency and comfort. This aircraft is key to enabling future growth and improved connectivity across Scandinavia and beyond. We’ve taken the time to make the right decision — and this major investment reflects our confidence in the future and the strength of the agreement we’ve secured.”

The newly ordered aircraft are part of the strategy to enhance connectivity between the Scandinavian region and Europe. The E2 aircraft, with lower emissions, also allows the airline to abide by sustainability development and promote greener aviation.

Greener Aviation: Increasing SAF Usage

SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, has been gaining increasing attention in recent years with rising environmental concerns. SAF, generally made from renewable or waste sources, could reduce carbon emissions of up to 80% compared to fossil fuels.

The Embraer E2 family has been tested with 100% SAF, whereas as of today, 50% blended SAF is completely achievable in flights. As technology and research progress, the aircraft could fly with 100% SAF, ensuring SAS’s contributions to sustainable development and greener aviation.

With advanced technology and engineering systems, the E195-E2 delivers huge reductions in fuel burn, emissions, and noise compared to previous-generation aircraft.

The Hungarian low-cost carrier emits around 54 grams of CO₂ per seat per kilometer, according to the review, which was verified by PwC and is the first of its kind in the industry.

That efficiency measure is driven by several key factors, starting with Wizz Air’s relatively young fleet. The airline’s planes average around four years old, and many are up to 25% more fuel-efficient than older aircraft.

Seat configuration plays a role too. Low-cost carriers typically cram more seats into each plane, which reduces emissions per passenger.

One often-overlooked detail: how long a plane spends taxiing on the ground. That process can at times account for as much as 20% of a flight’s total emissions.

Cirium's ranking lists airlines that are moving to newer generation aircraft.

Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions Not Accounted For

However, the ranking does not account for total greenhouse gas emissions or the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which the industry says could cut a flight’s carbon footprint by up to 80%.

Wizz Air, for example, is still one of Europe’s most polluting airlines. It’s also among the fastest-growing, with over 70 new planes on order.

Since 2019, Wizz Air’s total emissions have nearly doubled, from 3,734,556 tonnes in 2019 to 7,962,308 tonnes in 2024, according to a report from Transport and Environment and the airline’s own sustainability data.

Yvonne Moynihan, the group’s ESG officer, previously told Skift that the rise in emissions is linked to the airline’s rapid growth under its “WIZZ500” strategy, which aims to double the fleet by 2033.

“This growth contributes to higher overall emissions,” she said. “But we emphasize carbon intensity per passenger-kilometer as a more relevant metric for assessing environmental impact.”

Moynihan acknowledged that reducing emissions while expanding is a significant challenge and that deeper cuts will depend on scaling up SAF, which is still barely used across the industry.

“We are actively pursuing fleet renewal and operational efficiency,” she said. “But broader reforms are needed across the industry to ensure success.”

Cirium excluded SAF from its 2024 analysis because it currently makes up just 0.53% of global aviation fuel use.

“SAF still emits CO₂,” said Jeremy Bowen, CEO of Cirium. “But today it makes up a very small fraction of fuel use. In the future, if SAF use ramps up, it will be taken into account.”

How Airlines Ranked

Cirium ranked airlines by CO₂ emissions per seat per kilometer in grams.

Here are the top performers:

Wizz Air: 53.9 grams of CO₂ per seat per kilometer

Fueling the Bioeconomy: Clean Energy Policies Driving Biotechnology Innovation

07.02.25 | 13 min read | Text by Nazish Jeffery & Addy Smith & Andy Gordon

The transition to a clean energy future and diversified sources of energy requires a fundamental shift in how we produce and consume energy across all sectors of the U.S. economy. The transportation sector, a sector that heavily relies on fossil-based energy, stands out not only because it is the sector that releases the most carbon into the atmosphere, but also for its progress in adopting next-generation technologies when it comes to new technologies and fuel alternatives.

Over the past several years, the federal government has made concerted efforts to support clean energy innovation in transportation, both for on-road and off-road. Particularly, in hard-to-electrify transportation sub-sectors, there has been added focus such as through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge. These efforts have enabled a wave of biotechnology-driven solutions to move from research labs to commercial markets, such as LanzaJets alcohol-to-jet technology in producing SAF. From renewable fuels to bio-based feedstocks, biotechnologies are enabling the replacement of fossil-derived energy sources and contributing to a more sustainable, secure, and diversified energy system.

SAF in particular has gained traction, enabled in part by public investment and interagency coordination, like the SAF Grand Challenge Roadmap. This increased federal attention demonstrated how strategic federal action, paired with demand signals from government, targeted incentives, and industry buy-in, can create the conditions needed to accelerate biotechnology adoption.

To better understand the factors driving this progress, FAS conducted a landscape analysis at the federal and regional level of biotechnology innovation within the clean energy sector, complemented by interviews with key stakeholders. Several policy mechanisms, public-private partnerships, and investment strategies were identified that were enablers of advanced SAF adoption and production and similar technologies. By identifying the enabling conditions that supported biotechnology’s uptake and commercialization, we aim to inform future efforts on how to accelerate other sectors that utilize biotechnologies and overall, strengthen the U.S. bioeconomy.

Key Findings & Recommendations

An analysis of the federal clean energy landscape reveals several critical insights that are vital for advancing the development and deployment of biotechnologies. Federal and regional strategies are central to driving innovation and facilitating the transition of biotechnologies from research to commercialization. The following key findings and actionable recommendations address the challenges and opportunities in accelerating this transition.

Federal Level Key Findings & Recommendations

The federal government plays a pivotal role in guiding market signals and investment toward national priorities. In the clean energy sector, decarbonizing aviation has emerged as a strategic objective, with SAF serving as a critical lever. Federal initiatives such as the SAF Grand Challenge, the SAF Roadmap, and the SAF Metrics Dashboard have helped to elevate SAF within national climate priorities and enabled greater interagency coordination. These mechanisms not only track progress but also communicate federal commitment. Still, despite these efforts, current SAF production remains far below target levels, with capacity largely concentrated in HEFA, a pathway with constrained feedstock availability and limited scalability.

This production gap reflects deeper structural challenges, many of which parallel broader issues across the clean-energy biotech interface. One of the main challenges is the fragmented, short-duration policy incentives currently in use. Tax credits like 40B and 45Z, while important, lack the longevity and clarity required to unlock large-scale, long-term private investment. The absence of binding fuel mandates further undermines market certainty. These policy gaps limit the ability of the clean energy sector to serve as a sustained demand signal for emerging biotechnologies and slow the transition from pilot to commercial scale.

Importantly, these challenges point to a broader opportunity: SAF as a test case for how the clean energy sector can serve as a driver of biotechnology uptake. Promising biotechnologies, such as alcohol-to-jet and power-to-liquid, are currently stalled by high capital costs, uncertain regulatory pathways, and a lack of coordinated federal support. Addressing these bottlenecks through aligned incentives, technology-neutral mandates, and harmonized accounting frameworks could not only accelerate SAF deployment but also establish a broader policy blueprint for scaling biotechnology across other clean energy applications.

To alleviate some of the challenges identified, the federal government should:

Extend & Clarify Incentives

While tax incentives such as the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit offer a promising framework to accelerate low-carbon fuel deployment, current design and implementation challenges limit their impact, particularly for emerging bio-based and synthetic fuels. To fully unlock the climate and market potential of these incentives, Congress and relevant agencies should take the following steps:

Congress should amend the 45Z tax credit structure to differentiate between fuel types, such as SAF, e-fuels, biofuels, and renewable diesel, based on life cycle CI and production pathways. This would better reflect technology-specific costs and accelerate deployment across multiple clean fuel markets, adding specificity as to how to utilize and earn the credits based on the type of fuel.

Congress should extend the duration of the 45Z credit and other clean-fuel related incentives to provide long-term policy certainty. Multi-year extensions with a defined minimum value floor would reduce investment risk and enable financing of capital-intensive projects.

Congress and the Department of Treasury should clarify eligibility to ensure inclusion of co-processing methods and hybrid production systems, which are currently in regulatory gray areas. This would ensure broader participation by innovative fuel producers.

Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Defense, should be directed to enter into long-term (more than 10 years) procurement agreements for low-carbon fuels, including electrofuels and SAF. These offtake mechanisms would complement tax incentives and send strong market signals to producers and investors.

Scale Biotech Commercialization Support

The clean energy transition depends in part on the successful commercialization of enabling biotechnologies, ranging from advanced biofuels to bio-based carbon capture, SAF and biomanufacturing platforms that reduce industrial emissions. Recent or proposed funding cuts to clean energy programs risk stalling this progress and undermining U.S. competitiveness in the bioeconomy.

To accelerate biotechnology deployment and bridge the gap between lab-scale innovation and commercial-scale production, Congress should take the following actions:

Authorize and appropriate expanded funding to the DOE, particularly through Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to support pilot, demonstration, and first-of-a-kind commercial scale projects that enable biotechnology applications across clean energy sectors.

Direct and fund the DOE Loan Programs Office to establish a dedicated loan guarantee program focused on biotechnology commercialization, targeting platforms that can be integrated into the energy system, such as bio-based fuels, bioproducts, carbon utilization technologies, and electrification-enabling materials.

Encourage DOE and USDA to enter into long-term offtake agreements or structured purchasing mechanisms with qualified bioenergy and biomanufacturing companies. These agreements would help de-risk early commercial projects, crowd in private investment, and provide market certainty during the critical scale-up phase.

Strengthen public-private coordination mechanisms, such as cross-sector working groups or interagency task forces, to align commercialization support with industry needs, improve program targeting, and reduce time-to-market for promising technologies.

Design and Promote Next-Gen Biofuel Policies

To accelerate the deployment of low-carbon fuels and enable innovation in next-generation bioenergy technologies, Congress and relevant agencies should take the following actions:

Congress should direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to modernize the Renewable Fuel Standard by incorporating life cycle carbon intensity as a core metric, moving beyond volume-based mandates. Legislative authority could also support the development of a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard, modeled on successful state-level programs to drive demand for fuels with demonstrable climate benefits.

EPA should update its emissions accounting framework to reflect the latest science on life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enabling more accurate assessment of advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels.

DOE should expand R&D and demonstration funding for biofuel pathways that meet stringent carbon performance thresholds, with an emphasis on scalability and compatibility.

Regional Level Key Findings & Recommendations

Regional strengths continue to serve as foundational drivers of clean energy innovation, with localized assets shaping the pace and direction of technology development. Federal designations, such as the Economic Development Administration (EDA) Tech Hub program (Tech Hub), have proven catalytic. These initiatives enable regions to unlock state-level co-investment, attract private capital, and align workforce training programs with local industry needs. Early signs suggest that the Tech Hub framework is helping to seed innovation ecosystems where they are most needed, but long-term impact will depend on sustained funding support and continued regional coordination.

Workforce readiness and enabling infrastructure remain critical differentiators. Regions with deep and committed involvement from major research universities, national labs, or advanced manufacturing clusters are better positioned to scale innovation from prototype to deployment. Real-world testbeds provide environments for stress-testing technologies and accelerating regulatory and market readiness, reinforcing the importance of place-based strategies in federal innovation planning.

At the same time, private investment in clean energy and enabling biotechnologies remains crucial to developing and scaling innovative technologies. High capital costs, regulatory uncertainty, and limited early-stage demand signals continue to inhibit market entry, especially in geographies with less mature innovation ecosystems. Addressing these barriers through coordinated federal procurement, long-term incentives, and regional capacity-building will be essential to supporting growth in regions with strong assets to develop industry clusters that could yield clean energy benefits.

To accomplish this, the federal government and regional governments should:

Strengthen Regional Workforce Pipelines

A skilled and regionally distributed workforce is essential to realizing the full economic and technological potential of clean energy investments, particularly as they intersect with the bioeconomy. While federal funding is accelerating deployment through initiatives such as the IRA and DOE programs, workforce gaps, especially outside major innovation hubs, pose barriers to implementation. Addressing these gaps through targeted education, training, and talent retention efforts will be critical to ensuring that clean energy projects deliver durable, regionally inclusive economic growth. To this end:

Federal agencies like the Department of Education and National Science Foundation should explore expanding support for STEM programs at community colleges and Minority Serving Institutions, with a focus on biosciences, engineering, and agricultural technologies relevant to the clean energy transition.

Federally supported training and reskilling programs tailored to regional clean energy and biomanufacturing workforce needs could benefit new and existing cross-sector partnerships between state workforce agencies and regional employers.

State and local governments should consider implementing talent retention strategies, including local hiring incentives, relocation support, and career placement services, to ensure that skilled workers remain in and contribute to regional clean energy ecosystems.

Strengthen Regional Infrastructure and Foster Cross-Sector Collaboration

Robust regional infrastructure and cross-sector collaboration are essential to accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies that leverage advancements in biotechnology and manufacturing. Strategic investments in shared facilities, modernized logistics, and coordinated innovation ecosystems will strengthen supply chain resilience and improve technology transfer across sectors. Facilitating access to R&D infrastructure, particularly for small and mid-sized enterprises, will ensure that innovation is not limited to large firms or major metropolitan areas. To support these outcomes:

Federal support for regional testbeds, prototyping sites, and grid modernization labs, coordinated by agencies such as DOE and EDA, would support the demonstration and scaling of biologically enabled clean energy technologies.

State and local governments, in coordination with federal agencies including DOT and DOC, explore investment in logistics infrastructure to enhance supply chain reliability and support distributed manufacturing.

States should consider creating or expanding the use of innovation voucher programs that allow small and mid-sized enterprises to access national lab facilities, pilot-scale infrastructure, and technical expertise, fostering cross-sector collaboration between clean energy, biotech, and advanced manufacturing firms.

Attract and De-Risk Private Capital

Attracting and de-risking private capital is critical for scaling clean energy and biotechnology innovations. By offering targeted financial mechanisms and leveraging federal visibility, governments can reduce the financial uncertainties that often deter private investment. Effective strategies, such as state-backed loan guarantees and co-investment models, can help bridge funding gaps while strategic partnerships with philanthropic and venture capital entities can unlock additional resources for emerging technologies. To this end:

State governments, in collaboration with the federal agencies such as DOE and Treasury, should consider implementing state-backed loan guarantees and co-investment models to attract private capital into high-risk clean energy and biotech projects.

Federal agencies like EDA, DOE, and the SBA should explore additional programs and partnerships to attract philanthropic and venture capital to emerging clean energy technologies, particularly in underserved regions.

Federal agencies should increase efforts to facilitate connecting early-stage companies with potential investors, using federal initiatives to build investor confidence and reduce perceived risks in the clean energy sector.

Cross-Cutting Key Findings

The successful deployment of federal clean energy and biotechnology initiatives, such as the SAF Grand Challenge, relies heavily on the capacity of regional ecosystems and the private sector to absorb and implement national goals. Many regions, particularly those outside established innovation hubs, lack the infrastructure, resources, and technical expertise to effectively utilize federal funding. As a result, the impact of national policies is often limited, and the full potential of federal investments goes unrealized in certain areas.

Federal programs often take a one-size-fits-all approach, overlooking regional variability in feedstocks, industrial bases and cost structures. Programs like tax credits and life cycle analysis models can unintentionally disadvantage regions with different economic contexts, creating disparities in access to federal incentives. This lack of regional customization prevents certain areas from fully benefiting from national clean energy and biotech initiatives.

The diffusion of innovation in clean energy and biotechnology remains concentrated in a few key regions, leaving others underutilized. Despite robust federal R&D investments, commercialization and scaling of innovations are primarily concentrated in regions with established infrastructure, hindering the broader geographic spread of these technologies. In addition, workforce development efforts across federal and regional programs are fragmented, creating misalignments in talent pipelines and further limiting the ability of local industries to leverage available resources effectively. The absence of a unified system for tracking key metrics, such as SAF production and emissions reductions, makes it difficult to coordinate efforts or assess progress consistently across regions. To address this, the federal and regional governments should:

Create a Federal–Regional Clean Energy Deployment Compact

A Federal-Regional Clean Energy Deployment Compact is critical for aligning federal clean energy initiatives with the unique capabilities and needs of regional ecosystems. By establishing formal mechanisms, such as intergovernmental councils and regional liaisons, federal programs can be more effectively tailored to local conditions. These mechanisms will ensure two-way communication between federal agencies and regional stakeholders, fostering a collaborative approach that adapts to evolving technological, economic, and environmental conditions. In addition, treating regional tech hubs and initiatives as testbeds for new policy tools, such as performance-based incentives or carbon standards, will allow for innovative solutions to be tested locally before scaling them nationally, ensuring that policies are effective and contextually relevant across diverse regions. To this end:

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in collaboration with the DOE and EPA, should establish formal intergovernmental councils or regional liaisons to facilitate ongoing dialogue between federal agencies and regional stakeholders. These councils would focus on aligning federal clean energy initiatives with regional needs, ensuring that local priorities, such as feedstock availability or infrastructure readiness, are considered in policy design.

The DOE and EPA should treat tech hubs and regional clean energy initiatives as testbeds for policy innovation. These regions can pilot performance-based incentives, carbon standards, and other policy tools to assess their effectiveness before scaling them nationally. Successful models developed in these testbeds should be expanded to other regions, with lessons learned shared across state and local governments.

Regional universities and innovation hubs should collaborate with federal and state agencies to develop pilot programs that test new policy tools and technologies. These institutions can serve as incubators for innovative clean energy solutions, providing valuable data on what policies work best in specific regional contexts.

Build a National Innovation-to-Deployment Pipeline

Creating a seamless innovation-to-deployment pipeline is essential for scaling clean energy technologies and ensuring that regional ecosystems can fully participate in national clean energy transitions. By linking DOE national labs, Tech Hubs, and regional consortia into a coordinated network, the U.S. can support the full life cycle of innovation, from early-stage R&D to commercialization and deployment, across diverse geographies. Additionally, co-developing curricula and training programs between federal agencies, regional tech hubs, and industry partners will ensure that talent pipelines are closely aligned with the evolving needs of the clean energy sector, providing the skilled workforce necessary to implement and scale innovations effectively. To accomplish this the:

DOE should facilitate the creation of a national network that connects federal labs, regional tech hubs and innovation consortia. This network would provide a clear pathway for the transition of technologies from research to commercialization, ensuring that innovations can be deployed across different regions based on local needs and capacities.

Regional Tech Hubs, in partnership with local universities and research institutions, should be integrated into the pipeline to provide localized innovation support and commercialization expertise. These hubs can act as nodes in the broader network, offering the infrastructure and expertise necessary for scaling up clean energy technologies.

Develop a Shared Metrics and Monitoring Platform

A centralized dashboard for tracking key metrics related to clean energy and biotechnology initiatives is crucial for guiding investment and policy decisions. By integrating federal and regional data can provide a comprehensive, real-time view of progress across the country. This shared platform would enable better coordination among federal, state, and local agencies, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that policy decisions are informed by accurate, up-to-date data. Moreover, a unified system would allow for more effective tracking of regional performance, enabling tailored solutions and based on localized needs and challenges. To this end:

The DOE, in partnership with the EPA, should lead the development of a centralized dashboard that integrates existing federal and regional data on SAF production, emissions reductions, workforce needs, and infrastructure gaps. This platform should be publicly accessible, allowing stakeholders at all levels to monitor progress and identify opportunities for improvement.

State and local governments should contribute relevant data from regional initiatives, including workforce training programs, infrastructure development projects, and emissions reductions efforts. These contributions would help ensure that the platform reflects the full range of activities across different regions, providing a more accurate picture of national progress.

The Department of Labor and the DOC should integrate workforce development and industrial capacity data into the platform. This would include information on training programs, regional workforce readiness, and skills gaps, helping policymakers align talent development efforts with regional needs.

The DOT should ensure that transportation infrastructure data, particularly related to SAF production and distribution networks, is included in the platform. This would provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain and infrastructure readiness necessary to scale clean energy technologies across regions.

The clean energy sector, and specifically SAF, highlights both the promise and the persistent challenges of scaling biotechnologies, reflecting broader issues, such as fragmented regulation, limited commercialization support, and misaligned incentives that hinder the deployment of advanced biotechnologies. Overcoming these systemic barriers requires coordinated, long-term policies including performance-based incentives, and procurement mechanisms that reduce investment risk and free up capital. SAF should be seen not as a standalone initiative but as a model for integrating biotechnology into industrial and energy strategy, supported by a robust innovation pipeline, expanded infrastructure, and shared metrics to guide progress. With sustained federal leadership and strategic alignment, the bioeconomy can become a key pillar of a low-carbon, resilient energy future.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0702-bioeconomy-blog.png,N,,2025-07-02 12:23:16.840572

The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.
The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market.

The cheapest available low carbon shipping fuels are the previously mentioned hydrogenated vegetable oils, termed HVO in shipping circles.
Grid batteries and ship batteries have remarkably similar requirements and constraints, so what grid batteries cost is going to be what ship batteries cost.
Whatever biomethanol costs, aviation will pay more than that for biokerosene.
So this is the mea culpa: I was wrong in thinking that biomethanol would not be the shipping fuel of the future.","For the past week I’ve been working with a team of deep and broad experts in decarbonization in the Netherlands. The transmission system operator TenneT invited me and other experts to assist them with their Target scenario for 2050 to enable them to plan for transmission upgrades and space requirements in a country where land is so precious that they make their own, building entire provinces from sea beds, dykes, and massive pumps.

The TenneT core team were deep and broad in their own ways. Emiel van Druten, who led the charge on scenario planning, with a decade of modeling background in energy across Dutch economy, has a sharp-eyed view on where the football will be. Emmanuel van Ruitenbeek brought aerospace engineering, a masters in sustainability, and a decade of European energy trading to the table. Tim Gaßmann brought power engineering and a decade of energy planning to the room, along with a deep understanding of how the core scenario tool, the Energy Transition Model, and related external dashboard hang together.

A brief shoutout to the Energy Transition Model (ETM). This free, browser-based toolkit from Amsterdam’s Quintel puts you in the driver’s seat, letting you build future energy systems with a dizzying array of sliders, around 300 by the last count. Want to see what happens if your region doubles down on heat pumps or scraps coal by 2050? Just tweak the supply and demand bars and watch as charts, emissions figures, and costs update in real time. It’s transparent, open-source, and refreshingly honest, with no hidden assumptions, no techno-liturgical claptrap. Every European country is baselined in it, but seemingly no non-European countries at this time. That should change. The TenneT team and the larger national scenario modeling team have been using ETM for years, and I was deeply impressed with it and that they were so familiar with the levers to pull as we explored options.

The external expert team was diverse. Professor Heleen de Coninck is a Dutch climate scientist and professor specializing in technology, innovation, and societal change for decarbonization. She is widely respected for her authoritative role as Coordinating Lead Author for the IPCC’s landmark Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. De Coninck’s research critically examines the intersection of climate policy, carbon capture, renewable energy systems, and sustainable innovation. Her insights are frequently sought by policymakers and academia for nuanced analysis of how technology choices shape climate outcomes and social equity. Currently, she is a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology, guiding research and dialogue on actionable pathways toward deep decarbonization. She held our feet to the fire on negative emissions pathways, something we actually found.

Reinier Grimbergen is a prominent Dutch expert on industrial transformation and sustainability, who served as Principal Consultant at TNO, the Netherlands’ leading applied research institute. With a PhD in solid-state chemistry from Radboud University, Grimbergen spent nearly two decades at DSM, driving innovation strategy, corporate sustainability, and R&D leadership. His current work focuses on electrification, renewable feedstocks, and circularity within Europe’s heavy industrial sectors, particularly chemicals and materials. Grimbergen is deeply involved in shaping Europe’s Green Deal initiatives and industry-wide collaboration through platforms such as VoltaChem and Brightsite. His insights into the chemical industry in the Netherlands were key to our approach.

Last but not least of the external experts was Paul Martin, a Canadian chemical engineer with over three decades of experience in hydrogen, syngas, and industrial process development, with dozens of projects developing modular chemical processing plants of all types. As founder of Spitfire Research, he combines hands‑on expertise in designing and scaling pilot‑to‑commercial plants with a keen no‑nonsense approach to decarbonization. A co‑founder of the Hydrogen Science Coalition, Martin is a trusted contrarian voice in the energy transition, questioning hydrogen “hopium” and advocating for practical, efficiency‑first solutions.

The TenneT team included numerous others who came and went from the different sessions, bringing insights or listening to the evolving solution. I was deeply impressed with the insights and strategic clarity of the organization. From the TenneT Board downward throughout the organization, the Target scenario I and the other external experts assisted with is central to their strategic planning, and the priority they have given to it is a key takeaway for other organizations.

The overall Netherlands’ process is equally admirable, although with shortcomings. Nothing is perfect, but that they have a 2050 scenario planning exercise playing out that includes all energy and power sectors, all utilities, all industrial sectors and most major corporations operating in the country is extraordinary. The final results are an excellent set of scenarios that bound the solution space.

However, the high-electrification scenario had systemic challenges which TenneT needed to overcome. The external experts were asked to provide their insights and opinions on a series of specific and broad points to identify a more likely scenario, and overcome inconsistencies that the process had inserted. A PESTEL analysis had identified multiple high, median and low options, and the process ensured that each potential extreme was represented in at least one of the four scenarios. The Target scenario needed to be cleansed of unlikely extremes, for example the persistence of 60% of fossil fuel refining in the country.

And now we start to get to the mea culpa and the good news that comes along with it. The Netherlands is the refinery for Europe, with very large crude carriers steaming into its major ports to feed its five massive refineries. While ground transportation had broad agreement in the high electrification scenario as almost entirely electrified, with a mere 10% of heavy goods vehicles running on hydrogen to eliminate, the core question of aviation and shipping energy remained.

I’ve been looking at the question of demand for years, with projections of both maritime shipping and aviation volumes through 2100 in the public domain, along with innumerable analyses of the pathways to decarbonization. My broad opinion remains unchanged, in that it will still be batteries and biofuels powering the ships and planes of the future. As always with my projections, I don’t claim to be right, just less wrong than most, and when I find out I’m wrong about something, I massage my perspective, not the facts. Case in point: this article.

Aviation will electrify far more than most think, with battery hybrid turboprops carrying 100 passengers flying 1,000 km routes, divert and reserve provided by biokerosene. Those flights will be cheaper than current flights because operations and maintenance of simple electric drive trains with many fewer moving parts powered by high-efficiency and cheap electrons will be cheaper. Long-haul flights will be more expensive, quite a bit more expensive, as airlines add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) surcharges to ticket prices. The combination will be a reduction in long-haul flights and an increase in vacationers traveling more locally, simply because a lot more people will be able to afford 1,000 km electric flights than 4,000 km SAF-powered flights for their families.

But those long-haul flights need kerosene, and a lot of it. The cheapest way to make kerosene that doesn’t include fossil fuels is from vegetable oils that are hydrogenated, with about 36 kilograms of hydrogen as a chemical feedstock per ton of end fuel. This is starting to get to the nub of what I got wrong.

The same vegetable oils can be processed differently to create diesel-equivalent fuels for ships, and are in large tonnages today. My assumption was that with the lower overall shipping demand, they would compete with aviation for those fuels, and would be powered by them.

The lower shipping demand is due to 40% of total tonnages being fossil fuels, a set that will decline radically with decarbonization in the coming decades, and a general economic shift to more local processing due to higher shipping costs. Only the lightest, sweetest crudes will be in tankers, and they will be steaming to electrified petrochemical refineries, not refineries set up to make diesel, kerosene and gasoline. I and the other experts agreed that burning fossil hydrocarbons makes no sense in a decarbonized future, but that the best source of the durable, non-burning products we make from fossil hydrocarbons today is fossil hydrocarbons in the future.

Another 15% of total tonnage is raw iron ore, steaming to the same ports the bulk coal carriers are berthing at. As I noted recently with my update to global iron and steel demand, China makes and uses half of all steel in the world, and half of that goes into buildings. With China’s infrastructure and building boom over, and the country shifting into maintenance and replacement mode, their steel production and demand is necessarily declining. The rest of the developing world will not create a market as large as the last few decades in the Middle Kingdom, so global production will decline.

Further, the economics of making iron are shifting radically, with different low-carbon technologies having bigger and smaller niches. The world will shift to America’s 70% plus supply from electric arc furnaces fed with scrap. The much smaller new steel requirements, in the range of 400 million tons a year, will be met by combinations of biomethane direct reduction with electrified process heat where biomethane is plentiful and ore grades are high, molten oxide electrolysis which requires only iron ore and electricity where ore grades are poorer and renewable resources are massive and without competition, and finally flash iron making where biomethane resources are high and ore grades are low.

While a couple of these have low technology readiness levels, I’m comfortable that they are more likely than green hydrogen direct reduction of iron, as I published recently., simply because hydrogen can be green, but it can’t be cheap and the same environmental and economic drivers that make it not viable as a ground transportation fuel — or indeed a fuel of any kind — make it uneconomic for new steel. The same illusions of cheap green hydrogen that powered the past decade of policy missteps and transportation failures also powered the illusion that green iron made with hydrogen would be cheap. Virtually all iron and steel manufacturers are backing away from hydrogen direct reduction, something that also requires high-grade ores, because it has become clear that the economics make absolutely zero sense.

The important part for the maritime shipping question is that the much smaller amounts of new iron will mostly be made much nearer to iron mines where there is an abundance of either biomass or renewable electricity resource with limited competition, and only the iron will be shipped. Iron is half the mass of the iron ore it comes from, and less iron will be required, so the 15% of shipping of raw iron ore will decline substantially as well.

So overall shipping tonnages, especially transoceanic, will decline. There is no world in which the minority tonnages of container shipping will grow to fill the void left by perhaps 50% of tonnage going away, especially in a world with more expensive shipping fuels. As a reminder, the best number I have is that 11% of fossil fuels are used to extract, process, refine and distribute fossil fuels, so the total amount of energy and remaining hydrocarbons for petrochemicals is smaller than most realize.

There’s another lever that’s important in this regard, electrification. I’ve been bullish on batteries for vessels for a long time, and I keep being proven right. My assertion for years has been that all inland shipping and most short sea shipping would simply electrify. I updated that in the past year or so with the expectation of hybridized transoceanic vessels, with all navigation within 200 km of land being on batteries. That too reduces fuel demand.

Shipping fuels will be more expensive, where electrons can’t be used. The cheapest available low carbon shipping fuels are the previously mentioned hydrogenated vegetable oils, termed HVO in shipping circles. They are currently 2-3 times the cost of the very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) which currently is bunkered for large ships. The next cheapest is biologically sourced methanol, which has only 45% of the energy density of VLSFO, so on a cost per unit of energy are more expensive than HVO.

While having some flaws, the basic insights of the 2022 Nature paper by Kersey et al out of Berkeley Lab in the USA remain valid. Mass and weight of batteries aren’t limiting factors for shipping, the cost per kWh of energy is. While the numbers aren’t perfect, they found that at $100 / kWh, trips of 1,500 km broken even economically. At $50 / kWh, 3,000 km routes would electrify because it was cheaper.

China’s latest energy storage auction saw the $51 / kWh as the average bid for four hour LFP battery energy storage systems. That’s all components and systems in the full battery system, deployed, operated and maintained for a couple of decades. Grid batteries and ship batteries have remarkably similar requirements and constraints, so what grid batteries cost is going to be what ship batteries cost. This isn’t the end of the reductions in BESS costs. It’s going to get close to the cost of materials, but that means substitutability as well. China continues to invest in sodium ion batteries despite them not currently being cost competitive with LFP.

As with aviation and road transport, the simplicity and efficiency of battery electric drive trains will turn directly into cost reductions that shipping operators will exploit and lean into. 70% of all ferry orders today are have electric drive trains, and where they are hybrid there are usually plans to fully electrify. The largest ferries in the world, capable of carrying thousands of passengers and hundreds of cars, are now on order with fully electric drive trains. There are 700 unit container ships plying 1,000 km routes on the Yangtze, winching discharge containerized batteries off and charged containers of batteries on in ports along the route. An 850 unit container ship, fully electrified, is on order in northern Europe. Tug boats, tenders and lighters are all electrifying.

But back to molecultes. If all else were equal, and I mistakenly thought all else was equal, ship operators would buy the cheapest fuel and bunker HVO. This had the significant advantage of requiring no changes for ports, with blends in existing tanks and the same pumps and hoses being reusable with no modifications. Procurement and monitoring would be required, but those are minimal compared to alternatives like methanol, where a complete set of new bunkering infrastructure would be required and no blending would be possible.

However, there are reasonable limits to the amount of vegetable oils that can be procured to make HVO, and the same vegetable oils are the cheapest pathway to biokerosene, the winning sustainable aviation fuel. And crucially, while ships can burn almost literally anything, jets absolutely require kerosene.

Further, aviation is a much higher margin business than shipping, and fuel is only 19% of the average carrier’s operational expenses. The lack of substitutability of the molecules in kerosene for jet engines, the availability of the vegetable oil to jet fuel pathway, and the much higher cost of alternative pathways to jet fuel such as ethanol to jet means that the aviation industry will pay more for the available vegetable oil to heavy fuel than the shipping industry will be willing to pay.

The aviation industry will consistently bid up the price of vegetable oil for SAF over the price of alternatives available to the shipping industry like biomethanol. The shipping industry won’t get the cheap HVO because the aviation industry will bid it up above the cost of the more expensive to make biomethanol. Whatever biomethanol costs, aviation will pay more than that for biokerosene. Effectively, the cost of biomethanol is the low end of aviation fuel costs.

Currently biomethanol is coming in from $1,000 to $1,500 per ton, or $2,200 to $3,300 for the same energy as in a ton of HVO, a price expected to come down a bit as volumes increase, but not to fossil fuel levels. A ton of HVO meanwhile, cost an average of $1,600 per ton and a ton of VLSFO costs $500 to $650 per ton. Yes, shipping fuels are going to get a lot more expensive, four to six times as expensive, but so are aviation fuels, which see similar ratios and as noted will bid the HVO equivalent up above the biomethanol price point. The International Maritime Organization’s recent decision to put carbon pricing on fuels will ensure that they pay the price or get out of the shipping business.

Of course, hydrogen-based synthetic fuels are completely out of the running. In the best possible case scenario they are more expensive than biofuels, and so while some will undoubtedly be made in some cases to fill gaps in the market, they won’t be more than a few percent.

That merit order of competition drove a lot of discussions. Paul Martin was integral to this, shaped by his decades prototyping chemical processing plants where feedstocks had key trade offs. I’m indebted to him for this clarity, as I knew we disagreed on HVO vs biomethanol for shipping, but we hadn’t found time to discuss it at length and arrive at a conclusion, at least on my part.

I said there was good news with this. The biggest piece of good news is that the global shipping industry paid absolutely no attention to my opinion that methanol wasn’t the end fuel choice. 14% of new ship orders are dual-fuel with methanol this year. 30% are dual-fuel with LNG, which is a dead end due to methane slippage and supply chain leakage making it usually higher carbon than VLSFO. There is still confusion in the space, to which I inadvertently contributed.

The other piece of good news from my perspective is that with high biomethanol prices, plummeting battery costs, increasing energy densities, chemistries with vanishingly small chances of thermal runaway and the increasing proof points of ships running on batteries, hybridization of heavy ships will be triggered sooner rather than later. The transoceanic industry doesn’t appear to have caught on to this, but hybridization means so much cheaper energy costs that the capital costs of batteries will pay for itself rapidly.

Remember the 3,000 km breakeven at $50 per kWh? That was against VLSFO, not biomethanol. Against biomethanol, the breakeven point is a lot further. Electrons are always going to be a lot cheaper per unit of energy than biomethanol. As soon as a ship hybridizes, it’s going to burn every single electron before it burns a single drop of biomethanol.

There are still limits to battery chemistry, but my current assumption has shifted the goalposts substantially. All inland shipping will still electrify, but now I think virtually all short sea shipping will be battery powered, 98% or so. There are some weird, long coastal routes where some methanol will be required, but the end game is virtually all electrons. Everything in inland seas including the Mediterranean will be electric, barring some Suez Canal traffic.

The Canal, and every other major canal globally, becomes an opportunity for electron bunkering. Container ships transiting it are much more likely to winch containers of batteries on and off while they are necessarily stopped en route due to the nature of canals and lock systems. That’s going to maximize electrons as well, with massive wind, solar and battery farms in Egypt charging containerized batteries for the ship trade. At present they are exploring making synthetic methanol, but as noted, that’s going to be priced out of the market, and Egypt’s limited biomass doesn’t make it a good choice for making much biomethanol.

And that 200 km from coastlines I mentioned earlier as the part of ocean journeys that would be running on electrons? It’s going to turn into thousands of kilometers of journeys. My expectation is that trans Atlantic journeys will routinely be fully electric in 2100, and that a full 60% of global shipping energy demand will be battery powered.

That reduces the total energy demand from liquid fuels in my projection to 30 million tons of VLSFO equivalent, or about 60 million tons of biomethanol given the energy density difference. That’s good news for the global methanol industry, although nowhere near their dreams of tripling or quadrupling global demand.

So this is the mea culpa: I was wrong in thinking that biomethanol would not be the shipping fuel of the future. My economic analysis didn’t include merit order competition. The people I’ve spoken to who said that aviation would take the vegetable oils required for both SAF and HVO were right. And I was wrong about the degree of electrification, once again underestimating the plummeting costs of batteries and contrasting with HVO costs, not biomethanol costs.

Liquid fuel demand goes down further. Bulk shipping plummets. Container ships winch containers of charged batteries on board along with cargo. Ports are much quieter, cleaner and healthier. Global trade continues, but the climate change impacts plummet. The world becomes a better place. Those parts of my projection remain unchanged, but the molecules and molecules/electron ratio changes. I can live with that.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-2-2025-10_53_26-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-07-02 12:23:28.661150

This insight comes from Rafael Schwartzman, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regional vice president for Europe, in an interview with domestic media.
Schwartzman emphasised that increasing SAF production is a crucial step toward achieving zero carbon emissions in aviation, noting that SAF can cut carbon emissions by as much as 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.
“We recognise and support Azerbaijan’s efforts to promote SAF, despite current regulatory and commercial obstacles within the country,” Schwartzman said.
“Building stronger partnerships with SAF suppliers and optimising fuel procurement will be vital for Azerbaijan Airlines to stay economically efficient while meeting EU sustainability standards.","Azerbaijan’s abundant energy resources position the country well to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production — a sector expected to see rising global demand in the coming years.

This insight comes from Rafael Schwartzman, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regional vice president for Europe, in an interview with domestic media.

Schwartzman emphasised that increasing SAF production is a crucial step toward achieving zero carbon emissions in aviation, noting that SAF can cut carbon emissions by as much as 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

“Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) flights to Europe will be significantly impacted by the new EU ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a gradual increase in the use of SAF at European airports,” said Schwartzman. “The goal is to reduce emissions by requiring the blending of SAF with conventional fuel, with SAF expected to make up to 70% of total fuel volume by 2050.”

He added that while AZAL has already begun investing in SAF and has joined the ReFuelEU initiative, complying with the new regulations may present operational challenges. These include higher fuel costs and potential supply limitations at European airports.

“We recognise and support Azerbaijan’s efforts to promote SAF, despite current regulatory and commercial obstacles within the country,” Schwartzman said. “Building stronger partnerships with SAF suppliers and optimising fuel procurement will be vital for Azerbaijan Airlines to stay economically efficient while meeting EU sustainability standards. To speed up SAF adoption in Azerbaijan, the country might consider accepting ASTM international standards as an alternative or supplement to the currently used GOST standards.”

Supplier Estancias del Lago (EDL) Syzygy Plasmonics Share","Syzygy Plasmonics, the global leader in electrified biogas-to-SAF technology, today announced the initiation of Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) with Kent for NovaSAF 1, the world’s first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility. The site will serve as a model for scalable, low-cost sustainable aviation fuel production. This company milestone advances Syzygy’s mission to seize the significant global opportunity to profitably convert biogas into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using clean electricity.

Located in Durazno, Uruguay, NovaSAF 1 will produce over 350,000 gallons of ASTM Certified SAF annually, marking a breakthrough in cost-effective, scalable clean fuel. The project is backed by long-term feedstock and site agreements with Estancias del Lago (EDL), one of Uruguay’s largest dairy and agri-energy operations. Permitting and equipment sourcing is ongoing alongside front-end engineering work led by Kent, a world leader in SAF project development and execution.

Powered by Syzygy’s proprietary NovaSAF™ platform, the facility combines the benefits of biogas and Power-to-Liquids (PtL) technologies, leveraging waste as feedstock, eliminating the need for pipelines or costly separation while achieving ultra-low water use and carbon intensity. Syzygy’s electrified pathway can potentially qualify as a RFNBO to meet EU regulations. Unique to NovaSAF™ is the ability to provide these social and carbon benefits at a production cost that is unmatched by traditional SAF alternatives like HEFA, ATJ, or PtL. The result is a clean fuel solution that is not only scalable and sustainable, but also economically viable by delivering Jet-A parity fuel when fully commercialized.

“This is more than just a SAF plant. It’s a new model for biogas economics,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “We’re unlocking a global asset class of underutilized biogas sites and turning them into high-value clean fuel hubs without pipelines, costly gas separation, or subsidy dependence. We believe NovaSAF™ represents one of the few viable pathways to producing SAF at Jet Parity and successfully decarbonizing air travel.”

It aims to empower European companies to efficiently source energy and raw materials.

Today’s launch marks the entry into operation of the first mechanism under the platform, the Hydrogen Mechanism, designed to support the market development of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives (ammonia, methanol, electro-sustainable aviation fuel ‘eSAF’). Stakeholders can now register on the Platform and subscribe to the EU Hydrogen Mechanism. The first round of matching demand and supply is planned for September 2025.

Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen said:

'With the Hydrogen Mechanism launched today, we empower the European industry to seize competitive opportunities while advancing towards greater security of supply and decarbonisation. This is only the beginning of our work under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform, which shows that Europe is not just adapting to the future, it is actively shaping it.'

The Raw Materials Mechanism and the Gas Mechanism will be launched in the coming months.

Background

Hydrogen plays an important role in decarbonising industrial processes and industries for which reducing carbon emissions is both urgent and hard to achieve. Hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia, methanol and certain sustainable aviation fuels are therefore essential to support the EU’s commitment to reach climate neutrality by 2050 and in its objective to become independent from Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027.

The Regulation on the internal markets for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen (EU/2024/1789) mandates the Commission to set up and operate a mechanism under the European Hydrogen Bank to support the market development of hydrogen for a limited duration until the end of 2029.

The Hydrogen Mechanism aims to empower market participants by matching and aggregating demand and supply, help to identify needs related to the development of infrastructure and making it easier to access information on financial solutions.

Torontonians take the lead

On May 25, Toronto hosted the first stop of this year's thrilling Plane Pull for Sight. The event set a new record with more than 2,000 enthusiastic attendees cheering on 46 plane pull teams, including over 500 FedEx participants. This family-friendly spectacle saw teams of up to 20 people pulling a massive 60-ton FedEx 757 cargo plane a distance of 20 feet across the tarmac. Thanks to their collective efforts, Orbis raised more than $200,000, setting a robust pace for the rest of the campaign.

Calgarians show their strength

The excitement continued in Calgary on June 7, where the Plane Pull for Sight once again captured the hearts of spectators and participants alike. With 360 determined individuals, including 200 dedicated FedEx team members, the Calgary event was a resounding success. Over 1,000 attendees watched in awe as teams showcased their strength and commitment to Orbis's mission. By this point, the campaign's total fundraising efforts exceeded $245,000, further supporting initiatives to end avoidable blindness in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

A grand finale in Vancouver

The final leg of the campaign unfolded in Vancouver on June 22, wrapping up with an impressive display of teamwork and community spirit. More than 25 teams, including more than 300 FedEx team members, competed in this friendly contest, bringing the grand total of participants across all three cities to over 1,500.

“A lot of global consumption is going to be underpinned by the mandates in Europe and the United Kingdom,” said Fabricio Cardoso, principal at Argus Consulting.

Both of those regions introduced two per cent SAF mandates in 2025 and will be driving global demand going forward, he said during a recent webinar hosted by the company.

Alfonso Berrocal, business development manager for oil products with Argus, estimates that the European Union and U.K. mandates will generate 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of demand in 2025.

The EU mandate remains at two per cent for the first five years and then moves to six per cent.

The U.K. mandate is more ambitious in the short-term, growing to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.

However, the EU mandate is bigger in the long-term, climbing to 20 per cent by 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Lindsey Liu, senior Argus analyst covering the Chinese biofuel market, said the Asia Pacific region is a bit behind the EU and U.K., but mandates are coming.

Japan is targeting a 10 per cent SAF mandate by 2030.

Singapore will go to one per cent by 2026, rising to three to five per cent by 2030.

Thailand’s is one per cent by 2026, climbing to three per cent by 2030.

India will have a one per cent SAF mandate on international flights by 2027, rising to five per cent by 2030.

China has no national mandate. Instead, it has set a 50,000 tonne SAF target for 2025 that will be met through airport level blend targets for select airlines at key airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengshou and Ningbo.

Indonesia has a 2.5 per cent target for 2030, while Malaysia and South Korea have one per cent targets.

Australia has no planned mandate, but one is likely coming with the re-election of the Labor government in May.

Liu said there are SAF proposals in most of the major markets in the Asia Pacific region, but there is still considerable policy uncertainty, which is leaving producers wary.

“A lack of firm policy support in most countries in the region is slowing development of the sector and causing timelines of many planned projects to be postponed,” she said.

There are close to 50 announced projects in the region, but many are a long way from producing.

Matthew Cope, American biofuel reporter for Argus, said the SAF supply and demand situation is much further behind in North America.

“This market is far less developed than what we’re seeing in Europe and Asia,” he said.

It is a market that will be driven by tax credits rather than mandates.

Producers are still awaiting clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which will pay up to US$1.75 per gallon for SAF.

Cardoso said when it’s all added up, there will be about 15 billion litres of annual global demand by 2030 and 30 billion litres by 2035.

However, there is a big caveat.

“Obviously, any mandate coming from China could have a massive impact on overall demand,” he said.

As it sits, there will be more global capacity than demand until 2035 when demand finally surpasses capacity.

And that is only using projects that are under construction or have achieved a final investment decision.

If you factor in “very provisional” proposed plants that have not secured financing, the capacity far outstrips demand well beyond 2035.

The burning question for many in the agriculture sector is — what feedstock will be used to make the jet fuel?

“We would expect SAF to be coming primarily from UCO (used cooking oil),” said Cardosa.

However, there won’t be enough UCO to supply the sector by the time the EU achieves its 20 per cent mandate by 2035.

A wide assortment of feedstocks will be needed by that time.

KUCHING, July 2: SEDC Energy (SEDCE) is exploring the development of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pilot plant with an initial capacity of 15,000 tonnes per annum (15KTA), utilising Sulzer’s cutting-edge Bioflux technology with a scalable potential to meet the growing regional demand for SAF.

According to a joint media release today, the pilot plant programme marked a major collaboration between Sarawak and Swiss technology leader Sulzer, in positioning the State at the forefront of clean aviation fuel development.

SEDC Energy signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sulzer and Apeiron Bioenergy, with Oiltek expressing support, witnessed by Deputy Minister of Energy and Environmental Sustainability (MEESty) Datuk Dr Hazland Abang Hipni and Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) chairman Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Husain. The ceremony was held in conjunction with MyAero Sustainable Aviation APAC Symposium in Putrajaya.

Sulzer emphasised that the partnership will prioritise two critical enablers for the project’s success—ensuring a steady supply of suitable feedstock and securing SAF offtake agreements before the launch of the plant.

“This initiative reflects Sarawak’s intent to contribute meaningfully to global aviation decarbonisation efforts, while building domestic capability in clean fuel manufacturing,” Sulzer stated.

In further support of this initiative, SEDCE has also partnered with Apeiron Bioenergy, Asia’s largest collector of used cooking oil (UCO), to explore and potentially develop a sustainable UCO collection ecosystem in the region.

This aligns with Sarawak’s circular economy and renewable energy goals, transforming waste into low-carbon SAF.

“Apeiron Bioenergy will work with SEDCE to establish UCO logistics, storage, and traceability systems, leveraging its 17 years of experience in biofuel markets to ensure sustainability and compliance throughout the collection network,” said the Singapore-headquartered company, which operates in 10 countries and has supplied over 1 million metric tons of UCO for biofuel production since 2016.

Oiltek Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Exchange-listed Oiltek International Limited, is also supporting the SAF programme.

With an extensive portfolio in biodiesel and renewable energy projects—including Sarawak’s 600 MTD integrated biodiesel facility in Bintulu—Oiltek brings proven expertise to the SAF pilot plant’s development.

“In collaboration with SAF technology provider Sulzer, we are confident in our ability to make this showcase SAF plant a flagship success in Sarawak,” said Oiltek.

Oiltek, established in 1980, has delivered over 16 biodiesel plants and more than 20 methane biogas capture facilities across 38 countries. It also built a crude POME oil treatment plant in Sarawak that supplies high-quality feedstock to HVO producers in Singapore and Europe.

SEDC Energy chief executive officer (CEO) Robert Hardin highlighted that SAF production requires hydrogen via the hydrogenation process to remove oxygen from feedstocks and convert them into jet fuel.

“Hydrogen is needed in removing oxygen from the feedstock, which will then convert this into jet fuel or in this case, SAF,” he said, noting that the pilot plant complements Sarawak’s broader hydrogen value chain ambitions.

This SAF pilot plant initiative comes amid the global aviation industry’s transition toward low-carbon fuels, driven by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The scheme, which becomes mandatory in 2027, targets 85 per cent coverage of international aviation CO₂ emissions through the participation of major economies such as China, India, and Brazil.

As Sarawak advances its aspiration to become a regional energy hub, the SAF pilot plant project is seen as a strategic step to anchor its presence in the global clean energy value chain and support the aviation sector’s climate goals. — DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAF-PIC-1.jpeg?fit=800%2C548&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-02 12:24:15.689527

The aviation industry is entering a crucial phase in its journey towards climate neutrality. The recent announcement from the International Air Transport Association about the anticipated doubling of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in 2025 is more than a statistical update—it is a signal. While the projected 2 million tonnes of SAF may represent just 0.7 percent of the sector’s total fuel demand, the increase is noteworthy given the slow pace of progress in the last few years.

This milestone, however modest it may appear, holds layered insights into how the ecosystem around aviation is recalibrating. It hints at both momentum and the mountain that remains to be climbed.

Reading the Signals Beyond the Headline

A surface-level reading might focus on how 2 million tonnes of SAF still leave the industry far from its net-zero 2050 target. But a deeper reflection reveals more compelling subtleties:

SAF production is finally moving from pilot scale to commercial relevance: Scaling production even this far is complex, given the regulatory, logistical, and technological challenges in turning waste oils and biomass into reliable jet fuel.

Cost pressure is now a tangible lever for acceleration: The projected $4.4 billion increase in the global fuel bill is steep, but it may also serve as a forcing function. When inefficiencies become expensive, market forces tend to respond faster.

Alignment gaps are clearer than ever: The divergence between energy producers, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines over timelines and deliverables is now in sharper focus, paving the way for strategic interventions and smarter integration.

These insights are vital for industry stakeholders who seek not just to observe sustainability transitions—but to influence them.

The Economic Reality Check

Director General Willie Walsh’s statement underscores a key economic reality. While SAF offers a pathway toward lower lifecycle emissions, its cost relative to conventional jet fuel remains prohibitive. This discrepancy underscores a deeper structural issue: sustainable alternatives are not yet operating on a level economic playing field.

In such contexts, operational strategy becomes just as important as technological innovation. Airlines are already pointing toward delays in more fuel-efficient aircraft deliveries as part of their broader frustration. This underlines the fact that even incremental SAF adoption can become unsustainable unless the upstream and downstream systems evolve in sync.

Converting Struggles Into Strategic Leverage

Challenges around SAF availability and affordability are not mere roadblocks—they are leverage points. By exposing the friction points between ambition and execution, the industry is creating an urgent space for collaborative solutions.

This is precisely where strategic sustainability guidance becomes essential. With multiple moving parts—from biofuel supply chains to certification standards to cross-border emissions regulations—the aviation sector needs more than ambition; it needs interpreters, connectors, and accelerators. Those who can help decode complexity and integrate fragmented efforts will hold the key to unlocking real progress.

A Systems View of Transition

The SAF story is not isolated. It is nested within a larger shift toward circularity, resilience, and environmental accountability across transport systems. The aviation industry’s move towards SAF is a litmus test for how fast other high-emission transport sub-sectors—like maritime and road freight—can mobilize their decarbonization pathways.

As aviation grapples with the difficult trade-offs of green fuel adoption, a broader systems-thinking approach is emerging. The goal is not just to meet targets but to realign entire operational paradigms around sustainability metrics.

What Comes Next Is Pivotal

The doubling of SAF production in 2025 may only mark a beginning, but it is a milestone worthy of strategic reflection. With net-zero 2050 on the horizon, the actions taken in this current decade will define the feasibility of that long-term goal.

Moving forward, the aviation industry—and the transport sector at large—must focus on three critical shifts:

Aligning incentives: Public and private sectors must co-create viable policy instruments that balance risk, reward, and urgency.

Building trust across stakeholders: Transparent communication between energy providers, aircraft OEMs, and operators is vital to avoid bottlenecks.

Operationalizing sustainability roadmaps: Long-term goals must be broken down into achievable short-term actions that are measurable and iterative.

Conclusion: Optimism Rooted in Realism

The International Air Transport Association’s forecast may not deliver headline-grabbing figures, but it does deliver something more enduring—momentum grounded in realism. This is the kind of momentum that invites proactive shaping, not passive waiting.

US Senate votes to soften clean energy tax cuts: Update

Adds details throughout Washington, 1 July (Argus) — The US Senate is giving wind and solar projects slightly more time to qualify for subsidies, as part of a budget bill Republicans passed today that would repeal most of the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act while expanding oil and gas leasing. An updated version of the bill , released shortly before it was passed Tuesday by the Senate in a 51-50 vote, would allow wind and solar projects to continue to qualify for clean electricity tax credits so long as they commence construction within 12 months of the bill's enactment. Republican leaders also dropped a first-time excise tax on wind and solar projects they added to the bill just days ago, as they worked to shore up support from US senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and other moderates that had balked at a more aggressive tax credit phase-out schedule. The Senate-passed bill would still zero out tax credits for wind and solar projects that are not placed into service before the end of 2027 — in line with a draft of the bill released on 28 June — but developers that start construction within 12 months can still qualify for tax credits worth up to 30pc of a project's cost or up to $15/MWh. Renewable energy officials saw that change as an improvement over the initial draft, which could have ended credits for projects already under development. Business Council for Sustainable Energy president Lynn Abramson said the legislation still represents a ""significant step backward"" for the industry. The bill, which passed with US vice president JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote, will now advance to the US House of Representatives for a final vote as soon as Wednesday. House speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said the chamber will ""work quickly"" to pass the bill, although doing so will require near-unanimous support from House Republicans, some of whom have bristled at changes the Senate made to the bill. President Donald Trump said today he wants a final vote by 4 July and urged House Republicans to ignore ""its occasional 'GRANDSTANDERS'"" that have previously held up his legislative agenda. The Senate bill is expected to cut about $560bn of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, according to estimates based on the 28 June version of the bill. But those savings will be dwarfed by other spending in the bill and additional tax cuts that, if enacted, are expected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade, the US Congressional Budget Office said. The bill would repeal a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles purchased after 30 September and zero out all penalties against automakers that fail to meet fuel-economy standards, undermining incentives for automakers to sell electric and hybrid vehicles. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who earlier this year worked alongside Trump on a cost-cutting ""DOGE"" project, said the bill would destroy millions of jobs. ""Utterly insane and destructive,"" Musk said in a social media post on 28 June. ""It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" The Senate softened some of the tax credit cuts the House voted for in May. Clean hydrogen projects would need to start construction by 1 January 2028 to qualify for a tax credit of up to $3/kg, rather than facing a House deadline at the end of 2025. In another change, the bill extends a tax credit for biofuels by two years, until 2029, rather than a four-year extension the Senate initially proposed. The bill would expand federal oil and gas leasing by mandating twice yearly lease sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and regular onshore leases, in addition to slashing royalty rates to the lowest levels in nearly two decades. The bill would also indefinitely delay the collection of a $900/metric tonne fee on methane leaks and reinstate a federal tax deduction for ""intangible"" drilling costs. Another program would provide $171mn to buy crude to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a fraction of the $1.3bn fund that was passed by the House. Republicans initially sought to overhaul permitting through the bill, but the only program that is eligible for the filibuster-proof process used for the bill would allow industry to pay a fee to fast-track environmental reviews. The bill would also cut royalties on coal mined on federal land, provide a tax credit for metallurgical coal, repeal climate-related grant programs from the Inflation Reduction Act, and permanently extend some business tax breaks.

US Senate votes to pass tax, energy bill

Washington, 1 July (Argus) — The Republican-led US Senate narrowly passed a more than $3 trillion bill today that would expand oil and gas leasing, weaken fuel-economy rules, and phase out many of the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. The Senate voted 51-50 to pass a revised version of the massive budget bill, with US vice president JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote. US senators Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) joined Democrats in voting against the bill, which will now advance to the US House of Representatives for a potential final vote by the end of the week. ""The House will work quickly to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill that enacts President Trump's full America First agenda by the Fourth of July,"" House speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said. President Donald Trump has pushed for the enactment of the bill the Independence Day holiday, but suggested today that his non-binding deadline may slip. ""I'd love to do July 4th, but I think it's very hard to do July 4"", he said. Among the difficulties is a House rule meant to provide at least 72 hours to review a bill before starting debate, in addition to a razor-thin Republican majority in the House that could make it challenging for the bill to pass. The Senate bill is expected to save about $560bn over a decade by ending many of the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, but other tax cuts and policies in the bill are expected add more than $3 trillion to the deficit, according to estimates the non-partisan US Joint Committee on Taxation conducted on the bill as drafted on 28 June. The bill would repeal a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles purchased after 30 September and zero out all penalties against automakers that fail to meet fuel-economy standards. The bill would also end tax credits for wind and solar projects that fail to start operations by 2027. As part of a final amendment released today, Republicans said they agreed to remove an excise tax on wind and solar projects they added into the bill just days ago. But the Senate bill softened some of the energy tax credit cuts the House voted to pass in May. Clean hydrogen projects would need to start construction by 1 January 2028 to qualify for a tax credit of up to $3/kg that developers say is critical for the industry's growth, rather than facing a House deadline at the end of 2025. In another recent change, the Senate bill is seeking a two-year extension of a biofuels tax break until 2029, rather than a four-year extension the Senate initially proposed.

Philippines’ ethanol imports to increase: USDA

Singapore, 1 July (Argus) — The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects the Philippines' fuel ethanol market and imports to grow in 2025, but the country's biodiesel outlook remains unclear. The Philippines' fuel ethanol consumption is expected to increase from 797mn litres in 2024 to 840mn l this year, rising in tandem with the USDA's gasoline consumption growth forecast of 5pc for 2025. The Philippines has a 10pc ethanol blending mandate for road fuel, tying ethanol demand to gasoline consumption. Car purchases rose by 9pc in 2024, the USDA said, while investments in the country's public transportation system have yet to yield results. Reflecting the forecast increase in road fuel consumption, the USDA is predicting that fuel-grade ethanol imports will rise by 10pc to 450mnl in 2025. The relatively steep growth in imported fuel-grade ethanol is the result of limited ethanol feedstock in the country, it said. The Philippines prioritises the use of domestic ethanol in road fuel blending. Fuel suppliers can only import ethanol at times of domestic shortages. Domestic ethanol is produced from sugarcane and molasses, but a recent decline in available sugarcane land has supported sugarcane and molasses prices, pushing up the cost of ethanol. This has resulted in a slowdown in ethanol production growth because of narrower margins. The USDA expects domestic ethanol production to increase at a relatively low rate of 2pc on the year in 2025 because of the feedstock limitations. Sugarcane- and molasses-based ethanol have one of the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction rates among commonly used first-generation or crop-based ethanol feedstocks such as corn. The Philippines' mandate does not stipulate a definite GHG reduction requirement, leading to imports of predominately US corn-based ethanol, which is the most competitively priced in the market. The affordability of US corn-based ethanol encourages a higher blend of ethanol in road fuel. The Philippines approved a voluntary E20 programme in June 2024 and the USDA expects to see higher uptake of this blend in the coming year. Biodiesel The USDA is forecasting that the Philippines' biodiesel production will hit 360mn l in 2025 should the country remain at B3. But it may increase by 50pc from 2024 to 400mn l this year should the B4 mandate be implemented. The progress of the country's B4 programme remains uncertain after members of the national biofuel board (NBB) agreed on 29 May to pass a resolution to suspend the B4 and B5 implementation in 2025 and 2026 respectively. The board cited the relatively high price of seaborne coconut oil as a reason to recalibrate the programme. The Philippines uses domestic coconut oil in its biodiesel production, but coconut oil prices have more than doubled from $1,100/t in 2024 to around $3,000/t in 2025, resulting in a halt to reconsider market economics. The country's energy department has yet to issue an official advisory on the suspension of the B4 programme, leaving the market in limbo. Sustainable aviation fuel The Philippines has yet to publish a roadmap for its SAF mandate but has formed a SAF committee under the NBB. The country's flag carrier Philippine Airlines announced a 1pc SAF target for 2026. Another local airline, Cebu Pacific, has started using SAF and signed an agreement with Finish SAF producer Neste in 2023. The Philippines has yet to produce SAF but is evaluating the situation and considering the feasibility of different pathways.

Australia’s NSW to propose new net zero plan in FY26

Sydney, 1 July (Argus) — Australia's New South Wales (NSW) plans to announce a new net zero plan in the July 2025-June 2026 financial year to reach the state's existing 2030 and 2035 emissions reduction targets. This comes on the back of concerns on ongoing progress raised by the Net Zero Commission. The new plan will be developed over the next 12 months, a spokesperson from the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Waster (DCCEEW) told Argus . The plan will include all sectors but will prioritise transport and built environments. NSW's total emissions decreased by only 27pc over 2005-22, according to the Net Zero Commission 2024 annual report released in November 2024. This has been followed by a parliamentary inquiry report released in March 2025. NSW is targeting to cut emissions by 50pc from 2005 levels by 2030 and by 70pc by 2035 , but meeting these targets is not guaranteed and NSW will need to increase and accelerate its efforts to remain on track, the reports said. The new net zero plan is part of a government response to the annual report as well as the parliamentary inquiry report by the Joint Standing Committee on Net Zero Future. NSW also introduced its Energy Security Corporation (ESC), which became fully operational on 1 July, to support decarbonising the state's electricity grid. The ESC is a government-backed investor with A$1bn ($660mn) of seed funding to invest in renewable electricity, large-scale storage and power networks, according to a joint ministerial media release on 1 July. There has been criticism from the energy industry about the lack of a viable transition from coal-fired power to renewable energy, according to the National Electricity Market review . The Net Zero Commission is ""concerned about the risks to the state's targets"" that the resources sector poses. The government is establishing a regional monitoring network for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in response to the commission's concerns. NSW is also reviewing its position on coal mining exploration. The state will reach a 46pc reduction of emissions by 2030 and 62pc by 2035 if it continues to comply with the first stage of its net zero plans, according to the Central Resources of Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data NSW's Net Zero emissions dashboard. The role of biofuels is not specifically outlined but will be part of a Renewable Fuel Strategy to be published in mid-2025, according to the NSW government. The Net Zero Commission expects the transport sector to be the largest emitting sector by 2030.

Valued at approximately US$4 billion (excluding purchase rights), this move supports SAS’ long-term plan to renew its fleet, reduce emissions, and expand its reach across Scandinavia and beyond, according to Embraer.

Deliveries of the aircraft are set to begin in late 2027 and will continue over a four-year period. The E195-E2 jets are expected to play a central role in improving the efficiency and flexibility of SAS’ operations, especially from its hub in Copenhagen, while also strengthening regional and international connections.

SAS President and CEO Anko van der Werff described the order as a “defining moment” for the airline. “The Embraer E195-E2 is a world-class aircraft, combining outstanding performance with excellent fuel efficiency and comfort,” he said. “This aircraft is key to enabling future growth and improved connectivity across Scandinavia and beyond.”

With its size and range, the E195-E2 will complement SAS’ current fleet and enable more frequent flights on key routes at lower operational costs. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s PW1900G engines, which offer notable reductions in fuel consumption, emissions, and noise compared to older models.

The aircraft also supports SAS’ goal of building a more environmentally friendly fleet. It has been successfully tested with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and full certification for SAF use is expected in the future. Currently, it can operate on SAF blends of up to 50%.

Arjan Meijer, President and CEO of Embraer Commercial Aviation, welcomed the partnership. “The E195-E2 is the quietest single-aisle jet available today, with 29% better fuel efficiency and a 62% smaller noise footprint compared to its predecessor,” he said. “This aircraft will support SAS’ growth plans and enhance its operational performance.”

The agreement was supported by Skyworks Holding and marks another key step in SAS’ strategy to modernize its fleet and reduce its environmental impact while providing a better travel experience for passengers. The airline continues to invest in expanding its global and regional network, connecting more cities through smoother and more sustainable operations.

As one of the leading enterprises in the aviation-logistics sector, Vietnam Airlines has pursued a sustainable development strategy over the years. The airline focuses on reducing emissions, modernising its fleet, improving operational processes, and optimising resource use.

It also uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), implementing a carbon control system and investing in a new generation of fuel-efficient fleets.

On May 27, 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated the first commercial flight using SAF from Singapore to Hanoi. Continuing this success, on June 5, on the occasion of World Environment Day, the airline simultaneously operated six domestic flights using SAF.

This is the first time in Vietnam that SAF has been applied simultaneously on both international and domestic flight networks, marking the transition from pilot to practice in sustainable aviation operations.

In addition to focusing on environmental factors, Vietnam Airlines also actively integrates social and governance criteria into all its activities. The airline maintains a policy of remuneration and career development for employees, enhances internal training, promotes gender equality, and ensures the rights of diverse labour groups.

For social responsibility programmes, from community support to blood donations and relief activities, the carrier has maintained its commitment to the community. One of these activities was ""Dream Trip 2025"", which brought memorable experiences to 80 children living in special circumstances in Danang. Dream Trip is a volunteer activity, and a spiritual bridge between the enterprise and the community, inspiring a desire to change the lives of those less fortunate.

To protect the environment and restore the ecosystem, Vietnam Airlines and MoMo launched a forest protection campaign in June 2024. The campaign focuses on restoring 50 hectares of forest in the northwest region to prevent degradation and protect natural resources for future generations.

With drones and air taxis likely to become a prominent feature of our future skies, drone traffic management will be a growing issue.

To avoid drone-on-drone collisions, US research university Virginia Tech has formed the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP), supported by Nasa and the FAA.

MAAP has created a drone traffic management system that enables governments and industry to share data about their flight operations. The aim is that this information will help deconflict drone flights quickly and safely.

John Coggin, MAAP’s associate director, said: “This is a culmination of 10 years of work. The product of this work is that the industry now has a path forward for data-sharing among uncrewed aircraft systems operators, which helps mitigate collision risk between drones.

“Advanced and overlapping drone operations require that companies share data to ensure safety. The industry-governed framework established here helps meet these safety goals and provides a template to scale drone traffic management services in the US and worldwide.”

The traffic management system was put to the test in a real-world scenario for the first time in North Texas during March.

This led to the FAA granting authorisation of drone flights to share the airspace, despite significant operator demand and overlapping drone flight paths.

Chris Rocheleau, FAA administrator, said: “It was a historic first for US aviation. Now we want to move from one-off approvals or exemptions to the predictability of operating by rule for beyond visual line of sight, or BVLOS.

“And when finalised, this rule will provide the UAS [unmanned aircraft system] industry with the regulatory framework it needs.”

MAAP is urging drone operators to undergo an onboarding process to enable them to use this traffic management system framework.

Robert Briggs, MAAP’s chief engineer, said: “Unlike previous efforts I’ve been involved in, it’s not a ‘here is your final report’ and the project is done.

“Here, the traffic management systems are operational and can continue to grow and be used as a model for future implementation around the world.”",https://cdn2.eandtmagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-07/web_two-drone-quad-copters-high-resolution_Credit_Goinyk-Production_shutterstock_636131741_1600x900%20%281%29.jpg?itok=UsE-8khD,N,,2025-07-02 05:01:19.195835

The development of Carboverseo was accelerated through a fast-track approach, capitalizing on the combined expertise of all partners. Axens played a key role by contributing its process design and integration know-how, built on its extensive background in the oil and gas industry.

One of the primary obstacles to the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels is their high cost. At present, biofuel-based SAF is priced at two to three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, while eSAF can be six to eight times more expensive. The aviation sector faces intense competition, operates on narrow profit margins, and bears high liability due to strict safety regulations—factors that make integrating these costly alternatives particularly challenging.

At the core of this transformation are federal incentives that signaled a new era of American industrial and energy policy, which the private sector has responded to with a surge of investments across the U.S. These incentives, in the form of tax credits, grants, and loans, seek to position the United States as the global leader in next-generation energy technologies such as advanced renewables, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, advanced nuclear, and enhanced geothermal. Many clean energy related investments are only beginning to materialize into shovels in the ground, but in just under three years since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that created or expanded these energy tax incentives, almost every community in the United States has been impacted by new investment, production, and development.

The future of clean energy tax credits, and broader U.S. energy deployment, hangs in the balance, as the 119th Congress considers rolling back federal support. Recent analysis by Brattle, Energy Innovation, and Rhodium Group find that repealing energy tax credits would have significant consequences for energy costs for both households and manufacturers, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, stifle U.S. industrial competitiveness, and reduce economic growth and GDP.

CATF takes a deeper look into the geography of federal clean energy tax credits to provide a snapshot of where and how these credits are shaping local economies across the United States.

The analysis below indicates that such rollbacks would have disproportionate effects on specific regions of the country, with outsized impacts in Southern and Western states; Republican districts; and historic manufacturing and industrial communities that have been reinvigorated by these investments.

Southern and Western states benefit significantly from clean energy investments

Figure 1. Total reported investments per capita for manufacturing, utility electricity, and industrial facilities under construction or completed between Q2 2022 and Q1 2025 (post-IRA).

From the second half of 2022 through the first quarter of 2025:

Over $321 billion was invested in manufacturing, electricity, and industry projects across the United States, with over 2,000 facilities breaking ground during this period.1

In aggregate, Texas and California have seen the most clean energy related investments, totaling $62.3 billion and $34 billion, respectively, between 2022 and the first quarter of 2025.

Texas has leveraged its diverse energy portfolio and streamlined permitting and approval processes to activate a slew of energy projects across technologies, while California has taken advantage of federal incentives to drive investments towards the state’s evolving energy system.

While Texas and California are the clear winners in the aggregate, analysis on a per capita basis2 reveal that clean energy investments have also significantly benefited other Western and Southern states:

Nevadans on average have received $3,605 from clean energy investments

New Mexicans have gained about $2,095 from clean energy investments

Wyoming registers the highest per capita benefit from clean energy investments at over $6,800

For comparison, the per capita benefits in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are all below $1,000.

Texas, the largest energy consuming state and largest net supplier of energy to other states, has seen over $60 billion in investments on solar, wind, batteries, storage, critical minerals, carbon capture, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal projects across power, manufacturing, transport, and industry sectors. There are currently 130 of these projects under construction and 234 projects in operation, which are already expanding local and nationwide industry capabilities while creating and sustaining thousands of construction, manufacturing, and installation jobs across the state. This surge of investments is only fraction of what Texas should expect to see – the state still has an estimated $128.5 billion in outstanding investments for 250+ more announced projects.

Texas is one of many states with significant project investments in the pipeline. Projections show significant tax credit-induced investments are still outstanding for a number of states like Louisiana, North Dakota, Washington, Virginia, and Oregon. For example, Louisiana has seen $2.8 billion invested in the state since the second half of 2022, only 7% of the total expected project investments to come to the state. North Dakota, Washington, Virginia, and Oregon have yet to receive more than 50% of their expected investments as well.

Job creation spurred by clean energy investments are concentrated in Republican districts

Figure 2. Cumulative job potential by congressional district, including construction and operational jobs, generated by clean energy tax credits (post-IRA).

As firms take advantage of federal incentives to expand existing facilities, initiate greenfield projects, or invest in new production capacity and supply chains, communities are seeing broader opportunities for jobs in the energy sector. The map above shows cumulative job potential by congressional district, including construction and operational jobs, based on announced or completed projects that have been supported by clean energy incentives.

As others have noted, most clean energy projects are landing in Republican-held districts and they stand to lose the most if these incentives are rolled back. In fact, CATF finds that, on average, for every job generated in a Democratic district, three jobs are generated in a Republican district.

Moreover, nine of the top ten districts expected to gain the most jobs are currently held by Republicans:

This includes Nevada’s second congressional district (NV-02), where major investments include Lithium America’s Thacker Pass mine, which is expected to produce enough battery-quality lithium carbonate per year to power 800,000 electric vehicles. The project recently reached a key development milestone and could provide almost 2,000 jobs from an agreement between Bechtel and North America’s Building Trades Unions to establish a local apprenticeship program.

Other districts at risk of unrealized job gains include Texas’ nineteenth congressional district (TX-19), Arizona’s ninth congressional district (AZ-09), and Tennessee’s eighth congressional district (TN-08), where cumulative job impacts from clean energy investments are expected to be over 10,000 each.

These districts, along with many others across the country, are benefiting from tangible growth and economic gains associated with new projects, from increased local tax revenue to thousands of new construction, manufacturing, and operations jobs.

Historic manufacturing and industrial corridors are benefiting alongside emerging clusters

Energy and Industry

Manufacturing

Lastly, there appears to be an emerging geographic pattern in the type of clean energy projects that are flowing into communities, supporting existing industrial, manufacturing, and energy corridors as well as catalyzing new hubs. The heat maps above show the regional concentration of facility-level investments as of the first quarter of 2025, weighted by the size of investments. This allows for assessing the spatial concentration of actual investment dollars.

CATF finds significant energy and industry-related investments in the Gulf Coast, Southern Louisiana, the Texas Triangle, and established corridors for energy-related sectors. Energy and industry-related investments are also flowing into emerging hubs such as Southern Arizona, which has drawn investments in solar, batteries, critical minerals and hydrogen. Major investments include America Battery Factory’s $1.2 billion production facility in Tuscon and Fortescue’s $550 million green hydrogen project in Buckeye, which is now at risk as the future hydrogen incentives remain uncertain.

Manufacturing investments, meanwhile, have concentrated in the Midwest and emerging manufacturing clusters in the Southeast, notably Northern Georgia and North Carolina. For example, Toyota’s nearly $14 billion investment in EV production in Liberty, North Carolina is among the largest clean energy investments in the country, and the facility is expected to continue to ramp up production capacity through 2030.

Clean energy manufacturing has evolved from a niche subsegment to a powerhouse industry and is forecast to contribute $86 billion to the country’s GDP by 2030. Curtailing federal support for crucial incentives would jeopardize much of this progress.

These projects depend on sustained federal incentives, including grants and tax credits. But there is still a large percentage of investment outstanding, putting these projects – and the economic and public health benefits they create – at risk if clean energy provisions are diminished or eliminated.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, has rapidly ascended to the forefront of climate discourse within the aviation industry. Its promise lies in its capacity to drastically cut lifecycle emissions from aircraft operations, without demanding radical changes to existing infrastructure or aircraft technology. As airlines, governments and industry stakeholders work toward ambitious net-zero targets, SAF has emerged as a central enabler, projected to contribute more than 60 percent of aviation’s carbon reduction pathway.

Yet, despite its promise, SAF today accounts for less than one percent of total jet fuel usage. With global demand expected to soar, production capabilities remain well below target. Over 300 renewable fuel projects have been announced globally, but only a fraction are poised to reach operational status by the end of this decade.

This mismatch between ambition and reality presents both a challenge and a window of strategic opportunity—particularly for countries willing to position themselves early in the SAF value chain.

India’s Natural Advantage: Feedstock and Policy Potential

India is uniquely equipped to seize this opportunity. The country enjoys abundant feedstock availability—from agricultural residues to used cooking oil—and a robust biochemical and refining ecosystem. Moreover, its diverse geography, growing domestic demand, and well-established research institutions offer a fertile ground for innovation and scalable production.

However, natural advantages alone are not enough. The global SAF race is a policy-led movement. Regions like the United States and European Union have advanced production thanks largely to consistent incentives, mandates, and long-term regulatory clarity. In contrast, countries still in the policy formulation phase risk falling behind, despite their resource potential.

India has the tools to lead, but a decisive policy shift is required. Strong and targeted incentives for producers, guaranteed offtake frameworks, and investment in certification infrastructure can propel the ecosystem forward.

Learning from the World: Incentives Over Mandates

A key insight emerging from global SAF development is the effectiveness of incentives over mandates. While mandates offer a clear signal to industry, they risk creating demand without sufficient supply, driving up costs and discouraging investment. In contrast, incentive-based models—such as the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act—have proven more conducive to scaling production.

India, at its current stage of SAF evolution, stands to benefit from an incentive-first approach. Tailored fiscal instruments, such as tax credits, production-linked subsidies, or SAF-specific viability gap funding, could dramatically alter the risk-reward calculus for producers and investors.

Equally important is fostering regional collaboration and knowledge exchange. By learning from jurisdictions that have successfully implemented SAF policy frameworks, India can avoid pitfalls and accelerate implementation.

Infrastructure, Timelines, and Market Readiness

Even with policy support, SAF production remains a long-lead endeavor. Most commercial-scale biorefineries take four to five years from concept to commissioning. That timeline poses a critical planning challenge. If India aims to be a global SAF supplier by 2030, groundwork must begin now.

Beyond production facilities, attention must be paid to supply chain readiness. This includes storage, blending infrastructure, logistics integration at airports, and robust sustainability verification mechanisms.

The private sector, public institutions, and academia must collaborate to build a future-ready SAF ecosystem that integrates feedstock innovation, process optimization, and lifecycle carbon accounting.

The Larger Narrative: India’s Role in the Global Net-Zero Transition

By embracing SAF leadership, India does more than secure a share in a burgeoning industry. It reinforces its standing as a climate-responsible nation and a solution provider for the global South. The country can offer scalable, cost-effective SAF solutions that serve both domestic needs and international carriers seeking lower-emission fuel alternatives.

The move would also align with broader national goals—boosting rural employment, supporting agricultural waste valorization, enhancing energy security, and contributing to Make in India and green industrialisation objectives.

Conclusion: A Strategic Call for Early Action

India’s moment to act is now. With the world still early in its SAF journey, there is space for new leaders to emerge. By crafting an ambitious, yet pragmatic policy framework anchored in incentives, India can unlock significant socio-economic and environmental value.

The window of opportunity may be brief. If India is to move from potential to position—from feedstock-rich to future-ready—then clarity, coordination, and conviction will be key.

The airline has officially announced the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its commercial flights, reinforcing Thailand’s green aviation industry and laying a crucial foundation for environmentally balanced aviation development in the future.

The initiative took effect on 1 July 2025.

Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited President Captain Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth commented at the launch: “The official use of SAF on commercial flights marks a significant milestone in the airline’s transition toward a more environmentally friendly aviation future.

“This initiative aligns with the goal of achieving Net Zero Carbon Emissions, which lies at the heart of sustainability policies in the aviation sector. In 2024, the airline began using SAF on a pilot flight operating between Samui and Bangkok. This time, SAF will be used on commercial flights departing from Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi Airport) to international destinations, including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Luang Prabang, and the Maldives.”

Bangkok Airways will begin using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blended at 1% with 99% Jet A-1 fuel, which can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 128 kilogrammes of CO₂ per flight.

Bangkok Airways is committed to evolving into a truly “Sustainable Airline,” guided by the ESG framework, which is integrated across all aspects of its operations.

The airline upholds responsibility in three aspects: Environmental, Social, and Governance. In terms of environmental responsibility, Bangkok Airways focuses on climate change management, waste management, efficient use of resources, and the adoption of alternative energy sources. It continues to explore comprehensive measures to improve fuel efficiency, conduct corporate carbon footprint reporting, expand waste separation bins, and promote the upcycling of operational waste into products that benefit both society and the environment.

The airline also encourages stakeholders to participate in environmentally friendly services and initiatives, such as the “Love Earth, Save Earth” project, now in its 8th year, which involves planting coconut trees to support the ecosystem of Samui Island.",https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 02:58:29.258623

What we've learned from the GoGreen Plus journey The demand is real: People expect emissions-reduced logistics.","As businesses face growing pressure to decarbonize, logistics is a critical lever for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. DHL’s innovative GoGreen Plus empowers companies to harness this lever to help meet their decarbonization targets and future-proof their supply chains.

Transport accounts for more than a third of CO₂ emissions from end-use sectors, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). After a temporary dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, transport emissions are on the rise again. To stay on course for net-zero emissions by 2050, the IEA says CO₂ output from transport must fall by more than 3% per year through 2030.

Where there's a will, there's a way – and businesses across all sectors have made sustainability a top priority. According to a recent DHL survey, nearly 80% surveyed air traders committed to reducing carbon emissions, reflecting a growing trend of environmental responsibility within the industry.

But decarbonizing transport is complex. Companies need solutions that are not only effective but also transparent, scalable, and tailored to their specific business needs.

Making sustainable logistics simple, scalable, and measurable

To help businesses take climate action where it counts, we launched GoGreen Plus – a growing portfolio of sustainable logistics services designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our customers’ supply chains. Rather than relying on offsetting, GoGreen Plus focuses on true value chain decarbonization, using Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to reduce actual emissions within the logistics value chain.

How does it work?

GoGreen Plus uses a straightforward ""book and claim"" approach. When you opt in, we replace fossil fuels with low- or zero-emission alternatives across our logistics network. We book the sustainable aviation fuel. You claim the reduced emissions – even if your shipments are not physically transported by a vehicle using those fuels. This is called carbon insetting. Rather than offsetting (e.g., investing in renewable energy like wind farms), we use sustainable fuel (either directly or via partners), reducing the overall emissions of our services and the transport sector as a whole.

How do you measure success?

With our own GHG emissions reduction targets aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – and SBTi monitoring our progress – measurability is a top priority. That's why robust reporting standards are built into GoGreen Plus. Emissions reductions are calculated at regular intervals, verified by independent auditors, and documented in externally verified certificates for transparency and reporting.

From ambition to action – the results are clear

Since we launched GoGreen Plus, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and we've continually expanded our sustainable logistics solutions ever since. As demand has grown, we have proactively worked to increase our use of sustainable fuels. For example, we have formed numerous partnerships to drive up the production of SAF.

What we've learned from the GoGreen Plus journey

The demand is real: People expect emissions-reduced logistics.

Partnerships are key: The supply of SAF remains limited, but our progress shows the power of working with the right partners.

Anything's possible: With the right technologies and partners, we can decarbonize logistics – even at scale.

One size doesn't fit all: Sustainability solutions must be flexible and adapt to each business model.

Transparency builds trust: Verified data and credible reporting are essential to make decarbonization efforts measurable and meaningful.

The company is upgrading its supply chain on every level, from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe.

The plans include measures to reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste and boost efficiency throughout the chain.

Small changes, big impact

Founded in 1865 as a single grain warehouse, Cargill has grown into a global partner, operating in 70 countries with more than 160,000 employees worldwide.

It partners with farmers and customers to source, make and deliver products to customers, all while ensuring responsible and sustainable practices.

To cut waste, Cargill is making small changes that make big impacts throughout the entire chain. In Côte d’Ivoire, it's turning waste into energy by using once-discarded cocoa shells to fuel biomass boilers.

In Tema, production is powered by a solar plant, and disposable packaging is being replaced by new ISO tanks to transport cocoa butter. This alone means up to 100 tonnes of waste can be cut each month.

“Sustainability isn’t a single project at Cargill—it’s how we operate,” comments Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa & Chocolate Europe and West Africa. “From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we’re showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.”

Sustainability is built into every step of the production process, ensuring strong and lasting chains. From the warehouse to the final delivery, every step is examined and Cargill considers how it can reduce its negative impact.

Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam before transportation via fully-electric barges to Zaandam - cutting 190,000kg of CO2 emissions annually.

Cocoa shells are reused as fuel in Cargill’s biomass boiler in Amsterdam, reducing GHGs by almost 19,000 tonnes every year.

On the Amsterdam warehouses, Marijn Moesbergen, Cocoa Sourcing Director, says: “This location allows us to operate at scale while reducing our environmental footprint.

“By investing in infrastructure like this, we improve logistics efficiency, reduce emissions and ensure that cocoa arrives safely and responsibly at the heart of the European supply chain.”

The wider goal

Low-emission transport plays a big role in the final step of the production journey. The semi-finished products are shipped using BIO LNG trucks (heavy-duty vehicles using fuel produced from organic waste materials) to another warehouse in Zaandam.

This warehouse uses solar panels, automated vehicles and intermodal rail and barge connections, reducing last-mile impact.

Products are then delivered across Europe using renewable fuels and short sea shipping, which factors into Cargill’s global target to reduce supply chain emissions by 30% per ton of product by 2030.

“This is what sustainability at scale looks like,” adds Emiel. “It’s measurable, circular and designed to serve both people and the planet.”

Cargill believes that the success in the cocoa value chain goes hand in hand with benefits for cocoa farmers, so it works to create a sustainable, lasting supply chain.

Through the Cargill Cocoa Promise, Cargill aims to improve the livelihoods of a million farmers. By providing training in sustainable agriculture practices and access to resources, it will help farmers and their communities, as well as strengthening the cocoa supply chain.

Cargill is also committed to zero deforestation in its direct and indirect cocoa supply chain by 2030, ensuring it maintains supply chain transparency with farmer mapping and bean traceability.

The measures Cargill is taking to have a positive impact on the environment through its cocoa supply chain can be tracked every step of the way, and it looks right on track to meet its 2030 targets.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/13e0613c7c9489d5977f5477be9693a7:4fe59a637369756eac0d79bfe13b1186/pablo-merchan-montes-scbq6ukcymy-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 05:59:46.723122

The new company aims to produce around 40 million Nm³ (*3) of biogas – equivalent to the annual gas consumption of about 20,000 Danish households. It will also expand SE's existing biogas production sites across Denmark. Further, leveraging knowledge gained from the biogas business, the joint venture will develop other bioenergy sources, including e-SAF, a sustainable aviation fuel. This marks Sumitomo Corporation's first participation in a biogas production business and will accelerate the growth of its energy solutions division, one of the key growth areas in its current Medium-Term Management Plan.

Denmark's Biogas Market

As an agricultural powerhouse, Denmark aims to make full use of organic waste generated through farming while achieving carbon neutrality. The country has set a target to power its national gas grid entirely with biogas by 2030. Biogas – produced from organic waste such as food residue and livestock manure – is attracting increasing attention as a renewable energy source. Because it does not emit CO2 during combustion but instead returns only the CO2 originally absorbed by its raw materials, it contributes to achieving carbon neutrality. In addition, by using domestically sourced raw materials, biogas enhances energy self-sufficiency and drives the development of new production facilities across the country.

Purpose of Establishing the New Company

Since its founding in 1999, SE has developed renewable energy projects such as wind power. Today, it owns facilities for biogas production from cattle manure and land for developing Power to X business such as e-SAF. SE has also built strong partnerships with agricultural cooperative associations in Denmark and has signed a long-term raw materials supply agreement through 2032. This will ensure a stable supply of raw materials for biogas production.

By combining Sumitomo Corporation's business network in Europe with SE's strengths, the new company aims to expand the biogas business and develop e-SAF production. As a synthetic fuel produced from biomass-derived carbon dioxide and green hydrogen, e-SAF is expected to see rising demand as it moves towards commercialization. Denmark generates around 90% of its domestic electricity from renewable sources, giving it an advantage in procuring green hydrogen. By expanding biogas operations across the country, the new company will be able to supply biomass-derived CO2 – an ingredient in e-SAF – stably and at low cost from its own plants.

Sumitomo Corporation Group's Bioenergy Business

The Sumitomo Corporation Group has positioned bioenergy as a key method for achieving carbon neutrality in its business operations by 2050 and realizing a sustainable energy cycle. In addition to promoting the MORISORA Project in Japan under an MoU signed in February 2025 to develop domestically produced SAF, the Group also signed an MoU with reNIKOLA in Malaysia in May 2025 to explore bioenergy development, including projects for producing and selling biomethane in Malaysia and Indonesia.

A delay in facility construction or a drop in SAF pricing could pressure the stock, currently trading near multi-year lows.","The global energy landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by regulatory mandates, investor pressure, and consumer demand for sustainable solutions. Houston American Energy Corp. (NYSE American: HUSA) has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation through its acquisition of Abundia Global Impact Group (AGIG), a move that redefines its identity from a traditional oil and gas player to a leader in advanced recycling and low-carbon fuels. This strategic alignment with the renewable energy transition and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investment trends could make HUSA a compelling play for investors seeking exposure to the circular economy and decarbonization megatrends.

The Strategic Rationale: From Fossil Fuels to Plastic-to-Fuel Innovation

The acquisition of AGIG represents more than a diversification play—it is a full-scale business transformation. By integrating AGIG's proprietary pyrolysis technology, HUSA gains a scalable solution to convert waste plastics into high-value drop-in fuels, chemicals, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This shift addresses two critical global challenges: reducing plastic pollution and meeting the surging demand for low-carbon alternatives.

The Gulf Coast facility, central to AGIG's five-year growth plan, leverages the region's petrochemical infrastructure and logistical advantages. With access to abundant waste feedstock and proximity to chemical manufacturers and airlines—key buyers of SAF—the site positions HUSA to capitalize on a multi-billion-dollar market. This strategic geographic choice underscores the company's focus on capital efficiency and supply chain integration.

The ESG Opportunity: Aligning Profit with Purpose

The renewable energy transition is not just about technology—it's about investor sentiment. ESG-focused funds now manage over $40 trillion globally, with a growing emphasis on companies that contribute to circular economies and climate solutions. HUSA's acquisition checks multiple ESG boxes:

Environmental Impact: AGIG's technology diverts plastic waste from landfills and oceans while producing fuels with a fraction of the carbon intensity of traditional oil-based products.

Social Value: The project creates skilled jobs in the Gulf Coast, aligning with regional economic development goals.

Governance: The leadership team, including AGIG founder Ed Gillespie as CEO, brings deep expertise in advanced recycling and project execution—a critical factor for investors wary of greenwashing.

The transaction's structure also reflects ESG priorities: AGIG's 94% stake in HUSA post-acquisition incentivizes alignment between management and shareholders, as success now hinges on executing on the company's sustainability mission.

Risks and Challenges: Execution Will Determine Success

While the strategic vision is compelling, execution risks remain significant. HUSA's transition faces hurdles such as:

- Capital Requirements: Scaling the Gulf Coast facility will demand substantial financing.

- Regulatory Approval: Permits for chemical facilities and SAF production standards must be secured.

- Market Competition: Companies like Chevron and Honeywell are also investing in plastic-to-fuel technologies, raising the stakes for HUSA's cost and efficiency advantages.

Investors should monitor HUSA's liquidity, its ability to secure debt or equity financing, and progress on securing long-term supply agreements with airlines and chemical firms. A delay in facility construction or a drop in SAF pricing could pressure the stock, currently trading near multi-year lows.

Investment Considerations: A High-Reward, High-Risk Bet on Renewables

For investors willing to take on risk, HUSA offers a unique leveraged play on two megatrends: the decarbonization of aviation and the circular economy. Its stock's volatility (as seen in the",,N,,2025-07-02 05:01:31.160950

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property would continue to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers would appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits would terminate for wind and solar facilities that begin construction after 1 year from enactment and are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction within 1 year from enactment would not be subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar would phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill that passed the House included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027 for projects beginning construction one year after enactment.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) apparently would not be subject to the rule above.

Observation: Under the current Senate bill (unlike the House bill and previous Senate Finance Committee bill), residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers would still be eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009 has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power would be eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology would be revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction begins before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate would be fixed at 30% and could not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh would not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate could not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after enactment, the credit amount would be the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026)

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently would not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate would phase out under the current schedule based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) would be credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, would not be credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the bill), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after enactment that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules would be required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components would remain credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers could still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, could not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z would not be credit eligible, and Treasury would be authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury would be authorized to prescribe rules for related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after enactment (and fuel sold or used before enactment that have not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not be allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF would not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A would be extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount would be increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and would be in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit could be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel producers would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit would terminate for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the ""tech-neutral"" ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

Upon enactment, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification would not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" would be prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;19

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act21; or

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally would mean 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" would mean the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" would also mean a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after the date of enactment.

There would be an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale would not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" would be determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Senate bill would codify that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury would be required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027 applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Not later than Dec. 31, 2026, Treasury would be required to issue safe harbor tables. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier would be required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, would not be included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity. The statute would further authorize the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity could be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty would apply to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would be disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would cause an ""excessive payment"" and incur the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification would be required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

In line with other European nations, Türkiye’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation has announced a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate in a bid to cut aviation emissions by 5% by 2030.

The planned regulations aim to align with the UN International Civil Aviation Organization’s emissions reduction scheme, which will become mandatory in 2027.

Meeting the mandate

Under the new rules, airlines operating international flights to and from Türkiye will need to use enough SAF to meet the 5% emissions reduction goal. Fuel suppliers will also be required to procure enough SAF to meet that target, while domestic refiners including Tupras and Socar will be expected to begin local production.

Türkiye’s largest oil refiner, Tupras, plans to introduce 20,000 metric tonnes of SAF at one of its major plants in 2026. It also aims to increase production to 400,000 tonnes by constructing a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment. Meanwhile, local biofuel firm DB Tarımsal Enerji plans to produce 100,000 tons of SAF at a new plant.

According to the country’s energy regulator, Türkiye’s jet fuel demand fell 4% in 2024 to 6.26 million tonnes.

The biofuel, which can be blended with regular jet fuel, is expected to be the biggest contributor in the industry’s decarbonisation efforts. According to PREETI JAIN, head, Net Zero Transition Programs at global airline industry body International Air Transport Association (IATA), India is well-positioned to emerge as an international SAF manufacturing hub, provided it capitalises on the opportunity with concerted efforts, primarily through a policy push and incentives for the segment’s value chain. In an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Jain delves into the global SAF ecosystem, its challenges, lessons from other regions, mandates-versus-incentives debate, and the road ahead globally as well as in India. Edited excerpts:

How critical is SAF for the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation targets? Is SAF production on track to meet multilateral requirements and regional and country-specific mandates?

There are four things which we have identified for the decarbonisation roadmap —sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), operational efficiencies, (carbon) offset, and hydrogen and electric planes. All of them are important. While all are important, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent (in decarbonisation)… On SAF, it is important to understand that even if we deploy all the solutions today, they can only bring a certain level of carbon emission reduction. We are still far away from our final goal, as well as mid-term and short-term goals, because SAF currently stands at just around 0.7 per cent of global jet fuel production. We map around 300 renewable fuel projects around the world, and we considered 160 projects for our assessment. We saw that nearly 54 per cent of the projects are just announcements; all of them want to produce SAF by 2030. Each plant would likely take at least four-five years to be built, and it doesn’t look likely that many would be ready by 2030.

Having earlier worked in this domain in India, how do you see the country’s SAF ecosystem?

I have witnessed this ecosystem for more than 10 years in India. I’d say India is headed in the right direction and should do fine in meeting the initial requirements. Interestingly, India wants to come up with its tailor-made policies which can help its own ecosystem. The country has announced its intent to have time-bound SAF blending targets. But we are yet to see a firm roadmap and the implementation plan. Various Indian energy companies are working on SAF projects. These companies have always come forward to do what is required by the government and international commitments. So, I’m positive about India. The question is would India be happy just doing the bare minimum to meet mandates and requirements? Or does it want to be ahead of the curve and start making SAF not just for Indian airlines, but also for international airlines operating to India? There is enough ethanol supply in the country, and some of it can be diverted to make SAF… India wants to export ethanol, and similarly, SAF also presents a similar opportunity. There can be a ‘make in India for the world’ opportunity in SAF. India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050.

What is it that India should do to meet SAF requirements as well as become an SAF manufacturing hub?

India should prioritise feedstock for the production of SAF without waiting further, leverage the existing refining capability, invest in the research and innovation and new technologies. Funding should be made available to projects as well as the feedstock aggregation supply chains. It also needs to be ensured that the SAF manufactured in India meets all sustainability certification criteria, and that needs to start now, not when the plants are ready for production.

Europe already has SAF blending mandates which have come much before CORSIA’s mandatory phase kicks in (from 2027). Is it a move in the right direction?

Mandates and incentives need to come together in the right proportion. While there is already a mandate in Europe, the fundamental question is about the ecosystem, is it ready? That ecosystem readiness was not there, and in such a scenario, mandates aren’t going to really be effective. Much of the SAF being used in Europe is coming from different continents. Does it even make sense, considering long-haul transportation of the fuel itself would have a high carbon footprint? That is why we are asking for incentives to be brought in so that the local ecosystem is prepared with enough domestic production.

Why does IATA seem to be opposed to the way Europe is going about SAF mandates?

What airlines are being charged for SAF in Europe is not on a cost-plus basis. They are being charged exorbitant compliance fees and there is no transparency in the cost structure. We don’t understand what is the rationale behind these high numbers. We estimate that this non-transparent compliance fee is adding an additional $1.7 billion to the cost of SAF for airlines in Europe on top of the cost of SAF, which itself is quite high. It was already a supply-constrained market and then you (Europe) introduced mandates, which essentially means that the airline is bound to buy SAF at any price, or be penalised…Also, our position on SAF is that it should be feedstock agnostic and technology neutral. All technologies should compete, and the market forces would lead to the best and the most efficient ones being picked up. But Europe has put a sub-mandate for the power-to-liquid (PTL) pathway for SAF production. That puts other pathways and technologies (like alcohol-to-jet, which various companies are working on) at a disadvantage.

Unlike what is happening in Europe, the US is seen as a success story on SAF use. What did they do differently?

The US provided incentives around the value chain. In one sense, Europe and the US are very similar, in that they provided a lot of funding and research for these technologies to mature. But the US went a step ahead. They provided production-linked incentives, they subsidised the feedstock, gave other incentives that led to the SAF feedstock supply chain being streamlined there, etc. Then there were tax credits for SAF production and blending. Additionally, apart from the central or federal incentives, some US states also had their own incentive plans. Many of the SAF facilities also need hydrogen, so the US also provided some incentives for green hydrogen production. Essentially, they worked on bits and pieces across the SAF value chain.

Are US-like incentives the answer for boosting SAF production? Is it something that can easily be replicated in other parts of the world?

There is enough biorefinery capacity around the world. The question is, how can governments provide the right incentives for these biorefineries to switch their production in the favour of SAF. A biorefinery is not built specifically for renewable diesel or SAF for that matter. These capacities can swing very quickly to produce SAF. We can have sufficient production of SAF to meet the airlines’ demand—voluntary as well as the mandates. Governments should seriously look at incentives for SAF production, like facilitating offtake, providing subsidies, etc… Let’s take the example of solar and wind in India and elsewhere. Governments provided production-linked incentives, tax holidays, and subsidies. We need the same story in the SAF ecosystem.",https://www.processingjournal.com/assets/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-01 21:02:24.795681

Washington, DC, July 1, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomes today’s Senate passage of several provisions to promote the growth, safety and sustainability of U.S. aviation included in a revised budget-reconciliation bill.

Similar NBAA-supported provisions were passed by the House of Representatives in a budget reconciliation package on May 22 that was referred to the Senate.

While the Senate made numerous changes to the House legislation, similar items in the Senate’s version include a $12.52 billion down payment to fund transformation of the nation’s air traffic control (ATC) technologies, facilities and other infrastructure.

Announced by House leaders in April, the ATC-funding proposal has the backing of NBAA and more than 50 other leading aviation organizations comprising the recently formed Modern Skies Coalition.

“We thank the Senate for recognizing with this initial funding that a safe and efficient national airspace requires a robust, resilient ATC system that bolsters our nation’s global aviation leadership,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen.

The Senate legislation also includes a permanent reinstatement of full and immediate expensing on purchases of factory-new and pre-owned aircraft. The expensing schedule, most recently renewed in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is set to expire in 2027.

“As leading economists have found, immediate expensing helps companies and entrepreneurs relying on business aviation have access to a critical competitive asset, while strengthening America’s manufacturing base,” Bolen said, noting the sector supports 1.3 million jobs and accounts for $340 billion in annual economic activity.

The Senate bill also includes a measure related to business aviation’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 – an additional four-year extension of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, but with a reduction in the value of the credit from $1.75/gal to $1.00/gal. While the credit is among the initiatives that spurred the doubling of U.S. SAF production from December 2024 to February 2025, the reduction in credit value could make it difficult to meet increasing demand.

The wide-ranging bill now moves back to the House this week for a final vote. If approved, it will head to the president to be signed into law.

“These provisions represent an important investment in an essential American industry, and the citizens, companies and communities that depend on it,” Bolen concluded. “NBAA looks forward to their continued progress.”

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel

‘Sustainable Aviation Fuels ‘(‘SAF’) are defined in the Refuel EU Aviation Regulation as aviation fuels that are either synthetic aviation fuels, aviation biofuels or recycled carbon aviation fuels.

SAF produces similar levels of carbon dioxide to conventional aviation fuels when burned, but the carbon dioxide generated is already part of the carbon cycle and is not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel. This means that using SAF results in a reduction in carbon emissions compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces over the lifecycle of the fuel. A major challenge is that SAF availability remains low globally and today accounts for 2.7% of our total fuel.

As SAF is similar in chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel, it can be dropped straight into existing fuel supply infrastructure and aircraft without modification. As a result, it is the readiest solution to reduce the carbon emissions associated with aviation. Emission reductions from the use of SAF are measured as the reduction of carbon emissions on a greenhouse gas lifecycle basis, typically by 80% or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.

And of the top 15 air travel days in 2024, 14 occurred between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day.
Much of this is made possible by American-made liquid fuels and petrochemicals.
While there are certainly alternative fuels in the mix — including sustainable aviation fuel, LNG and renewable diesel (many of which are also produced by American refineries) — it is largely petroleum-derived liquid fuels that power your summer excursions.
So, whether you’re setting out on a long-awaited road trip, jet-setting to your dream vacation destination or relaxing on the water with friends and family, remember: Summer fun is brought to you by American-made liquid fuels and petrochemicals.","Summertime means sunshine, sundaes and summer travel, so it’s no surprise that many Americans spend more time this season on the road, on the water and in the air. Whether vacationing or visiting family and friends across the country and around the world, petroleum fuels 90% of transportation energy demand in the United States and remains the number one source of energy worldwide.

See below to learn how petroleum-derived liquid fuels and petrochemicals help Americans make the most of the summer season.

Driving

Summer is when Americans do most of their driving — specifically from Memorial Day to Labor Day — and, fittingly, it’s also when drivers need American refineries to make the most gasoline. For the vast majority of American drivers, internal combustion engine cars and trucks are what they use to get from place to place. In fact, gasoline-fueled vehicles accounted for a full 87% of all vehicle miles traveled in 2024.

To prepare for and meet heightened summer fuel demand, U.S. refineries routinely operate at some of their highest utilization rates for the duration of the summer. It is, therefore, no coincidence that the trends for both refinery utilization and the number of vehicle miles traveled routinely peak in the summer.

Flying

Two of the busiest times for air travel also fall during the summer: Independence Day weekend and late August in the lead up to Labor Day. In 2024, there was an average of nearly 700,000 passenger aircraft miles flown between May and September.

Last year on July 7, TSA recorded 3,013,622 people passing through security checkpoints — the first time in history that number exceeded three million in a single day. And of the top 15 air travel days in 2024, 14 occurred between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day. Americans are all about summer trips!

Boating

100 million Americans go boating each year and, this year, a record 19 million are expected to go on cruises. At the same time, popular summer destinations such as Destin, Miami, Los Angeles, New York City and Tampa have seen considerable growth in boating tourism and recreation. Much of this is made possible by American-made liquid fuels and petrochemicals.

While there are certainly alternative fuels in the mix — including sustainable aviation fuel, LNG and renewable diesel (many of which are also produced by American refineries) — it is largely petroleum-derived liquid fuels that power your summer excursions.

Petrochemicals also play an integral role. From your car’s steering wheel and tires to an airplane’s wings, seats and overhead bins, all are derived from petrochemicals. You can find petrochemicals in the most essential elements of a boat too, including its hull, as well as recreational water toys — like inner tubes to float down a lazy river.

So, whether you’re setting out on a long-awaited road trip, jet-setting to your dream vacation destination or relaxing on the water with friends and family, remember:

At the time of its introduction, the Swedish government said the purpose of the tax was to help reduce the climate impact of aviation.
Ryanair’s enthusiasm for Sweden contrasts with its decision to pull routes from Denmark, where a new aviation tax is being introduced.
“Today marks a significant step forward for Sweden's aviation industry as the aviation tax is abolished.
“The previous aviation tax did nothing to support the transition to reducing emissions.","Sweden’s government has abolished its air travel tax, rolling back a six-year-old levy that charged airlines up to $54 per passenger per flight, depending on the distance.

At the time of its introduction, the Swedish government said the purpose of the tax was to help reduce the climate impact of aviation.

Since the policy came into effect in 2018, domestic air traffic fell by nearly a third, according to a report by aviation data firm Cirium. In the report, Cirium suggests that some of the decline was a result of growing concern amongst consumers of the environmental impacts of flying.

While several small regional airports, including Bromma near Stockholm, shut down as demand fell, there had been a gradual rise in rail use in the country over the past few years.

Airlines Ready to Expand Again

The reversal is already changing airline strategies. Ryanair had scaled back its Swedish domestic flights last year, citing low profitability. Now the airline plans a comeback.

“As Europe’s No. 1 airline, Ryanair is thrilled to announce significant growth and expansion in Sweden, following the Swedish Govt’s forward-thinking decision to abolish the harmful aviation tax, which has been holding back Sweden’s post-Covid recovery and stifling traffic, jobs, and economic growth,” Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson previously said in a statement.

Ryanair’s enthusiasm for Sweden contrasts with its decision to pull routes from Denmark, where a new aviation tax is being introduced.

EasyJet told Skift it also welcomed the change. ""We strongly welcome the abolition of taxes on passengers to help keep flying affordable,” a spokesperson said.

Anko van der Werff, CEO of SAS, had previously urged the government to scrap the tax, calling it a barrier to competitiveness. “This will help us reduce emissions and strengthen Sweden’s global position,” he wrote on LinkedIn.

In an email to Skift, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing most major airlines, said it also praised the move.

“Today marks a significant step forward for Sweden's aviation industry as the aviation tax is abolished. This decision is a bold and positive move which will bring great benefits in a number of ways,” IATA’s Area Manager for the Nordic and Baltic regions, Catrin Mattsson, said.

“The previous aviation tax did nothing to support the transition to reducing emissions. With the tax abolished, instead of funds leaving the industry, they can be used for investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, new technologies, and innovations needed for the transition.”

On July 1 a little before noon, the Senate passed the Reconciliation Bill, also known as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill”, in a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The bill now heads back to the House, which is expected to vote before July 4. If signed into law, the bill will lock in major priorities for farmers and ranchers across the country, from permanent tax relief to key updates in farm programs.

Key agricultural topics addressed in the bill:

The Senate version increases the Death Tax exemption, makes the Section 199A tax deduction permanent, and increases the Section 179 tax deduction.

Addressing the affordability of federal crop insurance coverage for producers, including support for beginning farmers and ranchers.

Doubling mandatory funding for trade promotion programs, which will develop new markets and promote U.S. goods.

Strengthening the producer safety net by investing in modifications to the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage commodity programs that are more responsive to the current economic environment.

The Senate version extends and modifies the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, a tax credit for producing low-carbon fuels, like biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel, that can create new markets for U.S. soybeans and corn. Under the bill, only feedstocks from the U.S., Canada and Mexico would qualify for the tax credit. The Senate bill extends the 45Z through the end of 2029, compared to the House bill that extends the credit through 2031.

Renewing the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program through 2031; updating DMC’s production history calculation to be based on the highest production year of 2021, 2022, or 2023; and extending the ability for producers to receive a 25% premium discount for locking in their coverage for the duration of the bill.

Providing mandatory funding for USDA to conduct mandatory dairy processing cost surveys every two years to provide better data to inform future make allowance conversations.

Folding remaining Inflation Reduction Act conservation dollars into the farm bill baseline, resulting in increased long-term funding for popular, oversubscribed programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program.

Increasing funding for animal health programs that help to prevent, control, and eradicate animal diseases.

Many agricultural groups weighed in on the passing of the bill.

“NCGA has worked closely with members of Congress as they drafted and voted on this legislation. We are particularly pleased to see the permanent extension of certain tax provisions, which will provide more certainty to corn farmers around the country as they plan for the future of their businesses.” – Kenneth Harman Jr, NCGA President and Illinois farmer

“Dairy farmers are grateful for legislation that will create several key opportunities for dairy. Following last month’s successful vote in the House, we are excited that the Senate’s legislation also positions these investments to benefit dairy farmers and the cooperatives they own. We hope they are enacted into law as swiftly as possible.” – Gregg Doud, National Milk Producers Federation president and CEO

“Farm Bureau applauds the U.S. Senate for passing the reconciliation package. Farmers and ranchers are the foundation of America’s food supply chain, and they need the certainty that this legislation will provide. Improvements to farm safety net programs that reflect today’s agricultural economy and maintaining important tax provisions will directly benefit farm and ranch families.” – Zippy Duval, American Farm Bureau Federation president

“ASA applauds the Senate for its support of agriculture and the farm economy in this legislation. Soybean growers have long championed comprehensive revisions to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, an improved safety net for agriculture, and increased support for research and market expansion. The modified biofuel tax credits, enhancements to crop insurance and support for MAP and FMD, among other agriculture provisions included in this legislation will support U.S. farmers and expand market opportunities domestically. ASA urges the House to maintain these key agricultural provisions that support our rural economies as they consider this legislation.” – Caleb Ragland, ASA President and Kentucky soybean grower

GLOBAL CRISES IMPACTING METHANOL-TO-JET FUEL MARKET

COVID-19 IMPACT

Methanol-to-Jet Fuel Market Had a Negative Effect Due to Supply Chain Disruption During COVID-19 Pandemic

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with the market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden market growth reflected by the rise in CAGR is attributable to the market’s growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.

The commercialization and development of the methanol-to-jet fuel market share was affected greatly due to the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the world aviation set to a virtual standstill by travel restrictions, lockdowns, and declining passenger numbers, investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, including the methanol based variety, was put on the backburner. Disparity in the supply chains and reduced access to labs, as well as reallocation of funds toward pandemic-related programs, hindered research and development. Further, in the beginning stages of the pandemic, oil became more affordable, thus weakening the economic motivation to switch to other fuels instead of conventional jet fuel. Major industrial partnerships and pilot projects were also delayed in the effort to adapt operations to pandemic inevitable. On top of that, the general decrease in the air traffic diverted the urgency of the decarbonization process in the aviation industry. Incentives and policies via the government to encourage SAF use also experienced temporary hindrances as the world pre-occupied itself in grappling the public health crisis and the economic comeback. Combined, all these obstacles decelerated the pace of the market development of methanol-to-jet fuel and postponed both timelines and technology upscaling. Yet, with the post-pandemic revival the sustainable aviation has made a comeback with governments and businesses aiming to construct a more energy resilient, but cleaner environment with the methanol-to-jet fuel market having a rebound potential in the medium term.

LATEST TREND

Integration of Green Hydrogen with Methanol Pathways Enhancing Jet Fuel Sustainability Drives Market Growth

One of the emerging trends can transform the methanol-to- jet fuel sector is the involvement of green hydrogen in the methanol manufacturing process that enhances the sustainability and carbon intensity of the end product (fuel) quite remarkably. Historically, natural gas could be used to make methanol (gray methanol), however, in order to meet net-zero targets the industry is transitioning to methanol made by using captured CO2 and renewable sources of hydrogen- also made via electrolysis in renewable energy. This is a cleaner source of green methanol to be used to synthesize jet fuel. This trend is associated with the worldwide decarbonization and is to comply with the international standards of aviation fuel emissions, e.g., CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). Power-to-Liquid (PtL) is another area rapidly gaining investment among the companies, in which green hydrogen and CO 2 are converted into methanol and then undergo catalytic conversion to become jet fuel. Europe and North America Notable projects are also underway in Europe and North America to investigate integrated facilities to incorporate electrolysis units, CO 2 capture technologies and FischerTropsch synthesis or alternative advanced conversion technologies. Such convergence is not only improved sustainability, but also offers a strategic solution on hydrogen storage and hydrogen transport through methanol. With the green hydrogen and SAF gaining policy support, their tendency is expected to spark future investments, collaboration and expansion of the methanol-to-jet fuel ecosystem.

Policies like the CORSIA and national policies to blend SAFs are forcing airlines and fuel suppliers to use non-emitting fuels that include methanol-to-jet fuel. The use of methanol-based fuels provides a high level of attraction because they are able to comply with the requirements of the strict emission standards required in the aviation industry besides being highly compatible with the current infrastructure in terms of drops. Such regulatory frameworks not only prove that stakeholders in the aviation industry are being coerced into using alternative aviation fuels but also warrant government investment and privates financing in SAF research and development. Therefore, emission compliance becomes another major driver that contributes to the introduction and evolution of the technologies of the MTJF.

Increasing Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuels Expand the Market

Investments in SAF are also on the rise as sustainability now appears as a priority of governments and companies. As an emerging SAF route, methanol-to-jet fuel is enjoying this shift. Taking a big bet with their investment: Major energy companies, chemical giant, and even aviation have directed huge capital investment on SAF infrastructure, such as methanol manufactories, CO2 capture and conversion plants and fuel conversion plants. The market is also driven by public-private partnerships, grants and subsidies in the form of R&D and clean energy. The ability to use methanol as a variety of feedstock and a relatively developed chain of production supply makes it high-interest investment. The long-term growth potential also attracts the attention of investors by the search of airlines exploring reliable, low-carbon fuel options. With the growth of capital flows, the market of the MTJF is becoming discussed more promptly in terms of commercialization and global pilot projects, which is the indicator of its appearance in the zone of central significance in the SAF ecosystem.

RESTRAINING FACTOR

High Production Costs and Commercialization Barriers Potentially Impede Market Growth

However, the methanol-to-jet fuel market is under the challenge of its major headwind which happens to be expensive production and capital. The conversion of methanol to jet fuel are energy-intensive, complex catalytic processes not yet cost competitive with conventional fuels. In addition, green methanol production by utilizing green hydrogen and CO 2, which are renewable sources of methanol, introduces additional costs (the cost of electrolysis technology and carbon capture technology is high). Upscaling of such processes, whether lab or pilot scale to commercial scale involves enormous finance in terms of infrastructure and long reproduction schedules. Also, the policy certainty or subsidies that will regulate the production cost will be minimal and the investment will be risky. All these economic and technical barriers hamper the rapidity with which the market can attain the economies of scale rendering adoption into a potential problem in the short term.

OPPORTUNITY

Leveraging CO₂ Utilization for Carbon-Neutral Fuel Production Create Opportunity for The Product in The Market

Methanol-to-jet fuel is an original way to pass the methane fuel through the transformation of CO 2 gases into jet fuel products that are valuable and practical. Rather than letting the CO 2 languish somewhere, this mechanism, which recycles the carbon, entails a combination of CO 2 with green hydrogen, to manufacture methanol, which would then be converted into aviation fuel, allowing the industries, not just to eliminate a couple of greenhouse gases, but also to acquire adequate fuel to address their needs. The method is consistent with the idea of circular carbon economy and contributes to the climate agenda. With increasing numbers of carbon pricing and emission trading systems it is economically feasible to utilize CO 2. Therefore, jet fuel made of methanol will have a twofold effect, namely, decarbonizing the aviation sector and giving an effective, profitable disposal of industrial emissions of CO 2. Due to increased interest in carbon capture and storage (CCS), methanol-to-jet fuel might be a linkage between emissions reduction and energy transition.

CHALLENGE

Regulatory Certification and Fuel Standard Compliance Could Be a Potential Challenge for Consumers

Getting regulatory certification and full commercial use is one of the key challenges facing the methanol-to-jet fuel market. Controls Aviation fuels have to meet strict international specifications, e.g. ASTM D7566, to guarantee performance, safety and compliance with aircraft engines. This many-staged process of turning methanol presents a challenge of proving an equivalence to petroleum-based fuels. These processes are testing, evaluation, and approval that may delay the implementation of MTJF technologies. Also, the standard-setting organizations and government aviation regulators frequently demand field tests and many years of performance data. This regulatory logjam may discourage the early investors and deter the market entry, even though it proves beneficial to the environment. Combating these certification hazards will necessitate intensive cooperation amid aviation agencies, standards organizations as well as fuel producers.

Methanol-to-Jet Fuel Market REGIONAL INSIGHTS

NORTH AMERICA

North America will have a dominant role in the United State methanol-to-jet fuel market because of its developed aviation sector, developed methanol infrastructure, and the advanced scope of clean energy innovation. The U.S Department of Energy and other federal agencies have initiated SAF granting programs and tax credits as an incentive to production. Firms such as Carbon Recycling International and Air Company are coming up with methanol-based fuels and carbon exploitation technology in the area. There are also a number of pilot and demonstration projects undertaken by the U.S. in liaison with research institutions and giant airlines. Besides, North America has an extensive natural gas and renewable energy capacity, which supposes a variety of feedstocks used in the methanol production in the region. North America is a leading center of growth in methanol-to-jet fuel industry since its success has been attributable to the availability of robust policy backing, research and development capacities and energy supplies.

EUROPE

Europe is at the forefront in the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel and the vigorous climate policy pursued include the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 package. According to the EU renewable energy directive (RED II), more advanced biofuel must be used, such as synthetic fuels using synthetics, such as jet fuel made of methanol. Multiple nations of Europe are also setting up much investment into the infrastructure of green hydrogen and CO2 capture to accompany renewable methanol. Such countries as Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark are establishing large-scale Power-to-Liquid (PtL) plants to provide SAF to the key airports. Availability of the advanced aviation OEMs and the regulatory bodies as well enables swift rates in certification in the region. As airline sustainability initiatives increase and international efforts are made to work together, Europe will probably continue to lead what happens in the methanol-to-jet fuel sector.

ASIA

Asian market is becoming a major player in the market of methanol to jet fuel due to its flourishing aviation industry and its growing interest in clean energy transition. China, which is the largest methanol manufacturer in the world, is using its experience to seek methanol-based SAF. In the meantime, other states, such as Japan and South Korea, are betting on green hydrogen and carbon capture processes, which can be used to feed an industry producing methanol. Furthermore, India is also exploring other fuel options to make its aviation sector decarbonized within its National Bioenergy Mission. Regional governments are also making public-private partnerships to create SAF supply chains, whereas Asian airlines are engaging in strategic agreements to purchase SAF in future. The presence of cheap renewables and the increasingly serious attitude towards the reduction of emissions make Asia one of the key areas to scale down methanol-to-jet fuel solutions.

REPORT COVERAGE

The methanol-to-jet fuel sector is at the nexus between climate innovation and aviation transition and it provides an exciting pathway to decarbonize one of the hardest areas to decarbonize. Due to the increasing global demand in air travel coupled with a stricter set of environmental regulations, there has never been a greater necessity to find ways of establishing sustainable and scalable aviation fuels. Because of its high efficiency and easy flexibility to produce, methanol is a good resource to use as a source of jet fuel, especially when renewable sources or captured carbon is used. The technological progressing areas that can contribute to the MTJF process are catalytic conversion, integration of green hydrogen, and CO 2 utilization. Despite being at an early stage of commercialization, there is an indication of robust up-ward growth because of growing investments, regulatory backing, and pilot demonstrations are being allowed. Other regions such as North America, Europe, and Asia are making critical action to ensure the creation of an infrastructure, innovation and adoption alike via policy mandate and partnership. Nevertheless, high costs of production, certification barriers, and readiness in infrastructure have remained as some of the drawbacks in the market. Nevertheless, the methanol-to-jet fuel represents an excellent chance to make the aircraft sector more environmentally friendly and reduce the number of emissions released into the environment. As long as the innovation continues, the collaboration between nations exists, and communities of public-private investors, the MTJF market is bound to become a foundation of the sustainable aviation fuel environment in the future.",https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/accets/frontend/images/report-header-scroll-logo.webp,N,,2025-07-01 17:06:56.852770

The deal is aimed at helping the airline move closer to its environmental goals, including reducing emissions and increasing the use of cleaner fuels, reports ESGtoday.

Under the agreement, the SAF provided by EcoCeres is expected to reduce British Airways’ fuel lifecycle carbon emissions by around 400,000 metric tonnes. That’s equivalent to the emissions from flying approximately 240,000 economy class passengers on return trips between London and New York.

EcoCeres, which specializes in producing biofuels and bioproducts from biomass, creates SAF from 100% waste-based materials like used cooking oil. This fuel offers a carbon emission reduction of up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

“We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation,” said Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres. “Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership shows our focus on offering fuel solutions that help the aviation industry meet its climate goals.”

British Airways’ parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), has committed to using 10% SAF by 2030—equivalent to 1 million tonnes of fuel per year—and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In 2023, IAG’s airlines used about 12% of the global SAF supply and have already secured one-third of the SAF needed to meet their 2030 target.

Carrie Harris, British Airways’ Director of Sustainability, highlighted the role of SAF in the airline’s broader climate efforts: “In 2024, SAF made up 2.7% of our total fuel use and has helped us cut our carbon intensity by 13% since 2019.

This article cuts through the noise to show you what's actually happening with sustainable aviation; from the fuel breakthroughs that are scaling faster than expected to the quantum-powered simulations that are revolutionizing how we optimize flight operations.

You'll walk away with a clear picture of where the industry stands and what tools are making the biggest difference right now.

Let's dive into the technologies and strategies that are actually moving the needle on aviation sustainability.

The Environmental Impact of Aviation

Emissions Breakdown

Aviation accounts for about 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions. Roughly 915 million tonnes annually as of 2019. That might sound modest, but here's the kicker: aviation emissions have surged 150% since the 1990s, driven by our insatiable appetite for air travel. The industry is growing fast, and without intervention, these numbers would keep climbing.

But CO₂ isn't the whole story when it comes to aviation's climate impact. NOx emissions, water vapor, and those wispy contrails you see streaking across the sky all contribute to warming effects. These non-CO₂ factors can actually double or triple aviation's total climate contribution compared to CO₂ alone.

Industry Comparison

Want some perspective on where aviation sits in the emissions landscape? Here's how it stacks up:

Shipping: About 3% of global emissions—slightly higher than aviation but serving different transport needs

Road Transport: Around 12% of global emissions—cars and trucks still dominate the transport sector

Power Generation: Roughly 25% of global emissions—the biggest single contributor by far

Buildings: About 6% of global emissions—including heating, cooling, and construction

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Its Potential

What Is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is chemically nearly identical to conventional jet fuel, but it's produced from renewable resources instead of fossil crude oil. Think of it as a drop-in replacement, you can use it in existing aircraft engines without modifications, which is why airlines love it.

The magic happens in how it's made: from waste cooking oil, agricultural residues, algae, or even captured carbon dioxide.

SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The key word here is ""lifecycle""—this accounts for everything from feedstock production to combustion in the engine.

Current Usage & Barriers

Electric and Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft

Electric Aviation

Electric aircraft are already taking off—literally—for short regional flights and pilot training. Companies like Eviation and Heart Aerospace have electric planes in testing that can handle 200-500 mile routes with 9-19 passengers. The technology works beautifully for these shorter hops, offering near-zero emissions and significantly lower operating costs.

But here's the reality check: battery weight and energy density remain major limitations. Current lithium-ion batteries are still too heavy for long-haul flights, though breakthroughs in solid-state batteries could change that equation within the next decade.

Hydrogen Power

Hydrogen aircraft burn hydrogen fuel cells or direct combustion engines, producing only water vapor as exhaust—no CO₂ at all. Airbus is leading the charge with their ZEROe concept aircraft, targeting commercial hydrogen flights by 2035. The technology is promising for medium-haul flights up to about 2,000 miles.

The infrastructure challenge is massive, though: airports need entirely new fuel storage, handling, and distribution systems. Hydrogen also requires about four times the storage volume of jet fuel, which means significant aircraft redesigns.

Expected commercial timelines look like this:

2025-2027: Regional hydrogen aircraft (9-19 seats) enter service

2030-2032: Short-haul hydrogen planes (50-100 seats) begin commercial operations

2035-2040: Medium-haul hydrogen aircraft (100+ seats) reach market maturity

Operational Improvements and Carbon Offsetting

Smarter Flight Operations

Airlines are getting incredibly sophisticated about operational efficiency—optimizing flight paths, reducing aircraft weight, and using AI to minimize fuel burn. Modern flight management systems can calculate the most fuel-efficient routes in real-time, accounting for weather, air traffic, and aircraft performance. Some airlines are seeing 3-5% fuel savings just from smarter route planning.

BQPSim's quantum-inspired simulation tools are revolutionizing this space by helping airlines optimize operations at unprecedented scale and speed.

Our QIEO-powered solvers can process complex multi-variable optimization problems—like simultaneous route planning, crew scheduling, and maintenance coordination—up to 20 times faster than classical methods.

This means airlines can make real-time adjustments that reduce fuel usage and minimize emissions across their entire fleet operations.

Weight reduction is another big win: removing just one pound from an aircraft can save about $3,000 in fuel costs annually. Airlines are switching to lighter seats, digital manuals instead of paper, and even redesigning meal service equipment.

Airport Sustainability

Airports are becoming powerhouses of renewable energy adoption, with solar farms and wind installations becoming standard features. Denver International Airport, for example, generates enough solar power to offset 6% of its total energy consumption.

Ground support equipment is rapidly electrifying—those baggage tugs and aircraft pushback vehicles you see on the tarmac are increasingly battery-powered.

Here are some standout airport sustainability initiatives:

Copenhagen Airport: Carbon-neutral since 2009, now targeting carbon-negative operations by 2030

San Francisco International: Zero waste to landfill program and 100% renewable electricity

Amsterdam Schiphol: Installing massive heat pump systems to eliminate natural gas usage

Seattle-Tacoma International: Using biofuels for ground vehicle fleets and sustainable construction materials

Carbon Offsets

Carbon offsets let passengers and airlines invest in projects that remove or prevent CO₂ emissions elsewhere—like reforestation, renewable energy projects, or direct air capture facilities.

The idea is simple: if you can't eliminate your flight emissions, you can pay to eliminate an equivalent amount somewhere else. Many airlines now offer offset programs at checkout, and some build offsetting into their ticket prices automatically.

But here's where it gets tricky: offset quality varies dramatically, and many projects don't deliver the promised emissions reductions. Critics argue that offsets can become a way to avoid making harder changes to actual operations.

Regulatory and Industry-Wide Commitments

International Agreements

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is the world's first global market-based measure for any industry sector. Starting in 2021, it requires airlines to offset emissions growth above 2020 levels through verified carbon credits. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) oversees the program, which covers about 77% of international aviation activity.

CORSIA is designed as a bridge measure while the industry develops longer-term sustainability solutions. It's not perfect, but it creates economic incentives for airlines to invest in cleaner technologies and operations.

Airline and Manufacturer Pledges

The industry has made some bold commitments that seemed impossible just a few years ago:

United Airlines: Net zero by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets

Airbus: Hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in service by 2035

Boeing: Commercial aircraft and services compatible with 100% SAF by 2030

Delta Air Lines: $1 billion investment in carbon neutrality initiatives over 10 years

JetBlue: Net zero emissions by 2040—10 years ahead of the industry target

Rolls-Royce: All new aircraft engines compatible with 100% SAF by 2023

Role of Governments

Governments are stepping up with both carrots and sticks to accelerate aviation sustainability. The EU's RefuelEU Aviation regulation mandates minimum SAF blending starting at 2% in 2025 and ramping to 70% by 2050. The US Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for SAF production, making it more economically viable for producers.

R&D funding is flowing into breakthrough technologies: NASA's Advanced Air Mobility program is investing hundreds of millions in electric and hydrogen aircraft development. The European Union's Clean Aviation partnership has committed €4.1 billion to sustainable aviation technologies through 2030.

Conclusion

Here are the three key takeaways that matter most for aviation's sustainable future:

SAF is the near-term game-changer: Despite current production challenges, it's the most viable path to significant emissions reductions before 2035

Operational optimization delivers immediate wins: Quantum-powered simulation tools and AI-driven flight management are already reducing fuel consumption today

Long-term solutions require coordinated investment: Electric and hydrogen aircraft show promise, but success depends on infrastructure development and regulatory support

Then there were tax credits for SAF production and blending.
We need the same story in the SAF ecosystem.","Having earlier worked in this domain in India, how do you see the country’s SAF ecosystem?

I have witnessed this ecosystem for more than 10 years in India. I’d say India is headed in the right direction and should do fine in meeting the initial requirements. Interestingly, India wants to come up with its tailor-made policies which can help its own ecosystem. The country has announced its intent to have time-bound SAF blending targets. But we are yet to see a firm roadmap and the implementation plan. Various Indian energy companies are working on SAF projects. These companies have always come forward to do what is required by the government and international commitments. So, I’m positive about India. The question is would India be happy just doing the bare minimum to meet mandates and requirements? Or does it want to be ahead of the curve and start making SAF not just for Indian airlines, but also for international airlines operating to India? There is enough ethanol supply in the country, and some of it can be diverted to make SAF… India wants to export ethanol, and similarly, SAF also presents a similar opportunity. There can be a ‘make in India for the world’ opportunity in SAF. India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050.

What is it that India should do to meet SAF requirements as well as become an SAF manufacturing hub?

India should prioritise feedstock for the production of SAF without waiting further, leverage the existing refining capability, invest in the research and innovation and new technologies. Funding should be made available to projects as well as the feedstock aggregation supply chains. It also needs to be ensured that the SAF manufactured in India meets all sustainability certification criteria, and that needs to start now, not when the plants are ready for production.

Europe already has SAF blending mandates which have come much before CORSIA’s mandatory phase kicks in (from 2027). Is it a move in the right direction?

Mandates and incentives need to come together in the right proportion. While there is already a mandate in Europe, the fundamental question is about the ecosystem, is it ready? That ecosystem readiness was not there, and in such a scenario, mandates aren’t going to really be effective. Much of the SAF being used in Europe is coming from different continents. Does it even make sense, considering long-haul transportation of the fuel itself would have a high carbon footprint? That is why we are asking for incentives to be brought in so that the local ecosystem is prepared with enough domestic production.

Why does IATA seem to be opposed to the way Europe is going about SAF mandates?

What airlines are being charged for SAF in Europe is not on a cost-plus basis. They are being charged exorbitant compliance fees and there is no transparency in the cost structure. We don’t understand what is the rationale behind these high numbers. We estimate that this non-transparent compliance fee is adding an additional $1.7 billion to the cost of SAF for airlines in Europe on top of the cost of SAF, which itself is quite high. It was already a supply-constrained market and then you (Europe) introduced mandates, which essentially means that the airline is bound to buy SAF at any price, or be penalised…Also, our position on SAF is that it should be feedstock agnostic and technology neutral. All technologies should compete, and the market forces would lead to the best and the most efficient ones being picked up. But Europe has put a sub-mandate for the power-to-liquid (PTL) pathway for SAF production. That puts other pathways and technologies (like alcohol-to-jet, which various companies are working on) at a disadvantage.

Unlike what is happening in Europe, the US is seen as a success story on SAF use. What did they do differently?

The US provided incentives around the value chain. In one sense, Europe and the US are very similar, in that they provided a lot of funding and research for these technologies to mature. But the US went a step ahead. They provided production-linked incentives, they subsidised the feedstock, gave other incentives that led to the SAF feedstock supply chain being streamlined there, etc. Then there were tax credits for SAF production and blending. Additionally, apart from the central or federal incentives, some US states also had their own incentive plans. Many of the SAF facilities also need hydrogen, so the US also provided some incentives for green hydrogen production. Essentially, they worked on bits and pieces across the SAF value chain.

Are US-like incentives the answer for boosting SAF production? Is it something that can easily be replicated in other parts of the world?

There is enough biorefinery capacity around the world. The question is, how can governments provide the right incentives for these biorefineries to switch their production in the favour of SAF. A biorefinery is not built specifically for renewable diesel or SAF for that matter. These capacities can swing very quickly to produce SAF. We can have sufficient production of SAF to meet the airlines’ demand—voluntary as well as the mandates. Governments should seriously look at incentives for SAF production, like facilitating offtake, providing subsidies, etc… Let’s take the example of solar and wind in India and elsewhere. Governments provided production-linked incentives, tax holidays, and subsidies. We need the same story in the SAF ecosystem.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/07/Untitled-design-6.jpg,N,,2025-07-01 13:10:16.816300

Commenting on the development, Anil Chalamalasetty, Founder and CEO of AM Green, said, “This transaction is a significant milestone toward building one of the world’s most fully integrated and scalable green energy platforms. We thank ORIX for their ongoing partnership and confidence in our long-term vision.”

The deal enhances AM Green’s upstream integration capabilities through its strengthened partnership with Greenko, one of India’s largest renewable energy companies. Greenko operates over 10 gigawatts (GW) of renewable and pumped storage assets and is known for its innovation in large-scale energy storage. The company is currently developing what is expected to be the world’s largest “Intelligent Energy Storage Cloud Platform,” which will offer more than 100 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of daily storage capacity by 2030.

In addition to its energy storage and renewable generation capabilities, AM Green has set ambitious targets for the production of green fuels. The company plans to produce 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia. Construction of its first green ammonia project, with a 1 MTPA capacity, is already underway in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh. Furthermore, the company is also advancing projects related to green hydrogen (targeting 1 MTPA capacity), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and low-carbon products such as caustic soda, ethanol, and high-value bio-based chemicals. These efforts are being supported by AMG’s proprietary Chempolis technology.

With this acquisition and strategic investment from ORIX, AM Green is well-positioned to accelerate the development of its next-generation clean energy platform and reinforce its leadership in the global transition to sustainable fuels.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-01 12:18:15.160212

UK and global SAF production remains extremely limited, increasing the risk of missing mandate targets, according to the Climate Change Committee.
Roger Tyers, T&E UK’s Aviation Policy Manager advised, ""The UK Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) bill is a welcome world-first.
It will create a revenue certainty mechanism, which will be vital to create investor confidence and kick-start domestic SAF production.
Consider e-SAF production as a key energy-intensive industry, as outlined in the recent industrial strategy, and eligible to benefit from lower electricity costs.","To reduce aviation emissions, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has a key immediate role to play, alongside other longer-term measures. SAF covers a range of lower-carbon alternatives to conventional aviation kerosene. Unlike hydrogen or battery powered aircraft, SAF can be used immediately in existing aircraft as a ‘drop in’ fuel, without needing to adapt fuel delivery infrastructure.

To support the shift to SAF, the UK Government has already created a SAF mandate. From January 2025, this requires fuel suppliers to use a minimum proportion of SAF in the UK aviation fuel mix, rising from 2% in 2025 to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

UK and global SAF production remains extremely limited, increasing the risk of missing mandate targets, according to the Climate Change Committee. Major oil companies remain largely absent from the sector, which is dominated by start-up projects often viewed as high-risk by private investors. To address these barriers, , the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill to parliament in May 2025.

The bill will create a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ (RCM) to provide financial reassurance to investors in UK SAF plants, by creating a guaranteed price for SAF, known as the strike price. If the market price falls below this strike price, the SAF producer receives a top-up payment to cover the difference. Conversely, if the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays back the difference. The RCM is the first of its kind in the world and is a welcome innovation, especially as it will be funded by a levy on fuel suppliers under the ‘polluter pays’ principle, rather than by taxpayers.

However, not all SAF types are equally sustainable or scalable; government legislation should reflect this.

E-SAF—synthetic fuel made from air-captured carbon and renewable hydrogen—has the greatest decarbonisation potential, cutting lifecycle emissions by over 90% and avoiding land-use impacts and feedstock constraints of other SAFs. Only e-SAF can meet long-term aviation demand sustainably and at scale.

Roger Tyers, T&E UK’s Aviation Policy Manager advised, ""The UK Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) bill is a welcome world-first. It will create a revenue certainty mechanism, which will be vital to create investor confidence and kick-start domestic SAF production.

The Government must now earmark part of the revenue support toward the production of synthetic e-SAF - the most scalable and sustainable form of SAF. This will be good for energy security, economic growth, exports and UK jobs in the production of a fuel of the future. Otherwise there is a real risk that RCM funding will flow only to less sustainable biofuel projects.""

UK and EU airline mandates will soon drive demand for e-SAF. With global competition expected for limited supply, imports alone won’t suffice. The RCM offers a chance to secure UK-produced e-SAF, helping meet both domestic targets and international demand. Since the UK currently imports over 60% of its jet fuel, domestic e-SAF production could retain value and reduce dependency on foreign petrostates.

The ensure the RCM is effective, the government should implement the following measures:

Amend the SAF bill so that it explicitly commits a proportion of RCM support to e-SAF projects - at least enough to enable production to meet the SAF Mandate e-SAF quota of around 65,000 tonnes of e-SAF in 2030, equating to one large plant.

Consider e-SAF production as a key energy-intensive industry, as outlined in the recent industrial strategy, and eligible to benefit from lower electricity costs.

In June 2025, over 130 organisations—including T&E, NGOs, investors, and e-SAF producers—signed a joint appeal urging the government to use the RCM to back e-SAF production. This would secure the UK a ‘first mover’ advantage, boost energy security, and support jobs and exports. Without such support, the bill and RCM risk being a significant missed opportunity.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Aviation-fuels-and-climate-plan.png?mtime=1714401411,N,,2025-07-01 14:10:43.928765

This growth outpaces the 2.2% growth increase recorded during the same period in 2024.

The domestic market drove the rebound, with passenger numbers rising 5.4% to 25.5 million. This follows a 3.9% decline in 2024 due to the temporary grounding of Volaris and VivaAerobus aircraft for engine inspections.

In contrast, international carriers saw minimal growth, with a 0.4% increase to 18.5 million passengers. Traffic in the US–Mexico market declined by 4.4%, tempering the 6% growth seen in 2024.

Aeroméxico expanded its international operations, carrying 7.1 million passengers abroad—a 6.9% year-over-year increase. The airline plans to launch a new Mexico City–Philadelphia route in collaboration with Delta Air Lines.

Domestically, Volaris led in total passengers from January to May, transporting 11.3 million. Viva followed closely with 11.1 million and Aeroméxico ranked third with 9.8 million passengers. However, in May, Viva surpassed Volaris for the first time, carrying 2.3 million passengers compared to Volaris’ 2.2 million.

“Passenger traffic remained stable, with a resilient load factor of 84.8%, supported by ongoing efforts to optimize our route network and capacity,” said Viva CEO Juan Carlos Zuazua in the airline’s May operational report.

AFAC data highlighted the busiest domestic routes:

Mexico City–Cancun

Mexico City–Madrid (+1.1%)

Dallas/Fort Worth–Cancún

Los Angeles–Guadalajara

Chicago–Cancun (-19.2%).

AFAC forecasts that total air passenger numbers in Mexico will reach approximately 123 million by the end of 2025.

On June 10, Jesús Antonio Esteva Medina, Ministry of Infrastructure, Communications, and Transport (SICT), announced an expected 3%–5% growth in Mexico’s air transport sector during the current administration. A key initiative driving this growth is the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–80% and create over 3,500 jobs. The first SAF-powered flight is scheduled for late 2025, with broader implementation in 2027.

Despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, constrained capacity has led to higher load factors, increased fares, and improved profitability for some airlines, according to John Grant, chief analyst, OAG.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects US$36 billion in global airline profits for 2025, with a net margin of 3.7%. While still low for a capital-intensive industry, the outlook is bolstered by steady growth in Latin America, driven largely by low-cost carriers.

Grant noted that, despite global economic uncertainty and a forecasted slowdown in GDP growth from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.5% in 2025, the aviation industry’s performance in the first half of 2025 has exceeded expectations.

The move aligns with the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) global emissions reduction plan, which will become mandatory in 2027. Under the new guidelines, airlines operating international flights involving Turkey will be required to use enough SAF to meet the 5% reduction target. Fuel suppliers and oil refiners will also be expected to play their part.

Jet fuel producers in Turkey, including Tupras and Socar, will be required to begin SAF production. Tupras, the country’s largest oil refiner, plans to start producing 20,000 metric tons of SAF in 2026 and aims to scale up to 400,000 tons with the construction of a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment decision. Local biofuel company DB Tarimsal Enerji also plans to build a new facility to produce 100,000 tons of SAF.

According to the civil aviation authority, a minimum share of SAF must be loaded within Turkey—airline operators will be required to load 90% of their SAF for international flights at Turkish airports. Fuel suppliers that fail to meet the new targets will face penalties, the authority added.

The aviation sector is currently responsible for about 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

Built for the future of sustainable aviation “The E2 is central to our strategy to build a modern, efficient fleet with strong performance.
SAS continues to strengthen its overall network and international reach while enhancing connectivity between regional cities and global destinations through more seamless and sustainable operations.","Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) has entered into an agreement to acquire 45 Embraer (NYSE: ERJ; B3: EMBR3) E195-E2 aircraft, with purchase rights for an additional 10 aircraft — the largest SAS jet order direct from a manufacturer since 1996. This milestone agreement supports SAS’ long-term fleet renewal strategy, which is focused on increasing efficiency, reducing emissions, and unlocking future growth opportunities from its global hub in Copenhagen as well as across its Scandinavian and international network.

The first aircraft deliveries from Embraer are scheduled to begin in late 2027, with further deliveries extending over approximately four years. Excluding purchase rights, the value for the order is approximately US$4 billion.

“This is a defining moment for SAS,” says Anko van der Werff, President & CEO, SAS. “The Embraer E195-E2 is a world-class aircraft, combining outstanding performance with excellent fuel efficiency and comfort. This aircraft is key to enabling future growth and improved connectivity across Scandinavia and beyond. We’ve taken the time to make the right decision — and this major investment reflects our confidence in the future and the strength of the agreement we’ve secured.”

The E195-E2 will play a vital role in optimizing SAS’ operations and enhancing connectivity across Scandinavia and Europe. Its size and range are ideally suited to complement SAS’ existing fleet and route structure, allowing for more frequencies, better network flexibility, and lower trip costs.

Built for the future of sustainable aviation

“The E2 is central to our strategy to build a modern, efficient fleet with strong performance. It enables us to serve more routes with lower emissions, better economics, and a premium experience for our passengers,” adds Van der Werff. “Together with Embraer, we are setting the course for the next chapter of SAS.”

The E2 family of aircraft has already been tested with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and is in the process of being fully certified to fly on 100% SAF in the foreseeable future. Today blends of up to 50% SAF are already achievable.

Arjan Meijer, President and CEO Embraer Commercial Aviation, says: “We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with SAS through this landmark deal. The E2 is the quietest single aisle jet available today – 29% more fuel efficient and with a 62% reduction in noise footprint over the previous generation jet, the E195-E2 is a game-changer in terms of efficiency, performance, and passenger comfort.

Engine Support Limited (WMES). This transaction, finalized in June 2025, represents a critical pivot to amplify WLFC's role in aviation asset management while leveraging its partnership with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. The integration of BAML's technical expertise into WMES's operations could position the joint venture as a dominant player in global MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) markets, backed by a growing $380 million asset base.

The Strategic Rationale: Synergies and Scale

WLFC's decision to transfer BAML to WMES is a calculated play to consolidate its aviation services under a single, robust platform. By merging BAML's records management and technical consultancy with WMES's engine leasing and maintenance capabilities, the joint venture gains a full-suite offering for aviation clients. This vertical integration eliminates redundancies, streamlines operations, and enhances WMES's ability to compete in high-margin MRO services—a sector projected to grow at 5% annually through 2030.

The $45 million sale price for BAML, subject to working capital adjustments, injects liquidity into WLFC's balance sheet. This capital can be redirected toward high-potential initiatives, such as expanding its engine leasing fleet or advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects through its subsidiary, Willis Sustainable Fuels. Meanwhile, the renamed Willis Mitsui & Co. Asset Management Limited (WAML) will serve as WMES's technical backbone, enabling the joint venture to expand into markets like Asia and Europe, where demand for engine-related services is surging.

Financial and Operational Leverage

WLFC's ownership stake in WMES remains at 50%, ensuring it benefits directly from the joint venture's growth. WMES's current $380 million asset base—a figure expected to rise as WAML's expertise drives new deals—provides a solid foundation for scaling. Notably, WLFC's subsidiary, Willis Engine Structured Trust VIII, recently issued $596 million in asset-backed notes secured by 64 engines/airframes. This financing highlights the company's confidence in the underlying demand for aviation infrastructure.

Risks and Considerations

While the transaction is strategically sound, risks persist. Geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and oil price volatility could disrupt lessee compliance and asset valuations. Additionally, WLFC's Q1 2025 earnings missed EPS estimates, signaling potential operational headwinds. Insider trading data further raises eyebrows: executives, including CEO Austin Willis, sold over $10 million in shares in the past six months. While this could reflect personal financial decisions, it may also indicate caution about near-term volatility.

The Investment Thesis: Capitalizing on Undervalued Aviation Infrastructure

Despite these risks, WLFC's move into integrated aviation asset management aligns with sector tailwinds. As airlines and lessors increasingly prioritize cost efficiency and sustainability, WMES's expanded capabilities position it to capture a larger share of the $50 billion MRO market. Analysts at JPMorgan estimate that WMES could grow its asset base to $500 million by 2027, driven by WAML's technical services and Mitsui's global reach.

Investors should note that WLFC's stock trades at a discount to peers, with a P/B ratio of 1.2x compared to the sector average of 1.5x. This undervaluation, combined with WMES's growth potential, makes WLFC an attractive entry point for contrarian investors. The company's focus on sustainable aviation fuels and engine leasing—both key to decarbonizing aviation—also aligns with ESG trends, enhancing its long-term appeal.

Conclusion: A Strategic Play for Long-Term Gains

Willis Lease Finance Corporation's integration of BAML into WMES is a strategic masterstroke that strengthens its foothold in aviation asset management. While risks such as macroeconomic volatility remain, the transaction's synergies, liquidity injection, and Mitsui's backing suggest a compelling upside. Investors seeking exposure to undervalued aviation infrastructure plays should consider adding WLFC to their portfolios, particularly if they're willing to ride out short-term uncertainty for long-term growth.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO, UNITED STATES, July 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition, a national biodiesel trade association made up of over 70 organizational members throughout the biodiesel value chain, applauds the biofuel provisions added to the Senate budget-reconciliation legislation known as the “big, beautiful bill.” Introduced on June 28, the Senate version of the tax bill includes provisions for an immediate extension of the Section 40A Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. The value of the credit increases from 10 cents to 20 cents per gallon on the first 15 million gallons. It also makes the credit transferable so that pass-through entities such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and S corporations can access the credit and monetize it. This is important transitional relief to biodiesel producers, many of which have shut down this year since the biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC) expired on Dec. 31, 2024, while the industry awaits implementing regulations for its replacement, the Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z).

“Finding some transitional relief in 2025 has been SABR’s top priority,” said SABR CEO Joe Jobe.

The Senate bill also introduces several key improvements to Section 45Z, which will take effect in 2026. Some changes mirror those passed by the House of Representatives on May 22 while others differ significantly. The differences must be reconciled before the legislation can be sent to President Donald Trump for signing into law by the July 4 target date.

Like the House revisions, these improvements by the Senate include elimination of the failed theory of indirect land-use change (ILUC) that penalizes domestic agricultural feedstocks in modeling greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations.

A critical difference between the Senate’s modifications to 45Z and both existing law and changes passed by the House is that the Senate version seeks to put sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and on-road biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel on equal footing. Currently, SAF producers are eligible for up to $1.75 per gallon under Section 45Z, provided certain criteria are met, but biodiesel manufacturers can only receive up to a maximum of $1 per gallon.

While the House bill extends Section 45Z from its current sunset date of Dec. 31, 2027, to Dec. 31, 2031, the Senate version shortens this extension by two years and allows transferability of the credit through 2029.

Earlier modifications to Section 45Z from the Senate Finance Committee allowed feedstocks from outside the U.S. to claim the credit at a 20 percent discount to domestic inputs. Updated language in the full Senate bill, however, matches the House version and only allows feedstocks from North America to qualify for the incentive.

SABR reiterates that, because these changes do not take effect until 2026, it is important that Congress provides transitional relief now as a policy bridge to 2026.

“The amendments to the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit will make for dramatically better energy, agriculture and clean transportation policy,” Jobe said. “But those amendments take effect in 2026, and SABR has been educating members of Congress about the severe immediate harm to the biodiesel industry caused by the lack of policy clarity. SABR has been urging immediate extension of the Section 40A Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit and applauds its inclusion. While most biofuel advocates have been focused solely on ‘fixing’ 45Z beginning next year in the reconciliation bill, a top priority for SABR has been getting transitional relief for biodiesel producers this year. We thank Sen. Chuck Grassley and Finance Chair Mike Crapo for their work on this measure.”

Groundbreaking technology developed at Trinity, which captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is being put through its paces at Dublin Airport – with the team behind its creation hoping to demonstrate its wider potential for capturing carbon in the aviation and e-fuel industries.

The project has been funded by a prestigious European Innovation Council (EIC) Transition grant (AirInMotion) and supported by the Enterprise Ireland.

Developed by Prof. Wolfgang Schmitt and Dr Sebastien Vaesen from Trinity’s School of Chemistry and AMBER, the Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland Centre for Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research, this pioneering initiative focuses on delivering scalable, energy-efficient atmospheric carbon dioxide capture solutions to help reduce industrial emissions. This Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology is a critical tool in achieving net-zero targets and has the potential to drive real, measurable change in combating climate change.

This deployment marked the first industrial-scale field test of the technology. The demonstrator has been operating for three months at Dublin Airport, collecting critical data on efficiency, operational stability, and energy consumption. Insights gained from this deployment have provided crucial validation of the technology performance and will shape future development and commercial applications.

Prof. Wolfgang Schmitt pointed out the impact of this technology, stating, “Atmospheric carbon capture innovations are crucial because they directly address one of the most pressing challenges we face today—reducing carbon emissions from industries that can't easily eliminate them at the source. By advancing and integrating this technology across industries, we are not only reducing emissions but also creating economic opportunities through supplying high-purity CO₂ that align with global sustainability goals.”

“This technology has the potential to be a cornerstone in the global effort to combat climate change, and the idea that this could contribute to a solution that makes a real difference is incredibly motivating.”

Dr Sebastien Vaesen, technical lead, emphasised the transformative potential of the technology, adding: “Our technology is designed for industrial deployment, efficiently capturing CO₂ from the air while utilising low-grade waste heat from industries. We have enhanced CO₂ capture efficiency by integrating innovative design features and optimising key operational conditions using our laboratory test rig.”

“The deployment at Dublin Airport is a key validation for scaling up and allows us to gather critical performance data in a live operational setting and fine-tune it for long-term sustainable operation. Moreover, we are strongly committed to the technology commercialisation, and this deployment is a major stepping stone.”

This technology deployment aims to further demonstrate its potential for the aviation and e-fuel industries, directly addressing the European Commission's ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, which mandates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) comprise 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050. Furthermore, it also requires e-fuels, produced from renewable electricity and sustainable CO₂, to constitute 50% of the SAF.

Andrea Carroll, Director of Sustainability at daa, the operators of Dublin Airport, said: “We are pleased to support Trinity College Dublin's trial of carbon capture technology at Dublin Airport. This project offers daa an opportunity to explore carbon capture as a potential means of decarbonising our operations and industry. The collaboration between Trinity College Dublin and Dublin Airport exemplifies the kind of forward-thinking partnerships that are essential for driving innovation and real change as we all make our way towards a Net Zero world.”

Dr Elham Katoueizadeh, Project Developer for this technology, highlighted that developed over more than 10 years of research and innovation, this technology is now ready for large-scale implementation across industries, recognising the urgent need for scalable carbon capture solutions. Following the start of this field test, the team is focusing on securing additional investment and partnerships to expand and accelerate commercial adoption.",https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/top-stories/featured/trinitys-groundbreaking-carbon-capture-tech/media/tcd/news-images/IMG_0200.jpeg,N,,2025-07-01 08:02:21.656670

1 ReFuelEU-VO bestimmt, dass Fluggesellschaften die Verwendung ein und derselben Charge SAF nicht im Rahmen mehrerer Treibhausgasminderungssysteme geltend machen können.","1. Was ist SAF?

SAF ist eine Sammelbezeichnung für nachhaltige Flugkraftstoffe. Chemisch unterscheiden sie sich nicht wesentlich von fossilem Kerosin, weshalb sie ohne weiteres zur Betankung von herkömmlichen Flugzeugen verwendet werden können. SAF sind nicht lokal klimaneutral, d.h. sie emittieren bei der Verbrennung CO2. Jedoch können sie über ihren gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg bis zu 80 % an CO2-Emissionen gegenüber fossilem Kerosin einsparen. Das liegt daran, dass das emittierte CO2 vorher der Atmosphäre entzogen wurde. Es entsteht also ein CO2-Kreislauf. Es gibt unterschiedliche Arten von SAF. Art. 3 Nr. 7 Verordnung (EU) 2023/2405 des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates vom 18. Oktober 2023 zur Gewährleistung gleicher Wettbewerbsbedingungen für einen nachhaltigen Luftverkehr (Initiative ReFuelEU Aviation) („ReFuelEU-VO“) unterscheidet zwischen synthetischen Flugkraftstoffen, Biokraftstoffen für die Luftfahrt und wiederverwerteten kohlenstoffhaltigen Flugkraftstoffen.

Synthetische Flugkraftstoffe oder E-Kerosin wird durch die Synthese von Wasserstoff und CO2 hergestellt. Damit E-Kerosin klimafreundlich ist, muss der Wasserstoff klimaneutral erzeugt werden, z.B. durch erneuerbare Energien (grüner Wasserstoff) oder Kernenergie (roter Wasserstoff). Zudem muss das beigemischte CO2 der Atmosphäre vorab entzogen werden, z.B. mittels Direct-Air-Capture. Das Herstellungsverfahren wird auch Power-to-Liquid (PtL) genannt.

Biokraftstoffe für die Luftfahrt oder Biokerosin wird aus Biomasse hergestellt. Hierfür kommen unter anderem landwirtschaftliche Abfälle, Ölsaaten oder Algen in Betracht. Biokerosin ist klimafreundlich, da bei der Verbrennung nur CO2 freigesetzt wird, das zuvor während des Wachstums der Pflanzen oder Tiere, von denen die Biomasse stammt, in der Biomasse gebunden wurde.

Wiederverwertete kohlenstoffhaltige Kraftstoffe werden aus Abfällen nicht erneuerbaren Ursprungs hergestellt, z.B. Industrieabgasen. Sie sind nur klimafreundlich, wenn das bei der Verbrennung freigesetzte CO2 ohne die Wiederverwertung als Flugkraftstoff unmittelbar freigesetzt worden wäre.

Die deutsche und EU-Gesetzgebung stellen zum Teil zusätzliche Anforderungen an die einzelnen SAF-Varianten, was unter 2.4 und 3.1 dargestellt wird.

2. Was gilt in der Europäischen Union?

Die EU möchte mit der ReFuelEU-VO den Markthochlauf von SAF vorantreiben, indem sie die Beimischung eines steigenden Mindestanteils von SAF zu konventionellem Kerosin vorschreibt.

2.1 Flugkraftstoffanbieter

Nach Art. 4 Abs. 1 ReFuelEU-VO sind Flugkraftstoffanbieter verpflichtet, Kerosin einen Mindestanteil SAF beizumischen. Ab dem Jahr 2025 beträgt der Mindestanteil 2 %, ab 2030 6 % und bis 2050 steigt er auf 70 %. Ab 2030 gilt zudem eine Unterquote für synthetisches Kerosin. Danach ist konventionellem Kerosin mindestens 0,7 % synthetisches Kerosin beizumischen. Bis 2050 steigt die Unterquote für synthetisches Kerosin auf 35 %.

2.2 Fluggesellschaften

Fluggesellschaften sind gem. Art. 5 Abs. 1 ReFuelEU-VO verpflichtet, mindestens 90 % ihres Jahresbedarfs an Kerosin für Flüge, die in der EU starten, an Flughäfen in der EU zu tanken. Eine Unterschreitung dieses Schwellenwertes ist nach Art. 5 Abs. 2 ReFuelEU-VO aus Gründen der Kraftstoffsicherheit zulässig. Dies dient zur Einhaltung bestimmter Pflichtreserven, um z.B. Ausweichflughäfen erreichen zu können.

Die Betankungspflicht soll verhindern, dass Fluggesellschaften zum Tanken auf Flughäfen außerhalb der EU ausweichen, um dort günstigeres Kerosin ohne beigemischtes SAF zu tanken.

2.3 Anforderungen an SAF

Synthetische Flugkraftstoffe werden in Art. 3 Nr. 12 ReFuelEU-VO nicht unmittelbar definiert. Stattdessen verweist die Norm auf die Definition der erneuerbaren Kraftstoffe nicht biogenen Ursprungs („RFNBO“) nach Art. 2 Abs. 2 Nr. 36 Richtlinie (EU) 2018/2001 des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates vom 11. Dezember 2018 zur Förderung der Nutzung von Energie aus erneuerbaren Quellen (Neufassung) („RED III“). RFNBO sind danach Kraftstoffe, deren Energiegehalt aus erneuerbaren Energiequellen mit Ausnahme von Biomasse stammt. In RED III finden sich zudem weitere Anforderungen. Für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe gelten aber nur Art. 29 Abs. 1 und 30 RED III, denn nur hierauf verweist Art. 3 Nr. 12 ReFuelEU-VO. Danach muss synthetischer Flugkraftstoff im Laufe seines Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führen und entsprechend zertifiziert sein. Hingegen erfolgt kein Verweis auf Art. 27 Abs. 6 RED III. Damit gelten für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe auch nicht die Vorgaben für RFNBO nach der Delegierten Verordnung (EU) 2023/1184 der Kommission zur Ergänzung der RED III durch die Festlegung einer Unionsmethode mit detaillierten Vorschriften für die Erzeugung flüssiger oder gasförmiger erneuerbarer Kraftstoffe nicht biogenen Ursprungs für den Verkehr, die auf Art. 27 Abs. 6 RED III basiert (mehr dazu unter 3.1).

Kein synthetischer Flugkraftstoff ist nach der Definition synthetischer Flugkraftstoff, für dessen Herstellung Wasserstoff durch Kernenergie erzeugt wurde (roter Wasserstoff). Jedoch kann dieser nach Art. 3 Nr. 13 ReFuelEU-VO als synthetischer kohlenstoffarmer Flugkraftstoff gelten, wenn er im Laufe seines Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führt und entsprechend zertifiziert ist. Kohlenstoffarme Flugkraftstoffe (sowie erneuerbarer und kohlenstoffarmer Wasserstoff) können nach Art. 4 Abs. 2 ReFuelEU-VO anstelle von SAF verwendet werden.

Biokraftstoffe für die Luftfahrt werden in Art. 3 Nr. 8 ReFuelEU-VO auch mit Verweis auf RED III definiert. Danach wird unterschieden zwischen:

Fortschriftlichen Biokraftstoffen, die aus den in Anhang IX Teil A RED III aufgeführten Rohstoffen (z.B. Algen, Gülle oder Nussschalen) hergestellt werden,

Biokraftstoffen, die aus den in Anhang IX Teil B RED III aufgeführten Rohstoffen (z.B. gebrauchtes Speiseöl, tierische Fette oder Abwasser) hergestellt werden, und

sonstigen Biokraftstoffen, die nicht aus Nahrungsmittel- und Futtermittelpflanzen hergestellt werden, die im Laufe ihres Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führen.

Hintergrund des Ausschlusses von Nahrungs- und Futtermittelpflanzen für die Herstellung von Biokraftstoff für die Luftfahrt ist nach Erwägungsgrund 23 ReFuelEU-VO, dass eine Flächenkonkurrenz und eine damit einhergehende erhöhte Landnutzung vermieden werden sollen.

Für wiederverwertete kohlenstoffhaltige Kraftstoffe gilt nach Art. 3 Nr. 9 ReFuelEU-VO und Art. 2 Nr. 35 RED III ebenfalls, dass sie im Laufe ihres Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führen und entsprechend zertifiziert sein müssen. Zusätzlich müssen sie aus flüssigem oder festem Abfall hergestellt werden, der für eine stoffliche Verwertung nach Art. 4 Richtlinie 2008/98/EG (EU-Abfallrichtlinie) nicht geeignet ist, oder aus Gas aus der Abfallverarbeitung oder Abgas, das zwangsläufig und unbeabsichtigt infolge der Produktionsprozesse in Industrieanlagen entstehen. Damit soll sichergestellt werden, dass bei der Verbrennung des Flugkraftstoffs tatsächlich nur CO2 freigesetzt wird, dass ohnehin freigesetzt worden wäre.

2.4 Verhältnis zum EHS und CORSIA

Bereits vor Inkrafttreten der SAF-Quote unterlag der innereuropäische Luftverkehr dem EU-Emissionshandelssystem („EHS“). Danach müssen Emittenten für jede Tonne emittiertes CO2 Zertifikate erwerben. Da die Gesamtmenge der Zertifikate jährlich sinkt, sinken somit auch jährlich die Gesamtemissionen der erfassten Sektoren. Nicht-innereuropäische Flüge unterliegen seit 2021 dem Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA verpflichtet Fluggesellschaften zur Begrenzung der CO2-Emissionen auf das Niveau des Jahres 2019. Das Wachstum der Branche soll dadurch klimaneutral sein. Darüberhinausgehende Emissionen müssen kompensiert werden.

Art. 9 Abs. 1 ReFuelEU-VO bestimmt, dass Fluggesellschaften die Verwendung ein und derselben Charge SAF nicht im Rahmen mehrerer Treibhausgasminderungssysteme geltend machen können. Fluggesellschaften müssen sich demnach entscheiden, ob sie eine Charge SAF entweder auf ihre Verpflichtungen nach dem EHS oder nach CORSIA anwenden wollen. SAF haben im EHS und bei CORSIA einen Emissionsfaktor von null, d.h. sie gelten nicht als Verursacher von Treibhausgasemissionen. Zudem erhalten Fluggesellschaften nach Art. 3c Abs. 6 Richtlinie 2003/87/EG (EHS-Richtlinie) im Zeitraum von 2024 bis 2030 bis zu 20 Millionen kostenlose Emissionszertifikate für die Verwendung von SAF. Noch weiter gehen möchte die neue Bundesregierung. Im Koalitionsvertrag heißt es, dass die Hälfte der EHS-Einnahmen aus der Luftfahrt zur Förderung des Markthochlaufs von SAF verwendet werden sollen.

3. Was gilt zusätzlich in Deutschland?

In Deutschland gilt auch eine nationale Beimischungsquote für Kraftstoff aus erneuerbaren Energien nicht-biogenen Ursprungs für Kerosin. Nach § 37a Abs. 4a BImSchG gilt die Quote ab 2026 und beträgt 0,5 %, 1 % ab 2028 und 2 % ab 2030. Die Zukunft dieser nationalen Quote ist ungewiss. Im Koalitionsvertrag hat sich die schwarz-rote Koalition auf ihre Abschaffung verständigt. Ein am 19. Juni 2025 veröffentlichter Referentenentwurf eines zweiten Gesetzes zur Weiterentwicklung der Treibhausgasminderungs-Quote sieht vor, die nationale SAF-Quote durch eine allgemeine Quote für alle Verkehrsbereiche zu ersetzen.

3.1 Nationale Anforderungen an SAF

Die Anforderungen an den beigemischten Kraftstoff sind in der 37. BImSchV geregelt. Dabei übernimmt § 2 Abs. 3 37. BImSchV die EU-Definition von RFNBO nach Art. 2 Abs. 2 Nr. 36 RED III. Dennoch gibt es Unterschiede zur EU-Definition von synthetischem Flugkraftstoff. Wie bei der EU-SAF-Quote muss nach § 10 Abs. 1 37. BImSchV mindestens eine Treibhausgasminderung von 70 % erreicht und dies auch entsprechend der EU-Methodik nachgewiesen werden. Hinzu kommen jedoch die Anforderungen nach den §§ 3 ff. 37. BImSchV. Diese entsprechen den Anforderungen der Delegierten Verordnung (EU) 2023/1184, die für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe nach der EU-SAF-Quote gerade nicht gilt.

Der Strom für die Erzeugung von RFNBO muss grundsätzlich folgende Kriterien erfüllen:

Zusätzliche Stromerzeugung, § 6 37. BImSchV: RFNBO sollen nur mit Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien erzeugt werden, der in Anlagen (Windparks, PV-Parks, etc.) erzeugt wurde, die zusätzlich zu bestehenden Anlagen errichtet worden sind.

Zeitliche Korrelation, § 7 37. BImSchV: Der Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien soll in einem engen zeitlichen Rahmen mit seinem Verbrauch zur Herstellung von RFNBO erzeugt werden.

Geografische Korrelation, § 8 37. BImSchV: Der Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien soll in derselben Stromgebotszone erzeugt werden, in der er zur RFNBO-Herstellung verbraucht wird.

In Deutschland gilt somit, anders als im Rest der EU, bereits vor 2030 eine Beimischungsquote für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe (und nicht nur für SAF im Allgemeinen), die 2030 deutlich über der EU-Quote von 0,7 % liegen wird und strengere Anforderungen an die Herstellung des Kraftstoffs stellt.

3.2 Verhältnis zur EU-SAF-Quote

Da es sich bei der EU-SAF-Quote ausweislich des Wortlauts der Verordnung um einen „Mindestanteil“ handelt, ist der nationale Gesetzgeber berechtigt, darüberhinausgehende Anforderungen zu festzulegen. Konkret bedeutet das, dass die nationale Quote insoweit greift, wie sie nicht bereits durch Erfüllung der EU-SAF-Quote geboten ist. Für synthetischen Flugkraftstoff gelten zudem in Höhe der nationalen Quote die strengeren Anforderungen nach der 37. BImSchV.

4. Fazit und Ausblick

Die EU-SAF-Quote ist grundsätzlich positiv zu sehen, da sie einen Anreiz für einen Markthochlauf von SAF schaffen kann. Da alternative, klimaneutrale Antriebssysteme für Flugzeuge absehbar nicht zur Verfügung stehen, ist auch nicht zu befürchten, dass es zu einer Bevorzugung oder Benachteiligung einzelner Technologien kommt. Zudem wurde ein gutes Zusammenspiel mit dem Emissionshandel gefunden. Die SAF-Quote stellt nämlich keine zusätzliche Verpflichtung zur Emissionsreduktion dar, sondern weist einen Weg zur Erfüllung der Verpflichtungen zur Emissionsreduktion.

Fraglich ist hingegen, ob die vorgeschriebenen Quoten auch zu einem Markthochlauf in dem gewünschten Umfang führen werden, sodass die Preise tatsächlich sinken. Hierzu wäre denkbar, die hinter SAF steckende Technologie (E-Fuels) auch für andere Branchen als die Flugbranche zu öffnen, beispielsweise für die Automobilindustrie, was politisch umstritten ist. Schließlich wirft die neue Koalition mit Recht die Frage nach der Sinnhaftigkeit einer zusätzlichen deutschen SAF-Quote auf.

As the Swedish engineering giant prepares to showcase its latest advancements at its new Flemingsberg site, the focus will be on how strategic innovation and aggressive sustainability targets are driving long-term value.

Accelerating Sustainability: From Net Zero to Global Impact

Alfa Laval's sustainability commitments are not merely aspirational—they are operational. The company has already advanced its net zero target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions to 2027, three years ahead of its original 2030 goal. This acceleration is underpinned by investments in renewable energy, energy-efficient processes, and a shift away from fossil fuels in its global operations.

But the ambition extends beyond its own footprint. Alfa Laval's solutions directly enable industries to decarbonize. For instance, its ammonia fuel supply system (FCM Ammonia)—now contracted for seven new LPG/ammonia carriers—could redefine maritime shipping. By 2025, these systems will be operational, positioning Alfa Laval as a critical enabler for the global shift to low-carbon marine fuels.

The company's acquisition of Fives Cryogenics (valued at €800 million) further amplifies its role in green energy transitions. Cryogenic heat transfer technologies are vital for industries such as hydrogen production and LNG storage, sectors expected to boom as renewable energy adoption accelerates.

Innovation-Driven Growth: A Pipeline of High-Impact Technologies

Alfa Laval's innovation engine is fueling both top-line growth and ESG leadership. Key highlights include:

- Food Innovation Center in Copenhagen: Addressing the UN's projected 70% rise in global food demand by 2050, this facility will develop technologies to reduce waste and energy use in food production.

- NRG Marine Acquisition: Ultrasonic anti-fouling systems cut vessel fuel consumption by up to 15%, directly aligning with maritime decarbonization targets.

- Biofuel Contracts: A SEK 350 million deal to supply HVO pre-treatment technology for Europe's largest biofuel facility underscores Alfa Laval's role in scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

These initiatives are not siloed. They form a cohesive strategy to dominate markets where sustainability and efficiency are paramount. The company's 2024 sales of SEK 66.9 billion (up 5% year-on-year) and a proposed dividend of SEK 8.50 per share reflect financial resilience amid these strategic bets.

Investment Case: Long-Term Value in a Transition Economy

Alfa Laval's dual focus on operational sustainability and customer-driven innovation creates a compelling investment thesis. Key drivers include:

1. Decarbonization Tailwinds: Global spending on green energy infrastructure is projected to reach $1.8 trillion annually by 2030 (IEA). Alfa Laval's heat transfer, separation, and fluid-handling solutions are indispensable in this shift.

2. Scalable Partnerships: Collaborations with firms like SSAB (for low-carbon steel) and Outokumpu demonstrate how cross-industry synergies can reduce emissions and open new revenue streams.

3. Strong Balance Sheet: A robust cash flow and disciplined capital allocation (e.g., the Fives Cryogenics buy) suggest management's ability to execute on growth while maintaining shareholder returns.

Risks and Considerations

Investors must weigh macroeconomic headwinds, such as potential slowdowns in industrial demand, and the execution risks of ambitious targets. However, Alfa Laval's track record—e.g., hitting Scope 1/2 net zero three years early—suggests strong execution capability.

Conclusion: A Leader in the Transition to a Sustainable Economy

Alfa Laval's 2025 Capital Markets Day will likely reinforce its position as a strategic partner for industries undergoing decarbonization. With a clear path to its SEK 100 billion sales target by 2030, coupled with innovations addressing critical sustainability challenges, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on structural shifts in energy, food, and transport.

For investors seeking exposure to companies that blend ESG leadership with tangible financial growth, Alfa Laval merits serious consideration. The stock's historical outperformance relative to peers (see data query above) and its expanding addressable markets suggest it could remain a standout name in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

This move demonstrates Qantas’s commitment to balancing route expansion with environmental responsibility, as the A321XLR’s long-range capability allows direct connections to new destinations using less fuel than previous models. With this aircraft certified to operate on up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and designed for future 100 percent SAF usage, Qantas is not only increasing its operational efficiency but also reinforcing its pledge to reduce the carbon footprint of its fleet—placing it at the forefront of sustainable air travel innovation.

Qantas has officially become the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to take delivery of the Airbus A321XLR, ushering in a transformative era for long-range narrowbody operations. The arrival of this aircraft marks a milestone in the airline’s ambitious fleet renewal strategy, one that prioritizes range, fuel efficiency, and environmental performance in response to evolving global travel demand.

Airbus has handed over the first A321XLR to Qantas from its final assembly site in Hamburg, Germany. The aircraft is now en route to Sydney, making only one scheduled stop in Bangkok for refueling and crew rest. This nearly nonstop journey highlights the aircraft’s impressive long-range performance and operational efficiency. With this capability, the A321XLR is poised to redefine route networks by seamlessly connecting domestic and international destinations that once required larger, less efficient widebody jets.

Qantas has outfitted its new A321XLR with a dual-class cabin design, featuring 20 seats in Business Class and 177 in Economy. This configuration reflects the airline’s focus on delivering a blend of passenger comfort, optimized seating capacity, and operational flexibility across a wide range of routes. Initially, the aircraft will serve busy domestic corridors within Australia, replacing aging models with higher fuel consumption. As more A321XLRs are integrated into the fleet, Qantas aims to expand their use to longer international routes, especially targeting secondary destinations in Asia that currently lack direct service.

The A321XLR is powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, known for their advanced fuel-efficiency and reduced noise profile. These engines, paired with a new fuel tank configuration and reinforced landing gear, enable the aircraft to reach a range of up to 4,700 nautical miles—the longest of any single-aisle commercial jet currently in service. This gives airlines the flexibility to open direct city-pair connections that would otherwise be unprofitable or operationally impractical using widebody aircraft.

As part of its broad fleet renewal initiative, the Qantas Group has placed a firm order for 40 Airbus A321XLR aircraft. Of this total, 28 jets will be integrated into the mainline Qantas fleet, while 12 are slated for operation by Jetstar, the group’s low-cost division. This acquisition falls within a broader purchasing agreement with Airbus, which also includes 128 aircraft from the A320neo single-aisle family and 24 long-range A350-1000 widebodies. The overarching goal of the modernization effort is to phase out older aircraft, enhance fuel and cost efficiency, and enable the airline to expand across both domestic routes and new international markets.

Airbus developed the A321XLR as the next evolution in its A320neo family to meet growing market demand for longer-range narrowbody jets. The aircraft introduces significant improvements in fuel efficiency and environmental performance compared to older models. In real-world airline operations, the A321XLR consumes significantly less fuel per seat-mile while producing fewer emissions, making it an attractive option for carriers seeking to improve sustainability metrics.

Beyond its impressive range and cost efficiency, the A321XLR supports the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. The aircraft is already approved to fly using blends containing up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and Airbus aims to make it fully compatible with 100% SAF by 2030. This forward-looking capability makes the A321XLR a key asset for airlines seeking to modernize their fleets with environmentally responsible solutions.

For Qantas, the A321XLR presents an opportunity to expand its network in ways that were previously not viable. The combination of long range and smaller capacity allows the airline to serve medium-demand international destinations directly, eliminating the need for layovers or fleet swaps. This strategy will improve connectivity for travelers, reduce travel times, and support tourism and business links between Australia and emerging markets across Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.

The aircraft also offers advantages in terms of passenger experience. Cabin features include larger overhead storage, quieter engines, mood lighting, and improved air filtration systems. These enhancements help position the A321XLR as not only a fuel-efficient performer but also a traveler-friendly option for journeys of up to eight hours in duration.

The entry of the A321XLR into Qantas’s fleet supports broader aviation trends toward right-sizing aircraft on long-distance routes. As demand patterns shift and sustainability becomes a greater focus, airlines are investing in versatile aircraft that offer both performance and efficiency. The success of the A321XLR in global markets reflects this trend, with more than 500 orders already placed by carriers around the world.

Qantas is leading the way in the Asia-Pacific by being the first to put this aircraft type into commercial service. This step further strengthens the airline’s role as an innovator in fleet transformation and route development. As more A321XLRs join its fleet, Qantas is expected to expand nonstop services to regional destinations in countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India—routes that traditionally required stopovers or larger aircraft.

The aircraft’s arrival is timely as Qantas rebuilds its network in the post-pandemic era, focusing on flexibility, cost control, and environmental responsibility. The A321XLR supports all three pillars, giving the airline a tool that fits modern travel needs without compromising on range or passenger comfort.

Qantas is leading sustainable aviation by deploying its first Airbus A321XLR, expanding its route network while cutting fuel use and emissions through advanced long-range design and Sustainable Aviation Fuel capability.

As the aviation industry continues to rebound and evolve, Qantas’s early adoption of the A321XLR sets a benchmark for others in the region.

The strategic partnership is expected to help the UK’s flagship carrier reduce lifecycle carbon emissions of approximately 400,000 metric tonnes, compared with use of the same volume of conventional jet fuel.

This reduction is equivalent to the total emissions of flying 240,000 economy class passengers on return flights between London and New York.

As part of its sustainability roadmap, British Airways has committed to powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 (the UK government has since set a SAF Mandate).

EcoCeres will provide SAF produced from 100% waste-based biomass feedstock, such as used cooking oil (UCO). This SAF has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces.

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, said of the move: “We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation.

“Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership exemplifies our dedication to providing innovative fuel solutions that will help the aviation industry meet its environmental targets. Together, we are contributing to the broader effort of reducing emissions in transportation.”

Carrie Harris, Director of Sustainability at British Airways, added: “We see sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as an important part of our BA Better World strategy. In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13% reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes.
The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.
The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president sustainability and chief economist.
The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president sustainability and chief economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

By embedding sustainability into its operational core—through fleet upgrades, emissions reduction initiatives, and expanded public safety roles—the company is not only mitigating risks but also unlocking new revenue streams. For investors, Bristow's strategic pivot offers a compelling case of how ESG leadership can translate into long-term growth and resilience.

Environmental Stewardship: Modernization Meets Climate Ambition

Bristow's recent fleet modernization, highlighted by the acquisition of 10 Leonardo AW189 helicopters (with options for 10 more), stands as a cornerstone of its environmental strategy. These aircraft reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 20% compared to older models and are fully compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This shift aligns with Norway's push for zero-emission aviation, where Bristow has partnered on pilot programs to test next-generation technologies.

The environmental benefits extend beyond emissions. Bristow's 2024 Sustainability Report notes a 32% reduction in lost workdays due to improved safety protocols—a metric that underscores the dual advantage of modern, efficient equipment. Meanwhile, the company's transition to electric ground vehicles and renewable energy at global facilities further reduces its carbon footprint.

Social Impact: SAR Expansion and Community Trust

Bristow's leadership in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations amplifies its social value. Expanding SAR contracts into Ireland—adding to existing mandates in the UK, Netherlands, and Falkland Islands—has bolstered its role in public safety. In 2024 alone, its UK SAR team conducted 2,870 missions, rescuing 470 people, while the Bristow Uplift initiative donated over $600,000 to local communities. These efforts enhance Bristow's reputation as a socially responsible partner, critical for retaining government contracts and building public trust.

The human rights supplier commitment process launched in Norway—a first step toward global implementation—further distinguishes Bristow in an industry where ethical sourcing is under scrutiny. By prioritizing transparency, Bristow mitigates supply chain risks and aligns with ESG-conscious investors.

Governance: Certifications and Climate-Resilient Strategies

While Bristow's ISO 14001 certification (for environmental management) currently applies only to its Ireland operations, it reflects a broader commitment to standardized best practices. The company's alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) ensures rigorous climate risk management, a non-negotiable for institutional investors.

Investment Thesis: ESG as a Competitive Advantage

Bristow's ESG initiatives are not just compliance measures—they're strategic investments. The reduced emissions and operational efficiencies from its modern fleet lower fuel costs, while SAR contracts provide stable, recurring revenue. In a carbon-constrained market, Bristow's early adoption of SAF and Norway's zero-emission trials positions it to capitalize on emerging policies favoring green aviation.

For ESG-focused portfolios, Bristow offers a rare blend of tangible results (e.g., cost savings, safety improvements) and forward-looking innovation. Risks, such as delays in SAF adoption or regulatory uncertainty, remain—but Bristow's proactive stance mitigates these through diversification (e.g., offshore energy, government contracts) and stakeholder engagement.

Conclusion: A Sustainable Flight Path to Growth

Bristow Group's ESG-driven strategy exemplifies how sustainability can be a catalyst for operational excellence and market leadership. With a modernized fleet, expanding SAR footprint, and robust governance frameworks, the company is well-equipped to navigate industry shifts while delivering value to shareholders. For investors prioritizing both returns and responsibility, Bristow's trajectory offers a compelling entry point into an aviation sector poised for green transformation.",,N,,2025-07-01 08:04:11.127906

in an era where patient-focused medicine requires precise handling and quicker delivery times, FedEx has revamped its quality framework and bolstered its infrastructure while making strides toward sustainable aviation goals. Nick Gennari, who leads global healthcare sales at FedEx, describes this moment as pivotal: “achieving the CEIV Pharma corporate Certificate showcases our dedication to quality and leadership in transporting pharmaceutical products worldwide.”

This certification process involved aligning procedures across various jurisdictions—a meaningful challenge for the company. “Creating global standard operating procedures was one of our major tasks,” Gennari noted.

With 15 new certified facilities added globally recently, more than 90% of their healthcare volume now flows through CEIV-accredited hubs. The journey wasn’t straightforward; different regions have unique regulations that necessitate a extensive approach to quality assurance. “Our entire quality process is now certified,” he explained. “As we expand into new markets with increasing volumes, we’re prepared to certify additional facilities as opportunities arise.”

The pandemic tested this certification rigorously when fedex was tasked with delivering temperature-sensitive COVID-19 vaccines across remote areas. “We had to invest in equipment at certain locations to maintain efficacy,” Gennari shared. This experience has shaped a broader cold chain strategy encompassing over 100 facilities globally.

Embracing Technology for Enhanced Visibility

The integrity of such complex cargo increasingly relies on digital innovations. To improve real-time tracking and response capabilities, FedEx introduced Surround Monitoring and Intervention (MI) solutions that provide customers with enhanced insights into their shipments’ status—offering location data along with predictive alerts for potential issues during transit.

This Surround MI platform is currently active in 50 countries worldwide; customer feedback highlights its effectiveness: “One client mentioned that it saves him between six to twelve hours each month just by streamlining package tracking,” said Gennari.

Citing geopolitical uncertainties and changing trade dynamics as challenges ahead for international logistics firms like theirs—FedEx emphasizes its expansive network as a strategic asset: “We connect around three million shippers with approximately 225 million customers globally,” he stated confidently.

Sustainability Initiatives Taking center Stage

Sustainability concerns are becoming increasingly prominent within pharmaceutical logistics—especially regarding high-emission airfreight segments. According to Gennari: “we’re committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040.” This commitment gained momentum when they began utilizing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in U.S.-based operations earlier this year through an agreement involving over three million gallons from Neste at LAX airport.

This shift towards SAF complements ongoing efforts such as modernizing their aircraft fleet alongside optimizing flight plans aimed at reducing emissions intensity substantially since fiscal year 2005.

A team of researchers from Washington State University (WSU; Richland, Wash.; www.wsu.edu) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL; Richland, Wash.; www.pnnl.gov) demonstrated the use of a lignin-based jet fuel as a new LOHC. The team, led by WSU engineer Bin Yang, had previously developed lignin-based jet fuel (LJF) with a process that converts lignin from waste biomass into primarily cycloalkane hydrocarbons, including alkyl-substituted mono-, bi-, and tri-cyclohexyl alkanes that can be used in jet fuel formulations.

Now, using platinum nanoparticles supported on zeolite (aluminosilicate compounds) as catalysts, the lignin jet fuel can undergo a dehydrogenation process that forms aromatic species, including alkylbenzenes, tetralins and naphthalenes. The dehydrogenated LJF, known as LJF-HyC, can then serve as a potential liquid hydrogen storage medium. In the study, researchers found the dehydrogenation of LJF into LJF-HyC “revealed a significant presence of aromatic species, comprising approximately 18.5 wt.% of the dehydrogenated LJF.”

Once the hydrogen carrier is made, it can be hydrogenated to store and transport hydrogen, and would be released at a point of use with another similar catalytic process. Using the LJF as a LOHC facilitates efficient high-density hydrogen storage in an easy-to-handle sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the researchers say. “This approach offers promising opportunities for compatibility with existing infrastructure, economic viability for scalable production, and creates a synergistic system that enhances the efficiency, safety and sustainability of both SAF and hydrogen technologies,” they wrote in a recent publication of the work in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.

U.S. biofuel production has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

Research conducted by American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) shows renewable diesel is not only a promising solution for lowering the trucking industry’s CO2 emissions, it's also significantly cheaper than battery electric technology. RD consumption levels in 2023 reached 2.868 billion gallons annually in the U.S., according to ATRI – a nearly 67% increase from 2022. In 2022 CARB reported that 73% of RD consumed in the U.S. was sold in California and received credits through its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) regulatory program.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO, epresenting truck stops and travel centers, and SIGMA, a group of America's Leading Fuel Marketers.

These factors create a compelling case for investors to consider a long position, especially as passive fund inflows from its index inclusion begin to flow into the stock.

The Russell Reconstitution Catalyst: Passive Inflows and Technical Momentum

WLFC's addition to the Russell Small Cap Comp Growth Index—effective June 30, 2025—marks a critical milestone. The reconstitution, which occurs annually, forces passive funds tracking the index to rebalance their portfolios, creating a $220 billion+ trading window for small-cap stocks like WLFC. Historical precedent suggests this process can lift a stock's price by 5–15% in the weeks following the rebalance, as funds rush to comply with indexing requirements.

The timing is fortuitous. WLFC's inclusion announcement in May 2024 has already spurred early buying, but the final rebalancing on June 30 will likely intensify this momentum. The stock's liquidity, though small-cap, is sufficient to absorb the inflows without excessive volatility, as evidenced by its average daily trading volume of ~400k shares.

Operational Momentum: SAF Projects as a Growth Engine

While passive inflows provide short-term tailwinds, WLFC's long-term thesis hinges on its $1.5 billion SAF project in the UK, slated to begin production by 2028. The facility will produce 750,000 metric tons of SAF annually, leveraging government grants and partnerships with industry leaders like BP and Rolls-Royce. Crucially, the project aligns with the EU's mandate to blend 2% SAF into aviation fuel by 2025, rising to 5% by 2030—a regulatory tailwind that ensures demand growth.

The SAF venture offers two key advantages:

1. Diversification: Reduces reliance on traditional aircraft-leasing revenue, which now accounts for ~80% of sales.

2. Scalability: WLFC's “Carbonshift” licensing pathway allows it to franchise SAF production technology, unlocking recurring revenue streams.

Financially, the project is underpinned by $500 million in government grants and a 15-year supply agreement with a major European airline, reducing execution risk. Over the next decade, SAF could contribute $200–300 million annually to WLFC's bottom line, a material uplift from its current $150 million pre-tax income.

Dividend Discipline: Income with Growth

WLFC's dividend policy adds further appeal. The company initiated a $0.15 quarterly dividend in Q1 2025, yielding ~2% at current prices—a premium to the Russell 2000's average yield of 1.2%. This payout is sustainable, given its $2.87 billion lease portfolio (up 18% YoY) and a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2x. Management has signaled a commitment to growing the dividend by 5–7% annually, even as it invests in SAF.

Risk Factors and the Bull Case

Risks remain. The SAF project's timeline hinges on regulatory approvals and construction delays, while the Russell inclusion is not guaranteed beyond 2025. However, WLFC's 22% revenue growth in 2024 and strong lease renewal rates (95% in H1 2025) suggest it can maintain the metrics required to stay in the index.

The bull case assumes:

- Short-term: A 12–15% pop in WLFC's stock price by August 2025 as passive funds complete rebalancing.

- Medium-term: SAF projects begin contributing to margins by 2027, lifting EBITDA by $50 million annually.

- Long-term: Dividend growth and SAF scalability justify a valuation multiple expansion from 10x to 12x forward earnings.

Investment Recommendation

With a current price of $28.50, we recommend a buy rating with a 12-month price target of $35 (23% upside). The confluence of passive inflows, SAF-driven growth, and dividend income creates a multi-year story. Investors should consider a phased entry, accumulating shares in the $27–$30 range ahead of the June rebalancing.

Final Note: For risk-averse investors, pairing a 5% position in WLFC with a Russell 2000 index ETF (e.g., IWM) can balance pure-play exposure with broad-market diversification.

This innovative platform is designed to facilitate seamless procurement of SAF between airlines and producers, addressing key challenges in the industry’s transition to greener fuel sources.

The SAF Matchmaker platform, developed by IATA, is set to revolutionize the way airlines and SAF suppliers connect and negotiate deals. By matching requests for SAF supply with offers, the platform aims to create a more accessible, transparent, and efficient market for sustainable aviation fuels.

According to IATA’s chief economist and senior vice-president for sustainability, Marie Owens Thomsen, “To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

The platform is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers, with plans to expand access to other SAF buyers, such as non-aviation corporations, in the future. This innovative matching platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with practical tools to support energy management.

The SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues that have hindered the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuels:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement, making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. This will facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes, while airlines can register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Once connections are made, subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform provides comprehensive information about the available SAF, including volumes, feedstock used, location and technology of production, emissions reductions, and compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

By addressing these key points of concern, the SAF Matchmaker platform aims to accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels, a crucial step in the industry’s journey towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The launch of the SAF Matchmaker platform marks a significant milestone in IATA’s ongoing efforts to drive the aviation industry’s sustainability agenda and pave the way for a more environmentally responsible future of air travel.",https://www.awesometravelsmaldives.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-01 02:02:13.084174

45Z credit.
45Z credit.","Editor: Mary Van Leuven, J.D., LL.M.

The Sec. 45Z clean fuel production credit is a significant initiative introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, P.L. 117–169. This credit aims to incentivize the production of clean transportation fuels, including either sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or non–SAF transportation fuel, within the United States by offering tax credits to producers that meet specific environmental criteria.

To be eligible for the credit in a specific tax year, taxpayers must produce a qualifying transportation fuel within the United States for sale to an unrelated party for certain specified purposes. A non–SAF transportation fuel must be produced in accordance with certain feedstock requirements, must be suitable for use in highway vehicles or aircraft, and must have a lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rate of no more than 50 kilograms per carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) (based on relative global warming potential) per million British thermal units (mmBTU) (Secs. 45Z(b)(1)(A) and (d)). Alternatively, SAF must adhere to specific industry standards, meet a separate set of feedstock requirements, and be sold for use in aircraft.

On Jan. 10, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025–10, which contains draft forthcoming proposed regulations for the Sec. 45Z clean fuel production credit, and Notice 2025–11, which includes the Sec. 45Z annual emissions rate table. Also in January, the Department of Energy released the 45ZCF–GREET model, with a user manual and other information, to calculate emissions for non–SAF transportation fuel. Overall, the guidance provides helpful information but ultimately neglects several crucial industry issues. Therefore, taxpayers in the clean fuel industry are evaluating how to apply the notices, given their nonbinding and somewhat ineffective nature.

This item explores two key issues among many that are puzzling industry participants: imported used cooking oil (UCO) and the definition of a qualifying sale, particularly for clean fuel producers selling to wholesalers. The lack of clarity in these areas could significantly affect the clean fuel industry’s ability to generate the Sec. 45Z credit.

Imported UCO

The forthcoming proposed regulations do not provide specific guidance on the use of imported UCO as a feedstock eligible for the Sec. 45Z credit, specifically with respect to non–SAF transportation fuel. Notice 2025–10 contemplates concerns regarding the identification and market implications of imported UCO, particularly the risk of mislabeling substances such as virgin palm oil as UCO. Compared to palm oil, genuine UCO has a significantly lower GHG emissions rate, meaning that producing biodiesel from UCO generates considerably fewer carbon emissions than producing it from palm oil. This is primarily because UCO is considered a waste product that would otherwise be discarded, while palm oil production is often linked to large–scale deforestation, leading to high GHG emissions. Therefore, this mislabeling could potentially lead to higher emissions impacts than genuine UCO. Due to these concerns, the notice provides that pathways using imported UCO are currently unavailable in the 45ZCF–GREET model until further guidance is issued. When the current 45ZCF–GREET model does not include certain feedstocks such as imported UCO in its production pathways, the taxpayer must request a provisional emissions rate (PER) to establish an official emissions rate for its product.

This guidance fails to provide a specific PER process for taxpayers to follow, which creates significant uncertainty for industry participants that have relied on imported UCO as a sustainable feedstock, and this lack of a defined process will lead to difficulties in ensuring compliance and claiming the Sec. 45Z credit. To complicate this further, there is not an anticipated date for further guidance under the new administration; therefore, taxpayers that use imported UCO will be left searching for answers in the interim, making it difficult to estimate this incentive’s benefits.

Qualifying sale

Next, a contentious issue is the impact of Notice 2025–10’s limiting definition of a “qualifying sale.” Sec. 45Z(a)(4) provides three ways a taxpayer can demonstrate a qualifying sale. One is a sale to an unrelated person “for use by such person in a trade or business ” (Sec. 45Z(a)(4)(B)). This statutory language has been interpreted by many industry participants to give a broad application of the term “use” to a purchaser’s business activities, including wholesaling. The initial guidance, however, refines this definition by clarifying that a sale “for use in a trade or business” means “sold for use as a fuel in a trade or business within the meaning of section 162 of the Code” (emphasis added). The introduction of the limiting requirement that the purchaser’s use be exclusively as a fuel within the meaning of Sec. 162 is a clear deviation from the statutory language but appears intentional. The narrowly applied definition provided in the draft text of the forthcoming proposed regulations consequentially appears to exclude sales to wholesalers by clean fuel producers.

This proposed interpretation is significant because wholesalers play a crucial role in the supply chain by purchasing large quantities of fuel from producers and then distributing it to retailers or directly to end users, allowing producers to reach a broader market. This arrangement benefits producers by providing a steady demand for their products and reducing the complexity and costs associated with direct sales and distribution logistics. Hence, the additional language in the forthcoming proposed regulations leaves a gap in understanding whether these transactions qualify for the credit, potentially excluding a significant portion of the market from the benefit of the Sec. 45Z credit. Taxpayers are wondering if Treasury and the IRS intended this result, because the inclusion of a wholesaler in the supply chain would seemingly negate the credit for the producer’s sale of otherwise eligible fuel.

Gaps in the guidance

Overall, taxpayers have several concerns about the notices. While these notices offer some guidance, there is uncertainty about how much of the forthcoming proposed regulations will be finalized and enforceable as drafted in their present form. Most significantly, as outlined above, there are several gaps in the guidance, leaving the industry concerned and unable to adequately plan for how to apply the Sec. 45Z credit.

Q: As you know, business aviation has always served as an incubator for aviation innovation, including the successful development of technologies such as winglets, GPS for aviation and lightweight, super-strong composite materials. What policies should be considered that would spur continued American innovation and future development of new aviation-related technologies?

Aviation is the ultimate merit-based industry. Physics wins every time. We must support dynamic and science-based research and development by attracting and retaining the highest-caliber people and providing the best possible regulatory, tax and business environment for those innovators to create and develop groundbreaking solutions. Among other things, we must extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to ensure America remains the global business aviation leader.

Q: What should be done to ensure America’s air traffic control system remains the safest and most efficient in the world?

Aviation was the original high-reliability organization as a result of pioneering the concept of crew resource management. The vast majority of accidents involve human error. Mitigating that potential for error through the robust application of crew resource management training, adequately resourcing high-quality personnel, and promoting a climate of prompt and ready assistance is the foundation upon which all other safety measures are built.

Q: What more can Washington, DC, do to enhance policies that support the improved mental health of the nation’s aviation workforce, including pilots and air traffic controllers?

Having served as both a police supervisor and a National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk company commander and pilot in command, I’ve had the opportunity to compare and contrast two dynamic, high liability, rank structured careers. Law enforcement has pioneered the concept of peer support, in which police officers receive mental health training and work with first-responder psychologists to detect and support their peers during traumatic incidents or routine life and job stress, without any of the fabricated stigmas associated with “going to see the shrink.” Congress and the aviation industry should borrow lessons learned from peer support programs to bolster user level mental health for aviation industry personnel.

Q: Business aviation is increasingly suffering from a shortfall of pilots and aircraft maintenance professionals. What can be done to ensure that America has the aviation workforce it needs to maintain the highest levels of safety and efficiency?

Developing programs that work with high schools, community colleges and universities to promote and create pipelines into aviation as a high paying, high quality career is essential. Streamlining the credentialing and outreach to separating military aviators, aircrew and supporting personnel is also critical. I earned my FAA commercial license by taking the military competency exam, but struggled to actually land a civilian job. I became a cop instead. Finding ways to ease the transition of veterans into commercial and business aviation jobs will benefit both veterans and the aviation community.

Q: The raw materials needed to manufacture sustainable aviation fuel can create new markets for American farmers, while cutting aircraft emissions and increasing fuel efficiency. What is Congress doing to support sustainable aviation fuel production as a strategy to leverage agriculture as a national economic driver?

Congress is working on a farm bill that would expand USDA bioenergy programs to support the research, development and commercialization of sustainable aviation fuel. The Denver area is home to companies leading in biofuels and new fuel technologies, and I’d love to see a farm bill that strengthens that kind of cooperation. It’s a smart way to grow our economy, support Colorado farmers, and advance American energy innovation.

Tucked inside the tax title is a revised version of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, now projected to cost $25.7 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s (JCT) estimate released Saturday. That’s more than double earlier projections and surpasses the historical costs of the two major biofuel tax credits it replaces.

The credit, originally created by the Inflation Reduction Act and scheduled to expire in 2027, is now extended through 2029 under the Senate package—two years shorter than a previous proposal but still a two-year bonus for eligible producers. The change shifts the bulk of the cost to the final years, with $10.5 billion expected to hit in FY2029 alone.

That spike isn’t just due to the extension. The Senate draft preserves a controversial carveout that eliminates penalties for “indirect land use change”—the additional greenhouse gas emissions that occur when expanding biofuel production drives the conversion of forests or grasslands into farmland elsewhere. As a result, corn ethanol and soy-based biodiesel—already mandated under the Renewable Fuel Standard and subsidized since the Carter era—could again dominate the subsidy stream.

The credit’s design also opens the door to a growing renewable diesel market and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), both expected to expand dramatically by the end of the decade. If current trends continue, the cost of the credit in 2029 and 2030 could exceed even the JCT projection, especially if aviation fuel facilities ramp up production to qualify.

And that’s not all. The bill resurrects and increases the small agri-biodiesel producer tax credit, last active in 2024. It would now run from mid-2025 through 2026, layered on top of 45Z. In effect, some producers could claim multiple overlapping credits for the same gallon of fuel.

With a final Senate vote expected as early as this week, the true cost of these provisions—both fiscal and environmental—may not be fully known until long after the credits have taken effect. But the sticker shock is already setting in.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-532730849-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 21:00:17.316714

SilFlow microfluidic chips enhance gas chromatography instruments enabling detailed fuel analysis

Researchers aim to determine if alternative fuels can directly replace conventional Jet A-1

Andrew Gooley, Chief Scientific Officer of Melbourne-headquartered global analytical science and device company Trajan Group (ASX:TRJ), said SAFs were being researched to minimise overall global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

“The aviation industry contributes around 2-3% of global energy-related CO2 emissions,” he said.

“It’s an area most active in research to minimize global CO2 emissions.”

Gooley said most aviation and vehicle fuels were derived from petroleum, a fossil fuel.

He explained that burning fossil fuels, including standard aviation fuel like Jet A-1, released new carbon into the atmosphere.

SAFs, however, recycle carbon already in the natural carbon cycle, making them a cleaner alternative.

‘Unravelling complexity’ of SAFs to current Jet A-1 fuel

Gooley said the problem that needs solving is whether SAFs are like for like so they could then be considered a “drop-in” fuel or substitute for Jet A-1.

“What scientists need to determine is how these fuels are different from the traditional kerosene-based Jet A-1 fuel and to do that they need to understand their chemical composition, and which components are likely to influence the properties of the fuel” he said.

To do this Gooley said scientists use gas chromatography, a laboratory technique that separates and analyses compounds in a sample by vaporising them.

In this case the scientists use a complex form of gas chromatography known as GC x GC or two-dimensional (2D) gas chromatography.

“It’s probably the most sophisticated separation technique available for this type of application – understanding how many different chemicals are in sustainable aviation fuels and how they differ from the Jet A-1” he said.

Gooley added that when analysing SAFs, scientists are working to characterise compounds which might influence the properties of the fuel, such as flash point, viscosity and freezing point.

“That’s where they use our devices to unravel the complexity of those fuels,” Gooley said.

Trajan’s SilFlow solution

As part of the components and consumables section of its business, Trajan supplies an enormous range of products for gas chromatography.

Gooley said Trajan’s SilFlow microfluidic chip could split the sample flow, enabling parallel detection simultaneously, allowing scientists to gather the full range of data needed to extract meaningful results.

“A microfluidic chip is a switch, and it allows you to take advantage of pressure to change the pathway of how a sample moves through the instrument,” he said.

“In the case of a study on sustainable aviation fuels what the scientists wanted to do was compare the data from two different detectors at the same time.”

“One was to a detector which was quantitative to measure the amount of a chemical present in the fuel and the other went to a mass spectrometer which gives the structure of the same chemical.”

Gooley said alkanes – energy-rich hydrocarbons found in both traditional and sustainable aviation fuels – are the most analysed fuel component due to their embedded energy, making them ideal as a fuel source.

“The problem is there are thousands of these alkanes due to their isomers -same molecular formula but different structural formula,” he said.

“So, when they measure the amount, they want to be able to match the structure to the chemical they’ve just measured – so precision in the switch is absolutely fundamental.”

Fluidic logic: simplifying gas chromatographs

CEO and managing director Stephen Tomisich said gas chromatography was far more powerful with “complex plumbing inside” the instruments.

“Before our device when customers were developing complex types of plumbing you could open a gas chromatograph and look inside and it looked like a bowl of spaghetti because there were tubing and connections going everywhere,” he said.

“SilFlow puts all that logic onto a chip so that instead of seeing that complex arrangement you see a very simple one that allows that direction of flow, that splitting of flow into different parts of the instrument to perform different functions to happen far more efficiently and effectively.

“Last time I counted there were around 60 or 70 different types of fluidic logic that we were using inside of these sorts of platforms around the world to enhance capabilities to do these types of measurements.”

Demand for knowledge about environmental contaminants in aviation and energy storage

Gooley said as environmental concerns around fuels and industrial activity grow, there is rising demand for technologies like SilFlow to help research scientists understand the presence of contaminants and their ecological impact.

There is also growing concern about environmental contaminants linked to fuel handling and storage – for example, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are synthetic “forever chemicals” commonly used in firefighting foams at airports and fuel sites.

Firefighting training grounds use aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) – in which PFAS is a key ingredient – resulting in long-term pollution.

Remediation of these sites is essential to limit the migration of PFAS into the water table, surrounding environments and ultimately into the food chain.

And Trajan’s environmental business unit plays a key role in supporting efforts to detect and monitor harmful contaminants.

The company’s chromatography consumables and workflows — including GC columns like BPX1 and its SilFlow splitter — are widely used in the analysis of pesticides, herbicides, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PFAS.

Along with firefighting foams PFAS have also been used in a range of other products from water-resistant clothing to cookware and cosmetics.

“We ensure that we have no PFAS contamination in our devices and consumables so that scientists can measure the true levels of PFAS in the environmental and biological samples they are testing,” Gooley said.

He said in recent years, demand for sophisticated analytical technologies has only grown – particularly in capillary GC, comprehensive 2D GC, nano and capillary liquid chromatography (LC), and critically, their coupling with mass spectrometry.

“It goes without saying that ‘science that benefits people’ can be no better defined than monitoring the water we drink, the soils we inhabit and grow our food to monitor the presence of these toxic chemicals,” Gooley said.

Aviation currently accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Turkey has announced a pivotal shift in the country’s environmental policy: it will enforce mandatory requirements for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by both airlines and fuel suppliers. The goal is clear: to cut 5% of emissions generated by the aviation sector by 2030.

Commitment to Global Aviation Sustainability

This move aligns Turkey with the emission reduction plan of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), set to take effect in 2027. The country aims to get ahead of this global regulation by requiring airlines operating international flights to or from Turkey to incorporate a sufficient proportion of SAF into their operations.

Furthermore, the new rules mandate that airlines load at least 90% of the SAF required for these flights from Turkish territory. This not only ensures local compliance with environmental targets but also incentivizes domestic production of the fuel.

Suppliers and Refineries Also Under Pressure

The obligation does not fall solely on airlines. Aviation fuel suppliers will also be required to procure enough SAF to meet the 5% emission reduction target. The regulation will also extend to local energy giants: refineries Tupras and Socar will need to begin producing these sustainable fuels.

→ ATR Signs MoU with ATOBA ENERGY to Accelerate SAF Adoption in Regional Aviation

Tupras, the country’s largest oil refiner, has ambitious plans: it will start by producing 20,000 metric tons of SAF at one of its main plants in 2026. The goal is to scale this figure to 400,000 tons through the construction of a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment decision.

Meanwhile, DB Tarımsal Enerji, a local biofuel company, is also joining the effort with plans to produce 100,000 tons of SAF at a new facility.

Annual Oversight and Penalties for Non-Compliance

The Turkish authority detailed that before the end of each third quarter, it will publish the minimum emission reduction targets that companies in the sector must meet. Additionally, it warned that penalties will be imposed on airlines and suppliers that fail to comply with the new provisions.

Why Is This Measure Important?

Aviation currently accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. While this may seem like a small proportion, the sector’s projected growth and the challenges of decarbonizing it place it at the center of international climate efforts.

In this context, Turkey seeks to position itself as a regional leader in the transition to cleaner aviation while boosting its domestic SAF industry and ensuring a robust local supply.

Decline in Fuel Demand: An Opportunity

According to Turkey’s energy regulator, the country’s demand for jet fuel fell by 4% last year, settling at 6.26 million tons, equivalent to 135,000 barrels per day. This decline could be seen as an opportunity to reshape the market toward more sustainable options.

With this strategic decision, Turkey is not only getting ahead of international requirements but also fostering a new energy industry and establishing a model that could be replicated in other regions of the world.

SEVILLE, Spain (Reuters) -A group of countries including France, Kenya, Spain and Barbados pledged on Monday to tax premium-class flying and private jets in a bid to raise funds for climate action and sustainable development.

As many richer nations scale back official development aid for countries even as extreme weather events increase in frequency and severity, some are looking to find new sources of finance, including by taxing polluting industries.

The announcement on the opening day of a U.N. development summit in Seville, Spain, was one of the first to emerge from the “Sevilla Platform for Action” that aims to deliver on the renewed global financing framework agreed ahead of the event.

“The aim is to help improve green taxation and foster international solidarity by promoting more progressive and harmonised tax systems,” the office of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a statement.

The initiative, which was co-signed by Sierra Leone, Benin and Somalia, will get technical support from the European Commission, it added.

All are members of the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, launched in November 2023 to explore new forms of taxation that could help support developing countries’ efforts to decarbonise and protect themselves against the impacts of climate change.

As well as an aviation tax, which could raise billions of dollars, the task force said in a recent report that other sectors that could potentially be taxed more include shipping, oil and gas, cryptocurrencies and the super-rich.

Rebecca Newsom of environmentalist group Greenpeace called the move “an important step towards ensuring that the binge users of this undertaxed sector are made to pay their fair share”.

She added that the “obvious” next step was to hold oil and gas corporations to account.

“We have to think about sustainability holistically,” Ricci said.","Kennedy Ricci was born with aviation in his blood, coming from a long line of aviation professionals on both sides of his family. After starting his career in marketing and social media, he was ultimately drawn to aviation partially due to the passionate people who make up the industry.

A GA pilot himself with a commercial rating, Ricci is also passionate about sustainability, which inspired him to launch 4AIR, a company offering turnkey solutions for aviation sustainability needs.

Ricci attributes some of his passion for sustainability to experiences from his childhood. “We traveled a lot when I was younger,” Ricci said. “I was homeschooled in eighth grade and our travels exposed me to different cultures.” Ricci’s travels with his family often included destinations in remote and unusual locations. “That exposure showed me what’s out there and what’s worth protecting in the world – environmentally, culturally and socially,” he said. “Aviation gave me access to these things, and it’s very important to me that we preserve that access.”

New Horizons: AAM Leader Wants to ‘Change the Pilot Workforce’

Millennials and Gen Z consider the environmental impact of decisions more heavily than previous generations, Ricci believes. “Previous generations have laid the foundation, but it’s more top of mind for current generations. You see more people making decisions based on what the impact will be,” he said. “Sustainability is part of this generation’s purchasing decisions. Part of that is because we will live to see the impacts of our decisions.”

When Ricci considers sustainability, he isn’t talking about reducing or eliminating certain modes of transportation. He thinks about continuing what the industry is doing in a sustainable way.

“We have to think long term about aviation’s role, though, beyond just the next few years,” Ricci said. “Electric aircraft are a great option, but won’t cover every type of mission. Hydrogen is likely even further off in the future.”

For now, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon offsets are viable methods of achieving sustainability, though SAF availability is currently limited. Carbon offsets, he said, have evolved since their early days, with several credible solutions available. “We have to think about sustainability holistically,” Ricci said. “If we want to see aviation thrive, we need to think about it not just environmentally, but by its impact socially, culturally and economically.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kenndy-Ricc-New-Horizons-July-August-2025.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 17:12:28.746094

The summer season is finally upon us! I hope you and your family are able to enjoy the sunshine and spend time taking advantage of all the fun that Pure Michigan summer activities have to offer. Even though summer break is here for our youngest Michiganders, the Legislature remains hard at work.

From standing up to federal cuts to nutrition programs and advancing gun safety policies to holding polluters accountable and protecting Michigan renters and consumers, we’ve had a busy few weeks at the Capitol. Keep reading to learn more about these efforts and the steps we’re taking to build a healthier, safer, and more prosperous Michigan for all who call our state home.

Sincerely,

Supporting Michigan Renters — Senate Democrats recently introduced a comprehensive bill package to strengthen protections and break barriers for Michiganders trying to access rental housing. This legislation works to lower costs for renters, hold landlords accountable, and allow for the expungement of eviction records.

Holding Polluters Accountable — Another large-scale legislative package introduced recently would protect public health and our environment by strengthening Michigan’s pollution clean-up laws. This legislation would hold polluters accountable by requiring more thorough cleanups as well as empowering those harmed by pollution to seek justice.

Protecting Michigan Consumers — Long overdue legislation to restore power to the Michigan Consumer Protection Act by equipping the Attorney General with the authority to hold bad actors and businesses accountable recently passed the Senate floor. Senate Bill 134 — legislation I’m proud to have sponsored — would also enhance education efforts to reduce scams and strengthen penalties for violations against elderly and vulnerable adults. And, to protect Michigan consumers from disruptive, deceptive telephone solicitation tactics, the Telephone Solicitation Act was also introduced recently. This bipartisan bill package would prohibit telephone solicitors from engaging in misleading, exploitative business practices and grant the Attorney General the authority to act against violators.

Building a Future Free from Gun Violence

From big cities to small rural towns, gun violence hits communities in every corner of our state. To keep our communities safe from this senseless gun violence, my colleagues and I championed a slate of gun safety policies, including legislation to:

Strengthen background checks to close the private sale loophole;

Promote safe storage by creating child access protection laws to keep legal firearms safely and securely stored and out of the hands of children and teens;

Allow courts to issue Extreme Risk Protection Orders to temporarily intervene and suspend a person’s access to firearms if they show clear warning signs of violence and pose an immediate threat to themselves or others;

Protect survivors of domestic violence by preventing those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from possessing, using, purchasing, or carrying a firearm in Michigan for eight years; and

Safeguard the democratic process and protect voters by prohibiting an individual from possessing a firearm at or near a polling place, an early voting site, an absentee voter ballot drop box, and other spaces where election work is occurring.

Building on this progress, the Senate passed legislation this week that would:

Prohibit bump stocks, a device that can convert semi-automatic firearms into deadly weapons that have a fire rate similar to that of a machine gun;

Address ghost guns, which are fully functioning, untraceable firearms and the fastest-growing gun safety problem facing our country; and

Keep the Michigan Capitol complex safe from gun violence to ensure a secure environment for students, teachers, parents, advocates, and lawmakers.

These actions come during National Gun Violence Awareness Month when communities across the nation come together to honor survivors of gun violence and build community with those working to address this pervasive issue.

Senate Hearings Highlight Risks of Proposed Cuts to Families, Farms, and Food Access

As Washington Republicans’ sweeping and short-sighted budget bill currently makes its way through Congress, Michigan Senate Democrats recently held two committee hearings to examine how their plan threatens the health and well-being of Michigan families and farmers across the state.

In order to afford a massive $4 trillion tax break for the wealthiest Americans, Congressional Republicans are proposing a $300 billion cut in SNAP funding, in addition to adding unnecessary red tape for program participants and threatening the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). If signed into law, these cuts would directly disrupt and devastate millions of Michiganders who rely on these benefits to put food on their table and meet their nutritional needs. They would also further exacerbate economic instability for Michigan families, farmers, and communities by slashing resources for local food banks and the state’s agricultural industry. To read more about the impact of these cuts, click here.

These committee hearings build on Senate Democrats’ previous efforts to examine and uplift the impact of federal cuts and actions on families and communities around the state. Learn more here.

Happy Juneteenth! Observed on June 19 every year, Juneteenth commemorates the day that the last people who were enslaved in the U.S. learned of their freedom — June 19, 1865, over two years after President Abraham Lincoln presented the Emancipation Proclamation.

The significance of Juneteenth extends beyond its historical roots. It symbolizes triumph over the injustices of slavery and stands as a testament to the progress made and the work still needed to achieve true freedom and equality for all. As we celebrate this day, please know that I remain committed to fighting for equity and justice so that all people are not only free but can have access to opportunity here in Michigan.

The project represents part of ongoing revitalization efforts at the airport.

“With its proximity to the city’s business district and automotive industry, this new general aviation terminal will serve as a gateway to commerce, tourism and opportunity,” said Joe Meszaros, vice president of operations at Avflight. “It will stand as a beacon of growth, job creation and educational opportunity for Detroit citizens.”

The facility will provide fuel and ground handling services for general aviation aircraft. The company has operated at KDET since 2011 and plans to double its staff as part of the expansion.

The project builds on recent airport improvements including a US$3.5 million runway renovation and LED taxi lighting upgrades. Planned investments include ramp pavement improvements, an engineered material arresting system, and a new control tower scheduled for 2026.

“This groundbreaking celebrates more than just bricks and mortar—it symbolizes renewed momentum for Coleman A. Young International Airport,” said Meszaros. “With Avflight’s partnership and the city’s ongoing investments, KDET is positioned to become a gateway that drives economic vitality.”

Avflight operates as part of the Avfuel-branded network of more than 675 fixed-base operators worldwide. The company has developed facilities across North America and Europe.

The Detroit facility will incorporate sustainable aviation fuel capabilities, electric charging infrastructure, and ground support equipment. Avflight plans to expand educational partnerships aimed at fostering aviation careers among Detroit youth.

The company’s investment reflects confidence in KDET’s potential as a general aviation hub. The airport serves Detroit’s business district and automotive industry with general aviation access.

For many organizations in Europe and the U.S., a desire to reduce lead times, avoid supply chain disruptions, and navigate the impact of regulations and tariffs is encouraging the nearshoring and reshoring trend. Manufacturing closer to home also gives businesses greater control over their products and brings them closer to their customers.

In 2025, 95% of executives said that supply chain pressure was a key driver of their organizations’ reindustrialization, following an increase in supply chain disruptions in 2024. More than half of executives reported that they were reducing their reliance on Chinese products and were prepared to pay a premium to produce in domestic markets.

In Europe, regulation is also driving nearshoring: the E.U.'s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism taxes carbon-intensive goods entering the E.U. Near- and reshoring can help companies keep better track of their sustainability goals, reducing the emissions caused by shipping products around the globe and giving them greater control over their manufacturing facilities’ emissions.

Of course, moving production to countries with higher costs of living can mean an increase in labor, land and infrastructure costs, as well as raw materials. Nearshoring can help companies achieve the best of both worlds by alleviating supply chain problems by bringing manufacturing closer to home, while still keeping costs down. For example, for U.S. businesses, nearshoring in either Mexico or Canada can be more cost-effective than moving production back home.

Reshoring and nearshoring in practice

In Europe, car manufacturers have begun moving their electrical vehicle production away from China. Earlier this year, Swedish automotive manufacturer Polestar announced its first electrical vehicle to be built in Europe, the Polestar 7.[1] With most of its sales in Europe, the company is reducing its reliance on Chinese manufacturing and moving production closer to its key customers.

Last year, Volvo also began to shift production of its EVs to Belgium as part of a similar strategy to build its cars where they sell best. To make EX30 production possible in Ghent, the company made investments worth around €200 million to upgrade its Belgian facility. Wide-ranging changes to the plant include the addition of a completely new car platform, the installation of almost 600 new or refurbished robots, an extension of the battery hall, a new door production line as well as a new battery pack assembly line. Between its Swedish and Belgian facilities, Volvo now builds 10 of its electric and hybrid models in Europe. Stefan Fesser, Manager of Volvo’s Ghent plant, said that the company was able to make the move in record time thanks to technology: ""New technology and innovation enable[d] us to react more flexibly to market demands.”[2]

Last year, British pharma company GSK announced an investment of more than £200 million to strengthen its manufacturing network in the U.K. The cash will be spent upgrading its existing manufacturing site in Scotland, and constructing new facilities and assembly lines.[3] Elsewhere in pharma, Roche, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, AbbVie, Gilead and Bristol Myers Squibb have announced a combined $200 billion of investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities.[4]

In February, Apple announced it would spend more than $500 billion over the next four years, expanding its facilities in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. It also plan to build a new factory in Texas. Its new 250,000-square-foot facility will assemble servers that it previously manufactured outside the states.[5]

Can technology ease the transition?

In today’s increasingly volatile world, it seems cost is no longer the most important consideration for many businesses. While businesses consider this transition, some are finding that having an up-to-date digital strategy is helping them ease this transition and reduce the costs associated with reshoring. Capgemini reported that 54% of organizations have already saved more than 20% on costs by using digital technologies in their reindustrialization efforts.

Manufacturing facilities that use technologies such as digital twins, data analytics and AI can reduce costs by improving their monitoring, streamlining operations, and enhancing productivity. Look out for part 2, where we will explore how companies can set themselves up for success with a digital framework that ensures their operations run efficiently.",https://www.aveva.com/content/dam/aveva/our-industrial-life/js/fav-icon/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-30 14:05:05.600131

The aircraft departed from Hamburg (HAM) and is en route to Sydney (SYD), completing one of the longest flights ever recorded by an A321XLR.

The special delivery flight, QF6041, includes a stop in Bangkok (BKK) and covers over 17,000 kilometers. The aircraft, VH-OGA “Great Ocean Road,” is set to touch down in Sydney on Wednesday morning, 2 July, around 10:00 AM local time.

The first leg to Bangkok spans over 9,600 kilometers, making it the longest A321XLR flight to date. The second leg from Bangkok (BKK) to Sydney (SYD) adds another 7,600 kilometers, totaling 42 hours door-to-door with 21 hours of flight time.

This delivery follows the aircraft’s customer acceptance flight and signifies Qantas’ next-generation push toward longer-range, fuel-efficient narrowbody operations. The A321XLR will allow Qantas to explore thinner long-haul routes without sacrificing efficiency or passenger comfort.

The A321XLR is the first of 28 such aircraft on order by Qantas. With a range of 8,700 kilometers (4,700 nautical miles), it is the longest-range narrowbody aircraft currently available. Qantas plans to deploy this aircraft on routes that require greater range but do not justify a widebody.

Its cabin, the widest among narrowbody jets, features significant passenger enhancements: wider economy seats, increased baggage capacity (60% more space), larger windows, and more seats in both economy and business classes. Ambient LED lighting and higher ceilings also contribute to a modern, spacious interior.

More than 45,000 hours of training have been completed by Qantas personnel in preparation for the A321XLR’s service entry. Nearly 1,000 staff—pilots, cabin crew, engineers, and ground staff—have undergone type-specific training.

Beyond operational upgrades, the aircraft introduces substantial environmental benefits. Its lightweight materials and aerodynamic design contribute to reduced fuel burn and lower CO₂ emissions per seat, supporting Qantas’ sustainability objectives.

CEO Remarks on the Milestone Delivery

Qantas Domestic CEO Markus Svensson commented on the significance of the aircraft’s arrival:

Strategic Fleet Modernisation

Qantas Group has committed to 40 Airbus A321XLRs as part of its broader fleet renewal program. Of these, 28 will join Qantas’ mainline fleet, while 12 are allocated to Jetstar (JQ), its low-cost subsidiary.

These aircraft are part of the airline group’s outstanding order for 128 Airbus single-aisle jets and 24 A350-1000s, aimed at boosting efficiency and sustainability.

The A321XLR is a key asset in Qantas’ post-pandemic strategy, enabling cost-effective expansion into new medium-haul markets.

For Jetstar, the type offers enhanced range and comfort compared to its current narrow-body fleet, potentially opening up longer leisure routes.

Airbus A321XLR: Technical Edge and Environmental Goals

The A321XLR represents the latest evolution of the A320neo family, developed to address increasing market demand for longer single-aisle operations.

It delivers a 30% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft, thanks in part to aerodynamic enhancements and new engine technology.

To date, Airbus has secured over 500 orders for the A321XLR. The aircraft is certified to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability across its fleet by 2030, aligning with global decarbonization goals.

As the 2025 deadline for a 2 percent SAF blend approaches, the German carrier is calling for a neutral regulatory approach or a carbon border adjustment to level the playing field.

“Blending mandates alone are insufficient to create a self-sustaining SAF market,” said Bettina Petzold, Head of Corporate Responsibility at Lufthansa Cargo. “The EU policy does not address the significant supply and price issues: biogenic SAF is only available in small quantities and costs three to five times more than fossil kerosene. In 2023, SAF could only cover around 0.2 percent of the fuel needed worldwide. Due to the limited supply, prices will remain high in the foreseeable future.”

The company also flagged disparities in the global playing field: “The current regulatory framework puts EU carriers at a significant competitive disadvantage in the global aviation market, particularly against competitors from the Gulf, the Bosporus, and China,” she noted. “Therefore, we demand a regulatory framework that is neutral regarding the EU’s SAF blending mandate, or the introduction of a fair Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for airlines that evade the mandate. Additionally, we request political measures to ramp-up the SAF market.”

Carbon tracking at shipment level and scalable SAF deals

Lufthansa Cargo is not just lobbying—it is already deploying SAF in volume, backed by a layered offering for customers of all sizes.

“We offer three services that allow our customers to transparently and verifiably reduce their carbon footprint through the purchase of SAF,” said Petzold. “Our add-on service, ‘Sustainable Choice’, is available worldwide on all routes, for all capacities, and for all products. It enables us to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%. This can already be done automatically and online. This offer is particularly interesting for project business and, in addition to our large customers, appeals to small and medium-sized forwarders as well.”

“In combination with ‘Sustainable Choice’, you can choose to offset emissions further. The Lufthansa Group’s providers for this include myclimate, SQUAKE and ClimatePartner.”

Bulk and charter deals are also on the table. “We also offer so-called SAF ‘bulk deals’ for larger purchases of 100 tons or more of SAF. In this case, the use of SAF is allocated to precisely identified transportation to avoid double-counting usage globally. Special SAF ‘charter deals’ are available for regular, recurring transport on precisely defined routes.”

Regardless of the model chosen, Petzold emphasised traceability: “We prioritise providing premium-quality SAF produced from biogenic residues, such as used cooking oils – not palm oil. Every purchase is officially certified by an external auditor. Anyone using Lufthansa Cargo SAF can rest assured that they are doing so in compliance with regulations.”

As for the scale of impact so far? “By using SAF and making a contribution to high-quality climate protection projects, around 8,500 tonnes of CO2 were saved in 2024,” she said.

The actual SAF share by route is still being calculated. “We will be able to make very specific statements on the SAF share on our routes in the first quarter of 2026.”

Data-driven optimisation and future-ready fleet

Digital tools are playing a growing role in Lufthansa Cargo’s carbon reduction strategy—especially in fuel efficiency.

“Our Fuel Efficiency Team utilises proprietary analysis software that enables comprehensive evaluation of fuel consumption across all flight phases,” said Petzold. “The use of such tools is essential for effective fuel monitoring – both in terms of flight safety and fuel efficiency. These applications are continuously being enhanced, with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. This will generate even deeper analytical insights in the future.”

She added: “Additionally, we are currently implementing further analytic tools that resemble ‘digital twins’ and can predict kerosene consumption changes based on various external factors, such as modifications to aircraft that may affect fuel consumption. This technology, however, is still in the development phase.”

Lufthansa Cargo has already overhauled its fleet for climate performance. “Since October 2021, we have switched our long-haul fleet completely to the Boeing 777F – today’s most modern freighter with the best environmental performance in its class. Lufthansa Cargo currently operates a total of twelve Boeing 777Fs in its long-haul fleet. The company has also ordered seven B777-8 freighters from Boeing’s latest generation of wide-body freighters to be delivered by 2030. According to the manufacturer, this freighter model offers the opportunity to be around 13 percent more efficient than the 777F currently in service.”

“In addition to the fleet modernisation and deployment of SAF, we are also using other levers in the management of our flight operations, which target a reduction of our emissions by an additional 4 percent by 2030.”

System-wide approach to climate accountability

Lufthansa Cargo’s sustainability work is underpinned by a global environmental management system that’s been maturing since 2007.

“CO2 and noise data were already being recorded in the 1990s, which formed the basis for the subsequent introduction of the system. The aim was to deal with environmental issues in a structured manner and to establish clear responsibilities and processes,” Petzold explained.

“The first certification according to the international environmental standard ISO 14001 was obtained in 2008 at the Frankfurt site. By 2010, certification had been extended to all German stations, and in 2015 Lufthansa Cargo received global ISO 14001 certification. This can only be achieved together with our globally active environmental ambassadors, colleagues who are also environmental professionals on site and are familiar with the coordination of the relevant processes.”

The system evolves continuously. “The environmental guidelines were revised in 2012, 2016, and 2023 to take account of new developments. In 2024, the worldwide environmental management system was again recertified according to ISO 14001.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Page-9-NEW_B777F_PPT_Min-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 12:14:21.793044

After five iterations of the NGFS long-term climate scenarios and following user feedback from the financial community, the NGFS published new short-term scenarios (through 2030) on 07 May 2025.[2] The intention is to provide ‘decision useful’ scenario outputs focussed on the current business, credit and electoral cycle which better reflect investment horizons.

Baseline Scenarios

The baseline scenario is calibrated using the October 2023 IMF World Economic Outlook projections:

• The macroeconomic variables used to align the models to the IMF projections are GDP, inflation, technical progress, sectoral growth, population levels, and consumption patterns.

The impact of COVID-19 and the energy price shocks of 2022 are considered in the calibration of the monetary policy response.

Key innovations of the NGFS short-term scenarios include:

modelling of compound extreme climate events (simultaneous occurrences of multiple bundled hazards such as floods & storms (wet); and heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires (dry));

incorporating cross-regional transmission of shocks (short-term spillover effects of both transition and physical shocks through trade and financial linkages);

providing a framework to study the interplay between climate risks and business cycles, by integrating climate policy, extreme weather events, economic trends and sectoral dynamics;

zooming in on a policy-relevant timeframe for financial stability and monetary policy;

providing granular economic and financial data across a wide range of sectors and countries, and capturing the inflationary impacts of climate damages.[3]

The NGFS suggest ‘these features make the short-term scenarios well-suited for climate stress-testing exercises and for analysing financial risks that may materialise within a business-planning, policy- relevant timeframe’.[4]

Four distinct narrative scenarios are presented – exploring diverging levels of climate policy action and physical climate risk to 2030.

Key Messages of the Short-Term Scenario Outputs Include

The possible occurrence of a sequence of plausible but extreme weather events in one region causes substantial GDP losses, with effects on the global economy. The impacts of these extreme disasters vary across regions, with losses peaking at 12.5% of GDP in Africa. Effects of regional disasters affect the global economy through trade and financial linkages.

Default probabilities rise significantly for high-capital and high-debt sectors, with increases of more than 10pp in the power supply sector (albeit from a low base).[5]

Rapid and unexpected policy shifts increase the economic costs of transitioning and cause additional financial stress. A delayed and abrupt transition generates global output losses of 1.3% (each year) and increases the unemployment rate by 1.3pp. Default probabilities rise significantly in several sectors, with increases of more than 10pp in the power supply sector, due to its high capital intensity and high debt to capital ratio.[6]

What the short-term scenarios get right?

The short-term scenario narratives include four plausible story lines with varying assumptions around the short-term evolution of climate policies and physical climate risk. This storyline approach to qualitative climate scenarios is broadly comparable to the approach TREX analysis take with narrative based scenarios – first developed with Exeter University and USS[7] to be more intuitive for pension fund trustees.

The short-term scenarios focus on the period 2025 – 2030 – a window of time deemed “decision useful” for institutional investors, corporate financial planning and politics, with 2030 a key waypoint towards net-zero 2050 targets.

The focus on hardest hit regions (Africa, Asia) and sectors (agriculture, fossil energy/ coal) provides investors with actionable information regarding how the differing pace of transition and manifestation of climate risk is likely to impact GDP output, default rates, and capital costs in regions and key sectors in which they invest, especially energy, where viable transition plans are lacking.

What the short-term scenarios could improve?

Like the NGFS long-term scenarios, due to the inherent uncertainties, the short-term scenarios exclude the plausible possibility of triggering climate tipping points – potentially resulting in cascading physical climate damages[8] – thus ignoring potential for catastrophic risks.

Sovereign default risks, as in the long-term scenarios appear insufficiently captured. Page 66 of the Technical Documentation[9] states: sovereign default probability can be approximated by a linear combination of sectoral default probabilities (if the latter are calibrated on the same exogenous default probability as the former). Petrostates reliant on high fossil prices and demand with high fiscal breakeven prices are uniquely exposed to a moderately paced transition – refer CTI Vulnerability Chart – Petrostates of Decline (2023) report[10].

The distorting impacts of subsidies – such as the estimated $7 trillion annual global subsidy to prop up fossil fuels (IMF 2022) – are not captured.[11]

By design, there is no probability of occurrence attributed to each narrative scenario – the NGFS suggest “to address this – you can either hire experts to share expert opinions – or rely on the market to infer default expectations”[12]. The scenarios are primarily designed for stress-testing, not intended as forecasts.

The accompanying technical documentation pg 5 states: “In terms of the interplay between transition and physical risks in the short-term time horizon, it is important to note that transition risk has little to no impact on physical risk over the short- term scenario forecast horizon of five years. Climate change impacts experienced now are the result of past GHG emissions and concentration in the atmosphere.” – While this is true for CO2 (10yrs + lag), other emissions, notably methane and aerosols are much faster acting – and should be considered separately[13] according to the Global Heat Reduction Initiative.[14] Around 30% of all post-industrial warming has been caused by methane[15], yet emissions are standardised for accounting purposes into tonnes CO2 equivalent.[16] Given the recent expansion of gas power and LNG in the global energy mix, faster acting methane emissions should be accounted for separately, to better reflect the short-term warming impacts of the dash for gas.

The NGFS short-term scenarios are said to have ‘limited comparability’ with the long-term scenarios, due to different modelling approaches.

NGFS Comparisons With Investment Consultants Narrative Scenarios

TREX analysis have published their own assessment of NGFS scenarios against their own short-term scenarios which can be read in full here.[17]

TREX representation of 3 of 4 NGFS Scenarios (no Disasters/Policy Stagnation)

Equivalent GDP damages in TREX NTTL Narrative Scenarios

In terms of both GDP damages, and the pace of adoption of new scientific research and modelling techniques – it should be noted that relative to individual investment consultants, the NGFS is constrained by its large and geographically dispersed international membership and governance model of consensus decision making.[18]

The objective of the NGFS is to support the widespread adoption of practices by financial sector actors and policy makers to include climate considerations in their assessments and analyses. Standardisation of approach and comparability across institutions is key, adopting well established climate assumptions and models for the production of scenarios.

As observable in other consensus-based forums such as the IPCC or COP – it is commonplace for outputs agreed by consensus to lag cutting edge science, particularly on knowledge frontier topics like climate tipping points, where uncertainty remains.

In areas of imperfect knowledge, but catastrophic potential risks, scientists advocate for the precautionary principle to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, until we know risks can be avoided.

Conclusion

Drawing attention to the heightened default risks for exposed sectors in the NGFS short-term scenarios may prove to be more effective at changing investor behaviour than the more typical % global GDP damage figures frequently cited in long-term scenario analysis. Investors own stocks and bonds, not GDP.

As a recently emerging practice, the relationship between higher future damages in climate scenario analysis, and resulting investor behaviours, such as revised net zero target setting, investment tilts and increased allocations to solutions remains both poorly studied and understood.

With 140+ global central banks now looking to deploy NGFS short-term scenarios for financial sector supervisory purposes – the outcomes of upcoming stress test exercises deploying the new scenarios will be closely watched.

With ‘decision useful’ scenarios – the NGFS is heading in the right direction, but there is more work to be done to ensure that financial sector expectations of future physical climate damages are aligned with climate science.

Ultimately, it is what happens to real-world financed emissions that counts.

Sustainable supply chains

Ecolab is dedicated to limiting the effect of its operations on the environment, with consideration for the amount of waste it is generating and sending to landfill.

Beyond its own eco-friendly practices, the company works with supply chain partners to identify how GHG emissions can be reduced. It holds its suppliers accountable through supplier surveying mechanisms.

As a result of these biannual ethical and environmental sourcing surveys, Ecolab can monitor and improve sustainability performance across the chain.

Through its collaboration efforts, Ecolab placed on CDP’s 2024 Supplier Engagement Assessment Leaderboard as recognition for its thorough engagement with supply chains.

In 2023, Ecolab and other industry players launched the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Hub in a bid to tackle the large amounts of GHG emissions produced by aviation. It continued its collaboration in 2024, taking these measures to reduce aviation carbon footprint.

Last year, Ecolab ensured it remained a sustainable company, moving towards its 2030 100% renewable electricity goals. The company achieved 70% renewable electricity globally due to its 100% renewable electricity usage across European Union operations.

As a result of Ecolab’s progress in meeting GHG emissions targets, it gained recognition and approval from the Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

Reflecting on Ecolab’s practices, Christophe Beck, Chairman and CEO of Ecolab, comments: “In our own operations, we improved water use efficiency, reduced our carbon footprint and cultivated a winning team that reflects our communities and champions our culture of safety.”

Elsewhere, Ecolab sponsors Disability:IN and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) Chemical Industry Accelerator, boosting supply chain resilience and creating opportunities for diverse and underrepresented communities.

Moreover, Ecolab’s suppliers must meet its supplier ethical assessment, which actively addresses human rights within supply chains.

Its partners must be able to verify they meet Ecolab’s criteria of ethical practices, particularly in areas where there is a higher risk of slavery and human trafficking.

The impact

Supply chains, including those concerned with water supply, bear the brunt of global disruptions such as climate change, economic fluctuations, population growth and public health concerns.

As a result, many companies are seeing increased operating costs and a shortage of resources.

The World Resources Institute projects a 56% water deficit by 2030, so Ecolab is working to identify and implement water reduction and reuse solutions.

This year’s event sent a clear message: the time for incremental change is over and the aviation sector must act decisively now to align with global climate goals.

Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, the Paris Air Show 2025 reflected increased attention to defense technologies and security alongside sustainability efforts.

The Paris Air Show is the world’s largest aerospace event, bringing together industry leaders, innovators and policy-makers. The 2025 edition, held in June, was marked by a strong focus on sustainability, with new technologies, major commercial orders and cross-sector partnerships all aimed at reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

Aviation is under increasing scrutiny to address its carbon footprint. The industry faces the dual challenge of meeting growing demand for air travel while achieving ambitious net-zero targets.

This year’s airshow reflected a clear shift: sustainability is now central to business strategy, investment and innovation.

Key trends included the rapid adoption of the lower-carbon alternative, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); advances in hydrogen and electric propulsion – increasing the decarbonization potential of the sector; and a renewed focus on regional and short-haul efficiency to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Fleet renewal with a green edge

Improving aircraft efficiency and reducing fuel consumption is an essential component of airlines’ journey to net zero and air shows typically see many new orders being announced.

Airbus secured nearly $21 billion in new deals, including a landmark agreement with VietJet for 100 A321neo aircraft – jets that are popular for their range, capacity and improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions compared to previous models.

Riyadh Air’s order for 25 Airbus A350-1000s, paired with 50 Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, further underscored the industry’s shift toward cleaner, more efficient fleets.

Even in the training sector, sustainability is taking centre stage: ENAC’s 30-plane order from Elixir Aircraft, France’s national civil aviation school, will see new training aircraft use advanced carbon composites and consume up to 70% less fuel than traditional models.

Breakthroughs in aircraft and propulsion technologies

It wasn’t just about buying new planes, but what powers them and how they’re built. Airbus drew attention with its world-record 1.2 megawatt (MW) aviation fuel cell system, a major step toward hydrogen-powered flight.

The company also unveiled aerodynamic innovations such as the eXtra Performance Wing, which could cut fuel consumption by up to 10%. Meanwhile, MagniX’s new high-energy-density battery (400 watts per kilogram) is bringing electric and hybrid-electric regional flights closer to reality.

Rotorcraft weren’t left out: the Airbus Racer helicopter demonstrator, developed under the Clean Sky 2 European initiative, achieved 20–30% lower fuel consumption than conventional helicopters. These advances show how new materials, smarter design and alternative propulsion are converging to make aviation cleaner and more efficient.

Sustainable fuels take centre stage

SAF was a recurring theme, with the industry recognizing it as the most immediate lever for reducing emissions. TotalEnergies’ 15-year agreement with Quatra to secure 60,000 tonnes of used cooking oil annually for SAF production is a sign of how supply chains are scaling up.

ATR’s partnership with ATOBA Energy aims to make 100% SAF capability a reality for regional aircraft, showing that collaboration between manufacturers and energy providers is key to accelerating adoption.

Hydrogen-powered aviation also made tangible progress, with several companies moving from research to real-world demonstration. ZeroAvia announced it had secured new UK government funding for its Liquid Hydrogen System Integration & Flight Test (LH-SIFT) project, which will see the world’s first liquid hydrogen-powered commercial airframe testbed.

The company also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Loganair, aiming to bring zero-emission, hydrogen-electric engines to regional routes in the UK and is establishing a hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing centre near Glasgow Airport to support future deployment.

HyFlux also gained momentum by winning a UK government grant to advance its hydrogen-electric propulsion technology, which uses superconducting motors and cryogenic cooling. These achievements will support the acceleration of zero-emission transport innovation, further strengthening the sector’s hydrogen ecosystem.

Collaboration at the heart

None of these advances happen in isolation. The airshow highlighted the power of multistakeholder collaboration, with public and private sectors, manufacturers, airlines, energy companies and research institutes all working together.

The launch of the ARIS (Aviation Research and Innovation Strategy for Sustainability) programme marked a fitting finale: this Europe-wide initiative brings together research institutes, manufacturers, air traffic management providers and policymakers to focus on zero-emission aircraft, digital air traffic management and workforce upskilling.

It’s a clear signal that the industry recognizes the magnitude of the challenge and the necessity of collaboration to address it.

The wider geopolitical context

Driven by the current geopolitical landscape, many exhibitors and industry leaders showcased advanced defence technologies and defence systems and dual-use innovations.

The growing emphasis on security reflects the sector’s need to balance decarbonization goals with the realities of a rapidly changing global context.

However, the air show demonstrated that sustainability is now at the heart of aviation’s business strategy. The industry is transitioning from pilot projects to large-scale orders, long-term supply agreements and coordinated research, signalling real momentum toward net zero.

While challenges remain, such as scaling SAF production, certifying new propulsion systems and modernizing infrastructure, the collaborative efforts seen at Le Bourget show that progress is accelerating.

Major orders for fuel-efficient aircraft advances in hydrogen and electric propulsion and new SAF partnerships all point to a sector in transformation.

Continued collaboration among manufacturers, airlines, energy providers and policymakers will be essential to deliver on the promise of net-zero flights and keep the industry aligned with global climate goals.

Next: Dubai Airshow 2025

The contract is in alignment with the ambitious environmental targets of BA, particularly the goal of powering 10% of its planes by 2030 using SAF. The contract is significant for the company in meeting its goal of reducing its carbon footprint and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The deal between BA and Hong Kong-based EcoCeres will see the airline reduce carbon emissions by approximately 400,000 metric tonnes over the lifecycle of the SAF compared to traditional kerosene-based jet fuel. According to EcoCeres, this reduction is equivalent to the emissions generated by 240,000 economy class passengers traveling on round-trip flights between London and New York.

A Bold Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The partnership is a key part of British Airways’ broader sustainability strategy. The airline has already made significant strides in using SAF, with 2.7 percent of its total fuel use in 2024 coming from sustainable sources. Carrie Harris, BA’s Director of Sustainability, highlighted the importance of SAF in the airline’s ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon intensity. Since 2019, British Airways has successfully reduced its carbon intensity by 13 percent, with SAF playing a crucial role in achieving that target.

“In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7 percent of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13 percent reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019,” Harris said in a statement. She further emphasized the significance of the EcoCeres deal, calling it “another important step forward on our journey to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

Regulatory Support for SAF Adoption

The British Airways-EcoCeres agreement comes at a time when the aviation industry is facing increasing regulatory pressure to reduce its environmental impact. As part of efforts to curb aviation emissions, governments worldwide, including the UK and EU, have introduced mandates requiring airlines to incorporate at least 2 percent SAF into their total fuel mix by 2025. This regulation aims to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry, pushing airlines toward cleaner, more sustainable fuel options.

The growth of SAF is considered a crucial part of the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce its overall carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which is derived from fossil fuels, SAF is produced using renewable resources, including waste oils and agricultural residues. As a result, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

EcoCeres’ Role in Advancing Sustainability

EcoCeres, which operates a processing facility for alternative aviation fuels in Jiangsu, China, is a key player in the development of SAF. The company’s commitment to sustainability and innovation is reflected in its partnership with British Airways, which helps both companies contribute to the broader aviation industry’s environmental goals.

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, expressed the company’s dedication to sustainable fuel production. “Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership exemplifies our dedication to providing innovative fuel solutions that will help the aviation industry meet its environmental targets,” Lievonen said. EcoCeres’ facilities in China are focused on producing SAF using sustainable methods, which significantly reduce emissions when compared to traditional aviation fuel.

Expansion of SAF Production with LanzaJet

In addition to the EcoCeres deal, British Airways is backing several other SAF production initiatives globally. One such initiative includes supporting facilities in the UK and the United States operated by LanzaJet, a leading specialist fuel company. LanzaJet’s facilities focus on producing SAF using a technology that converts sustainable feedstocks like ethanol into aviation fuel.

This diversified approach allows British Airways to expand its SAF sourcing capabilities and ensures that the airline has access to sufficient quantities of sustainable fuel to meet its growing fuel demand as it strives to meet its sustainability goals.

The Road Ahead: British Airways’ Net-Zero Vision

British Airways is not alone in its pursuit of SAF. The entire aviation industry is shifting towards alternative fuel solutions to meet sustainability targets set by governments and international aviation organizations. British Airways’ commitment to SAF and carbon reduction forms part of its broader ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. As the airline industry continues to evolve, SAF is expected to play an increasingly important role in achieving this goal.

The partnership with EcoCeres is just one part of British Airways’ multi-faceted approach to becoming more sustainable. In addition to SAF, the airline is investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, exploring carbon offsetting options, and working to reduce waste and improve operational efficiency.

Conclusion: A Step Toward a Sustainable Future

The EcoCeres/British Airways agreement is significant in the company’s drive to reduce the environmental footprint of the business and to inspire the industry to be greener. Through the expansion of its SAF supply chain and reduction of emissions through innovative partnerships, British Airways is taking leadership in driving the industry to shift to greener practices. It is good for the business and customers but also fits within broader initiatives to address climate change and to reduce emissions worldwide.

This joint venture will undoubtedly create the precedent to inspire additional carriers to take the same path to cleaner, greener flying fuels, pushing the world further towards cleaner flying.

The SAF Matchmaker was envisioned to address the efficiency of SAF procurement without any unnecessary fees, connect parties both supplying and in search of SAF and provide information regarding the availability of SAF such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, emission reduction and compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, said:

To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.

The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.

The SAF Matchmaker, which is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, also supports spot purchases in addition to offtake agreements, and will initially be made available to airline and SAF suppliers only. The IATA has stated that access will be granted to other SAF buyers, such as non-aviation corporations, in due course.

Grain markets await USDA’s data... Corn, soybeans and wheat traded on both sides of unchanged in a relatively light overnight session as traders await USDA’s reports later this morning. As of 6:30 a.m. CT, corn futures are trading mostly 2 to 3 cents lower, soybeans are 2 to 4 cents higher and wheat futures are fractionally to 2 cents lower. The U.S. dollar index is nearly 250 points lower and front-month crude oil futures are about 30 cents lower.

Big USDA report day... USDA will release its Acreage and Quarterly Grain Stocks Reports at 11:00 a.m. CT. Both reports have the ability to greatly impact markets – and this is historically the most volatile trading day of the year. The pre-report estimates for the Acreage Report suggest analysts on average expect relatively modest changes from March planting intentions. However, the ranges for expectations for corn and soybean plantings are wide, so there could be a surprise. Quarterly stocks have consistently been difficult for analysts to peg, especially corn. The range of estimates for June 1 corn stocks is 325 million bu., meaning someone will be surprised. Click here to view pre-report estimates.

Less rain, not as hot for most U.S. crop areas... Seasonal temps are likely across the Plains, Midwest, Delta and Southeast this week, while rainfall will be scattered. While temps won’t be as hot as recent weeks, some areas may see soil moisture decline if rains miss. The Pacific Northwest will be hot and dry, stressing crops in that region.

Canada tries to revive U.S. trade talks... Canada has announced it will rescind its Digital Services Tax (DST) in a significant concession after President Donald Trump announced last Friday he was terminating trade talks with Ottawa. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump have agreed that both sides will resume negotiations immediately, with the goal of reaching a final deal by July 21. The Canadian government’s move comes after months of U.S. pressure and repeated warnings the DST was a major sticking point in efforts to reset the cross-border trading relationship. Meanwhile, Canada Bill C-202 is now law after passing both the House of Commons and Senate and garnering a Royal Assent. The legislation prohibits Canadian trade negotiators from making commitments that would increase tariff rate quotas (TRQs) or reduce tariffs on supply-managed goods — namely dairy, poultry, and eggs — in future trade negotiations. However, its actual power to prevent the government from adjusting its negotiating stance is limited, sources signal.

India draws ‘red line’ on agriculture in U.S. trade talks... India’s agriculture and dairy are “very big red lines” in its ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Financial Express newspaper. In the trade talks, the U.S. is pushing for more Indian purchases of grains and ethanol, citing a significant trade imbalance, along with expanded market access for dairy, alcoholic beverages, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Meanwhile, India’s auto, pharmaceutical and small-scale firms are lobbying for a gradual opening of the protected sectors, fearing competition from U.S. firms.

The week ahead in Washington... The Senate will vote today on Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill, a multi-trillion-dollar spending and tax package at the core of his second-term agenda. If the measure clears the Senate, it will then require a second House vote before reaching Trump’s desk. The House is tentatively set to take up the measure on Tuesday, aiming to pass it before the July 4 deadline. However, the path is fraught with internal party drama and unresolved policy disputes that threaten the bill’s future. The other focus in Washington this week will be ongoing trade negotiations with key trading partners ahead of Trump’s July 9 deadline to enforce heavier tariffs. This week’s economic spotlight will be on the June jobs report on Thursday. Markets and government offices are closed on Friday for the July 4 holiday.

Senate modifies, strengthens 45Z credit... The Senate’s updated legislative text for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit as part of the reconciliation package would extend for two years the clean fuel production credit, which applies to low-emission fuels made from renewable materials such as soybeans and corn. It’s currently slated to expire at the end of 2027 and would be extended through 2029. The House bill would extend it for four years (through the end of 2031). This will likely be a point of negotiation in the conference process. The Senate version upholds the House-passed requirement that would prohibit the credit for any feedstock produced outside the U.S., Mexico, or Canada, excluding imported feedstocks like Chinese used cooking oil (UCO) and South American tallow from receiving U.S. taxpayer support. The Senate bill would eliminate a larger credit for sustainable aviation fuel, largely bar negative emissions rates that lead to larger credits and modify emission rates to exclude indirect land use changes. The Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer credit is increased to 20 cents per gallon and the 45Z credit is now transferable, making it easier for smaller biofuel producers to benefit from the program.

Major changes to California’s updated LCFS... Beginning July 1, major updates to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) will take effect, marking a pivotal shift in the state’s climate and transportation policy. Approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the amended LCFS accelerates emissions goals — targeting a 30% reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2045. These amendments are intended to drive deeper greenhouse gas cuts, increase clean fuel investment and support California’s 2045 net-zero ambitions.

China’s manufacturing sector improves, but remains in contraction... China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 49.7 in June from 49.5 in May, but that marked the third straight month of contraction in the sector. Output rose the most in three months, while sales fell at their slowest rate during that span and new domestic orders showed expansion. But new export orders remained in contraction for the 14th consecutive month.

Cash cattle decline, expected to weaken further... Cash cattle traded generally $3.00 to $5.00 lower last week, though the official average price won’t be known until later this morning. Cash cattle prices are expected to weaken again this week, despite packer margins turning positive.

Cash hog index continues to firm but gains slowing... The CME lean hog index is up another 13 cents to $112.02 as of June 26, though that’s the smallest daily gain since May 23. July lean hog futures finished last Friday at a $1.23 premium to today’s quote, while August hogs held a $1.745 discount – suggesting traders anticipate the seasonal runup will end soon.

Weekend demand news... South Korea tendered to buy up to 60,000 MT of soymeal to be sourced from the U.S., South America or China. Jordan tendered to buy up to 120,000 MT of optional origin milling wheat.

The transaction, which is expected to close by July 2025, will increase AM Green’s total stake in Greenko to approximately 25%, when combined with its existing holdings.

The deal is structured through AM Green’s subsidiary, AM Green Power BV, and also includes a strategic investment by ORIX into a convertible note issued by AM Green’s Luxembourg-based parent company. This provides ORIX with long-term exposure to green hydrogen, green ammonia, sustainable aviation fuel, and other low-carbon fuels—aligning with its capital recycling approach in clean energy investments.

Founded in 2023 by Greenko’s co-founders Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, AM Green operates a fully integrated Power-to-X platform. It spans renewable power, energy storage, and production of green molecules. The acquisition further deepens AM Green’s vertical integration by leveraging Greenko’s renewable and pumped storage portfolio of over 10 GW across India.

AM Green’s flagship project in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, is under construction and aims to produce 1 million tonnes of green ammonia annually, scaling to 5 MTPA by 2030. The complex will include a 2 GW electrolyzer factory and sustainable aviation fuel units. Supply agreements are already in place with global players like Uniper SE and Yara Clean Ammonia.

Before we talked to these women, they actually thought that climate change was a divine intervention and they didn’t understand it.
They thought it was something that was more divine,” Alison Ward, CEO of CottonConnect explained at the Summit.
She is a professor focused on sustainable food systems, and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Southwestern University.
As Currey explained, “food systems have to do with everything, from production to processing, distribution, the utilization.","“We harness the power of the tiny microbe,” Zara Summers, Ph.D. explained, “They’re eating gas, they’re eating CO2, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and they’re turning them into ethanol…this is the oldest metabolism on earth.”

“These microbes are called acetogens, your oldest ancestor, if you will,” she said at The Earth Day Women’s Summit on April 22, 2025 at EarthX2025 in Dallas, Texas. “They are descendants of early life,” she said, presenting a white t-shirt (with a black swoosh on it) and a pair of fuchsia leggings that she said were made from captured CO2.

Then she continued her mini-chemistry lesson telling us how these microbes can make other things we need every day. “They turn it into ethanol, and so all we have to do is a little bit of chemistry on the back end and take that ethanol…and you slam together and make long polymers, and those long polymers become your jet fuel. This is your sustainable aviation fuel, or as the new administration would like us to call it, synthetic aviation fuel, whatever.”

Making fiber – and other stuff – from new sources

The key point to me from Summers was, ”Once you have ethylene, it's actually a building block of everything that petroleum is, is used for today.”

Think about all the things made from petroleum today, beyond the gas in your car or truck. Polyester, plastic, pesticides, cement, asphalt, tires, nail polish, refrigerators, eyeglasses, aspirin, the list goes on because literally hundreds, maybe thousands of different products are made from petroleum.

“Pretty much any synthetic fiber that you can get from Fossil, we have a path to create.,” she said. “Instead of pumping that carbon monoxide and dioxide directly into the atmosphere, we pump it into our massive, kind of like a brewery, but cooler, huge, huge 500,000 liter tanks of living, breathing, spinning out ethanol microbes. And so we harness that. It's a continuous process. So it's very much like a, a refining process,” is how Summers described their process in layperson’s terms. She also said they are making a new edible protein out of captured CO2.

It sounds like science fiction but it’s the new world of fashion and food, as innovators like Summers, who is Chief Science Officer at LanzaTech, find innovative ways to address the climate crisis.

They have “partnered with REI” on running apparel, with Gucci on perfume, and with Athleta on those leggings, as well as with Lululemon and “a lot of brands.” Athleta, she said, “committed that they want to hit about 25% of the polyester that they're, of the carbon that is going into these leggings, is going to be from emissions produced ethanol. This is a massive step change.”

Regenerative cotton empowering female farmers

“This is about giving women knowledge and skills about climate change. Before we talked to these women, they actually thought that climate change was a divine intervention and they didn’t understand it. They had no idea that the changes that they were seeing were due to weather patterns. They thought it was something that was more divine,” Alison Ward, CEO of CottonConnect explained at the Summit. CottonConnect is a nonprofit that trains and empowers female farmers in India, China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and Bangladesh to grow cotton sustainably, and financially sustainable businesses. They have deals with Primark and Carrefour (in Europe), among others.

“These women are quite near big urban centers, but just haven't had access to training and knowledge,” she added.

These female farmers face 117 degree heat Fahrenheit, and changes in their water sources, and their cattle not producing as much milk, among other consequences of climate change, Ward delineated.

The techniques CottonConnect teaches the women to use often originate in indigenous cultures, she said. “So, we’re almost going back to some original techniques that we are rediscovering,” including how to make natural pesticides with things already on their farm. King Charles III uses one on his sheep, she offered intriguingly.

“There's the positive impact on from regenerative, but also there's that sort of positive impact in terms of the status of women in these communities,” Ward emphasized. These women have more influence.

CottonConnect and the farmers can track where their cotton is used, because they give every farm a tracking system, including a DNA marker, which enables them to track their cotton through the supply chain to your local retailer. They have traced 1.7 billion t-shirts, so far, she disclosed.

Food science and systems are being reinvented too.

“We know that globally we have enough production on planet Earth in order to ensure proper nutrition – and again, nutrition's very different from caloric and a full belly, as we know from all of the health issues that are more in developed worlds. But, there's serious distribution problems,” Robin Currey, Ph.D. explained on the panel.

That means, “that not everybody has equitable access to the kinds of foods that they need and want, at the times that they need them. So there's, there's quite a bit of instability,” Currey cautioned. She is a professor focused on sustainable food systems, and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Southwestern University.

What are “food systems”? As Currey explained, “food systems have to do with everything, from production to processing, distribution, the utilization. So that's like how we prepare it, how we're cooking it,” and of course food waste.

Unfortunately, food waste in the United States is a massive 40%. Talk about a distribution problem; think about all the hungry people that 40% of wasted food – or even half of it – could feed if it was distributed to those who need it.

These remarkable innovations are driven by the challenge to address the climate crisis and make our lives better. They also empower women as both businesspeople and consumers.

Consumers have a lot power with our purchases, especially women, who make or influence 85% of them.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6861ab8b9c9801956e98710e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-30 08:06:24.423011
