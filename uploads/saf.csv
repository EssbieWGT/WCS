About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said.
Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective.
Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.
“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.","RAPID CITY — Jerry Schmitz is rarely at a loss for words about soybeans.

But when asked if farmers have faith in a good outcome from the Trump administration’s trade standoff with China, his gaze shifted and his brow creased momentarily as he thought about the best way to answer.

“Hope might be the better word over faith,” he said.

Schmitz, of rural Vermillion, is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association and the South Dakota Soybean Checkoff. A checkoff is a fee that’s collected from soybean sales and used for research and promotion of the crop.

South Dakota governor’s economic advisers bemoan Trump’s tariff policy

During and after a roundtable discussion Saturday at the Central States Fairgrounds hosted by a nonprofit called Farmers for Free Trade, Schmitz expressed concerns about the effects of trade disputes on farmers.

About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said. China imports soybeans largely for livestock feed to meet the growing demand for meat among its 1.4 billion people.

Now the country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed recently by Republican President Donald Trump.

“There is not a bushel sold to China right now, and we’re about to harvest,” Schmitz said.

Trump has said he’s wielding tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a negotiating tool to correct trade imbalances with other countries.

The Chinese boycott has reduced demand for U.S. soybeans, which has influenced prices. Soybeans sold for about $10.50 per bushel one year ago in South Dakota, but are now $1 to $1.50 lower, and there are fears of further declines without a China trade deal.

Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective. Noting that South Dakota farmers raise nearly 250 million bushels of soybeans annually, he said a price drop of $2 per bushel translates to a loss of $500 million.

Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.

“We need a deal sooner rather than later,” Johnson said, “because there is not an unlimited ability in farm country to be able to weather the storm.”

Johnson and Schmitz said farmers are planning to store some of the soybeans they’ll harvest this fall, in hopes of selling later at a higher price. Schmitz said grain elevators and soybean processors lacking buyers might have to store excess beans on the ground outside their facilities.

Both also stressed the long-term importance of finding additional buyers for U.S. soybeans. That could include developing better trade relationships with countries that have large populations and growing economies, such as India.

It could also include capitalizing on new domestic markets, such as the possibility of converting soybean oil into sustainable aviation fuel. A $500 million processing plant that will open this fall in Mitchell, for example, will process soybeans and other oilseed crops for uses in renewable fuel, food, livestock feed, lubricants and more.

Those efforts could reduce dependence on Chinese demand but aren’t likely to wholly replace it.

“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.

The congressman said many of the farmers he meets are “still backing the president’s play” to use tariffs in negotiations that could benefit agriculture in the future, but he said high tariffs “cannot be business as usual on a go-forward basis.”

“The president’s trying to use them as a tool to get better deals,” Johnson said. “I understand that approach, but we do not want to just end with high tariffs.”

The roundtable organizer, Farmers for Free Trade, is on a 14-state tour in an RV wrapped with pro-trade messaging. The group advocates for open markets and reduced trade barriers, said its executive director, Brian Kuehl, of Wyoming.

He referenced a statistic indicating exports account for 20% of the value of U.S. agricultural production.

“So if you were to lose all your exports, you’re going to lose farms, and you’re going to lose farmers. You’re going to lose rural America and rural communities,” Kuehl said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2788.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:56:15.927613

Now, are all SAF pathways the same? Of course not.

Today on the podcast we will talk with Mukund Karanjikar, founder and CEO of CleanJoule, a SAF startup based in Utah that is developing a SAF production method that delivers more joules of energy per unit of fuel mass than other traditional biogenic pathways.

What’s more, not content with powering a commercial aviation industry that is thirsty for SAF, CleanJoule is also developing biogenic SAF for space travel. So, when it comes to CleanJoule, you could well say that the sky is not the limit!

The prospect of clean space travel is quite interesting by itself, but, of course, there are other considerations too, such as cost and strategic independence and, on these two counts, CleanJoule is also ready to deliver, says Mukund.

So, in today’s episode we are going to learn a bit more about CycloSAF and CycloRP, the two flavours of sustainable aviation fuel that CleanJoule is developing (for the aviation and space industries, respectively) and how CleanJoule plans to roll out and scale production before the end of this decade.

We will also talk about the positioning of CleanJoule is the broader and constantly evolving SAF industry landscape and why this startup has got the attention of prominent investors such as Indigo Partners (a private equity firm which owns a global portfolio of low-cost airlines) and Temasek (one of Singapore’s most prominent groups).

Airlines such as Lufthansa, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways are investing heavily in the new twinjet to expand networks, reduce costs, and provide passengers with a comfortable travel experience.

Tourism authorities have welcomed the development, emphasizing the economic benefits of direct flights. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), nonstop flights increase inbound tourism by reducing travel fatigue and making destinations more accessible. Passengers traveling from Sydney to London or Doha to Santiago will experience fewer travel disruptions and shorter overall journey times, enhancing global tourism flows.

Reaching Further Without Compromise

The Boeing 777X family includes two models: the larger 777-9 and the smaller 777-8. The 777-9 can carry approximately 400 passengers up to 7,300 nautical miles, while the 777-8 extends the range to nearly 8,700 nautical miles. These capabilities allow airlines to launch nonstop connections that were previously impossible, offering direct access for tourists to high-demand destinations without layovers.

Advanced Design for Airports and Comfort

A key feature of the 777X is its folding wingtips. While in flight, the wings extend to 71.8 meters for better lift efficiency. On the ground, the wingtips fold to 64.8 meters, allowing the plane to fit into standard 777 gates without costly airport modifications. Unlike the Airbus A380, which required special infrastructure, the 777X can operate at existing airports worldwide.

Inside, the cabin has been redesigned for passenger comfort. Larger windows, wider aisles, and improved lighting allow airlines to create more spacious and flexible seating arrangements. The modern interiors aim to reduce jet lag and improve the travel experience on ultra-long-haul flights.

Powerful and Efficient Engines

The Boeing 777X is powered by the GE9X engines, the world’s largest commercial turbofans with a 134-inch fan diameter. They deliver 10% better fuel efficiency compared with previous models while supporting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Carbon-fiber composite blades make the engines lighter and more durable, reducing maintenance and operating costs for airlines.

Tourism and Economic Impact

Direct, long-range flights create a direct tourism boost for destination cities. Governments and tourism boards, including Tourism Australia and Visit Britain, highlight that nonstop connectivity encourages higher visitor numbers, longer stays, and increased spending in hotels, restaurants, and local attractions.

For example, Sydney tourists flying directly to London for cultural and business trips, or travelers from Doha visiting Santiago for leisure, can now experience a faster and more convenient journey. The 777X will also support business tourism, conferences, and international events by connecting key global hubs.

Airline Commitments and Market Reach

Lufthansa is the launch customer, replacing its Boeing 747 fleet with the 777X. Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways have placed significant orders, signaling confidence in the aircraft’s operational and environmental advantages.

The 777X program currently has 259 orders, representing the largest commercial aircraft investment in history. By offering longer nonstop routes and reduced operational costs, airlines can expand routes, attract more tourists, and strengthen global tourism markets.

Looking Ahead

FAA certification is expected in 2026, following rigorous testing across multiple flight conditions. Governments and tourism agencies are already preparing to market the new direct routes, highlighting ease of access, cultural experiences, and luxury travel opportunities.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-7-2025-06_11_15-PM-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:56:19.678421

Lufthansa (LH) was the first airline to place an order, aiming to replace its older Boeing 747 (FRA) fleet with the new twinjet.

Airlines like Emirates (DXB), Qatar Airways (DOH), and Etihad Airways (AUH) have followed with large commitments, drawn to the aircraft’s ability to cut costs and open new nonstop routes.

Boeing 777X Routes

The Boeing 777X family is built around two variants: the 777-9 and the 777-8. The larger 777-9 will seat roughly 400 passengers in a two-class layout and fly about 7,300 nautical miles, while the smaller 777-8 can cover nearly 8,700 nautical miles.

This range allows nonstop connections like Sydney (SYD) to London (LHR) or Doha (DOH) to Santiago (SCL) without payload restrictions.

The 777X blends capacity and efficiency in a way unmatched by current widebodies. Compared with the 777-300ER and Airbus A350-1000, it offers more seats while consuming less fuel per passenger. That balance gives airlines the flexibility to expand networks and protect margins in slot-constrained airports, Simple Flying reported.

Key Design Innovations

A central feature of the 777X is its composite wing with folding wingtips. Extended, it reaches a span of 71.8 meters for an improved lift-to-drag ratio. On the ground, the tips fold up, reducing the span to 64.8 meters, allowing the aircraft to operate as a Code-E jet without requiring airport modifications.

Unlike the Airbus A380, which faced infrastructure challenges, the 777X can fit seamlessly into existing 777 operations.

The cabin has also been redesigned to provide a better passenger experience, with larger windows, improved lighting, and wider cabins. This gives airlines more flexibility in configuring seating while keeping comfort at the forefront.

Power Behind 777X: GE9X Engines

The GE9X engine is the world’s largest and most powerful commercial turbofan, with a 134-inch fan diameter and a bypass ratio of 10:1.

It delivers a 10% fuel efficiency improvement over the GE90 while cutting thrust-specific fuel consumption by 5% compared with other widebodies.

The fan blades, made from carbon fiber composites with steel leading edges, are lighter and stronger, reducing weight and improving durability. Fewer blades—16 instead of 22 in the GE90—further improve efficiency.

These advances lower maintenance costs, extend shop intervals, and help airlines reduce operating expenses while supporting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use.

Orders and Market Impact

Boeing secured 259 orders at launch, making it the largest aircraft program by dollar value in history. Emirates ordered 150 units, Qatar Airways committed to 50, and Etihad placed an order for 25.

Lufthansa (FRA) purchased 34 of the 777-9, becoming the launch customer and signaling the end of its Boeing 747 operations as the new jets arrive.

The combination of high seat count, lower unit costs, and longer range makes the 777X a versatile replacement for aging quadjets like the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747. It also strengthens airline fleets against rising fuel costs and environmental regulations.

Testing and Certification Progress

The 777X test program is one of Boeing’s most extensive. Recent trials at Victorville (VCV) and Edwards Air Force Base (EDW) covered takeoff performance and environmental condition evaluations.

According to Boeing executives, certification is expected in 2026 after delays from the original 2020 target. FAA guidance continues to shape the certification timeline, with extended ETOPS testing to follow.

Despite setbacks, progress remains steady. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg emphasized that the 777X has accumulated more flight test hours than any prior program, increasing confidence in its entry into service.

Why the 777X Matters

The Boeing 777X stands as a successor to legendary long-haul jets, combining efficiency, reliability, and passenger-focused design.

Its wings, engines, and cabin represent major technological advances, while its ability to operate at existing airports avoids infrastructure limitations.

For airlines, the 777X offers lower costs per seat, longer nonstop missions, and compatibility with SAF, aligning with both commercial and environmental goals. For passengers, it promises a more comfortable, modern experience on the world’s longest flights.

India and Germany have also reduced the taxes on air travel.
It is very hard to make the technology of decarbonising air travel work.
But even if you are closer to the Extinction Rebellion side of that debate, it still does not make much sense to obsess over air travel.
Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.","Meanwhile, a few countries are even giving up on aviation taxes. From July, anyone getting a plane out of Sweden will no longer have to pay a green levy on their ticket, after its government decided that the “flight-shaming” movement had done too much damage to the industry. India and Germany have also reduced the taxes on air travel. With grim inevitability, Britain’s tax-obsessed Labour Government is still putting them up, with yet more rises in air passenger duty in the last Budget, but at least some countries are recognising they do more harm than good.

The jet zero strategy is in tatters. It is very hard to make the technology of decarbonising air travel work. Batteries are too heavy for a plane, and the electric engines do not generate enough power to keep an aircraft in the air.

Meanwhile the sustainable fuels that could have been an alternative cannot be produced at a competitive price. Sure, that may change, and the technology develops all the time, but we are not even close to making it work yet.

A few of us might be willing to follow the lead of Greta Thunberg and get a boat across the Atlantic, and the network of sleeper trains emerging across Europe will attract a few passengers, but most of us are not willing to give up flying. It remains by far the quickest, cheapest, and of course safest, mode of transport for anything much over 500 miles that we have. All the flight-shaming in the world is not going to change that, while the aviation taxes just add to the cost of living.

We need a change of strategy. We can all take a view on whether climate change is an emergency, or whether it is something that can be managed by gradually switching to different technologies as they emerge, and as they prove themselves effective, reliable, and cheap to run.

But even if you are closer to the Extinction Rebellion side of that debate, it still does not make much sense to obsess over air travel. In fact, flying might get a lot of coverage, partly because virtue-signalling politicians and celebrities love to boast about how they are travelling to Rome by canal, or getting a camel ride to Thailand, or whatever happens to look good on Instagram, but in fact, aviation only accounts for 2.5pc of global carbon emissions. It is never going to be critical to the outlook for global warming one way or another.

It would be far more sensible just to cut back on carbon emissions elsewhere. In the UK we could, for example, get on with building a new generation of nuclear power stations, and scrap all the cumbersome planning rules that make it twice as expensive to build one in Britain as it is in France or South Korea.

Across the EU, countries could drop the tariffs and quotas on Chinese electric vehicles, so that they could accelerate the switch to battery powered models by importing lots of cheap, well made cars. There are still lots of relatively simple ways of decarbonising the economy using technology that has been shown to work. We could then allow people to fly as much as they wanted to, without slapping punitive taxes on anyone who wants to take their children on holiday, or make a business trip; without guilt tripping everyone each time they go to the airport; and without wasting hundreds of millions of technologies that are clearly not going to work.

The blunt reality is this. Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/09/05/TELEMMGLPICT000427218227_17570905056530_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdLdu0TL-Cg_AMOUqySXmFgU.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Comment,N,,2025-09-07 08:56:16.173196

Through Air New Zealand, SAF’s “book and claim” system enables corporate partners to purchase SAF certificates (known as SAFc) that contribute to the airline’s use of sustainable fuel. These certificates can then be applied to a company’s own carbon reporting, helping reduce Scope 3 emissions from business travel.

The trial comes at a time when global momentum around SAF policy and production is rapidly increasing. Airlines, governments, airports, and fuel companies across the Asia-Pacific region are investing in alternative fuels, and Air New Zealand is working to help ensure New Zealand is at the table given our nation’s heavy reliance on long-haul aviation and trade.

MinterEllisonRuddWatts’ involvement aligns with its Sustainability Strategy and reinforces the firm’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The firm has pledged that 80% of its travel during the working week will be sustainable and is actively seeking innovative ways to reduce its environmental impact.

“This partnership demonstrates our leadership and accountability in the sustainability sector,” says Holly Hill, partner and sustainability leader at the firm.

“By championing SAF, we’re not only addressing a portion of our carbon footprint – we’re also helping to stimulate demand for sustainable fuel and encourage local production in New Zealand.”

Air New Zealand has offered emissions reductions through SAF to a group of early adopters to better understand corporate customer demand and inform future SAF investment, says Kiri Hannifin, the airline’s chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer.

“SAF is a complex commodity to understand, and it's a big step for a New Zealand company to buy SAF certificates because they're so new. We are very grateful to MinterEllisonRuddWatts for the leap of faith they have shown and for their leadership,” says Hannifin.

“Customers contributing to SAF like this is meaningful not only for climate reasons, but also because their action helps set up and scale a global SAF system for the future.”

One afternoon at a vocational aviation campus in Curug, a young student approached me after class. His eyes lit up as he described a simple idea: building an application to optimize crew scheduling so that airlines could run more efficiently. “If this were in the United States,” he said, “an idea like this could easily get the attention of investors. But here, it’s almost impossible. Forget about funding—getting permission just to test it is already a big hurdle.”

His frustration was real, yet his words captured something larger: the dilemma of Indonesia’s aviation ecosystem. We have thousands of young people who are talented, disciplined, and full of ideas. They dream not only of flying planes or repairing engines, but also of designing new systems, apps, and hardware. Yet the ecosystem around them is not fertile. Airports are deemed too risky for experiments. Operators hesitate to become the first customers. Regulators remain more focused on maintaining the status quo than opening space for innovation.

This is paradoxical. If there is one sector where Indonesia cannot afford to stagnate, it is aviation. With over 17,000 islands, our nation depends on the skies for integration, connectivity, and growth. Aviation is not just another industry; it is the backbone of national unity. But without entrepreneurs who can transform ideas into sustainable businesses, we risk being forever dependent on imported technologies while our own talents remain spectators.

The Urgency in Numbers

The aviation sector is not just strategic for Indonesia—it is economically massive. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air transport contributes US$15 billion annually to Indonesia’s GDP and supports more than 4 million jobs directly and indirectly. By 2035, passenger traffic in Indonesia is projected to nearly triple, making it one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world.

Meanwhile, the global drone logistics market is projected to reach US$29 billion by 2030. The market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), driven by global decarbonization goals, is expected to exceed US$200 billion by 2050. These are not abstract numbers—they represent opportunities where Indonesia’s young entrepreneurs could play a role, if only given the chance.

Yet, the paradox is glaring. While we graduate tens of thousands of students from vocational and technical aviation schools annually, almost all are channeled into fixed career tracks: pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers, ground staff. The pipeline is efficient for producing workers, but barren for producing innovators.

In comparison, Singapore—despite having only a fraction of our population—has already launched over 100 aviation-related startups through its Aviation Innovation Programme. Indonesia, with 270 million people and 17,000 islands, has virtually none making it to international recognition.

This is not just a missed opportunity—it is a strategic vulnerability.

Problem Definition: A Worker’s Paradigm in a Changing Economy

- Advertisement -

For decades, Indonesia’s vocational aviation schools have excelled at producing skilled workers: pilots, engineers, ground handlers, and technicians. This is necessary—safety and professionalism are paramount in aviation. But it has also created a “worker paradigm.” Students are trained to be operators of systems, not creators of solutions. They become competent “tukang”—craftsmen—rather than entrepreneurs.

This paradigm reinforces a pragmatic economy mindset. The goal is to graduate, secure a job, earn a stable salary, and climb the professional ladder. There is little room for risk-taking, innovation, or entrepreneurship. For many students, the safest career is working in state-owned airlines or airport authorities, not starting a business.

At the same time, the ecosystem is weak. There are few testbeds where students or startups can experiment. Private investors avoid aviation, seeing it as capital-intensive and heavily regulated. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) prefer to buy off-the-shelf foreign technologies rather than take risks with local innovators. As a result, young Indonesians with fresh ideas hit a wall: they have the talent, they have the ideas, but they lack the market, the funding, and the policy space.

The consequence is stark: while Indonesia consumes foreign aviation technologies, we contribute little to global innovation. Our airports are filled with imported systems, our airlines rely on foreign software, and our startups shy away from aviation altogether. This worker-oriented, pragmatic model may have served us in the past, but it cannot sustain Indonesia’s aviation future.

Policy Window: Why Now?

The timing could not be more critical. Several factors converge to make this the right moment to push for aviation entrepreneurship.

First, the demographic dividend. Indonesia is experiencing a surge of young talent. Millions of students graduate from vocational and technical schools every year. If even a fraction of this energy can be channeled into entrepreneurship, the impact would be transformative.

Second, global sustainability pressures. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) are pushing for greener, more sustainable aviation. Airlines worldwide are exploring electric ground support equipment, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and carbon-monitoring technologies. Indonesia cannot remain on the sidelines.

Third, ASEAN competition. Singapore has established itself as a regional hub for aviation innovation, with sandbox environments at Changi Airport. Vietnam and Thailand are aggressively investing in drone logistics and smart airports. If Indonesia fails to act, we risk being left behind in our own backyard.

Fourth, the digital economy momentum. Indonesia has already proven it can produce unicorns such as Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka. These successes demonstrate that young Indonesians are capable of world-class innovation when the ecosystem supports them. Aviation, as a sector deeply intertwined with logistics and digital solutions, is a natural next frontier.

In short, the window of opportunity is open. The question is whether we will seize it.

The Cost of Inaction

If Indonesia fails to act, the consequences will be more than economic.

Dependence on imports. We will continue to purchase aviation technologies—from air traffic management software to biometric boarding systems—from foreign suppliers. This not only drains foreign reserves but also weakens technological sovereignty.

Talent exodus. Talented youth frustrated by lack of opportunities will either leave the sector or migrate abroad. Already, we see Indonesian engineers contributing to aerospace projects in Singapore or even the Middle East.

Lost sustainability momentum. With global aviation under pressure to reduce emissions, Indonesia risks being labeled a “laggard,” missing out on green financing and carbon-credit opportunities.

Regional marginalization. As ASEAN neighbors push forward with drone logistics, urban air mobility, and smart airports, Indonesia could find itself sidelined—reduced to being a consumer market rather than a producer hub.

The opportunity cost is staggering: every year of inaction means billions in potential market value slipping away.

Concrete Areas of Innovation

Indonesia does not need to chase science-fiction dreams; many practical areas await innovation:

Smart apron management systems to reduce congestion.

Drone-based agricultural spraying for plantations in Kalimantan and Sumatra.

Digital compliance platforms for safety audits.

Electrified ground support equipment (e-GSE) for greener airports.

Cold-chain cargo monitoring to support fisheries and pharmaceuticals.

These niches are pragmatic, high-demand, and scalable—perfect entry points for young entrepreneurs.

Evidence and Comparative Analysis

Around the world, countries are finding ways to balance safety and innovation.

Singapore: Changi Airport has pioneered the Changi Innovation Sandbox, a controlled environment where startups can test technologies ranging from biometric boarding to automated baggage handling. This model shows that safety and innovation can coexist if there are boundaries and frameworks.

Rwanda: Despite limited infrastructure, Rwanda has become a global leader in drone logistics. Through partnerships with Zipline, drones deliver blood and medical supplies to remote villages in minutes. The lesson: innovation does not require a wealthy ecosystem, but it does require regulatory will and openness.

European Union: Through programs like Horizon Europe, the EU funds sustainable aviation projects—from SAF research to green airport infrastructure. By blending public funding with private innovation, Europe demonstrates how to align entrepreneurship with sustainability goals.

These examples illustrate a critical point: Indonesia does not need to reinvent the wheel. The models are out there. What is missing is the political will and institutional design to adapt them to our context.

Policy Recommendations: Building an Aviation Entrepreneurship Ecosystem

To shift from workers to entrepreneurs, and from pragmatic to sustainable economics, Indonesia must pursue a coherent set of policies. Six pillars stand out.

Curriculum Reform: Embedding Entrepreneurship in Vocational Education

Vocational aviation campuses must go beyond technical training. Entrepreneurship modules should be integrated into curricula. Students must learn how to develop business plans, pitch ideas, and assess risks alongside technical mastery. Final-year projects should not only be academic theses but also business proposals tested in real environments.

Airport Sandboxes: Creating Living Laboratories

Selected airports should be transformed into controlled innovation hubs. For example:

Kertajati as a hub for drone logistics and regional cargo solutions.

Soekarno-Hatta as a center for smart airport operations.

Batam as a cluster for light aerospace manufacturing and maintenance.

With proper regulation, these sandboxes can allow experimentation without compromising safety.

Sustainable Financing: Funding Innovation Responsibly

The government should establish green financing schemes for aviation startups. This includes:

Tax deductions for R&D.

Import duty exemptions for prototype components.

Matching funds where government co-invests alongside private investors.

By tying these funds to sustainability metrics, Indonesia can ensure that entrepreneurship aligns with long-term goals.

Domestic First-Customer Scheme: SOEs as Early Adopters

State-owned enterprises should act as “first customers” for local startups. A six-month trial contract with limited value can provide crucial validation. If successful, the product can be scaled. This approach spreads risk while giving innovators a chance to prove themselves.

Sustainable Business Integration

All business plans emerging from aviation campuses must incorporate sustainability. Whether it is reducing emissions, enhancing energy efficiency, or enabling circular economy practices, sustainability should be a default requirement.

Community and Branding: Building a Culture of Innovation

Indonesia needs a recurring platform such as an “Indonesia Aviation Startup Forum” to connect students, regulators, investors, and operators. Annual competitions can showcase talent and attract attention. Over time, this builds not just individual startups but also a culture that sees aviation as fertile ground for innovation.

Entrepreneurial Vision: From Tukang to Innovator, From Consumer to Producer

At its core, this is about a paradigm shift.

From tukang—skilled workers who execute tasks—to entrepreneurs who identify problems, design solutions, and create jobs.

From pragmatic economics, where the goal is stability and survival, to sustainable economics, where the goal is resilience, innovation, and long-term value.

From consumer of foreign technologies to producer of local solutions that can compete globally.

Vocational campuses can become the breeding ground of this transformation. They already instill discipline, precision, and technical excellence—the very qualities required for aviation. By adding entrepreneurship and sustainability to this foundation, we can produce a generation of innovators who are both competent and visionary.

Closing Narrative

As the conversation with the student in Curug ended, he looked at me with determination. “I don’t want to just be a spectator,” he said. “I want to build something in my own country.”

His words were simple, but they carried profound meaning. Indonesia’s youth are ready. They do not lack talent or ideas. What they lack is an ecosystem that allows them to grow from workers into entrepreneurs, from pragmatic earners into sustainable innovators.

If regulators can become facilitators, if airports can serve as laboratories, if investors can show trust, then Indonesia’s skies will not only connect islands. They will also showcase the creativity and ingenuity of our own people.

When that happens, we can finally say: the skies above Indonesia are not just airways—they are spaces of innovation, pride, and sustainable prosperity.

The sky above Indonesia is not just a passageway for planes. It can be a laboratory of innovation, a marketplace of ideas, and a symbol of national pride. But only if we dare to move from consumers to producers, from workers to entrepreneurs, from pragmatism to sustainability.

Neste’s current production capability is about 100,000 tons of SAF per year, worldwide. By the end of 2023, the company intends to increase that capacity to around 1.5 million tons of SAF annually. Other producers are ramping to begin or increase their production, with the potential for more than 1 billion gallons of SAF produced annually globally by 2025, according to the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative. Other methods of achieving carbon neutrality, such as carbon offsetting, building more efficient infrastructure, and development of more efficient aircraft, including electric aircraft, will certainly contribute to aviation’s decrease in emissions and overall mission of sustainability, but experts agree SAF is the key. If SAF is such a critical component to decreasing emissions and to carbon neutrality in the aviation sector, why aren’t aircraft operators using more of it? Two variables impact SAF use, and they’re the usual chicken-and-egg market scenario. SAF suppliers are hesitant to ramp up production and supply until they know there is industry demand to purchase SAF. Some potential SAF purchasers are hesitant to purchase SAF at the current prices. More demand will result in more supply, which will inevitably lower the price, leading to more demand. Building effective infrastructure for SAF production and delivery and creating sustainability-friendly policy will be vital as supply and demand increase. “SAF is widely considered to hold the greatest near-term potential for reducing aviation’s climate impact, as it can reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional (petroleum-based) jet fuel, with even greater reductions possible in the future,” aviation groups said while advocating for incentivizing the use of SAF through public policy. The good news is – the overview above is nowhere near a complete accounting for the industry’s progress toward widespread SAF usage in the last year. And as Vettel demonstrated in Bahrain, SAF is available for those who demand it.

About London Heathrow Airport Originally opened in 1946 as London Airport, London Heathrow Airport has evolved from a small airfield into the world-class facility it is today, comprising five terminals.","London Heathrow Airport (LHR) is by far the busiest airport in the UK, processing more than 83 million passengers in 2024. The facility is the world's best-connected international airport, offering direct links to over 200 destinations worldwide.

However, not content with its current accolades, and in order to ensure it continues to offer the best possible passenger experience and to support the significant operational challenges often faced by many airports, London Heathrow Airport is embarking on a massive £2.3 billion ($3.1 billion) upgrade plan over the next two years, which will be privately funded.

In this article, we will examine the plans and their implications for the airport's airline operators and the millions of passengers they serve. We will also consider London Heathrow Airport's place in the wider aviation industry.

Greater Accessibility & Improved Operational Resilience

Before embarking on its recently announced £2.3 billion upgrade plan, London Heathrow Airport consulted closely with airline partners and more than two million passengers to better understand their challenges and needs. As a result, one of the key objectives of the airport's plan is to enhance accessibility, enabling all passengers to navigate the airport with dignity and independence. Although the specifics are yet to be revealed, it will do this through the Independent Journeys Project, which is designed to empower passengers who need extra assistance and offer more autonomous travel options throughout the airport.

Another major aim of the plan is to improve operational resilience and punctuality. To achieve this, some of the privately funded investment will be put towards changing the airfield layout and increasing the number of aircraft stands. Significant investment will also be made in the airport's baggage delivery systems, helping to ensure baggage is delivered to the right place in a quicker timeframe.

Sustainability Is Key

Sustainability is now one of the key areas of focus for all industries around the world, and even more so in aviation. It is therefore unsurprising that developing sustainable initiatives features heavily in London Heathrow Airport's £2.3 billion upgrade plan.

This will include the addition of more walking and cycling routes between terminals through Active Travel initiatives, investment in electric vehicle infrastructure, energy-efficient buildings, and innovative waste-reduction solutions, demonstrating the airport's commitment to sustainable transport solutions. This will also involve the use of the latest technologies to align the operation with London Heathrow Airport's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions.

The CEO of London Heathrow Airport, Thomas Woldbye, reiterated that the improvement and expansion of the airport's infrastructure can go hand in hand with greater sustainability.

“With strict environmental safeguards, expanding Heathrow will prove that the UK economy can be grown responsibly and deliver on commitments to future generations. This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon that the Government sets out in the Airports National Policy Statement – it’s as simple as that. Even though we’re serving more passengers than ever before, our noise footprint is smaller and we’re also using more sustainable aviation fuel than ever before. I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.”

Significant Investment Has Already Been Made

In addition to the £2.3 billion upgrade plan that London Heathrow Airport is about to embark on, the facility has already made around £1.1 billion ($1.49 billion) of improvements in 2024, involving more than 1,100 supply chain partners from across the UK and beyond.

This includes a £191 million ($258 million) upgrade to the airport's security facilities, which has already started to prove fruitful, with improvements in both passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency. This is no mean feat, given that the airport boasts more than 140 individual security lanes across its four operational terminals. The airport aims to have at least 95% of passengers passing through security in under five minutes.

London Heathrow Airport is also in the process of installing advanced CT scanners, which will initially mean that passengers are no longer required to remove liquids or electronic devices from their bags, with the longer-term goal of being able to remove the 100ml liquid restriction altogether. The airport had initially hoped to finish this work in 2024, but the completion date has since been pushed back to 2025.

The World's Best-Connected International Airport

According to data from OAG, London Heathrow Airport was ranked the world's best-connected international airport in 2024, thanks to its direct links to over 200 destinations worldwide. The airport managed to retain its number one position in 2023. The world's second-best connected international airport last year was Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL), followed by Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND) in third place. The busiest international routes from Kuala Lumpur International Airport last year were:

Meanwhile, the best-connected airport on an international level in the US is still John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), although the facility fell from second place in 2023 to sixth place in 2024. New York-JFK currently serves more than 190 destinations in over 80 countries, with flights operated by around 70 different airlines from across the world. This includes more than 35 destinations in Europe and 12 in South America.

London Heathrow Airport's Role In The UK's Economy

London Heathrow Airport plays a major role in the UK's economy, connecting the country with businesses and tourists from across the world. The benefits will also be felt more locally too, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) surrounding the airport benefiting from increased opportunities for trade. London Heathrow Airport's upgrade plan will undoubtedly help to cement the UK's position as a leading global destination for international business and tourism.

If and when a third runway is eventually built at London Heathrow Airport, economic benefits will likely be felt throughout the whole country, with studies estimating a 0.43% increase in GDP by 2050 thanks to the proposed expansion. The UK's Chancellor approved the third runway program earlier this year.

“This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year. Heathrow is proud to answer the Chancellor's call to get Britain building,"" Woldbye said. ""A third runway is critical for the country’s future economic success, and I confirm we will submit our plans for a third runway to Government this summer. Ahead of then, as part of a phased expansion programme and supported by the Government’s clear backing, I am today confirming multi-billion-pound investment plans, 100% privately funded, to upgrade our terminal buildings, enhance passenger experience, and improve resilience and sustainability. This is vital investment and will ensure Heathrow remains globally competitive and a jewel in the country’s crown – the UK’s Gateway to Growth”.

About London Heathrow Airport

Originally opened in 1946 as London Airport, London Heathrow Airport has evolved from a small airfield into the world-class facility it is today, comprising five terminals. However, only four are currently operational, as Terminal 1 has been closed since 2015. Terminals 2 and 5 are the most modern, having opened in 2008 and 2014, respectively. The latter is home to the airport's largest airline operator, British Airways.

Terminal 2 was designed to be efficient, modern, and passenger-focused, replacing the original 1955 structure with a far more sustainable and spacious terminal. The building features a visually striking, wave-like roof, flooding the terminal with natural light. Linear passenger journeys also help to reduce walking distances. Today, Terminal 2 is home to most Star Alliance carriers, including United Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Air Canada.

London Heathrow Airport is served by more than 80 airlines. Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have hubs at the airport, but many other carriers from around the world fly into the airport from their respective hubs, including Qantas, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, LATAM Airlines, China Airlines, and Air India. The busiest destinations from the airport in 2024 are outlined in the table below:

As further improvements are made to London Heathrow Airport's operational resilience and passenger experience, it is only likely that the facility will be able to handle more flights, more passengers, and more connections in the future.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2179773861-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-07 04:56:14.340752

China has dramatically increased its investment footprint in Brazil's energy landscape, establishing itself as a dominant foreign investor in South America's largest economy. In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $4.18 billion across 39 projects, with the China investment in Brazil energy sector capturing the largest share of this capital influx. This strategic focus reflects China's dual approach to securing both traditional and renewable resources while expanding its global economic influence.

The power sector, particularly solar and wind projects, received 34% ($1.43 billion) of total Chinese investments in Brazil during 2024, while oil and gas attracted 25% ($1 billion). This balanced approach demonstrates China's pragmatic energy transition trends that simultaneously advances renewable capacity while maintaining access to fossil fuel resources.

What Drives China's Interest in Brazilian Energy Resources?

Strategic Resource Security

China's investment strategy in Brazil is fundamentally driven by resource security concerns. As the world's largest energy consumer, China seeks to diversify its supply sources and reduce vulnerability to market volatility and geopolitical tensions. Brazil offers an attractive combination of established oil production, renewable energy potential, and critical minerals necessary for energy transition technologies.

The investments serve multiple strategic objectives:

Securing long-term access to Brazil's offshore oil reserves

Establishing positions in renewable energy development

Accessing critical minerals like lithium, niobium, and rare earths

Building influence in a major regional economy with significant natural resources

Complementary Energy Policies

Both China and Brazil pursue parallel energy strategies that combine aggressive renewable energy expansion with continued fossil fuel development. Brazil maintains approximately 90% renewable electricity generation (primarily hydropower) while simultaneously expanding its oil production capacity. Similarly, China leads globally in renewable energy deployment while continuing to develop coal, oil, and gas resources.

This policy alignment creates natural investment synergies, allowing Chinese firms to pursue diverse energy projects that match their domestic expertise and strategic priorities. According to a recent analysis by Alvarez & Marsal, this complementary approach has positioned Brazil as China's third-largest investment destination globally.

Which Sectors Receive the Most Chinese Investment?

Renewable Energy Dominance

Since 2007, Chinese companies have invested $77.5 billion across 303 projects in Brazil, with the power sector claiming the largest share at 45% of total investments. Major Chinese energy corporations have established significant positions in Brazil's renewable energy landscape:

China Three Gorges (CTG): Acquired multiple hydroelectric assets and developed solar projects

State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC): Invested in wind and solar facilities

CGN Power: Developed utility-scale solar installations and transmission infrastructure

The Luiz Gonzaga Solar Complex represents one flagship project with substantial Chinese investment, highlighting the scale of renewable energy commitments and battery recycling innovation efforts.

Oil and Gas Strategic Positioning

The oil industry ranks as the second-largest recipient of Chinese investment at 29% of the cumulative total since 2007. Chinese national oil companies have secured stakes in Brazil's prolific pre-salt offshore oil basin, which has driven most of Brazil's production growth in recent years.

These investments provide China with:

Direct access to Brazilian crude oil exports

Participation in production sharing agreements

Technology transfer opportunities in deep-water exploration

Diversification away from Middle Eastern oil dependencies

Critical Minerals and Manufacturing

Beyond direct energy investments, Chinese firms have strategically targeted Brazil's mining sector, focusing on materials essential for the energy transition supply chain. For example, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) acquired Brazilian firm Mineração Taboca, the country's largest refined tin producer, for $340 million in late 2024.

This acquisition secured access to:

Tin (used in solar panel manufacturing)

Niobium (critical for high-strength steel and superconductors)

Tantalum (essential for electronics and energy storage)

Manufacturing investments have also followed, representing 8% of total Chinese investment since 2007, often supporting energy-related supply chains.

What Are the Recent Investment Trends?

Strategic Adaptation

As global energy markets evolve, Chinese investments will likely adapt to changing priorities while maintaining core strategic objectives. This may include greater emphasis on technologies supporting electrification, digitalization, and decarbonization while maintaining positions in conventional energy resources.

The investment relationship will continue balancing:

Short-term resource security needs

Long-term energy transition goals

Technological leadership ambitions

Economic and political influence objectives

Conclusion

China's multibillion-dollar investments in Brazil's energy sector represent a sophisticated strategy that secures access to both traditional and renewable resources while expanding economic influence in Latin America's largest economy. The complementary energy policies of both nations create natural investment synergies, despite apparent contradictions between fossil fuel development and renewable energy expansion.

As Brazil positions itself to host the COP30 climate summit while simultaneously pursuing oil production growth, Chinese investment provides crucial capital and technology to advance both conventional and renewable energy development. This partnership will continue shaping global China investment in Brazil energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitical relationships in the coming decades.

The dual focus on securing traditional energy resources while investing heavily in renewables reflects a pragmatic approach to energy transition—one that acknowledges the continuing importance of fossil fuels while building the infrastructure for a lower-carbon future. As this investment relationship evolves, it will significantly influence both countries' energy landscapes and their positions in the global energy order.

Menurut data Traction Energy Asia, Indonesia menghasilkan sekitar 933.200 kilo liter minyak jelantah setiap tahun. Tanpa pengelolaan, limbah ini bisa mencemari lingkungan, namun jika diolah, dapat menjadi sumber energi berkelanjutan.

Pertamina melalui inovasinya berhasil mengolah minyak jelantah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), bahan bakar ramah lingkungan yang mampu menurunkan emisi karbon hingga lebih dari 80% dibanding avtur biasa. Pada Agustus lalu, Pertamina resmi memproduksi SAF pertama di Indonesia sekaligus Asia Tenggara melalui Kilang Cilacap. Produk PertaminaSAF ini bahkan telah meraih sertifikasi internasional ISCC dan RSB sebagai jaminan standar keberlanjutan global.

Komperta Plaju Jadi Pionir Pengumpulan Jelantah di Sumatera

Produk PertaminaSAF bukan hanya hasil inovasi teknologi, tetapi juga strategi penting untuk mendukung ketahanan energi, menjaga lingkungan, sekaligus memberdayakan masyarakat. Pertamina menekankan bahwa keterlibatan publik adalah kunci terbentuknya ekosistem SAF yang berkelanjutan. Melalui inisiatif ini, limbah minyak jelantah (UCO) tidak hanya berkurang, tetapi juga memberi manfaat ekonomi. Salah satu jalur partisipasi yang dihadirkan adalah UCOllect Box.

Bekerja sama dengan Noovoleum, Pertamina menempatkan UCOllect Box di berbagai titik Indonesia sebagai sarana masyarakat menyetorkan minyak jelantah agar bisa diolah kembali menjadi energi ramah lingkungan. Di Sumatera, fasilitas ini pertama kali hadir di Komperta Kilang Plaju dan Komperta Sungai Gerong, Palembang, tepatnya di toko swalayan Coopmart, Jalan Antara No. 292, Plaju. Lokasi ini dipilih karena dinilai memiliki potensi besar dalam mendukung pengumpulan minyak jelantah.

Sejak beroperasi pada Februari 2025, antusiasme warga Palembang terus meningkat. Data Kilang Plaju mencatat, rata-rata 175 liter minyak jelantah berhasil dikumpulkan setiap bulan sepanjang Februari–Agustus 2025. Sumbernya beragam, mulai dari dapur Koperasi Wanita Petra (KWP), rumah tangga pekerja, hingga masyarakat umum di sekitar Plaju. Fakta ini memperlihatkan tumbuhnya kesadaran kolektif warga untuk mengelola limbah secara lebih bertanggung jawab, dengan semakin banyak keluarga memilih menyalurkan minyak bekas gorengan ke UCOllect Box ketimbang membuangnya sembarangan.

Area Manager Communication, Relations & CSR Kilang Plaju, Siti Rachmi Indahsari, menegaskan bahwa program ini merupakan langkah strategis perusahaan untuk menghubungkan dapur masyarakat dengan agenda besar transisi energi.

“Pengelolaan limbah tidak hanya tentang membuang, tetapi bagaimana kita bisa memanfaatkannya kembali agar memiliki nilai ekonomi sekaligus mendukung energi hijau. Pertamina mengajak masyarakat untuk berpartisipasi dalam ekosistem energi bersih yang berkelanjutan, dengan mengumpulkan setiap tetes jelantah di dapur untuk menjadi produk SAF,” imbuhnya.

Terbuka Untuk Umum

Fasilitas UCOllect Box di Palembang terbuka untuk seluruh masyarakat, memungkinkan siapa pun menyetorkan minyak jelantah mereka. Dengan begitu, manfaatnya tidak hanya dirasakan warga Komperta, tetapi juga menjadi sarana partisipasi kolektif masyarakat luas dalam mendukung energi bersih.

Kehadiran UCOllect membuktikan bahwa transformasi energi hijau bisa dimulai dari langkah sederhana. Satu liter minyak jelantah yang sebelumnya berpotensi mencemari jutaan liter air, kini bernilai Rp5.500 jika ditukarkan, sekaligus menjadi bagian rantai pasok bahan baku Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Dari dapur rumah tangga hingga tangki pesawat, setiap tetes jelantah berkontribusi menghadirkan energi ramah lingkungan.

Dengan capaian ini, Kilang Plaju tidak hanya berperan sebagai pengolah migas dan petrokimia, tetapi juga motor penggerak energi berkelanjutan. Program ini memperlihatkan bagaimana minyak jelantah yang terkumpul dapat mendorong Indonesia menuju era penerbangan rendah emisi sekaligus menjaga bumi untuk generasi mendatang.

Inisiatif ini juga sejalan dengan komitmen Pertamina dalam menerapkan prinsip Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) serta mendukung pencapaian Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs).",https://images.bloombergtechnoz.com/data/2025/09/image-20250906175452.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 23:56:15.315600

There is a growing need to expand Sarawak’s aerospace capacity, following a strong rebound in Sarawak’s air traffic.

According to Transport Minister Datuk Seri Lee Kim Shin during the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly (DUN) Sitting in May this year, the state recorded 30,980 aircraft movements and 2.5 million passengers in the first quarter of 2025 (1Q25).

This marks an eight per cent increase compared to the same period last year.

He added that air cargo movements also surged by 23.3 per cent to 14,438 tonnes, driven by rising demand for electronics, oil and gas equipment, e-commerce goods, perishables and general cargo.

“Internationally, Sarawak currently sees 37 international flights per week, while domestic routes from other Malaysian states contribute an average of 427 weekly flights,” he said.

“Kuching International Airport remains the busiest hub with 216 weekly flights, followed by Miri (99), Sibu (55), and Bintulu (45).”

Sarawak’s very own airline, AirBorneo, is on track to officially take to the skies by early 2026, following the full acquisition of MASwings Sdn Bhd from Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG).

During the Sarawak DUN Sitting in May, Lee noted that the Share Purchase Agreement between the Sarawak Government and MAG was signed on February 12 this year, with the legal and beneficial ownership of MASwings expected to be transferred to AirBorneo Holdings Sdn Bhd by Dec 31, 2025.

“All stakeholders are actively working to fulfil the necessary regulatory, operational and legal requirements during this transition period to ensure a seamless handover.

“AirBorneo will also focus on enhancing regional and international air connectivity, while continuing to serve rural areas under the Rural Air Services (RAS),” he added in his ministerial winding-up speech at the May DUN Sitting.

He said to ensure service continuity, all MASwings staff will be retained post-acquisition, leveraging their experience to maintain reliability.

He also assured that the schedule, frequency and routes under the RAS network will remain unchanged during and after the transition.

Progress is being made for the state-owned airline. Last week, the Sarawak government officially launched its airline logo named ‘Wings of Unity’ at Satria Pertiwi Complex officiated by Sarawak Premier, Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Abdul Rahman Zohari Tun Datuk Abang Openg.

The Premier described this move as a symbol of confidence in Sarawak’s position in the global landscape, as well as emphasising AirBorneo’s role in supporting the Post-Covid-19 Development Strategy (PCDS 2030) through improved Asean air connectivity, job opportunities, improved infrastructure and support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The new airline’s brand identity also features elements of Sarawak’s heritage colours and motifs, symbolising the diversity and unity of the Borneo community.

AirBorneo is expected to commence operations in January 2026, taking over and expanding MASwings’ services, including full routes and rural to inland air services.

New airline progressing well, but deadline looms

Nevertheless, starting an airline is one of the most complex and capital-intensive ventures in the business world, involving a daunting number of legal, financial, and operational hurdles.

According to an industry observer, the airline industry is highly regulated and competitive, requiring significant investment and expertise.

“Airlines are extremely capital-intensive. Beyond the cost of acquiring or leasing aircraft — which is often staggering — a new airline must secure funding for a wide array of other expenses, including aircraft acquisition, operational costs and labour,” the specialist commented to BizHive.

This includes hiring and training pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, and administrative staff is a massive undertaking. Pilots, in particular, require extensive and expensive training and certification.

“A new airline must also navigate a labyrinth of regulations in Malaysia to get off the ground. The most critical step is obtaining an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) from the national civil aviation authority. This process is rigorous and can take years.

“It requires a new airline to prove its competency in several key areas such as operational safety (the airline must demonstrate it has the procedures, manuals, and staff to ensure safe flight operations) and maintenance.”

The industry observer noted that the acquisition of an existing carrier like MASwings by AirBorneo simplifies some of this processes, as MASwings already holds an AOC. However, the transition still requires regulatory approval for changes in ownership, management, and operational scope.

“The process of obtaining additional route licenses and international approvals for new destinations also adds to the complexity.”

A successful airline also relies on a complex network of interconnected systems and services for fleet management, route planning and IT systems for the implementation and integration of essential systems for reservations, ticketing, crew scheduling, and maintenance tracking.

For AirBorneo, the transition from MASwings presents its own unique set of challenges from the perspective of a business model shift.

“MASwings primarily operated as a subsidised rural air service (RAS), focusing on domestic routes in East Malaysia with a fleet of turboprop aircraft like the ATR72-500s,” the observer noted.

“AirBorneo, however, aims to become a full-service carrier (FSC) with a hub-and-spoke model, expanding to regional and international routes.

“This requires a fundamental shift in strategy, fleet, and services, including new aircraft and service level upgrades.”

All eyes are locked in on the December 31, 2025 deadline for the transfer of the legal and beneficial ownership of MASwings to AirBorneo Holdings Sdn Bhd.

Global aero giants boost presence in Sarawak

Catching the attention of the world’s leading aviation giants, Airbus and Boeing, is testament to Sarawak’s rapid aerospace potential.

Airbus and Boeing are the two largest aerospace manufacturers in the world, and their histories reflect different paths to market dominance.

Boeing’s story is one of a pioneering American company that grew into a global powerhouse. The company’s position was solidified with the launch of the 707 in 1958, which ushered in the era of commercial jets.

This was followed by the highly successful 747 ‘jumbo jet’ in 1970, which revolutionised long-haul air travel and made mass air transportation a reality.

Over the decades, Boeing expanded its portfolio to include a family of popular aircraft like the 737 and 777, military planes, and space vehicles, becoming the undisputed leader in the aerospace industry for much of the 20th century.

In the late 1960s, American manufacturers like Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed dominated the global aviation market. To compete, several European nations, including France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, formed a consortium called Airbus Industrie GIE in 1970.

Their first aircraft, the A300, was the world’s first twin-engine wide-body jet. While initially slow to gain sales, its success was a major step towards establishing a European presence in the market.

Airbus’s big breakthrough came with the A320 in 1987, which introduced new technologies like “fly-by-wire” flight controls, which were a game-changer for the industry. This marked the beginning of intense competition between the two companies.

Airbus’s strategy focused on a family of aircraft with a common cockpit design to reduce training costs for airlines. The company later challenged Boeing’s dominance in the super-jumbo market with the A380, the world’s largest passenger airliner, in 2007.

Today, both Airbus and Boeing define the aerospace industry, with both companies constantly innovating and competing for market share.

Sarawak is tapping into their global expertise via strategic partnerships focused on talent development, technological innovation, and sustainable aviation, are set to transform the state into a regional hub for high-technology industries.

With both Airbus and Boeing now actively involved in developing the state’s aerospace sector, Sarawak is well on its way to achieving its goal of becoming a key player in the global aviation landscape.

Sarawak partners Airbus to develop aerospace industry

Back in early May, the Sarawak government announced a strategic collaboration with Airbus in developing the state’s aerospace industry.

During an official visit to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, Abang Johari stated that the official visit has opened the door to six key areas agreed upon for joint exploration, with the goal of establishing Sarawak as a new aerospace hub in the Asia-Pacific region.

According to a Sarawak Public Communications Unit (Ukas) report, the Sarawak Premier said one of the identified areas is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Sarawak actively conducting research to produce SAF in line with the global goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“The second area is the development of human capital in the aerospace industry, with collaboration between Airbus and local institutions such as i-CATS to be expanded in order to develop training programmes and aerospace-related syllabi.

“This initiative will open up opportunities for Sarawakian students to undergo industrial training at an international standard,” he said at a press conference following the working visit to the Airbus Campus and the ATR headquarters in May.

The third area of agreement, he added, involves the development of a supporting industry ecosystem.

Sarawak will also explore the potential for manufacturing composite materials and gas-based synthetic leather for use in the aviation industry, in addition to avionics technology and instrumentation related to AI-powered smart chips.

“The fourth area involves the digitalisation of travel and aviation services, with the introduction of a ‘digital journey’ concept.

“This is aimed at integrating the entire travel process—from flight ticket booking and the use of the Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART) transportation system to accommodation—into one seamless digital package,” he further explained.

The fifth agreed area is the establishment of a Sarawak–Airbus Joint Task Force to formulate a roadmap for the development of Sarawak’s aerospace industry, involving expertise from both parties.

“A team will be formed on our side, while Airbus will also form their own team. This move aims to create a synergy of expertise in the industry through comprehensive collaboration and discussions between the specialists involved.

“This effort is expected to act as a catalyst for the growth of the aviation industry, while also opening new opportunities for the sector to advance on an international level,” he explained.

The sixth area involves the development of an Aerotropolis as part of efforts to strengthen the aviation industry in the state.

“The state government plans to develop a 100-acre area as the site for the Aerotropolis—an integrated hub where all buildings are interconnected, making it more efficient and supportive of the aviation industry ecosystem,” he added.

Boeing to boost aerospace education in Sarawak

Meanwhile, earlier this week, American multinational corporation Boeing signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sarawak’s i-CATS University College to advance aerospace education and talent development in Sarawak.

The partnership supports Sarawak’s ambition to position itself as a regional hub for aerospace and high-technology industries, building on i-CATS’ recent launch of its Aerospace Engineering programme.

Under the MoU, Boeing and i-CATS will explore opportunities to engage Boeing experts in workshops, speaker sessions, and competitions organised by the i-CATS Aerospace Students’ Club.

The partnership will also support the development and delivery of coursework and executive education certificates in sustainable aviation, supply chain, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO); as well as foster partnerships with industrial companies and international institutions for undergraduate and master’s students.

Boeing Southeast Asia president, Penny Burtt, said the company is committed to supporting Sarawak’s vision of building a strong and sustainable aerospace ecosystem.

“Equipping i-CATS students with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) resources and opportunities is exactly what is needed to help inspire and grow Malaysia’s aviation workforce of the future.”

i-CATS vice chancellor Prof Emeritus Datuk Dr Mohamad Kadim Suaidi said the collaboration reflects the university’s commitment to nurturing a new generation of aerospace professionals.

“Together, we are laying the foundation for Sarawak to emerge as a competitive hub for aerospace education and research in the region,” he added.

AirAsia firms up Malaysia-Indonesia ties with new routes

Local private airlines are not missing out on the action in Sarawak, as low cost carrier AirAsia Bhd (AirAsia) recently strengthened its position as airline with largest network between Malaysia and Indonesia.

In July, it launched two new direct routes connecting Kuala Lumpur and Kuching to Pontianak, the capital city of West Kalimantan, Indonesia with AirAsia as the only airline operating international flights to the city starting 12 September 2025.

This expansion follows AirAsia’s rapid growth in Indonesia including the recent launch of the Kuala Lumpur-Palembang route in July and the upcoming Kuala Lumpur-Semarang in September.

On Friday (September 5), AirAsia Malaysia officially commenced its Kuala Lumpur–Semarang service which connects Malaysia with Central Java’s capital city.

With the return of international flights to Jenderal Ahmad Yani Airport, travellers now have greater access to Central Java’s cultural landmarks, business hubs, and emerging economic zones.

The launch of these new routes strengthens regional connectivity and supports both government targets, including Malaysia’s goal to attract 4.3 million Indonesian tourists in 2025 and Sarawak’s target of five million visitor arrivals by year-end.

It also aims to contribute to Indonesia’s national target of 16 million international arrivals with Malaysia remaining one of its top source markets.

In an interview with BizHive, AirAsia Malaysia chief executive officer Datuk Fareh Mazputra explained that AirAsia fully supports Sarawak’s vision under the PCDS 2030 framework, and it remains committed to play a catalytic role in elevating Kuching’s status as a key regional aviation hub.

“We are working closely with tourism and aviation authorities to position Kuching as a viable connecting hub for traffic between the Asean region,” he said in the interview.

“This includes optimising our network to improve flight timings, facilitating seamless transfers and promoting multi-destination travel itineraries.

“Operationally, AirAsia is currently the only national airline with a hub in Kuching, with a total of seven Airbus A320 aircraft stationed at the Kuching International Airport and serving a total of over 400 weekly flights within, into and from Sarawak, including our new Pontianak route in September.

“Our operation in Sarawak is backed by over 750 Allstars including at least 80 per cent Sarawakians who serve as pilots, cabin crew, aircraft engineers, sales, operation and administrative personnel.”

Fareh noted that AirAsia continuously enhances its digital platforms to enable easier bookings for connecting traffic via Kuching, as part of a broader effort to grow transit traffic and make Kuching more attractive to international carriers and partners.

“Our strategy includes leveraging Kuching not just as a terminus, but as a connecting hub for traffic between ASEAN markets,” he said, adding that the airline invests in digital and operational infrastructure to enhance transit experiences.

“AirAsia has already begun restoring and expanding our domestic and international network into Sarawak with Kuching as the primary gateway, including the recent announcement of our flights between Kuching and Pontianak in West Kalimantan, Indonesia that is set to take off in September.”

While the increased frequency to Kuching, Miri, and Sibu is vital, Fareh says AirAsia is keeping its eye to enhance “last-mile” connectivity to smaller, economically crucial towns like Bintulu, Mukah, and Kapit.

“Yes, we fully recognise that true connectivity extends beyond major cities, it’s about ensuring accessibility for all regions.

“Bintulu is already served with direct flights to Kuching, Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu, and we are currently reviewing potential frequency enhancements in line with demand trends.

“For other towns with smaller airports and airfields, these are currently being served by another operator under the Government’s Rural Air Service programme.”

Keeping towards low cost strategy

Fareh underscored AirAsia’s focus on affordability and accessibility being integral to AirAsia’s mission.

“We remain firmly committed to providing low fares for all, especially for Sarawakians who rely on air travel for family, business, leisure and educational purposes,” he said.

“Our dynamic pricing model allows us to allocate a significant number of seats at low fares, especially when booked in advance, and offers exclusive discounts and promotional deals to ensure that essential travel remains affordable.

“In the long term, we will continue to work with the authorities to explore fare incentives, subsidy frameworks, and travel passes that benefit Sarawakians, especially students, business travelers, and families.

“Additionally, by continuously improving efficiency and leveraging technology, we aim to keep operating costs low, enabling us to pass savings back to our guests in the form of competitive fares.”

Meanwhile, on AirAsia’s stategy towards new market, Fareh said they were always actively studying several high-potential international markets with strong tourism, business, education and diaspora links to Sarawak and this will of course be subject to market assessments in order to evaluate demand, partnerships, and operational feasibility.

He said they work very closely with key tourism stakeholders such as the Sarawak Tourism Board, Tourism Malaysia, Ministry of Tourism, Creative Industry and Performing Arts Sarawak, Ministry of Transport Sarawak and the Sarawak Economic Planning Unit to identify potential new routes, realising these routes will depend on the availability of aircraft, regulatory approvals and alignment with tourism and trade promotion efforts.

“We would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to the people of Sarawak for their continued trust and support, which has made us winner of the Skytrax award for the World’s Best Low Cost Airline 16 years in a row.

“AirAsia is proud to be a long-standing partner in Sarawak’s journey towards sustainable growth, regional prominence, and improved quality of life.

“As we expand our footprint and strengthen connectivity, our commitment remains unchanged—to provide safe, affordable, and reliable air travel for all Sarawakians.

“We look forward to working even more closely with state and community stakeholders to build a future where Sarawak is not just a destination, but a thriving aviation and economic hub for all of Asean and beyond.”

Batik Air links Kuching-Subang for better East-West air travel

The successful launch of Batik Air’s direct flight between Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang and Kuching International Airport (towards the end of July marked a major milestone in enhancing regional connectivity for Sarawak.

Speaking at a press conference after the touchdown of flight OD1612 on July 28, Sarawak Transport Minister Dato Sri Lee Kim Shin reiterated his call for Batik Air to expand its services to Sarawak and to help promote the state, including by launching its first international route from here.

“For example, it can fly to China or even to Korea, but that depends on the passenger load. But certainly, they can have a flight to China. For example, to Shenzhen or to Guangzhou or even other cities in China.

“We hope Batik Air will help us and support us with our requests because then, Batik Air would be the first airline to have direct international flights,” he said.

“At present, all flights are from either Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) or KLIA 2.

“Some passengers may prefer to fly from Subang because it is more convenient for them. From Subang, it normally takes about 30 to 45 minutes to get to the airport, depending on traffic conditions,” said Lee.

He said Batik Air now covers all four airports in Sarawak, adding that there is also a daily flight from KLIA operated by Batik Air to Miri, as well as daily flights to both Sibu and Bintulu.

“With these services, Batik Air has opened up new routes to Sarawak,” he said.

The launch underscored Batik Air’s commitment to enhancing direct point-to-point connections in response to increasing demand for greater convenience, speed, and accessibility.",https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2025/09/COVER-p1.png,N,,2025-09-06 21:56:10.737188

The Indian rupee fell 21 paise from its close of 88.15 on Thursday to a new all-time low of ₹88.36 versus the US dollar. Despite the government’s aggressive GST reforms, which were intended to boost domestic demand and consumption, this fall nonetheless happened. Although it was anticipated that the reforms would increase market activity, global uncertainties—such as concerns about inflation, rising US interest rates, and geopolitical tensions—remain dominant. The rupee and other emerging market currencies are under tremendous pressure as analysts note that global risk aversion and foreign money outflows are increasingly outweighing local policy initiatives. For now, the road to stability seems difficult.

Starlink Moves Closer to Launch in India

Elon Musk’s Starlink, the satellite internet venture, has crossed a major hurdle by receiving provisional spectrum clearance from India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT). This green signal allows Starlink to begin trial satellite broadband services in one of the world’s largest digital markets. With this permission, the company will proceed to build ground infrastructure, deploy base stations, and conduct critical security compliance tests. Industry experts believe that Starlink’s entry could be a game-changer for rural India, offering high-speed internet where terrestrial broadband remains inaccessible. The trial phase is expected to pave the way for a large-scale commercial launch in the near future.

Swiggy Raises Platform Fee Amid Festive Rush

Swiggy, India’s leading food delivery platform, has raised its platform fee to ₹15 per order, marking the steepest hike in its history. This is the third increase in just three weeks, as the company seeks to capitalize on the festive season surge and improve profitability. Earlier, Swiggy had briefly tested a ₹14 fee during Independence Day celebrations before reverting to ₹12. Now, with growing operational costs and competition in the delivery space, the ₹15 fee reflects a strategic push to enhance margins. Industry insiders see this as a clear sign that Swiggy is shifting focus from pure growth to sustainable financial health.

Instant House Helpers: The New Gig Economy Trend

India’s gig economy has welcomed a surprising new service—instant house helper apps—that promise domestic help at your doorstep within just 15 minutes.

For corn, rising domestic shortfalls have made Japan more reliant on US supplies, particularly for both food and feed use.
It added that the Japanese government is also working to accept US-manufactured and US-safety-certified passenger vehicles for sale in Japan without additional testing.
""These investments -- which will be selected by the United States government -- will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations,"" the executive order added.
""For automobiles and automobile parts, the tariff will be reduced from 25% to 15%, including existing tariffs,"" Ishiba said.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order reducing an additional 25% tariff on automobiles and other goods to 15% under the US-Japan agreement, White House officials said, paving the way to implement Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge across US energy, infrastructure and industrial sectors.

The move, which came Sept. 4, follows a July 22 framework agreement between the US and Japan, which lays the foundation for cutting the US' ""reciprocal tariffs"" on Japan from 25% to 15%.

Under the agreement, the US will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the US, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the US, according to the executive order.

The new tariff framework, combined with expanded US exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall US trade position, the executive order said.

Japan will also provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors, it said.

Specifically, the Japanese government is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase in US rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of US agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel) and other US products, totaling $8 billion annually.

In biofuels, Japan is exploring additional imports of ethanol -- including for sustainable aviation fuel via ETBE -- but since ETBE and ethanol for ETBE production already face a zero tariff, any future increase would primarily depend on Tokyo's decisions around higher domestic blending mandates and potential adjustments to required carbon intensity thresholds.

The July 22 framework also outlined expanded access for US beef and pork into the Japanese market, with Tokyo agreeing to work toward reducing tariff-rate quota barriers that have limited imports in recent years. For corn, rising domestic shortfalls have made Japan more reliant on US supplies, particularly for both food and feed use. The agreement also highlighted Japanese interest in scaling imports of US-origin bioethanol, provided that new blending or sustainability rules create additional demand.

It added that the Japanese government is also working to accept US-manufactured and US-safety-certified passenger vehicles for sale in Japan without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase US-made commercial aircraft and US defense equipment.

Tokyo has agreed to invest $550 billion in US sectors, including energy infrastructure and production, LNG, advanced fuels, grid modernization, critical minerals mining, processing and refining, and commercial and defense shipbuilding, including new yards and modernization of existing facilities. It will also target pharmaceutical, medical production and semiconductors.

""These investments -- which will be selected by the United States government -- will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations,"" the executive order added.

""Regarding reciprocal tariffs, it has been decided that, retroactively from Aug. 7, items with existing tariff rates of 15% or more will not be subject to additional tariffs, while items with rates below 15% will be charged a tariff of 15%, including the existing rates,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters in Tokyo Sept. 4.

""For automobiles and automobile parts, the tariff will be reduced from 25% to 15%, including existing tariffs,"" Ishiba said. ""Additionally, for semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, even if sector-specific tariffs are imposed in the future, our country will not be at a disadvantage compared to the EU, and no tariffs will be imposed on aircraft and aircraft parts.""

The US' 25% tariff on automobiles separately took effect April 3.

The US was Japan's largest export market in 2024, with exports valued at Yen 21.295 trillion ($145.19 billion), according to data from the Ministry of Finance.

Brian J West, executive vice president for finance and chief financial officer at Boeing, commented on the progress of 777X certification, according to ch-aviation.
According to Leeham News and Analysis, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said he was ""hopeful"" that certification testing will commence by year's end.
“I’m hopeful that we’ll get through the certification flight tests by the end of the year.
It’s an airplane that has had the most flight testing done of any other aircraft we’ve ever done in terms of hours.","Once it enters service, the Boeing 777X promises airlines a powerful set of tools for growing destination networks through a powerful blend of performance, efficiency, and passenger comfort. The jet will seat roughly four hundred passengers in a standard two-class layout, to beat out both 777-300ER or A350-1000 average seat counts. More importantly, it will ferry those souls at a lower burn than the big jet it replaces and its chief competitor from Airbus. The combination of lower operating cost and high seat capacity offers route flexibility and bottom-line padding that its predecessor could never hope to achieve.

The smaller 777-8 is projected to fly close to 8,700 nautical miles with a full passenger and cargo payload, while the larger 777-9 will max out around 7,300 nautical miles. Those figures make nonstop routes like Sydney to London, Dubai to Panama City, or Doha to Santiago possible. Missions that would force other widebodies, such as a Boeing 787 to takeoff payload-limited or in the case of an A330, nonstop is likely not feasible. The 777X will complement its performance and class-leading economics with a major upgrade to the cabin to make the experience even better for flyers as well as operators.

Boeing's Next-Generation Widebody

The new carbon-fiber wing with its novel folding wingtip is the spotlight feature of the new, gargantuan tinwjet. In the air, it spans almost 72 meters wide, but on the ground, its folding wingtips retract so that gate clearance matches the legacy 777-300ER. Airports can treat the jet as a normal Code-E aircraft, sparing operators the headaches and infrastructure surcharges that plagued the superjumbo A380 or even a jumbo 747-8. Carriers can dispatch the 777X to virtually every city already in its 777 network on day one, making the introduction of new routes equally easy too.

The 777X family comes in two sizes, with the 777-9 maximizing sheer volume to supplant the 747 or an A380 but with twin-engine fuel savings. Meanwhile, the 777-8 covers ultra-long-haul markets that demand fewer seats but an uncompromised range. Together, the qualities of high seat and cargo capacity, extreme range, and unrestricted airport compatibility create more viable routes than any other widebody.

The Future Of Long-Haul Flying

The Boeing 777X not only features the dramatically improved cabin, fuel saving and performance improvements but also a much more better maintenance interval with reduced cost and less frequent needs. A major factor in that is the new GE9X turbofans, which promise longer engine life with fewer shop visits that will add up to a stronger bottom line. That reliability and cost savings are equally vital for cargo and passenger carriers that fly long-haul across continents as well as transoceanic routes.

Boeing received 259 orders after it first opened the books, with the largest commercial aircraft launch in history by dollar value with Emirates ordering 150, Qatar Airways buying 50, and Etihad Airways ordering 25.

Brian J West, executive vice president for finance and chief financial officer at Boeing, commented on the progress of 777X certification, according to ch-aviation.

“Flight testing [for the 777X] recently resumed, and we still expect first delivery in 2026, and we will continue to follow the lead of the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] as we move through certification.”

The first airline to commit to the 777X was seeking to replace its departing fleet of 747 double-deckers, that was Lufthansa. Ordering 34 of the 777-9 extended variants, the German airline went for the maximum capacity model with its launch order. Due to the long-awaited arrival of the new twinjet, Lufthansa's fleet of 22 747s has gradually shrunk, after the 777X goes into service, the airline plans to retire its remaining aircraft.

Big Boeing: King Of The Twinjets

Its spotlight feature of Boeing’s 777X is a carbon-fiber wingtip that swings down into position for flight and folds up after takeoff for ground operations. The wings, when spread out to their full 71.8-meter span, provide an unmatched lift-to-drag ratio that makes the monstrous widebody more fuel-efficient than any competitor, despite its huge dimensions. When folded, the wings are around the same size as the current 777-300ER, so the aircraft can utilize existing Code-E gates and taxiways without requiring airports to change.

The new wing, featuring industry-first folding tips, enables the carrier to achieve a significant efficiency upgrade without incurring the costs of custom infrastructure or penalties for schedule restrictions that limit the use of the jumbo A380 or 747. The GE9X achieves double-digit fuel efficiency gains over the GE90 thanks to all-new material technology in the engine internals, a dramatically higher bypass ratio, and its 3.40-meter fan diameter. The massive engine size made it the largest turbofan ever certified, with a diameter that eclipses the 737’s fuselage dimensions.

Captain Ted Grady, 777X chief pilot, commented after a recent test flight on August 5.

“The 777-9 flies beautifully, and this airplane performed just as we expected. We appreciate the hard work of our teams who designed, built and prepared this airplane for flight, and we’re continuing our focus on getting the 777-9 certified and in our customers’ fleets.”

The 777X, with its folding wing, next-generation engines, and modernized and spacious cabin, will be a game-changer for current 777 operators. All of that, paired with legacy fleet commonality, will make the aircraft vital for airlines in a future with slot-restricted hubs and ever-more restricted operating budgets.

The Fire-Breathing Heart Of The 777X

Replacing the legacy quadjets, the 747 and A380, with twinjets demands more power from fewer engines to accomplish the same mission. It is expected to be the most fuel-efficient in its class and operate on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends. The GE9X engine is the world’s most powerful commercial turbofan ever produced, as detailed by Yahoo Finance.

The GE9X's sustainability improvements include 10% greater fuel efficiency than the GE90 and an overall pressure ratio of 61:1, which allows for a 5% lower thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). The projected maintenance will also be less than the current GE90. Improved propulsion efficiency, thanks to the higher-bypass-ratio fan, is mostly to credit for the increased efficiency with the bypass ratio at 10:1.

The gargantuan engine nacelle of the GE9X is 184 in (4,700 mm) wide.

Having fewer fan blades reduces the engine weight as well, improves aerodynamic efficiency, and allows the low-pressure (LP) fan and booster to spin faster. The booster can better match its speed with the LP turbine. The fan blades feature steel leading edges and fiberglass trailing edges, as well as carbon fiber composite in their construction. This complex interweaving of advanced materials results in lighter, thinner, and stronger blades than anything else. The GE9X also uses a carbon fiber composite fan case, derived from the GEnx.

Ready To Depart: The 777X Nears Certification

A prototype 777X arrived in Victorville last month to begin takeoff performance testing at Southern California Logistics Airport (VCV), or Victorville Airport, with Edwards Air Force Base (EDW) also hosting the tests. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) subjected the jet to a series of trials to verify that the 777-9 meets FAA standards for safe and reliable operation under different runway and environmental conditions.

According to Leeham News and Analysis, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said he was ""hopeful"" that certification testing will commence by year's end.

“I’m hopeful that we’ll get through the certification flight tests by the end of the year. We may still be doing some ETOPS testing going into next year, but there is no real change to our forecast of getting that certification done so that we can start deliveries next year. It’s an airplane that has had the most flight testing done of any other aircraft we’ve ever done in terms of hours. We feel pretty good about the stability and our entry into service for the airplane that we’ve done enough flight testing on that it’s going to be a great airplane.”",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fast2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-06 18:56:15.772156

With more than five years at Sopra Steria, he works closely with C-suite leaders, partners and new acquisitions to deliver innovative technologies and services. Passionate about driving growth and fostering future talent, he combines strategic insight with over 40 years of collective space expertise to help shape the sector’s next chapter.

Few industries are as critical to the UK’s long-term prosperity and sustainability as aerospace. Whether it’s accelerating defence programmes, advancing satellite and space systems, or leading cutting-edge R&D, aerospace sits at the heart of national innovation.

Generating £30.5 billion in annual turnover, the sector has grown by 7% over the past decade, a clear sign of its enduring strength and strategic importance. Much of this strength encompasses not only the large contractors but also the thousands of SMEs that form the backbone of the sector.

While there’s much to be optimistic about, it’s equally important to recognise the challenges the industry continues to face. These range from ramping up production rates and securing supply chains to driving digital transformation. Cybersecurity and reducing time-to-market also remain high on the agenda, demanding continued focus and coordinated action across the sector.

Layered on top of all this are heightened geopolitical tensions, the UK Defence Industrial Strategy’s renewed emphasis on sovereign production and the transformative potential of AI. Together, these forces are reshaping the sector’s priorities at pace. So, what will that look like in practice? Here are the trends set to shape aerospace in the years ahead.

Boosting future production ramp-up with generative AI

UK aerospace remains a major global player, with a reputation for reliability and technical excellence. From engine and wing manufacturing in the commercial sector to the development of next-generation military aircraft and space technologies, including satellites and launch systems, the UK continues to deliver at pace while upholding world-class quality standards.

However, like many complex production environments, the aerospace sector still faces operational inefficiencies that can hinder performance. Research suggests that issues such as lengthy inspection cycles and intricate testing processes could contribute to as much as £4 billion in downtime costs by the end of 2025. It’s a stark reminder of the need to modernise systems and strengthen productivity across the board.

Generative AI can help overcome these types of inefficiencies. Automating non-value-added tasks allows workers to focus on higher-value activities, improving overall consistency and accuracy and reducing the risk of human error.

Practical use cases include operators receiving summaries of complex assembly instructions to enable faster execution on the factory floor, or a mid-sized engineering firm using AI to accelerate inspection reporting, freeing up engineers from paperwork so they can focus on design work.

As these tools are deployed across dispersed production environments, ensuring the security of sensitive data and enabling trusted collaboration will be just as critical as the efficiency gains they deliver.

Strengthening supply chain planning will be central to greater resilience

Aerospace manufacturers are under growing pressure to improve planning processes in the face of mounting operational and economic challenges.

For example, 70% of UK manufacturers have seen their costs increase by up to a fifth in the last year, while almost one in ten have experienced an increase of up to 50%. This, on top of complex customer demands, shows that the ability to plan effectively has never been more critical. Those that treat supply chain planning as a strategic capability, rather than a day-to-day function, will be best placed to remain resilient and responsive.

Building supply chain resilience starts with greater visibility and awareness across the extended supplier network. This is particularly critical for SMEs, who typically operate on tighter margins and can be disproportionately affected by unexpected cost spikes or late changes in demand.

Manufacturers need a clear understanding of supplier capacity, potential risks and production demand to make operations more reliable. Achieving this depends on consistent, well-communicated data and the smart use of digital tools.

Breaking down data silos and improving data accuracy are essential first steps. From there, real-time monitoring, AI-driven modelling and scenario planning can help anticipate disruption, while stronger collaboration around shared data sets must become a strategic priority.

Driving innovation toward a decarbonised aerospace future

In response to the climate emergency, the aerospace industry is ramping up efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. International regulations like CORSIA are driving action, leading to initiatives like fleet renewal that combine aerodynamic improvements, lightweight materials and next-generation engines to cut fuel consumption.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), along with electric and hydrogen propulsion, are also gaining momentum across the industry. Meanwhile, in space, the push for more sustainable satellite technologies and debris mitigation is accelerating, as space becomes central to both climate monitoring and secure communications.

Looking ahead, manufacturers will need to treat emissions reduction not just as a regulatory requirement but as a core business priority, or risk falling short of compliance, facing financial penalties and damaging their reputation.

Achieving these goals at scale, however, will depend heavily on digital technologies. From research and development through to operations, these tools are accelerating the shift to a greener industry.

In R&D, digital twins are being used to simulate aerodynamics, test material strength, and optimise designs before production begins. Across supply chains, the use of SAF can be tracked and verified more accurately. In infrastructure planning, digital modelling supports the design of energy-efficient, future-ready facilities.

Moves like the proposed EU Space Act are also prompting greater alignment on sustainability and cyber-resilience across the satellite ecosystem, from lifecycle emissions to collision avoidance protocols. And operationally, AI-powered algorithms are improving flight planning, route efficiency and fuel burn.

An industry in transition

Faced with the dual challenge of decarbonisation and accelerating innovation, the aerospace industry stands at a strategic crossroads. The pursuit of ambitious sustainability goals, pressure to boost production and the need for greater supply chain resilience underline just how complex the road ahead will be.

These trends point to the need for a systemic transformation, one that spans operations, digital infrastructure and workforce capability. Success will depend on how effectively the industry embraces change, breaks down silos and embeds technology into every layer of its ecosystem.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Steve-Isaac-opinion-piece.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 16:56:26.182160

Sebagai bagian dari upaya membangun ekosistem produksi SAF yang berkelanjutan, termasuk dalam penyediaan bahan baku, Pertamina bersama Noovoleum sebagai mitra menghadirkan UCOllect Box di berbagai titik di Indonesia.

Kehadiran alat ini memungkinkan masyarakat luas untuk turut serta menyetorkan minyak jelantah yang dimiliki, agar tidak terbuang percuma dan justru dimanfaatkan kembali sebagai energi berkelanjutan.

Di Palembang, fasilitas UCOllect Box saat ini baru tersedia di kawasan Komperta Kilang Pertamina Plaju dan Komperta Sungai Gerong, yang menjadi pionir titik pengumpulan minyak jelantah di Sumatera.

Tepatnya berlokasi di toko swalayan Coopmart, Jalan Antara No. 292, Kelurahan Komperta, Kecamatan Plaju, Kota Palembang, fasilitas ini menyasar penduduk Komperta Plaju dan sekitarnya yang dinilai memiliki potensi besar untuk berkontribusi dalam penyetoran minyak jelantah secara berkelanjutan.

Sejak dioperasikan pada Februari 2025 lalu, antusiasme masyarakat untuk menyalurkan minyak jelantah terus tumbuh.

Data fungsi Environment-HSSE Kilang Pertamina Plaju mencatat bahwa sepanjang Februari–Agustus 2025, rata-rata 175 liter minyak jelantah berhasil dikumpulkan setiap bulannya.

Sumber pasokan jelantah ini sangat beragam, mulai dari dapur Koperasi Wanita Petra (KWP), rumah tangga pekerja, hingga partisipasi masyarakat umum di sekitar Plaju.

Fakta ini menunjukkan bahwa kesadaran kolektif warga untuk mengelola limbah sudah mulai mengakar.

Semakin banyak rumah tangga yang memilih untuk menukarkan minyak bekas gorengan mereka di UCOllect Box ketimbang membuangnya sembarangan.

Area Manager Communication, Relations & CSR PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional RU III, Siti Rachmi Indahsari, menegaskan bahwa program ini merupakan langkah strategis perusahaan untuk menghubungkan dapur masyarakat dengan agenda besar transisi energi.

“Pengelolaan limbah tidak hanya tentang membuang, tetapi bagaimana kita bisa memanfaatkannya kembali agar memiliki nilai ekonomi sekaligus mendukung energi hijau.

Pertamina mengajak masyarakat untuk berpartisipasi dalam ekosistem energi bersih yang berkelanjutan, dengan mengumpulkan setiap tetes jelantah di dapur untuk menjadi produk SAF,” ujarnya.

Terbuka Untuk Umum

Fasilitas UCOllect Box ini sepenuhnya terbuka untuk umum.

Artinya, siapa pun masyarakat di Kota Palembang yang memiliki minyak jelantah dapat menyetorkannya di titik ini, sehingga manfaatnya tidak hanya dirasakan oleh warga Komperta, tetapi juga menjadi sarana partisipasi kolektif masyarakat luas dalam mendukung energi bersih dan berkelanjutan.

Kehadiran UCOllect di Palembang membuktikan bahwa transformasi energi hijau bisa dimulai dari hal sederhana.

Satu liter minyak jelantah yang sebelumnya berpotensi mencemari jutaan liter air, kini bernilai Rp5.500 jika ditukarkan melalui UCOllect Box.

Lebih dari itu, setiap tetes jelantah yang terkumpul berkontribusi pada rantai pasok bahan baku SAF, membawa energi ramah lingkungan dari dapur rumah tangga hingga ke tangki pesawat.

Dengan capaian ini, Kilang Pertamina Plaju memperkuat perannya tidak hanya sebagai pengolah migas dan petrokimia, tetapi juga sebagai motor penggerak energi berkelanjutan.

Dari tetes jelantah yang dikumpulkan masyarakat, Indonesia kini melangkah lebih percaya diri menuju era penerbangan rendah emisi, sekaligus menjaga bumi untuk generasi mendatang.

Inisiatif pengumpulan minyak jelantah melalui UCOllect Box ini juga sejalan dengan komitmen Pertamina dalam menjalankan prinsip Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) serta mendukung pencapaian Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs).

Sejalan dengan SGDs & ESG

Program ini berkontribusi pada SDG 7 (Energi Bersih dan Terjangkau) melalui pemanfaatan sumber energi alternatif, SDG 12 (Konsumsi dan Produksi yang Bertanggung Jawab) lewat pengelolaan limbah berkelanjutan, SDG 13 (Penanganan Perubahan Iklim) dengan menekan emisi karbon, SDG 15 (Menjaga Ekosistem Darat) melalui pencegahan pencemaran lingkungan, serta SDG 17 (Kemitraan untuk Mencapai Tujuan) dengan menggandeng masyarakat, koperasi, dan berbagai mitra strategis.",https://palpos.disway.id/upload/a7c3f81526852abb2b1815a0d87c89fd.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 17:56:10.867439

Estas modernas instalaciones se iban a construir en el Parque Energético y Químico de Shell en Róterdam, cerca del mayor y más importante puerto de mercancías de Europa. Sin embargo, el combustible que iba a producir no estaba destinado a barcos sino aviones.

Inicialmente iba a ser un proyecto clave no sólo para la descarbonización de la compañía, también para la descarbonización de la industria aeronáutica europea, pero a Shell no le salen las cuentas. Tras una «exhaustiva evaluación económica y técnica», la compañía petrolera considera que el proyecto era demasiado caro y nada competitivo.

Esta planta se diseñó para ser una de las mayores convertidoras de residuos de Europa, capaz de convertir residuos orgánicos en hidrocarburos similares al queroseno de aviación (Jet A/Jet A-1), dando como resultado el conocido como combustible de aviación sostenible o SAF, por sus siglas en inglés («Sustainable Aviation Fuel»).

Mediante una serie de procesos industriales, se puede obtener combustible de aviación sostenible a partir de aceites de cocina usados, grasas animales, lodos de depuradoras, gases industriales o incluso residuos sólidos urbanos. El resultado final es un combustible con las mismas propiedades que el queroseno fósil, pero con una huella de carbono neta mucho menor (entre un 60% y un 90% menos, dependiendo de la materia prima y el proceso utilizado).

Conclusion The Air Canada labor dispute serves as a microcosm of the airline sector’s post-pandemic challenges.","The recent labor strike by Air Canada’s flight attendants, representing over 10,000 members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), has underscored the fragility of the post-pandemic airline sector. The three-day industrial action, which concluded with a tentative agreement on August 19, 2025, disrupted 500,000 passengers and cost the airline an estimated $98 million in daily losses [2]. While the deal includes wage increases and compensation for pre- and post-flight duties, its ratification remains pending, with voting closing on September 6 [1]. This case highlights broader systemic risks in the aviation industry, where unresolved labor disputes threaten financial stability, operational continuity, and long-term profitability.

Financial Risks: A Costly Disruption

The Air Canada strike exemplifies the acute financial vulnerabilities of airlines in a labor-intensive industry. According to a report by ePlaneAI, the airline’s daily losses during the strike were exacerbated by the grounding of 700 flights and the stranding of 25,000 passengers abroad [2]. These figures align with industry-wide trends: a 2025 IATA analysis notes that airlines globally face a 3.7% net margin, making them highly susceptible to shocks like labor disruptions [2]. For Air Canada, the strike’s financial toll is compounded by its efforts to process 20,000 customer claims and expand refund options, further straining liquidity [4].

The broader sector is not immune. Data from Morningstar indicates that core operating costs (excluding fuel) have risen 28% since the pandemic, driven by updated labor contracts and maintenance demands [1]. With fuel prices still averaging $87 per barrel—down from $99 in 2024—airlines remain exposed to volatile input costs [4]. For investors, this underscores the need to evaluate labor-related expenses as a critical component of operational risk.

Operational Risks: Labor Shortages and Aging Fleets

Beyond financial costs, unresolved labor disputes exacerbate operational challenges. The Air Canada strike coincided with a critical shortage of air traffic controllers (ATC) in Canada, particularly at Vancouver International Airport (YVR). A CBC report highlights that Air Canada pilots have publicly criticized these shortages, citing 50-minute delays and accusations that Nav Canada, the country’s ATC provider, prioritizes overtime over training [1]. This issue is not isolated: the global pilot shortage is projected to reach 50,000 by 2025, while U.S. air traffic control centers operate at 90% below recommended staffing levels [3].

Aging fleets further compound these risks. The average global aircraft age now stands at 14.8 years, increasing maintenance costs and reducing fuel efficiency [4]. For airlines like Air Canada, which must balance fleet modernization with labor negotiations, the interplay of these factors creates a volatile operational environment.

Industry-Wide Context: Post-Pandemic Pressures

The Air Canada case reflects broader post-pandemic challenges. A 2025 Gartner report ranks cybersecurity as the top risk for the aviation sector, with ransomware attacks like the Rhysida incident at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport exposing vulnerabilities [3]. Geopolitical conflicts also disrupt operations, with rerouting and insurance costs adding to expenses [4].

Despite these headwinds, the industry is projected to generate $36 billion in net profits in 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024 [2]. However, this growth is tempered by thin margins and the potential for renewed labor unrest. For instance, the tentative Air Canada agreement—while securing a 16–20% wage increase over four years—may not translate into long-term union gains, as labor experts caution against overestimating the strike’s political momentum [4].

Strategic Responses and Investor Implications

Airlines are adopting measures to mitigate these risks. United Airlines, for example, is investing in the Boeing 787 to improve route efficiency [1], while others leverage fuel hedging and digital transformation to stabilize costs [4]. For Air Canada, resolving the CUPE dispute is critical to restoring operational confidence. If the tentative agreement is ratified, the airline faces a week-long recovery period to restore full flight operations [3]. However, if rejected, arbitration on wage clauses could prolong uncertainty.

Investors should also monitor Nav Canada’s efforts to expand ATC training programs, which aim to address staffing shortages by 2028 [3]. Meanwhile, the industry’s reliance on aging fleets necessitates capital expenditure scrutiny. Airlines that prioritize fleet modernization and workforce development—such as through partnerships with training institutions—will likely outperform peers in a high-risk environment.

Conclusion

The Air Canada labor dispute serves as a microcosm of the airline sector’s post-pandemic challenges. While the tentative agreement offers a temporary reprieve, unresolved labor tensions, staffing shortages, and aging infrastructure continue to pose systemic risks. For investors, the key lies in identifying airlines that proactively address these vulnerabilities through strategic investments, cost containment, and collaborative labor relations. In an industry where margins are razor-thin and disruptions costly, resilience will separate winners from losers in the years ahead.

The new tariffs will take effect seven days after the announcement of the executive order.

According to Reuters, the US and Japan have officially reached an agreement, easing the significant uncertainty that has plagued Japan's automobile industry since the US-Japan trade agreement was announced in July. However, South Korea's automobile industry has expressed concerns that the move could put them at a competitive disadvantage.

In return, the executive order reaffirms that the Japanese government has agreed to invest US$550 billion (approximately HK$4.3 trillion) in US government-selected projects. Japan has also committed to increasing its purchase of American rice by 75% and buying US agricultural products, including corn, soybeans, fertilizers, bioethanol (including sustainable aviation fuel), and other goods, totaling US$8 billion (approximately HK$62.41 billion) annually.

Previously, Japan had indicated that under the existing framework, the share of US rice imports could rise, but the agreement ""does not sacrifice"" Japan's agricultural sector. Additionally, Japan stated that the agreement ensures the lowest tariffs for Japanese semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in all agreements negotiated in Washington. However, the US executive order makes no mention of such treatment.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday that Korean automakers like Hyundai and Kia, which compete directly with Japanese brands such as Toyota and Honda in the US market, are now concerned. While the US and South Korea previously reached a framework agreement, Trump has yet to sign the related executive order.

South Korean industry insiders noted that the 25% tariffs imposed on Korean vehicles have already placed immense pressure on the country's auto industry. With the US now lowering tariffs on Japanese vehicles, Korean automakers could face even greater challenges.

By aligning its fleet modernization with infrastructure investments and route expansion, the airline aims to balance cost efficiency, passenger capacity, and long-term profitability. This analysis examines how the adoption of the 787-10—coupled with hub-centric growth—positions Alaska Air Group to capitalize on trans-Pacific travel while navigating industry-wide challenges.

Fleet Modernization: Efficiency and Capacity for Trans-Pacific Growth

Alaska Airlines has aggressively restructured its fleet to meet surging demand for long-haul international travel. In July 2025, the airline exercised purchase options for five additional Boeing 787-9s and added 12 Boeing 737 MAX 10s to bolster its narrowbody fleet [1]. However, the most significant shift lies in the conversion of five Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 787-9 orders to the larger 787-10 variant [2]. This decision reflects a strategic prioritization of capacity on high-demand routes, such as Seattle to Tokyo and Honolulu to Los Angeles, where passenger traffic remains robust.

The 787-10’s advantages are twofold. First, its fuel efficiency—up to 30% better than older models—reduces operating costs, a critical factor amid volatile jet fuel prices [3]. Second, its increased seating capacity (typically 330 passengers in a mixed-class configuration) allows Alaska to maximize revenue on trans-Pacific routes without sacrificing frequency. According to a report by ePlaneAI, the airline anticipates $208 million in cost savings from reduced fuel consumption and fewer flight hours over the next decade [4]. These savings, combined with the ability to serve premium markets with lie-flat seats and enhanced amenities, strengthen the business case for the 787-10.

Hub Expansion: Seattle as a Global Gateway

The success of Alaska’s fleet strategy hinges on its parallel investment in infrastructure at the Seattle-Tacoma (SEA) hub. A $2.3 billion modernization initiative, led by the airline and the Port of Seattle, includes redeveloping terminal concourses, expanding security checkpoints, and reconfiguring office spaces to accommodate growing international traffic [5]. The SEA Gateway Project’s second phase, set to begin in 2026, will further enhance passenger flow and support the launch of 12 trans-Pacific routes by 2030 [6].

This infrastructure push is critical for managing the operational complexity of long-haul flights. For instance, the recent introduction of nonstop service to Seoul (Incheon) and plans for daily flights to London Heathrow underscore Alaska’s ambition to compete with legacy carriers like Delta and United [7]. By leveraging the 787-10’s range and efficiency, the airline can offer direct connectivity to Asia and Europe from a secondary U.S. hub, avoiding the congestion and higher costs of major East Coast airports.

Financial Projections and Strategic Risks

While the 787-10’s adoption promises cost savings and revenue growth, Alaska Air Group’s long-term profitability remains subject to external pressures. Stock forecasts suggest a 9.44% increase in share price by October 2025, with a projected range of $53.39–$69.75 for 2025 [8]. However, analysts caution that volatility could persist through 2027, when the stock’s average price is expected to dip to $48.06 [8]. This uncertainty stems from factors such as rising Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) costs and competition from low-cost international carriers.

The airline’s “Alaska Accelerate” plan—targeting $1 billion in incremental pre-tax profit—hinges on maintaining a 11%+ pre-tax margin through 2026 [9]. To achieve this, Alaska must balance fleet modernization with disciplined cost management. For example, while the 787-10’s commonality with the 787-9 reduces training and maintenance expenses [10], the airline’s reliance on a single aircraft type for long-haul operations could amplify risks if supply chain disruptions delay deliveries.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Global Connectivity

Alaska Air Group’s strategic alignment of fleet modernization, hub expansion, and trans-Pacific route growth positions it to capitalize on a structural shift in air travel. The 787-10’s efficiency and capacity address both cost and demand-side challenges, while SEA’s infrastructure investments ensure the hub can scale with the airline’s ambitions. However, the path to long-term profitability will require navigating macroeconomic headwinds and maintaining operational agility. For investors, the key question is whether Alaska can sustain its cost advantages and route network optimization in an increasingly competitive global market.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 11:56:32.595033

Doch das Urlaubsgefühl hat seinen Preis: Die zivile Luftfahrt trägt weltweit zwischen zwei und drei Prozent zu den gesamten CO2-Emissionen bei. Um die CO2- und Feinstaub-Bilanz zu verbessern, schreibt die EU daher seit diesem Jahr die Nutzung des grünen Treibstoffs SAF („Sustainable Aviation Fuel“, deutsch: „Nachhaltiger Luftfahrttreibstoff“) vor – zwei Prozent müssen die Airlines dem regulären Kerosin beimischen.

Bis 2050 soll dieser Anteil sukzessive auf 70 Prozent ansteigen. Dieser Traum könnte allerdings bald platzen: Erst hat eine neue Recherche der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters aufgedeckt, dass viele Projekte noch in den Kinderschuhen stecken und bislang noch nicht mal Treibstoff herstellen. Nun kommt der nächste Rückschlag: Der Öl-Riese Shell hat bekannt gegeben, den geplanten Bau einer der größten SAF-Produktionsstätten Europas zu schließen.

SAF: Der grüne Flug-Wunderstoff

Bei SAF handelt es sich um einen Oberbegriff für alle Treibstoffe, die nicht aus fossilen Brennstoffen hergestellt werden. Diese Treibstoffe sind besonders gefragt, weil große, kommerzielle Passagierflugzeuge nach derzeitigem technischen Stand nur schwer auf einen elektrischen Betrieb umgerüstet werden können, anders als etwa Pkw oder Busse. Gleichzeitig steigen Jahr für Jahr die weltweiten Passagierzahlen, und damit auch die Nachfrage nach Flügen.

Deswegen setzt die Luftfahrt auf einen CO2-armen Treibstoff, der dem klimaschädlichen Kerosin beigemischt werden kann – und deswegen schreibt die Europäische Union auch die Beimischung von SAF für alle Flüge vor, die innerhalb der EU starten. Dieser verpflichtende Anteil soll von den derzeit geltenden zwei Prozent sukzessive erhöht werden:

Sechs Prozent ab 2030

34 Prozent ab 2040

Und ab 2050 – wenn die EU-Länder klimaneutral sein wollen – müssen mindestens 70 Prozent SAF beigemischt sein.

Um diese Vorgaben einzuhalten, sicherte sich IAG – eine Holdinggesellschaft, zu der auch British Airways gehört – im März des vergangenen Jahres ein großes Stück vom Kuchen: 785.000 Tonnen SAF über die nächsten 14 Jahre. Liefern soll das US-amerikanische Start-Up Twelve.

Auch ein anderes Start-Up aus den USA, WorldEnergy, hat einen großen Deal mit der amerikanischen Fluglinie United Airlines abgeschlossen. Wie Reuters herausgefunden hat, wurde die Fabrik, die den Treibstoff produzieren sollte, im April klammheimlich geschlossen - und dabei handelt es sich nicht um das einzige Projekt, das nur auf dem Papier existiert.

Das harte Shell-Urteil

Die heimliche Schließung einer der größten SAF-Fabriken nahm die Nachrichtenagentur zum Anlass, die 165 SAF-Projekte, die von Airlines in den letzten zwölf Jahren bekanntgegeben wurden, zu überprüfen. Das Ergebnis:

Zu 44 dieser Projekte gibt es seit der ursprünglichen Bekanntgabe kein Update.

23 Projekte wurden aufgegeben.

27 Projekte sind verspätet oder auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben.

35 Projekte haben noch keinen Treibstoff hergestellt oder hatten es nie vor.

Insgesamt gibt es lediglich 36 SAF-Projekte, die tatsächlich Treibstoff produzieren – allerdings haben es bisher nur zehn geschafft, kommerzielle Mengen für die Fluggesellschaften herzustellen.

Und nun zieht sich also auch der Öl-Riese Shell aus dem Markt zurück. Schon im vergangenen Jahr hatte der Konzern den Bau einer großen Fabrik in Rotterdam, deren Kapazität zur Hälfte der Herstellung von SAF dienen sollte, auf Eis gelegt – zu unsicher waren die Marktbedingungen, so der Konzern. Nun wird das Projekt endgültig beendet, zugunsten des fossilen Kerngeschäfts von Shell. Eine Marktanalyse habe gezeigt, dass der Treibstoff nicht wettbewerbsfähig sein werde, hieß es in einer Mitteilung.

Streit um Treibstoff-Krise

Wer trägt die Verantwortung für die Treibstoff-Misere? Fluggesellschaften und Treibstoff-Industrie schieben sich gegenseitig den Schwarzen Peter zu. Nach einer Schätzung der IATA, des Branchenverbands des Flugverkehrs, werde SAF dieses Jahr lediglich 0,7 Prozent des Gesamttreibstoffes ausmachen. Die Produktion des grünen Treibstoffs hinkt den wachsenden Passagierzahlen deutlich hinterher

Gegenüber Reuters beschuldigte IATA-Chef Willie Walsh die Ölindustrie: Sie würde schlicht zu wenig Treibstoff produzieren. Die Branche hält schon länger dagegen, dass SAF momentan drei- bis fünfmal so teuer wie das handelsübliche Kerosin sei – und dadurch ein Ladenhüter ist. In Industriekreisen wird schon länger moniert, dass die Airlines sich bei der Umsetzung angekündigter SAF-Projekte kaum einbringen – und lieber Lobby-Druck auf Brüssel ausüben, die Beimischungs-Pflichten zu verwässern.

Der Treibstoff-Teufelskreis

Das Problem: Die meisten Hersteller nutzen Speisefettreste zur SAF-Produktion, von denen gibt es aber nur begrenzte Mengen. Das macht die Herstellung teuer und unsicher. Fluggesellschaften brauchen aber eine langfristig verlässliche Lieferkette.

Die Hersteller können also nicht genügend Treibstoff liefern, Airlines scheuen daher verbindliche Zusagen – aber genau diese sind notwendig, um in die Produktion zu investieren. Einige Airlines haben auch ihre eigenen SAF-Projekte ins Leben gerufen, was wiederum stürzt die bereits existierenden Hersteller in eine Krise stürzt. Ein Teufelskreis also.

Und dann ist da auch noch Trump

Der Traum vom klimaneutralen Fliegen könnte also bald platzen. Auch auf politischer Ebene wird es nicht besser: In den USA, wo zuletzt im April eine der größten SAF-Produktionsstätten heimlich dicht machte, könnte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Wandel in der Branche konterkarieren: Die Trump-Regierung kündigte bereits an, die Förderungen seines Vorgängers Joe Biden zurückzunehmen, die unter anderem auch die Produktion von SAF ankurbeln sollte.

Und in Deutschland hat die Kürzung von knapp drei Milliarden Euro an Forschungsgeldern die Entwicklung und Marktreife von SAF so stark zurückgeworfen, dass mittlerweile Zweifel bestehen, ob das Projekt überhaupt noch rechtzeitig umgesetzt werden kann.

Deutscher Lichtblick

Eine wenige Lichtblicke verbleiben jedoch: Für eine am Düsseldorfer Flughafen geplante Anlage zur SAF-Herstellung gibt es jetzt einen Abnehmer. Der Anlagenbetreiber Greenlyte und die Fluggesellschaft Eurowings unterzeichneten eine Absichtserklärung für eine strategische Partnerschaft, wie Eurowings am Donnerstag in Köln mitteilte.

In den ersten drei Jahren will Eurowings die gesamte Produktionsmenge der Anlage abnehmen. Rechnerisch, so heißt es, soll das etwa für 60 Flüge zwischen Düsseldorf und Palma de Mallorca reichen.

- Encaleret was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported over the study period

- Based on these findings, BridgeBio intends to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret, an orally-administered investigational therapy, in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026

PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, announced today that encaleret showed parathyroid hormone (PTH)-independent normalization of blood and urine calcium in post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. The Phase 2 results were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting 2025.

“Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a challenging condition to manage because treatment involves striking a balance between blood and urine calcium. With conventional therapy, using calcium and active vitamin D, we typically aim for a low or low-normal blood calcium to reduce the risk of high urinary calcium which can cause kidney calcifications and renal injury. Unfortunately, not all patients are able to achieve this balance, and many still struggle – some with the disruptive symptoms of low blood calcium, and others with persistently high urine calcium,” said Iris Hartley, M.D., endocrinologist and clinician investigator at the National Institute of Dental and Cranial Facial Research of the National Institutes of Health. “There is a clear need for better options. New results from this study are very promising, suggesting a potential path for improved calcium control in a convenient pill form.”

The Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluated the PTH-independent effects of encaleret on renal calcium handling in patients with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Ten participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism were administered encaleret at 162 mg twice daily for up to 5 days. Calcitriol was stopped one day prior to the first dose. After starting encaleret, calcium and calcitriol were titrated based on blood calcium. The findings from the study include:

Encaleret treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in fractional excretion of calcium in nine participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism

80% of post-surgical hypoparathyroidism participants achieved concomitant blood and urine calcium in the normal reference range within 5 days of treatment initiation compared to 0% of participants on conventional therapy at baseline

These results support the continued evaluation of encaleret as an orally-administered treatment option for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism

“These Phase 2 results show that encaleret may help normalize blood and urine calcium in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, in the absence of stimulating PTH secretion, due to its effect on the calcium-sensing receptor expressed in the kidney. Based on these encouraging findings, we intend to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026,” said Scott Adler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Calcilytix, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing encaleret.

During ASBMR 2025, we also presented data from two preclinical studies of infigratinib, which demonstrated that low-dose infigratinib significantly improved bone growth in a hypochondroplasia mouse model as well as enhanced skull development in a Crouzon/Pfeiffer syndrome model. These data underscore the therapy’s broad potential for treating skeletal conditions. Additionally, the study of infigratinib in the hypochondroplasia mouse model was recently published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

SHANGHAI, China, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hesai Group (NASDAQ: HSAI) (“Hesai” or the “Company”), the global leader in three-dimensional light detection and ranging (lidar) solutions, today announced the launch of its global offering (the “Global Offering”) of 17,000,000 Class B ordinary shares of the Company, which comprises a Hong Kong public offering of initially 1,700,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing on September 8, 2025 Hong Kong time (the “Hong Kong Public Offering”) and an international offering of initially 15,300,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing today (the “International Offering”), and dual-primary listing of its Class B ordinary shares on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong Kong Stock Exchange”) under the stock code “2525”.

The Company’s American depositary shares (the “ADSs”), each representing one Class B ordinary share of the Company, will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”). Investors in the Global Offering will only be able to purchase Class B ordinary shares and will not be able to take delivery of ADSs. Upon listing of the Class B ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Class B ordinary shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be fully fungible with the ADSs listed on Nasdaq.

The Company has an offer size adjustment option, exercisable with prior written agreement with the Sponsor-OCs (as defined below) on or before the time of pricing, pursuant to which the Company may allot and issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, to cover additional demand.

In addition, the Company expects to grant the international underwriters an over-allotment option to require the Company to issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares in the International Offering (or up to 2,932,500 Class B ordinary shares if the offer size adjustment option is exercised in full), representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Global Offering.

The initial number of Class B ordinary shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Offering represent approximately 10% and 90% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, respectively, subject to reallocation, offer size adjustment, and over-allotment. Subject to the level of oversubscription in the Hong Kong Public Offering and reallocation, as described in the Hong Kong prospectus to be issued by the Company in Hong Kong dated September 8, 2025, the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering could be adjusted to up to a maximum of 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering.

The offer price for the Hong Kong Public Offering (the “Hong Kong Offer Price”) will be no more than HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share (the “Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price”), or US$29.04, per Class B ordinary share (equivalent to US$29.04 per ADS) based on an exchange rate of HK$7.8499 to US$1.00 as of June 30, 2025 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The offer price for the International Offering tranche of the Global Offering (the “International Offer Price”) may be set higher than, or the same as, the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price. The Company will set the International Offer Price on or about September 12, 2025, Hong Kong time, by taking into consideration, among other factors, the closing price of the ADSs on the Nasdaq on the last trading day on or before September 12, 2025 and investor demand during the marketing process. The final Hong Kong Offer Price will be set at the lower of the final International Offer Price and the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price of HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share. The shares will be traded in board lots of 20 Class B ordinary shares.

The Company has entered into cornerstone investment agreements with HHLR Advisors (part of Hillhouse Group), Taikang Life, WT Asset Management, Grab, Hongda Group and Commando Global Fund. Under such agreements, the cornerstone investors have agreed to, subject to certain conditions, subscribe for such number of Class B ordinary shares that may be purchased with an aggregate amount of approximately US$148.0 million, or approximately HK$1,153.7 million at the International Offer Price, representing approximately 29.8% of the Class B ordinary shares initially being offered under the Global Offering assuming such Class B ordinary shares are sold at the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price, which percentage is subject to the offer size adjustment option and the over-allotment option. Such Class B ordinary shares are being sold in reliance on Regulation S and are exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and this cornerstone placing will form part of the International Offering.

The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering for investment in research and development, investment in its manufacturing capabilities, business development to accelerate its business expansion, and working capital and general corporate purposes.

WASHINGTON/TOKYO, Sept. 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday to implement lower tariffs on Japanese automobile imports and other products that were announced in July, providing some relief to Japan's export-heavy economy.

Formalizing the deal between the U.S. and a key Asian ally comes after months of negotiations, reduces uncertainty plaguing the massive Japanese auto sector since the July announcement and confirms an agreement for $550 billion of Japanese investment in U.S. projects.

The lower 15% tariffs on Japanese autos, down from the current 27.5%, are set to take effect seven days after official publication of the order.

The executive order also ensured that the 15% levy on Japanese imports agreed in July would not be stacked on top of those already subject to higher tariffs such as beef, while items previously subject to tariffs below 15% would be adjusted to 15%. This relief is retroactive to August 7.

In addition, it promised no tariffs on commercial airplanes and parts.

""Finally,"" Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's top trade negotiator, posted to X, in a nod to the months-long trade talks that had frustrated lawmakers in Tokyo. Thursday marked his 10th trip to the U.S. for the negotiations.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, Akazawa said Japan welcomed the executive order as ""a steady implementation of the agreement reached on July 22.""

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted a video clip on X showing a conversation with Akazawa where he said the order ""puts into effect the amazing, historic agreement.""

Trump's levies on global shipments have dragged down Japan's exports and hit Japanese carmakers hard.

Toyota 7203.T, which has flagged a nearly $10 billion profit hit from the tariffs, praised Trump's efforts to reach a trade deal with Japan. ""While nearly 80% of the vehicles Toyota sells in the U.S. are made in North America, this framework provides much needed clarity,"" the company said in a statement.

The United States in July agreed to lower tariffs on imports of Japanese automobiles, but the timing remained unclear as Trump had yet to sign an executive order.

Rival exporter South Korea is still waiting on an executive order covering a similar trade agreement with the U.S., including a 15% tariff on U.S. imports from automakers like Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and Kia 000270.KS, down from 25%.

A South Korean trade official said on Friday that his country was assessing the potential impact of the executive order regarding Japan.

Shares of major Japanese automakers were up slightly on Friday, while those in South Korea were slightly lower.

Billions of Dollars in Deals

Trump's order said Japan was ""working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements... and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel)"" and other U.S. products totaling $8 billion per year.

A separate joint statement released on Thursday said Japan would buy 100 Boeing BA.N planes, increase annual procurement of U.S. defense equipment ""by billions of dollars"" and explore a new Alaskan liquefied natural gas offtake agreement.

The joint statement also ensured the U.S.'s fifth-largest trading partner would always receive the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals of all the pacts negotiated by Washington.

Two-way trade between the two countries reached nearly $230 billion in 2024, with Japan running a trade surplus of nearly $70 billion.

Trump's order on Thursday also reiterated that the Japanese government has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States in projects that will be selected by the U.S. government.

The investment package, which will come in the form of equity, loans and guarantees from Japan's government-owned banks, was agreed as part of the July trade deal.

The two governments also signed a memorandum of understanding on the details of the package on Thursday, stating it would focus on investments in key sectors such as chips, metals, pharmaceuticals, energy and shipbuilding to be made by January 2029, which coincides with the end of Trump's presidential term.

Under the arrangement, available free cash flows from investments would be split in half until reaching an allocated amount, and then 90% would go to the United States.

The executive order on the tariff deal said that the United States ""may modify this order as necessary"" should Japan fail to implement its commitments under the agreement.

The agreement comes ahead of a key test for Japan's embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba with his ruling party set to vote on Monday on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election that could result in his ouster.

Ishiba has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majority in elections for both houses of parliament since coming to power last year amid voter anger over rising living costs and weak economic growth exacerbated by the trade tariff uncertainty.

While finalising the trade deal gives Ishiba an argument to stay on, he is unlikely to survive the backlash from within his own party, said David Boling of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, estimating a 60% chance that he is forced out.

Synhelion's work on solar fuel is a game-changer, and the Harley-Davidson name will sit along side it in the history books.","The Harley-Davidson name has been around for over a century, and it has enjoyed such longevity for a reason. Throughout its decades at the forefront of the motorcycle world, the company has continued to innovate to a changing market. There are now several different Harley-Davidson frame types designed to meet the needs of many different styles of riding. You can also customize your Harley, as well as choose from various types of engines. Now, the motorcycle brand has become the first to use a new form of fuel that is made with solar energy.

In May 2025, a company called Synhelion revealed that it had successfully fueled a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with an energy source known as solar fuel. Ridden by ETH Zurich professor Aldo Steinfeld, who has been studying solar fuel for more than a decade, the motorcycle operated much like one powered by normal fuel. It was noted that the motorcycle didn't require any modifications to use this new solar fuel, indicating that it shouldn't be necessary to retrofit current vehicles to accommodate it as it potentially becomes more widespread. With all of that said, what exactly is solar fuel?

When you see the word ""solar-powered,"" you likely imagine solar panels soaking up energy from the sun to power a device of some kind. Yet the Harley itself doesn't have any solar-powered technology on it. Instead, it is using solar-powered fuel. This is created when the energy of the sun drives a chemical reaction between some kind of biomass, like agricultural waste, and water. In this process, these substances are converted into liquid hydrocarbons. According to Synhelion, this thermochemical reaction is able to turn the aforementioned concoction into sustainable aviation fuel, gasoline, and diesel, so it goes without saying that this tech could be revolutionary in multiple industries.

Synhelion also notes that solar fuel is nearly carbon-dioxide-neutral. This means that, as it's burned in a car, truck, or Harley, it will only release roughly as much carbon dioxide as it took to produce it, without emitting CO₂ when in use. This could be appealing in a market that is shifting toward electric vehicles and other means of transportation that emit less carbon dioxide in an attempt to mitigate the effects of climate change. Solar fuel isn't the strangest renewable energy source being explored today, but it's making headlines all the same. After this historic Harley-Davidson ride, hopes are high that solar fuel could expand its reach in the near future.

There's no denying the historical significance of the solar fuel-powered Harley-Davidson ride. It cemented the viability of this alternative fuel source and provided strong evidence that it can be used safely and effectively on existing machinery. With that said, it's just the first step in Synhelion's wider solar fuel plan.

With the success of professor Aldo Steinfeld's Harley trip, Synhelion is moving forward with more real-world applications. For example, in early August 2025, Swiss International Air Lines saw 190 liters of solar fuel integrated into Jet A-1 aviation fuel for flight use. Synhelion also successfully used the fuel in a 1985 Audi Sport Quattro, taking it for a rigorous drive through the Swiss Alps to prove the fuel's capabilities. It stands to reason that so long as Synhelion is able to keep proving its solar fuel is on par with traditional gasoline, it could soon become more commonplace. Just as renewable energy can transform your home, it may be able to transform your commute in the form of solar fuel. Synhelion's work on solar fuel is a game-changer, and the Harley-Davidson name will sit along side it in the history books.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/what-you-should-know-about-the-worlds-first-solar-fueled-harley-davidson-motorcycle/l-intro-1756812737.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 10:56:23.438041

As the energy transition accelerates and oil prices stabilize, Petrobras’ dual focus on short-term shareholder returns and long-term decarbonization could unlock significant value.","For income-focused investors seeking undervalued opportunities in the energy sector, Petrobras (PBR) emerges as a compelling case study. Despite operating in a politically charged environment and facing headwinds from volatile oil prices, the Brazilian state-controlled oil giant combines a rock-bottom valuation, a robust free cash flow (FCF) yield, and a forward-looking energy transition strategy. This analysis explores how Petrobras balances these dynamics to position itself as a dividend powerhouse with long-term growth potential.

Discounted Valuation and Sustainable Dividends

Petrobras’ financial metrics in 2025 paint a picture of a deeply undervalued asset. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.86 [1] and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.03 [1] suggest the market is pricing the company below intrinsic value, even as it generates a free cash flow yield of 23.75% [1]. This yield—among the highest in the global energy sector—has enabled Petrobras to maintain a disciplined dividend policy. In Q2 2025, the company distributed $8.7 billion in dividends, representing 45% of its free cash flow [4], while historical data from Yahoo Finance indicates a 90.08% payout ratio [5], underscoring its commitment to shareholder returns.

The sustainability of these dividends is further reinforced by Petrobras’ ability to generate strong cash flows even amid a 10% drop in oil prices [1]. This resilience stems from its low-cost offshore production in Brazil’s pre-salt basins and operational efficiency gains. For context, a P/FCF ratio of 4.21 [1] implies investors are paying just four times the company’s annual free cash flow, a metric that historically signals attractive entry points for value-oriented investors.

Energy Transition: A $111 Billion Bet on the Future

While Petrobras’ traditional oil and gas operations anchor its current profitability, its $111 billion CAPEX plan for 2025–2029 [1] positions it as a key player in the global energy transition. Of this, $16.3 billion (15%) is allocated to decarbonization initiatives, including renewable energy, carbon capture, and green hydrogen.

Key projects include:

- 5GW of onshore renewable energy assets (wind and solar) by 2028, achieved through partnerships with private developers [3].

- A CCS hub in Macaé, Rio de Janeiro, targeting the reinjection of 80 million tonnes of CO2 by 2025 [1].

- A $18 million green hydrogen pilot project in Rio Grande do Norte, aligning with Brazil’s growing demand for low-carbon fuels [3].

These investments are part of a broader strategy to reduce absolute operational emissions by 30% by 2030 and achieve emissions neutrality by 2050 [1]. By leveraging its expertise in large-scale infrastructure and Brazil’s abundant natural resources, Petrobras aims to transition from a traditional energy producer to a diversified energy company. This pivot not only mitigates long-term exposure to carbon regulations but also taps into emerging markets for sustainable aviation fuel (BioQAV) and renewable diesel [3].

Navigating Political and Regulatory Risks

Petrobras’ path to growth is not without challenges. The company faces political risks tied to regulatory shifts, such as the ANP’s revised oil reference price, which has raised costs for post-salt projects and reduced the economic viability of onshore operations [3]. CEO Magda Chambriard has warned that these changes could delay key projects in the Campos Basin and impact profitability [1]. Additionally, the legacy of the 2014 Lava Jato scandal, which exposed $3 billion in bribes and implicated high-profile politicians, continues to cast a shadow over governance perceptions [5].

However, Petrobras has taken steps to mitigate these risks. It has scaled back controversial local content (LC) policies that previously tied production to domestic industrial development, opting instead for market-based reforms to improve transparency [2]. While corruption allegations in 2025 are not reported in current sources, the company’s recent focus on operational efficiency and shareholder returns suggests a renewed emphasis on accountability.

Balancing Risks and Rewards

Petrobras’ investment case hinges on its ability to balance short-term political risks with long-term growth opportunities. On one hand, regulatory changes and governance concerns could pressure margins and delay energy transition projects. On the other, its discounted valuation, high FCF yield, and strategic CAPEX create a margin of safety for investors willing to navigate these uncertainties.

For context, Petrobras’ free cash flow yield of 23.75% [1] dwarfs the energy sector average of 8.2%, while its P/FCF ratio of 4.21 [1] is significantly lower than the sector median of 6.8. These metrics suggest the company is undervalued relative to its cash-generating capacity, particularly as it reinvests in high-margin renewables and hydrogen.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Bet for Patient Investors

Petrobras is not for the faint of heart. Its exposure to Brazil’s political landscape and regulatory shifts demands a high tolerance for risk. Yet, for investors who can stomach these challenges, the rewards are substantial. The company’s deep-value metrics, dividend sustainability, and aggressive energy transition strategy position it as a rare hybrid: a cash-flow generator with a clear roadmap to future-proof its operations.

As the energy transition accelerates and oil prices stabilize, Petrobras’ dual focus on short-term shareholder returns and long-term decarbonization could unlock significant value. For those who recognize the interplay between discounted valuations and strategic reinvention, Petrobras represents a compelling, albeit complex, opportunity in the evolving energy landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 11:56:48.409210

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a cleaner, eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel.
Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka SAF initiative offers a template for SAF market expansion in the Asia-Pacific region.
Key Takeaways Hawaiian Airlines has started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka and Honolulu.","Hawaiian Airlines has begun using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on its daily flights from Osaka to Honolulu. This move marks a significant milestone in the airline’s mission to cut down on climate pollution and reduce its carbon footprint.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a cleaner, eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. It is made from renewable or waste feedstocks like used cooking oil, making it a greener choice for aviation. Hawaiian Airlines has partnered with SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a company that produces SAF from locally sourced cooking oil. This collaboration aims to help cut emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Why Osaka to Honolulu?

The airline chose the Osaka-Honolulu route for its SAF debut because it is a popular tourist route with steady demand, offering a reliable platform to scale this initiative. The wide-body daily flights provide an ideal opportunity to test and refine the SAF integration. Local production also minimizes the risks of fuel shortages and price fluctuations that might occur with imported fuel.

SAF Rollout Timeline and Targets

The SAF program was first announced in August 2025, and the initial deliveries of SAF began in early September 2025. The airline plans to use 1% SAF of its total fuel by the end of 2025, with a goal to reach 10% SAF by 2030. The ultimate aim is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

Process of SAF Blending and Use

Once the used cooking oil is collected and refined, it is blended with traditional jet fuel at the Kansai International Airport. The blended fuel is then used on Hawaiian Airlines’ A330-200 aircraft, operating flights HA449 and HA450 between Osaka and Honolulu. The process of fuel blending and certification ensures that the fuel meets sustainability standards like ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU.

It is the intention of the airlines to offer uninterrupted service to the patrons. While the rest of the protocol will remain the same, the fuel will be substituted for B20 blend SAF and conventional fuel. There will be no changes to the systems onboard, the layout and the boarding processes. Nevertheless, the tracking and blend processes still have to be modified.

Local Impact and Community Engagement

The SAF program integrates with local initiatives to gather used cooking oil from homes and companies. This initiative encourages recycling and deepens the community’s engagement with the sustainability process. Hawaiian Airlines recognizes the multifaceted opportunity to support sustainability and local economies.

The Role of Cosmo Oil and Other Partners

Cosmo Oil, a key partner in this program, is responsible for delivering the SAF to the airport. The company is focused on creating a domestic SAF supply chain in Japan. The Japanese government is also playing a crucial role by providing subsidies and policy support, which help lower the risks involved in scaling up this new fuel.

Addressing SAF Challenges and Future Scaling

While SAF is still a small share of the global aviation fuel market, early adoption is key to scaling up production. The main challenges to overcome include limited supply, the need for more refining plants, and the cost of SAF. However, early demand helps producers secure steady revenues and reinvest in building the supply chain.

The Annual Report anticipates that the U.S. demand for SAF products will reach 51,000 barrel equivalents per day by 2025. Although that figure seems high, it still represents less than 1% of total jet fuel consumption. Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka SAF initiative offers a template for SAF market expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. Large metropolitan centers will be able to support local SAF production.

Government Policy and Public Support

The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has been supporting the SAF initiative through public policy and financial incentives, which helps to lower initial costs for airlines. This collaboration highlights the importance of government backing in pushing forward new sustainable technologies.

Looking Ahead

Hawaiian Airlines has set its sights on expanding SAF usage to other routes as the fuel supply grows and costs decrease. The involvement of Alaska Air Group could provide additional benefits, such as shared procurement and logistics, lowering unit costs. As the SAF infrastructure improves, more airlines will be able to adopt this sustainable fuel and significantly reduce their emissions.

Key Takeaways

Hawaiian Airlines has started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka and Honolulu.

The SAF is produced from locally sourced cooking oil, reducing transportation emissions.

By 2030, Hawaiian aims to use 10% SAF, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040.

The program also highlights community involvement in used oil collection and regional SAF production.

Government and private sector collaboration is essential to scaling SAF and reducing aviation emissions.

Conclusion

The pioneering use of SAF by Hawaiian Airlines on the Osaka-Honolulu route is a critical milestone to further Hawaiian Airlines and the industry’s mission on emission reduction and sustainable aviation. Such an initiative can readily be replicated by other airlines interested in emission reduction and contributing to global climate action as it expands in scope.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hawaiian-airlines-3.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 05:56:12.196914

Thailand introduced it nationwide in 2007 and phased out pure gasoline by 2013, with no adverse effects on vehicle performance.
According to recent surveys by Petrolimex, Toyota, and Honda, vehicles in Vietnam also run smoothly on E10.","The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) has released a draft circular outlining Vietnam’s roadmap for increasing biofuel use, with mandatory nationwide adoption of E10 gasoline set to begin on January 1, 2026, reports Vietnamnet Global.

Under the proposal, all gasoline produced, blended, and sold for vehicles will be E10—gasoline with 10% ethanol. From 2031, the mandate will rise to E15 or higher ratios, depending on vehicle technology, fuel supply conditions, and energy security requirements. Until then, organizations and individuals are encouraged to produce, blend, and use biodiesel options such as B5 and B10.

Vietnam is expected to need around 1.5 million cubic meters of ethanol annually for blending, based on projected gasoline demand of 15 million cubic meters in 2024. Officials say the country already has sufficient capacity to meet this requirement.

The ministry emphasized that greater biofuel use supports Vietnam’s green growth goals, clean energy adoption, and its 2050 net-zero commitment. Studies indicate E10 can cut CO2 emissions by 3–5% compared with traditional gasoline. Applied to 10 million tons of annual consumption, that reduction could reach 640,000–800,000 tons of CO2 each year—six to eight times higher than the reductions achieved with E5.

Beyond climate benefits, biofuels lower toxic emissions such as CO, HC, and NOx, improving air quality in heavily polluted urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Addressing concerns over engine safety, MOIT cited automakers including Toyota, Honda, and Ford, as well as the Society of Automotive Engineers, in confirming E10 is safe for all modern engines. Vietnam’s own tests show no negative impact on engine durability when standards are met.

E10 has already been adopted successfully abroad. Thailand introduced it nationwide in 2007 and phased out pure gasoline by 2013, with no adverse effects on vehicle performance. Similarly, the US Renewable Fuels Association notes E10 has been used for over 20 years without issues.

According to recent surveys by Petrolimex, Toyota, and Honda, vehicles in Vietnam also run smoothly on E10. MOIT says the transition will protect engines, reduce maintenance costs, and extend vehicle lifespans thanks to E10’s higher octane rating.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ethanol-3.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 05:56:19.020079

(""Tidewater Renewables"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSX: LCFS), owner of Canada's first renewable diesel refinery, welcomes the Government of Canada's announcement of a new Biofuels Production Incentive and support for the Canadian biofuels sector.

On September 5th, 2025, the Government of Canada announced that it intends to introduce a new Biofuels Production Incentive, a time-limited production incentive which will provide over $370 million over two years to support the stability and resiliency of domestic producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel. The Biofuels Production Incentive is expected to be provided on a per litre basis to eligible Canadian producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel and is expected to be available from January 2026 to December 2027 for up to 300 million litres per facility. Further details about the Biofuels Production Incentive are expected from Natural Resources Canada in the coming weeks.

The Corporation's renewable diesel refinery in Prince George, British Columbia is expected to produce between 150 million and 170 million litres per year during 2026 and 2027. This anticipated production positions the Corporation to benefit from the announced program and is expected to support improved cash flow and returns over the eligible period.

The Government of Canada also announced its intention to make targeted amendments to the Clean Fuel Regulations, and to work with provinces and territories to explore a more complementary approach to ensure the domestic low-carbon fuels industry thrives now and in the future.

“Canada is at a critical crossroads,” said Fred Ghatala, President of ABFC. “The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has reshaped global energy markets and created a systemic imbalance, leaving Canadian producers at a severe competitive disadvantage, even in our own domestic marketplace. Today’s announcement is welcome. It gives our domestic biofuels sector the chance not only to compete, but to grow.

This new program will help restore competitiveness for domestic producers, enabling facilities to restart operations and expand capacity, and will shore up struggling feedstock markets. The clean fuels sector continues to prove it can deliver on government priorities. At full production, Canadian biorefineries contribute $19.8 billion to the Canadian economy. With the right fiscal and policy signals, Canada’s biofuels sector, already supporting over 30,000 jobs, can by 2030 expand production to generate $44.4 billion in economic output and sustain more than 60,000 jobs.

Biofuels support Canadian farmers by turning crops like canola into clean fuels to reinforce energy security, de-risk global trade headwinds, and drive clean energy investments. Biofuels connect rural fields to urban fuels, supporting Canadian farmers while building a sustainable economic and energy future for all Canadians.”

Since the July 2022 IRA announcement, ABFC has worked closely with the government and advocated for this much-needed program. ABFC will continue to provide data and analysis to support informed, evidence-based decision-making. Today’s announcement can be viewed on the Prime Minister’s website. ABFC will provide program updates on its website as details become available.

(CLMT) has positioned itself at the intersection of this shift through its subsidiary, Montana Renewables. In 2025, the company secured a $1.44 billion federal loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to expand its renewable fuels facility, a move that underscores its ambition to become a major player in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. This loan, structured with a 15-year tenor and an interest rate of the U.S. Treasury rate plus 3/8%, is a critical catalyst for scaling production to 300 million gallons annually—a step toward aligning with the Biden-Harris administration’s SAF Grand Challenge goals of 3 billion gallons by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 [1].

Strategic Positioning in the Renewable Energy Transition

Montana Renewables’ expansion is not merely a capital play but a strategic bet on regulatory tailwinds and market demand. The facility’s focus on SAF—a fuel with a carbon footprint up to 80% lower than conventional jet fuel—positions Calumet to capitalize on tightening emissions standards and corporate sustainability pledges. According to a report by the DOE, the project is expected to create 450 construction jobs and 40 operations jobs, injecting economic vitality into Montana while advancing decarbonization [2]. This dual benefit—environmental and economic—aligns with broader policy priorities, reducing political headwinds and enhancing the loan’s viability.

However, the path to growth has not been without turbulence. In early 2025, a temporary freeze on federal loans under the Trump administration delayed $782 million of the total $1.67 billion loan guarantee. Calumet’s CEO framed the delay as a bureaucratic hiccup rather than a rejection of the project’s merits, emphasizing that the company remains “on the cusp of a transformative phase” [3]. This resilience highlights management’s commitment to long-term value creation, even amid short-term uncertainties.

Financial Strength and Operational Efficiency

The financial implications of the loan are mixed. Calumet reported a net loss of $147.9 million in Q2 2025, driven by volatile commodity prices and high operational costs, despite exceeding revenue expectations by 10.96% to $1.0266 billion [4]. Its Adjusted EBITDA fell 26% year-over-year to $55.1 million, though cost-cutting initiatives saved $42 million in the first half of 2025. The Montana Renewables segment, while reporting a negative adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million in Q2, showed progress in reducing operating costs per gallon to $0.43—a 15% improvement from 2024 [4].

The federal loan provides critical financial flexibility. Approximately $500 million of the proceeds will be allocated to debt cleanup, reducing annual cash debt service by one-third and easing liquidity constraints [5]. This deleveraging is essential for a company with a debt-to-equity ratio of -0.23 in Q2 2025—a figure complicated by a stockholder deficit but indicative of aggressive balance sheet restructuring [6]. Analysts at HC Wainwright, however, have downgraded their Q3 2025 earnings forecast to a loss of $0.57 per share, citing ongoing profitability challenges despite regulatory tailwinds [7].

Balancing Risks and Rewards

Calumet’s trajectory hinges on its ability to execute the MaxSAF project—a $1.44 billion expansion that promises to reduce capital requirements and boost production efficiency [8]. Success here would not only enhance margins but also solidify the company’s position as a top-three U.S. SAF producer by 2026. Yet risks persist: regulatory clarity on SAF credits, competition from startups leveraging advanced biofuels, and macroeconomic headwinds like interest rate volatility could test the company’s resilience.

For investors, the key question is whether Calumet’s strategic momentum offsets its near-term financial struggles. The federal loan addresses immediate liquidity needs while aligning with a $300-per-barrel carbon credit market for SAF—a structural tailwind. However, the company’s path to profitability remains contingent on operational execution and favorable policy environments.

Conclusion

Calumet Inc. embodies the dual-edged nature of the renewable energy transition: high-stakes opportunities paired with execution risks. Its federal loan is a masterstroke in accessing capital at favorable terms, but the true test lies in translating this funding into scalable, profitable operations. For now, the company’s alignment with national decarbonization goals and its progress in reducing costs provide a cautiously optimistic outlook. Yet, as with any high-growth play, patience and close monitoring of operational milestones will be essential for investors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 01:56:12.307139

XCFGlobal (NASDAQ: $SAFX) is positioned as one of the most dynamic participants in the rapidly expanding %SustainableAviationFuel (SAF) industry. For investors, the company presents rare exposure to a sector now breaking out as record prices, regulatory mandates, and tight supply conditions converge globally, including stunning new price records and margin expansions across the European SAF market as highlighted in recent indices. SAF Demand, Policy, and Rising Prices in Europe The SAF landscape has transformed dramatically in 2025. Europe, under new EU and UK mandates effective January, now requires 2% SAF blending with conventional jet fuel. This development, combined with supply limitations, has sent Northwest European (NWE) SAF prices to a 17-month high, with recent deals at $2,631 per ton as of August 28, a 30% increase in the past month alone. Remarkably, the SAF premium over traditional jet fuel has expanded to 3.7 times, underscoring an era of scarcity pricing and lucrative margins for flexible producers. Strategic Relevance of XCF Global's Operating Model With policy-driven demand outpacing supply, SAF spot market activity is robust. Producers like XCF Global, which utilize Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (%HEFA) technology, are positioned to benefit from these margin upswings. In Europe, the HEFA-SPK margin is now approximately $900 per ton, providing a powerful incentive for advanced SAF producers and their shareholders. Despite rising SAF product prices, waste feedstock costs (such as used cooking oil and tallow) have remained flat throughout August, allowing margins to expand further. For companies with secure feedstock contracts, such as XCF Global's 15-year agreement with Phillips 66, this environment enhances operational visibility and financial resilience even as global supply chains remain volatile. Supply Chain Realities and Arbitrage Dynamics European SAF production is capped by feedstock and refinery constraints, further complicated by import restrictions on renewable diesel from Asia. However, no such restrictions exist for imported SAF, which means U.S. and Asian producers can capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. Shipping data show SAF flows now originate not only from Asia but increasingly from the United States, confirming that global production platforms, such as XCF's scalable, modular U.S. and forthcoming Australian facilities will play an essential role in meeting global mandate-driven demand. Commercial Progress, Expansion, and Peer Benchmarking XCF Global commands a strategic U.S. supply position as one of only six active SAF facilities nationally, with additional sites in the pipeline and an international licensing strategy that has one MOU signed to develop the SAF market in Australia. XCF's flagship facility New Rise is in the critical ramp-up phase, a period of gradual optimization and testing that new facilities undergo before reaching full production capacity. During ramp-up, New Rise has switched to produce renewable diesel as it optimizes its production process to prepare for full-scale SAF production. The company's patent-pending site design, layout, and configuration supports rapid, cost-effective expansion timed to global demand inflections. This approach closely resembles the successful integration and margin-maximizing focus of benchmarks like %Calumet Inc. (NASDAQ: $CLMT), which has translated supply discipline and contract management into strong investor value in the U.S. renewable fuels sector. Industry Economics and the Investor Case With spot SAF prices in Europe well above both jet fuel and renewable diesel, and with mandates tightening globally, producers with flexible, scalable operations and guaranteed sales contracts are poised to benefit from outsized margins. Even as blending ratios lag behind regulatory targets (UK reported 1.345% vs 2% mandated Jan–Jun 2025), fueled demand will only intensify, boosting the urgency for new production and further propelling the premium for early movers like XCF Global. XCF Global is executing a clear-eyed growth plan. Through modular innovation, long-term offtake, and multi-regional expansion, the company is set to capture both regulatory-driven and spot market upside. Scarcity pricing, supply lags, and the spread of mandates suggest that investors seeking leveraged exposure to the %SAF upcycle should consider SAFX closely. Under the stewardship of CEO Mihir Dange, XCF Global delivers not only on vision, but combines capital discipline with the operational flexibility required as SAF transitions from a niche product to a global necessity.",,N,,2025-09-05 23:56:08.368060

The project, initially expected to produce up to 820,000 tons of fuel annually, would have been one of Europe’s largest converters of waste products into SAF. Roughly half of the output was slated for aviation use, but following a technical and commercial review, Shell concluded the facility would be “insufficiently competitive.”

Machteld de Haan, Shell’s Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions president, said the decision reflected the need to prioritize projects that balance affordability with customer demand.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders,” de Haan said in the company’s release.

She emphasized that Shell will continue to trade and supply SAF at scale through its other facilities and resources, despite halting new Rotterdam production.

The long-term deal expands deployment of technology that permanently removes hard-to-abate CO₂ via mineralisation in demolition concrete and other mineral waste streams.

Neustark already operates 38 capture and storage plants across seven European countries and plans to grow rapidly over the coming months.

The partnership complements SWISS’s existing decarbonisation efforts, including commitments to sustainable aviation fuel and collaborations with Swiss climate technology leaders such as Climeworks and Synhelion.

Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS, said: “Permanent CO₂ removal is a key building block on the path to net zero in aviation. Together, we are taking an important and early step toward scaling this technology.”

How will CO2 be captured?

Neustark’s process captures biogenic CO₂ from nearby biogas plants, liquifies it, then transports it to construction waste recycling facilities.

There, as an addition to the existing recycling workflow, CO₂ is injected into demolition granules, triggering accelerated mineralisation that binds the gas permanently within the pores and on the surface of the material.

The carbonated granules can be used to build roads or produce recycled concrete, locking away the CO₂ for hundreds of thousands of years.

For many years, Japan has allowed significant quantities of dust to accumulate across its energy landscape. However, a new broom is on its way – and could have important implications for the country’s oil refining industry.

Japanese energy demand is falling – why?

As in other developed nations, increased efficiency, deindustrialisation and a shift towards renewables are all impacting Japanese energy demand. However, in Japan a further factor is resulting in overall demand decreasing: the country’s declining population. In fact, Japan’s birth rate of just 1.14 children per woman is barely half the rate of 2.1 children per woman established as being necessary to maintain a stable population.

Could the situation change?

The Japanese government views population decline as a national crisis and has introduced reforms to try to increase the birth rate. However, other political and cultural currents – in the form of a new, more proactive approach to the country’s macroeconomic situation – may prove more important in shaping the Japanese energy landscape over the next decade.

In February of 2025, the government approved the Japan’s 7th Strategic Energy Plan, with a key focus on achieving Net Zero by 2050. The cornerstone of this new energy policy is an ‘S+3E’ approach (Safety, Energy Security, Economic Efficiency & Environment). A huge portion of S+3E relates to power generation and innovation around renewables.

Since the Plan was announced, a series of macroeconomic events have combined to boost the potential for a reset of Japan’s energy sector. Changes in the Japanese bond market in the first half of the year suggest decades of deflation are over. Meanwhile, July’s general election results indicate the electorate are in favour of Japan-first policies to improve the country’s situation. Then came the trade deal with the Unites States signed on 22 July 2025, which establishes a new relationship between the two countries

Why should anyone outside Japan care?

Japan’s approach to its energy needs matters to the rest of the world for several reasons. Firstly, Japan is the world’s fourth largest economy (arguably tied with India). Secondly, it’s home to the world’s third largest bond market after the US and China. Thirdly, it’s the world’s sixth largest consumer of refined products, competing with California (which considered on its own would be the world’s fifth largest economy) for exports from China and South Korea.

What does Japan’s current oil and refining landscape look like?

Japan’s existing oil infrastructure is well adapted to the country’s island geography, rugged terrain and frequent earthquakes. Japan has very few pipelines – instead, refined products are either produced locally or imported and distributed by ship.

Effective evaluation of Japan’s oil and refined product markets therefore relies heavily on refinery monitoring and waterborne analysis. There are currently 20 operating refineries with a capacity of 3.3 million barrels per day serving Japan’s transportation fuel market – a figure that will fall to 18 by the end of 2025. Wood Mackenzie’s Refinery Intelligence solution currently monitors 10 Japanese refineries – and will expand to cover 16 of the 18 facilities remaining at the end of 2025. We also offer a VesselTracker maritime data solution to monitor waterborne flows.

What are the current headwinds for Japan’s oil and refined products markets?

Nearly 30% of the Japanese population are aged 65 or older and the death rate is more than double the birth rate. One consequence of this is that the Japanese are ‘ageing out’ of driving, with a consequent impact on demand for fuel for transportation. Based on current population projections, we anticipate a decline in demand of 0.5% a year for petrol and 0.3% a year for diesel through to 2030.

How can the industry address lower demand?

Refurbishing Japanese refineries to match the sophistication of newer facilities in neighbouring countries is financially unviable. The industry must therefore seek a balance between which refineries geographically have the economics to survive and which must either adapt or shut down.

A key potential opportunity is to transform existing assets to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); these refined products have the best chance of being economically viable in a country that produces no oil and so must import every barrel it refines. Given what Japan has spent on fuel subsidies over the past few years, this would be the prudent path.

For the first time, the 2025 report also incorporates emissions from ATPI’s data centres, reflecting the company’s progress in expanding the scope of its reportable footprint.
To further prioritise internal sustainable initiatives, 48% of the electricity consumed in ATPI’s offices now comes from renewable sources - a 5% increase since the last report.
Louisa Toure, ATPI Group’s Sustainability Officer, said: “This year’s report demonstrates how we continue to evolve, empower and inspire through action.","Travel and events management company ATPI Group, has released its second annual review of its global activities, performance, and outcomes against key Environmental, Social and Governance reporting metrics.

The 2025 Sustainability Report covers off key reportable metrics from the 2024 calendar year, highlights strong progress in ATPI’s carbon reduction efforts.

The company achieved a 25% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, alongside an 11% reduction in total emissions per full-time employee (FTE), from 1.86 tonnes of Co2e in 2023 to 1.65 tonnes in 2024.

During this period, ATPI also introduced an internal carbon price to accelerate its decarbonisation strategy.

This initiative not only helps to drive carbon reduction but also allows ATPI to continually reinvest in decarbonisation and compensation activities. Additionally, the Group compensated 100% of its residual emissions through a diverse portfolio of internationally recognised, high-integrity carbon offset projects.

In 2024, this included investments in new initiatives such as the Biomass Everest Starch Facility in India and the Envira Amazonia REDD+ project in Brazil, alongside a wider range of projects supporting global climate action.

Corporate travel remains essential for global business and connectivity, however aviation accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global CO2 emissions.

Recognising this as a priority sector for decarbonisation, ATPI has invested in 75 tonnes of SAF since the start of this reporting period, representing 5% of ATPI’s business travel emissions from the previous year.

This has been achieved through the company’s partnership with NESTE, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel. For the first time, the 2025 report also incorporates emissions from ATPI’s data centres, reflecting the company’s progress in expanding the scope of its reportable footprint.

To further prioritise internal sustainable initiatives, 48% of the electricity consumed in ATPI’s offices now comes from renewable sources - a 5% increase since the last report.

ATPI has also accelerated the transition of its company car fleet to electric and hybrid models, with 38% of its vehicles updated, up from 29% in the previous year.

Louisa Toure, ATPI Group’s Sustainability Officer, said: “This year’s report demonstrates how we continue to evolve, empower and inspire through action.

“We’ve reduced our impact, strengthened our culture, and empowered clients to travel more responsibly.

“I’m proud of how our people are driving this momentum, but our ambition doesn’t stop here, we are determined to evolve further and lead the way in shaping the future of sustainable travel.”

ATPI’s social sustainability supports its employees while aligning with the company’s wider goals. To strengthen transparency and accountability, ATPI introduced a new global staff database to enhance reporting, provide greater insights into its workforce, and enable meaningful action.

The report highlights that staff numbers grew by 8%, with women representing 60% and men 40% across the Group’s workforce globally. While the travel industry has been traditionally female-dominated, ATPI is committed to embedding equality of opportunity throughout its culture and organisational structure.

The company also continues to outperform global benchmarks on pay equality. Against an estimated global gender pay gap of 20%, ATPI reports a gap of just 9.9% in favour of males.

Social sustainability also took centre stage in 2024 with the launch of ATPI Inspires, a business-wide initiative focused on volunteering, wellbeing and community engagement. Employees dedicated 1,276 hours to volunteering through the programme, bringing ATPI’s value of “Show your kindness” to life across its global network.

This people-first approach is also reflected in the Group’s Global People Survey, which found that 81% of employees feel they have access to the learning and development needed to do their jobs effectively, 89% believe they clearly understand how their work contributes to ATPI’s broader goals, and 77% have a good understanding of what ATPI’s sustainability programme is trying to achieve.

Ian Sinderson, ATPI Group’s Chief Executive Officer added: “2024 was a dynamic year for ATPI. We continued to grow across the regions, embracing both the challenges and opportunities that come with a rapidly evolving travel landscape.

“As climate-related events such as extreme weather and shifting environmental conditions increasingly impacting travel, ATPI is committed to leading by example and guiding our clients toward smarter, more sustainable choices.”

“Our values shape our behaviour and decision-making, and by staying true to them, we strengthen ATPI’s identity, foster a positive culture, and lay the groundwork for long-term success.”","http://www.travolution.com/dynamic-images/29000-29999/29593/29593_c=(0,71,1000,525)_w=1200_h=630.webp?v=20230522122229",N,,2025-09-05 20:56:10.416453

The Red Arrows will, for the first time at a non-military air show, use Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Aviation enthusiasts are in for a world first at the International Ayr Show – Festival of Flight later this afternoon, Friday, September 5.

The Red Arrows will take to the skies above Ayr Low Green using a combination of sustainable fuels for the first time at a non-military air show.

Officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows will be powered by a 15 per cent blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The team will also use Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), a plant-based version of jet fuel and diesel, to produce their distinctive vapour trails.

As a result, the team will perform their signature aerobatics display in the skies above Ayrshire with a ""significantly reduced carbon footprint"".

It has been hailed as ""an exciting moment in the RAF’s history"" and the display will mark the first time ever that both SAF and HVO will be used at a non-military event.

South Ayrshire Council ’s director of communities and transformation, Jane Bradley, said: “We are thrilled to be part of this Scottish and world-first display at a non-military event.

Chief executive officer of theSKYLAB, Dr Geoff Coxon, said: “theSKYLAB has helped create history with the Red Arrows to enable the first ever non-military event featuring a jet display using both sustainable aviation fuel and HVO for the coloured smoke.

“This is an amazing way to celebrate the positive impact of STEM and will showcase to the world that Scotland and South Ayrshire are ready to deliver the technologies of tomorrow for a sustainable aerospace industry.

“We are extremely proud to have been able to achieve this for the International Ayr Show – Festival of Flight.”

Squadron Leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ senior engineering officer and who has led the pioneering fuels project for the team, said: “It is incredible to mark another world-first milestone in our decarbonisation journey at the International Ayr Show – Festival of Flight.

“Given the event’s strong focus on STEM, the location is a very natural setting to showcase this development and hopefully inspire future generations of innovators, engineers and aviators.

“Having been passionate and involved in our project from its outset earlier this year, it’s a privilege to work alongside theSKYLAB and South Ayrshire Council to turn a vision into reality.

“Alongside the benefits of SAF to emissions, the 100 per cent HVO vapour is our star-of-the-show and we remain the only display team worldwide using a bio-smoke to produce our distinctive, trademark trails.

“This project represents the very best of RAF innovation in STEM, our ability to be agile and to make changes rapidly – better-securing our future energy supplies and representing a fast-growing UK industry.”

The project led by Sqn Ldr King, to provide the Red Arrows with the ability to switch to the new fuels, was carried out in less than six months and done entirely with existing resources and people.

These studies culminated in a successful trial flight before being showcased at two public events earlier this year – an RAF flypast for King Charles III and at an air tattoo in Gloucestershire, staged at a military airbase.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, for example, called the development a “huge win for America’s farmers & ranchers,” on her X account, adding she’ll be in Japan soon to build on this agreement.

The American Soybean Association (ASA) welcomes the stronger partnership with Japan.

U.S. farmers require market access, which this trade agreement provides, said Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA.

“Reliable agreements like this not only strengthen markets for U.S. soy and keep America’s farm families a priority, but also help our farmers remain competitive in the global marketplace,” he said in a Sept. 5 statement.

In addition, Japan agreed to a 15 percent tariff on car imports into the U.S., and to invest $550 billion in U.S. projects.

It could use its prestige not to give cover to fossil fuel interests, but to lead the charge toward a sustainable future.","For a quarter of a century, Princeton University partnered with one of the world’s biggest oil and gas giants, BP. The alliance poured money into the University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI), one of its most prominent climate research programs. On the surface, the deal brought prestige and resources. In reality, critics argue that it delayed the urgent work of phasing out fossil fuels.

Now, the partnership is ending, as reported by The Daily Princetonian. When the current contract expires in 2025, BP will no longer fund CMI. Both sides insist it’s a mutual decision, but the move comes after years of growing criticism, student protests, and investigations that raised serious questions about how fossil fuel companies use academia to protect their business model.

A Deal That Shaped Climate Research

The report further explained: when Princeton struck its deal with BP back in 2000, it was framed as a groundbreaking collaboration. BP’s funding supported research into carbon capture, storage, alternative fuels, and other mitigation strategies.

CMI quickly became one of the University’s flagship institutes, producing influential studies like the Net Zero America report, which mapped possible pathways for the U.S. to achieve net zero by 2050.

Of the five modeled scenarios, four kept fossil fuels in play through mid-century, relying heavily on carbon capture to offset emissions. Critics later pointed out that this conclusion closely mirrored BP’s corporate strategy: continue pumping oil and gas while showcasing carbon capture as a lifeline.

At the time, renewable energy was less developed and more expensive than today. But as wind, solar, geothermal, and battery technologies advanced rapidly, the wisdom of pouring billions into carbon capture began to look like a stalling tactic.

Prestige for BP, Problems for Princeton

For BP, the partnership was a communications jackpot. Having Princeton’s name attached to its climate efforts gave the company a veneer of credibility, even as it expanded drilling and exploration. Internal communications later revealed how BP staff highlighted Princeton’s research to bolster its case for carbon capture and hydrogen in U.S. policy circles.

For Princeton, the financial support was significant, but the cost was reputational. As the climate crisis worsened, the University found itself increasingly criticized for giving BP legitimacy. By 2022, Princeton announced it would divest from fossil fuels, yet the BP relationship remained—an uncomfortable contradiction for a campus under growing activist pressure.

Net Zero: Whose Roadmap?

The partnership’s most contested legacy is the Net Zero America report. Funded by BP and Exxon, the study leaned heavily on carbon capture and fossil fuels. Just five months later, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued its own net-zero roadmap, independent of fossil fuel influence.

The IEA’s message was blunt: no new investments in fossil fuel projects could be made if the world hoped to stay within 1.5°C of warming. The sharp contrast between Princeton’s BP-backed report and the IEA’s independent findings laid bare the risks of corporate-funded science.

Investigations Pull Back the Curtain

The true extent of BP’s influence came into sharper focus in 2024. A congressional investigation concluded that BP leveraged its Princeton ties to promote policies that aligned with its long-term strategy rather than committing to large-scale renewable investments.

The investigation found that BP not only shaped the narrative around carbon capture but also used the partnership to influence how energy and emissions policies were discussed in Washington. For student groups like Sunrise Princeton and Divest Princeton, this confirmed what they had warned for years: the partnership was less about science and more about extending the fossil fuel era.

Is Fossil Fuel Money Too Toxic for Academia?

Princeton is hardly alone. We discovered that a 2023 report by Data for Progress and Fossil Free Research revealed that fossil fuel companies funneled more than $675 million into 27 U.S. universities between 2010 and 2020. The University of California, Berkeley topped the list with $154 million, followed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ($108 million) and George Mason University ($64 million).

The debate over whether universities should accept fossil fuel funding is complex. Supporters argue that oil and gas companies bring valuable expertise, particularly in areas like carbon storage, green hydrogen, or sustainable aviation fuel. They say tapping into that knowledge can accelerate decarbonization.

Critics counter that these partnerships are inherently compromised. Any research tied to fossil fuel dollars risks being skewed toward preserving oil and gas interests. The history of tobacco industry funding of medical research is often cited as a warning: money from industries whose business models depend on harmful practices should not dictate academic inquiry.

What’s clear is that fossil fuel money buys more than just lab equipment—it buys influence, legitimacy, and access to future policymakers. That’s a trade-off many now say is too high a price to pay.

From Princeton to Harvard: BP’s Quiet Academic Powerplay

BP’s influence extended beyond Princeton. Documents show the company paid between $2.1 million and $2.6 million to CMI between 2012 and 2017. It also funded programs at Harvard and Tufts, contributing hundreds of thousands annually to policy-focused research. Harvard’s Kennedy School and Tufts’s Fletcher School, both heavily tied to government policymaking, received funds earmarked for climate policy labs.

The report noted that these partnerships gave BP access not just to research, but also to future policymakers—a revolving door that helped the company shape long-term political outcomes.

Princeton’s Climate Work Seeks New Lifelines

The end of BP’s sponsorship comes as Princeton faces broader challenges in securing climate research funding. In mid-2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce cut $4 million earmarked for University climate programs, claiming they no longer aligned with federal priorities.

Professor Stephen Pacala, CMI’s director, acknowledged that the termination of BP’s support will reduce funding for some projects and end the annual BP-Princeton conference, but he emphasized that the work will continue with other backers. Professor Jonathan Levine, a lead investigator, echoed that sentiment, noting that the research pillars will remain intact but under new funding models.

Student Demands for Real Leadership

With BP now stepping back, Princeton students and climate activists see an opening for change. Divest Princeton has called on the University to:

Cut all ties with fossil fuel companies.

Offer pension plans free of fossil fuel exposure.

Introduce an undergraduate climate crisis course requirement.

Make campus operations a model of sustainability, from dining halls to reunions.

Acknowledge and address harms inflicted on frontline communities impacted by fossil fuels.

To them, Princeton has lagged on sustainability, and its long partnership with BP represents decades of lost opportunity. Instead of backing bold renewable solutions already proven at scale—solar, wind, geothermal, and battery storage—Princeton, they argue, gave BP the cover it needed to keep selling fossil fuels.

A Chance for Princeton to Reset

The end of Princeton’s BP partnership represents more than just the expiration of a contract. It’s a moment of reckoning for the University, and a chance to redefine its role in the global energy transition.

Princeton could choose to double down on independent, transparent climate research that focuses on accelerating renewable deployment, scaling storage, and building resilient, low-carbon systems. It could use its prestige not to give cover to fossil fuel interests, but to lead the charge toward a sustainable future.

Whether Princeton seizes this opportunity or clings to the legacy of a 25-year deal that many see as a costly mistake. Nonetheless, it will send a powerful signal about the role of higher education in solving the climate crisis.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2448299557.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:56:19.806333

On Sept. 4, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to enact a trade agreement with Japan, which will increase agricultural sales in the United States by $8 billion a year and secure a $550 billion investment in U.S. goods on behalf of Japan. In addition to the promised investment, the order announced a baseline 15% tariff on most Japanese imports to the U.S.

The White House stated it believes this agreement, “will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.” The agreement is a positive for agriculture, which has struggled in recent months with low commodity prices and tariff woes. The rice, corn and soybean industries are poised to receive the largest boost out of the deal.

“Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products,” read an excerpt from the executive order.

According to the American Soybean Association, in 2024, the U.S. soybean industry exported 52% of its total production, but this agreement could allow expansion and stronger demand within Japan.

“This news comes at a critical time as U.S. soybean farmers begin harvest,” said ASA President Caleb Ragland. “We appreciate President Trump prioritizing agriculture in trade negotiations with key partners like Japan and urge the Administration to finalize additional trade deals in the weeks ahead. Reliable agreements like this not only strengthen markets for U.S. soy and keep America’s farm families a priority but also help our farmers remain competitive in the global marketplace.”

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins will head to Japan in the next few weeks and communicate with buyers and to ensure that farm products can be sold and shipped as soon as possible. Rollins said in the long term, this deal was a big step forward for rural prosperity and sustainability for farmers and ranchers.

“We’ve talked a lot about China being one of our biggest buyers for some of these commodities, and certainly we need China, but we have to look to other areas of the world,” Rollins said in an RFDTV interview.

But beyond economics, fuel is now central to environmental strategy. Airlines are under increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and passengers to decarbonize their operations and lead the transition to net-zero emissions.

Key strategies include:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Airlines are entering long-term purchase agreements, supporting industry coalitions, and advocating for policy incentives to scale production and reduce costs.

Fleet Modernization: New aircraft models like the Airbus A321XLR and Boeing 787 Dreamliner offer significant fuel efficiency gains. Retrofitting existing fleets with aerodynamic enhancements and lightweight materials further reduces emissions.

Operational Efficiency: Airlines are optimizing flight paths, reducing taxi times, and implementing single-engine taxiing. These initiatives, coordinated with air traffic control and powered by real-time data, cut fuel consumption without compromising service.

Passenger Engagement: Sustainability-linked loyalty programs, transparent emissions reporting, and carbon offset options are helping airlines build brand trust and align with eco-conscious travelers.

Both airlines and airports are increasingly focused on climate adaptation. Rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, and severe storms are already disrupting operations. Future-proofing infrastructure is no longer optional—it’s essential.

Airports are conducting climate risk assessments and integrating resilience into capital planning through:

Elevated terminals and floodproofing in vulnerable areas.

Backup energy systems and microgrids for continuity during outages.

Heat-resilient materials and shade structures to protect assets.

Redundant communications and control systems for rapid response.

Airlines, meanwhile, are factoring climate risk into route planning, fleet deployment, and operational contingencies.

Sustainability is no longer a siloed initiative—it’s a shared responsibility across the aviation ecosystem. Airlines and airports must collaborate to align strategies, share data, and co-invest in technologies that reduce emissions and enhance resilience.

Moving forward, this flagship event will be held annually to advance the India’s vision of green aviation”, said Mr. Rohit Kumar, Secretary General, SAF Association.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the next frontier in India's clean energy transition. As we’ve led globally in solar, now is the time to lead in decarbonizing aviation. With the right innovation and policy support, India can become a global hub for SAF, empowering both our environment and economy”, Dr. Ajay Mathur, Former Director General, International Solar Alliance.

Why attend?

As the third-largest aviation market in the world, India is at a critical juncture. The need for sustainable aviation solutions has never been greater. SAF can reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, and India’s vast agricultural feedstock and innovation potential make it the perfect launchpad.

“We are still very much convinced that hydrogen has a really important part to play in aviation,” Reynolds told delegates. “We are still investing, we still see this as a really fundamental part of the future. We are still absolutely committed to SAF [sustainable aviation fuel].”

While hydrogen will be part of aviation’s future, it will have a “bigger and bigger part” beyond 2050, he adds.

“We want it to be ready by 2035, [but] we don’t think the hydrogen economy generally is going to reach the level we had hoped it would by 2035,” Reynolds points out. “We think it’s something like five to ten years behind where we had hoped. But we still see it coming, and we still want to be ready when the hydrogen economy is ready.”

According to the executive, Airbus is making “tremendous progress” and investing “triple-digit millions” every year in the technology. The company is also collaborating with airports and regulatory bodies globally, as well as building hubs in countries including the UK, Japan, Korea, the US, and Australia.

Japan also agrees to accept U.S. automobiles without additional safety testing requirements and bill buy U.S.-made commercial aircraft and military equipment.","President Trump on Thursday signed an order to implement a trade agreement with Japan that is expected to increase U.S. agricultural sales by $8 billion a year.

Over the past five years, Japan has bought on average just under $12.9 billion in annual farm goods from the U.S.

In detailing the agreement, the White House cited, ""Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.""

Those investments will be chosen by the U.S. government and are expected to ""generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.""

Spelling out agricultural trade, the order stated, ""Specifically, the government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements within the minimum access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year.""

Rice sales to Japan average more than $300 million a year in value, and are currently up 16% in 2025 compared to last year.

USA Rice commented, ""We appreciate the President's efforts to expand markets for U.S. rice and we look forward to working with our partners in Japan to increase our market access in what is already a top 5 market for our exporters, and to participating in the remaining FY2025 rice tenders that predate these latest announcements.""

While noting the sales of sustainable aviation fuels, the U.S. last year only produced about 20 million gallons. Japan has a goal to use 10% SAF fuel in its commercial airlines by 2030.

The American Soybean Association said the agreement ""helps further secure a top ten market for our crop. In Marketing Year 2023/2024, Japan imported $1.31 billion of U.S. soy products, making the country U.S. soy's sixth largest trading partner by volume, according to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service.""

""This news comes at a critical time as U.S. soybean farmers begin harvest,"" said ASA President and Kentucky farmer Caleb Ragland. ""We appreciate President Trump prioritizing agriculture in trade negotiations with key partners like Japan, and urge the administration to finalize additional trade deals in the weeks ahead. Reliable agreements like this not only strengthen markets for U.S. soy and keep America's farm families a priority, but also help our farmers remain competitive in the global marketplace.""

Under the deal, the U.S. will set a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports to the U.S., though there will be separate sector tariffs for automobiles and auto parts, aerospace products, generic pharmaceuticals, and some natural resources.

Japan also agrees to accept U.S. automobiles without additional safety testing requirements and bill buy U.S.-made commercial aircraft and military equipment.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, in a social media post, called the deal a ""HUGE win for America's farmers & ranchers."" Rollins indicated she would be traveling to Japan in the next few weeks.

SHELL has cancelled construction of its flagship biofuels plant in Rotterdam, shelving plans to produce 820,000 t/y of sustainable fuels from waste oils and animal fats – just three years after breaking ground.

First announced in 2021, the plant was intended to form part of Shell’s “powering progress” strategy of converting former refineries into new energy and chemicals facilities. Construction began in 2022 at Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam, on the site of the former Pernis refinery, but was paused in July 2024.

The company had planned to use cooking oil and waste animal fats as primary feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel, while capturing production emissions through the Dutch Porthos carbon capture and storage project.

However, Shell now says the investment is “insufficiently competitive”. The move mirrors a similar decision from Shell in March 2023 to shelve a project to build a 550,000 t/y SAF plant in Singapore.

The decision to scrap the Rotterdam plant is the latest in a string of moves from fossil fuel producers rowing back on commitments to cleaner energy. In February, bp announced plans to slash its investment in renewables while ramping up oil and gas investment by 20%. This followed a similar move from Equinor. Shell itself came under fire in March 2024 after diluting its targets for emissions intensity reductions from 20% by 2030 to 15–20%.

Machteld de Haan, president of downstream, renewables and energy solutions at Shell, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders. We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system.”

Shell remains one of the largest biofuel producers in the world, making 10.37bn L of biofuels in 2024. Nonetheless, biofuels form a very small share of its global business, contributing less than 0.1% of its US$289bn revenue last year. Shell also spent US$2.94bn on compliance certificates under government schemes requiring a portion of fuel sales to be renewable – more than ten times the company’s revenue from biofuels.

Starting with a feasibility study, this marks the first step toward exploring a new methanol-based route to electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) and low-carbon chemicals in Europe.

A group of GIC member companies have joined forces to evaluate the technical and economic potential of using methanol-to-olefins (MTO) technology as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based production processes.

The group will assess the viability of converting sustainable methanol into olefins, the essential building blocks of fuels and advanced materials. The newly formed spin-off structure is designed to facilitate deeper collaboration, explore investment, and prepare the groundwork for potential project development.

“Transforming how we produce essential building blocks like olefins is key to reducing emissions in the chemical sector and related value chains, such as aviation” said Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition. “The announcement today signals the growing momentum toward transforming the global chemical sector at a time when new technologies are urgently needed to meet climate and business goals.”

Formalizing the agreement between the U.S. and a key Asian ally comes after months of negotiations, reduces uncertainty for the massive Japanese auto sector and confirms an agreement for $550 billion of Japanese investment in U.S. projects.

The lower tariffs on Japanese autos are set to take effect seven days after publication of the order. Some of the tariff relief is retroactive to August 7.

Trump's order also means a reduced U.S. tariff rate on Japanese cars, from the current 27.5% to 15%, is set to take effect by the end of this month, Reuters reported earlier, citing a Japanese government source.

Trump's levies on global shipments have hit Japanese carmakers hard. Last month, Toyota said it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion from Trump's tariffs on cars imported into the United States.

""Finally,"" Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's top trade negotiator, posted to X, in a nod to the months-long trade talks that had frustrated lawmakers in Tokyo. Thursday marked his 10th trip to the U.S. for the negotiations.

Toyota praised Trump's efforts to reach a trade deal with Japan. ""While nearly 80% of the vehicles Toyota sells in the U.S. are made in North America, this framework provides much needed clarity,"" the company said in a statement.

Trump's order says Japan is ""working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements... and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel)"" and other U.S. products totaling $8 billion per year.

As part of the deal, Japan will buy 100 Boeing planes and hike defense spending with U.S. firms to $17 billion annually, from $14 billion, the White House said in July.

Japan said in July the share of U.S. rice imports may increase under its existing framework but that the agreement did ""not sacrifice"" Japanese agriculture.

Trump's order Thursday also reiterates the Japanese government has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States in projects that will be selected by the U.S. government.

Two-way trade between the two countries reached nearly $230 billion in 2024, with Japan running a trade surplus of nearly $70 billion.

The United States in July agreed to lower tariffs on imports of Japanese automobiles but the timing remains unclear as Trump had yet to sign an executive order.

Japan has said the trade deal ensures the U.S.'s fifth-largest trading partner will always receive the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals of all the pacts negotiated by Washington. It also includes no tariffs on commercial airplanes and parts.

The executive order is also expected to include provisions that the 15% levy agreed in July would not be stacked on Japanese imports that are subject to higher tariffs, while items previously subject to less than 15% tariffs would be adjusted to 15%, the source said.

The investment package, which will come in the form of equity, loans and guarantees from Japan's government-owned banks, was agreed as part of the July trade deal.

The European Union secured a 15% baseline tariff as part of a framework trade deal with the U.S. in July, averting looming new tariffs on chips and pharmaceuticals.

The trial, set to run for at least six months, marks the first industrial demonstration of Nuada’s technology in the EfW sector and represents an important step in both companies’ decarbonisation strategies.

Enfinium, one of the UK’s leading EfW operators, views the project as a milestone towards deploying carbon capture and storage (CCS) at scale across its six facilities.

“Waste producers must pay for their CO2,” Mike Mau | RSS.com

Simon Forshaw, VP Engineering & Construction at enfinium, stated: “Deploying waste to energy carbon capture at scale is critical to decarbonise the UK’s unrecyclable waste and generate the carbon removals needed to achieve net zero.

With EfW responsible for processing millions of metric tons of residual waste every year, integrating CCS has the potential to transform the sector into a source of large-scale carbon removals.

Pioneering Metal-Organic Framework Technology

At the heart of the pilot is Nuada’s use of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials, which separate CO2 from flue gases using a vacuum swing process. This approach promises higher efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to conventional capture systems, strengthening its potential for commercial deployment.

EfW is uniquely positioned to deliver negative emissions. Roughly half of the residual waste stream is biogenic, which has already absorbed CO2 during its lifecycle.

By capturing and storing this biogenic carbon, EfW facilities can achieve permanent removals rather than emissions, a capability increasingly recognised by policymakers and industry.

Relevant: enfinium Has Selected Isometric As Its Carbon Registry Partner On Project Parc Adfer

Dr Conor Hamill, co-CEO of Nuada, commented: “We believe that CCUS innovation like ours can help the EfW sector to efficiently unlock value from an existing waste stream CO2.”

The Climate Change Committee and The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies estimate that EfW could contribute between 5 and 8 million tonnes of CO2 removals annually by 2050.

Scaling technologies such as Nuada’s will therefore be central to meeting the UK’s net zero commitments while decarbonizing essential waste infrastructure.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/small4web-8591.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 08:56:14.099211

Air Côte d’Ivoire takes delivery of first A330neo aircraft

Air Côte d’Ivoire, the national flag carrier of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, has taken delivery of the first of its two Airbus A330-900 aircraft.

The A330neo is the first widebody aircraft to join Air Côte d’Ivoire’s fleet and is configured in a four-class layout, offering four seats in First, 44 in Business, 21 in Premium Economy and 173 in Economy. The airline is the leading carrier in West and Central Africa, serving 22 destinations across the continent. The A330-900 will play a central role in Air Côte d’Ivoire’s expansion into long-haul markets, beginning with Paris, followed by routes to the Middle East and North America.

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first A330neo delivery flight from Toulouse to Abidjan carried five tonnes of humanitarian aid, including equipment and school supplies. This was the airline’s third goodwill flight, organised in partnership with the Airbus Foundation and supported by Aviation Sans Frontières, which provided the donations. The supplies were distributed to two local NGOs, LifeShine and La Bienfaisance, to directly support their health and education initiatives in Abidjan.

By the end of July 2025, the A330 Family had secured more than 1,920 firm orders from over 130 customers worldwide. Like all Airbus aircraft, the A330neo is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for its entire aircraft range to be 100% SAF-capable by 2030.

The development of palm oil substitute

Through a double fermentation process, carbon gases are converted first into alcohol and then into a fat similar to palm oil. The process uses non-genetically modified oleaginous yeasts. Laboratory tests and validations in the cosmetics industry show that this substitute can be integrated into existing supply chains.

The Mibelle Group has confirmed that the new material replicates characteristics of palm oil used in cosmetics. At the same time, the technology opens up the possibility of producing sustainable aviation fuel(SAF) through the HEFA route, diversifying raw materials and reducing the risks associated with traditional vegetable oils.

The versatility of LanzaTech’ s platform allows for both the production of production of PBS through the ATJ pathway as well as through HEFA. This provides airlines and energy producers with a wider range of options to achieve climate neutrality goals. In addition, the integration of this innovation with the circular carbon economy offers a replicable approach for high-emission sectors.

The project is being scaled up at the Fraunhofer Center for Chemical and Biotechnological Processes in Leuna. The goal is to bring production to commercial levels and demonstrate that sustainable palm oil replacement can be viable on a large scale, both in cosmetics and fuels.

The Atlanta-based US legacy carrier and SkyTeam founding member teamed up with Shell to make this possible.

The move saw hundreds of thousands of gallons of US-made SAF delivered to Portland International, with this particular milestone marking the first commercial-scale uplift of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at the airport. Going forward, it will boost both Delta's sustainability credentials and PDX's ability to capitalize on SAF growth.

Portland's First Commercial-Scale SAF Uplift

As announced in a statement released yesterday by Delta Air Lines, the carrier has teamed up with Shell to take delivery of more than 400,000 gallons of SAF into the fuel system at Portland International Airport. Made in the US from waste-derived feedstock, the SAF was subjected to complex logistical procedures.

Indeed, Delta explains that, after the neat SAF was shipped by Shell to Portland's Zenith Terminal, it had to be ""blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck, and pipeline."" Having been blended, the SAF was then able to enter the airport's fuel system. Charlotte Lollar, who serves as Delta Air Lines' SAF Director, welcomed the milestone, explaining:

""Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel. By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.""

Delta Air Lines Is Hoping To Be Able To Grow The SAF Market In Portland

While Sustainable Aviation Fuel has widely been touted as an ideal shorter-term solution as airlines and airports around the world race to get their carbon emissions down to net-zero by 2050, one of its main shortcomings thus far has been its scalability. As such, deals such as this one between Delta Air Lines and Shell in Portland are playing an important role in ensuring that SAF is more widely available.

Indeed, the carrier explains that, as well as growing its own footprint as far as Sustainable Aviation Fuel is concerned, it will also enable Portland International Airport to ""capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the US."" On a local level, Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger explains that the rollout of SAF will ""improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.""

As previously noted, Delta's recent 400,000-gallon delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in partnership with Shell marked the first commercial-scale uplift at Portland International Airport. However, the carrier doesn't want this to be a one-off, and explains that it ""is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland.""

The Carrier Has Made Several Other Major Investments In SAF Over The Years

According to the International Air Transport Association ( IATA), SAF currently accounts for almost two-thirds of the overall strategy when it comes to getting the commercial aviation industry down to net-zero carbon emissions. With this in mind, key players like Delta have long been front and center with this initiative.

LATHAM — Plug Power, Inc. posted second-quarter results that show both stronger sales and signs of financial discipline as the Latham-based hydrogen company pursues its turnaround strategy.

Despite a net loss of $227 million for the quarter, Plug’s leadership reaffirmed a goal of reaching gross margin breakeven by the fourth quarter of 2025. The company said that continued cost controls, higher service performance, and expanding electrolyzer sales are central to that milestone.

The company reported $174 million in revenue for the quarter ending June 30, a 21 percent increase over the same period last year. Growth was driven by rising demand across its product lines, including GenDrive fuel cells, GenFuel hydrogen infrastructure, and its GenEco electrolyzer platform. Electrolyzer sales alone tripled year-over-year, bringing in approximately $45 million as Plug expanded its global footprint.

Gross margins improved sharply to -31 percent compared to -92 percent in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting lower service costs, equipment improvements, and better hydrogen pricing. Much of the shift is tied to “Project Quantum Leap,” a company-wide cost restructuring that reduced workforce and facility expenses, cut professional services, and secured new supply agreements expected to lower hydrogen costs later this year.

Plug recorded about $80 million in non-cash charges related to the restructuring, up from $6 million the prior year. Even with those charges, the company reduced its net cash use for operations and investments by more than 40 percent year-over-year.

At quarter’s end, Plug reported $140 million in unrestricted cash on hand and access to more than $300 million in additional debt capacity. Management also pointed to the value of recently clarified federal tax credits for clean hydrogen production and fuel cells, which they expect to monetize under Sections 45V and 48E of the tax code.

Operationally, Plug continues to pursue scale. More than 230 megawatts of GenEco electrolyzers are being deployed across Europe, Australia, and North America, including a record-setting hydrogen production run at its Georgia facility this spring. Executives said the systems are increasingly becoming the “platform of choice” for industrial applications ranging from steel and cement to semiconductors.

The company also sees momentum in its material handling business, where an extension of the Investment Tax Credit through 2026 is expected to boost demand for GenDrive fuel cells. Additional growth is projected from Plug’s Energy Transition division, which leverages its liquefier and skid-packaging expertise to support renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel projects.

Plug employs more than 2,000 people globally and operates hydrogen plants in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana with a combined daily production capacity of 40 tons.

Regardless of its role in researching such current matters, the ALECSys program marks the end of the road for Hefty Bee.
Rolls-Royce told AeroTime that the company plans to continue using “a blend of flying test beds and ground test facilities in the future”.
It is not yet known which specific aircraft the engine maker plans to use as future flying test beds.","On July 9, 2025, one of the most peculiar jumbo jets to ever take to the sky was withdrawn from service after a distinguished career spanning 45 years. Although it first flew as an airliner, for the last two decades this aircraft’s mission has had nothing to do with carrying passengers or cargo.

Since 2005, the aircraft, officially called the “Spirit of Excellence”, a Boeing B747-200 with registration N787RR, was operated by none other than British engine maker Rolls-Royce, which used it as a Flying Test Bed or FTB.

A flying test bed is in essence a flying laboratory that allows engineers to test new engine types in all sorts of real operational environments.

The aircraft, nicknamed “Hefty Bee”, was specially configured to carry a supplementary engine mount so that new engine types can be tested in real flight conditions while preserving full propulsion redundancy. This means that one of the aircraft’s wings carries three engines instead of the usual two, for a total of five.

The aircraft cabin was fitted with instruments capable of collecting large amounts of data about the engine’s performance in flight.

From airliner to flying laboratory

At the time of its retirement, Hefty Bee was one of only 15 other active B747-200s left in the world.

Its first operator was Cathay Pacific, back in 1980. The aircraft was operated by the Hong Kong-based carrier until 1999, when it was acquired by ACMI and cargo operator Air Atlanta Icelandic and its subsidiary Air Atlanta Europe until its acquisition by Rolls-Royce in 2005.

Shortly after its acquisition by the engine maker, Hefty Bee underwent a thorough transformation at L-3 Communications (later rebranded as L3Harris) in Texas, United States, in order to be able to fulfill its new, specialized role.

Hefty Bee’s first, and perhaps most prominent mission, was to test the Trent 1000 engine, designed specifically to power the, what was then new and revolutionary, Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

However, the aircraft’s useful life did not end with the Trent 1000’s entry into service in 2011. By mid-2025, Hefty Bee’s service record included 250 flights and 800 flying hours, 10 and five times more, respectively, than the 25 flights and 150 flight hours that had originally been planned by Rolls-Royce. In fact, the British engine ended up doubling the aircraft’s use rate from two to four flights per week.

The need to keep working on the Trent 1000 program after some operators reported reliability issues and premature blade corrosion, ensured that Hefty Bee would continue to be engaged in the successive development and update of this engine type.

But Rolls-Royce’s unique B747 also took part in other notable engine research programs. More recently, the smaller Pearl 10 engine, developed by the British engine maker to power the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet, has also used Hefty Bee as a test bank. Rolls-Royce tested the specially modified B747 between May and October 2024.

Some of those test flights were performed using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). However, this was not a first for Hefty Bee. The aircraft had already completed a 100% SAF flight test in 2021 although on that occasion it was using a Trent 1000 instead of a Pearl 10 engine.

In a written response to AeroTime’s questions about the recent missions undertaken by Hefty Bee, Rolls-Royce highlighted the aircraft’s central role in the firm’s commitment towards sustainable aviation.

“It made history in 2021 by flying a Trent 1000 powered entirely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel. More recently it played a key role in the certification of the durability enhancement package to more than double time on wing for that engine, part of a wider £1bn investment,” the statement read. “Its final mission, completed in July 2025, supported our Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, marking a significant step towards delivering more efficient and sustainable engines.”

The statement referred to an ongoing research program, backed by the EU’s Clean Sky initiative and the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), which aims to lower the environmental footprint of aircraft engines by making the fuel burning process more efficient by pre-mixing fuel and air.

Regardless of its role in researching such current matters, the ALECSys program marks the end of the road for Hefty Bee.

What next for Hefty Bee?

The aircraft has been donated to the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, right next to what has been its base for the last two decades. There it will join another jumbo jet N747GE, a Boeing 747-100 which was used by Rolls-Royce’s competitor GE Aerospace as a test bank between 1992 and 2017.

Rolls-Royce had long been preparing for Hefty Bee’s retirement. In 2019, the engine maker even acquired another jumbo jet, a much newer B747-400, registration N747RR, previously operated by Australian airline Qantas.

In a surprising move, though, Rolls-Royce cancelled a project to transform N747RR into another flying test bed in 2022 and sent the aircraft to be scrapped.

The engine maker, which has spent the last few years immersed in a major turnaround, has stated its willingness to use a mix of platforms and processes to test its new engines going forward.

Rolls-Royce told AeroTime that the company plans to continue using “a blend of flying test beds and ground test facilities in the future”.

It is not yet known which specific aircraft the engine maker plans to use as future flying test beds. However, it seems likely that its engine programs, such as the UltraFan technology which Rolls-Royce is developing for the Trent family, will see increased reliance on ground testing and simulators in the near future.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/08/53616604336_dfc351c087_k.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 04:56:33.455732

Airbus' new narrowbody, the A220, won't be helping their concerns. It is a clean-sheet design set to outperform its rivals in a number of metrics.

In this article, discover how Airbus has designed the A220 to dominate its competition, along with the challenges it faces and how the aircraft will continue to develop in the future.

The Three Ways That The A220 Could Win

In launching its new narrowbody aircraft, Airbus has outlined three ways it believes it can win with the A220 in competition with Boeing's narrowbody planes. Firstly, this will be a clean-sheet aircraft. It is a notable departure from the 737 MAX and A320neo variants, all of which are built upon pre-existing aircraft. A clean-sheet design allows all new innovations in aerodynamics, materials, and avionics to be integrated into a single aircraft. The target in doing so is to build a low-noise and environmentally friendly aircraft that can outperform its rivals with minimal impact on those on the ground. This makes the jet ideal for urban operations, particularly at night.

Airbus intends this jet to have a capacity for 100-160 passengers, offering a level of comfort never before experienced on a narrowbody aircraft. Passengers can enjoy wider seats, panoramic windows, and overhead bins that beat any other aircraft in its class. Of course, Airbus can't control all of these factors. Some are within the control of the airlines. As always, comfort aboard the aircraft will still depend on the airline operating it. Meanwhile, such a commitment to a small jet aircraft indicates a belief that airlines will continue moving towards high frequency rather than high-capacity services.

Finally, the A220 is built for versatility and efficiency. These characteristics open up more opportunities for airlines, allowing them to increase their revenues. Moreover, Airbus says this jet will have 25% lower operating costs per seat compared to previous-generation planes. These factors combine to mean better profit margins.

A220 Overview

In 2018, Airbus launched a new family of five-abreast narrowbody jets, based on the Bombardier CSeries (launched 2012). The jet became known as the A220 after Airbus purchased a majority stake in the joint venture to manufacture the aircraft. It is Airbus' most advanced clean-sheet design narrowbody, utilizing PW1500G geared turbofans from Pratt & Whitney, fly-by-wire controls, carbon composite wings, and an aluminum-lithium fuselage. Airbus has committed to this jet to challenge the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and four-abreast Embraer E-jets. It complements the A319neo. It has allowed Airbus to gain a 55% market share in the small jet airliner category.

The table below outlines the key specifications of both variants of the A220: -100 and -300. It has been put together from data collected by Airbus:

The A220 has already gathered modest success. Delta Air Lines is the largest operator, with 45 -100s and 34 -300s, and a further 66 -300s on order. This is unsurprising, given that they are also the largest operator of the Airbus A330 and Boeing 717, 757, and 767. In total, airlines have ordered 941 A220s, with 435 delivered to date. Those in service, spread between 24 operators, have completed over 1.5 million flights and 2.7 million block hours.

A220 Variants

Airbus currently has two variants of the A220: -100 and -300. The -100 is currently Airbus' smallest jetliner. The unit price is $81 million, substantially higher than Embraer's E-190 E2 and E-195 E2, which are priced between $61 million and $69 million; however, airlines placing bulk orders will receive the jets for less than this. 72 A220-100s are currently in service, with Delta leading the pack.

Airbus' marketing of the -100 is angled towards its capabilities as a ""route opener"" and the ""lowest risk solution."" They hope airlines will utilize it to operate in short-haul and small markets. The greatly decreased operating cost per seat and low capacity could make previously impractical routes profitable. Yet, its range also allows for some medium-haul routes to be operated. For example, Airbus states that, from Paris, the jet can reach African, Asian, and Middle Eastern destinations, like Islamabad, Muscat, Addis Ababa, and Entebbe.

The larger variant is the A220-300. This jet was first delivered as the CS300 to airBaltic following its maiden flight in February 2015. It is a slightly more affordable aircraft ($91.5 million) than the A319neo ($101.5 million), making it a cheaper complementary alternative. There are currently 363 -300s in service, with JetBlue being the largest operator with 51 aircraft. Airbus hopes airlines will use this aircraft as a ""network builder"" due to its combination of lean efficiency and greater capacity. Its range and versatility allow for both regional and intercontinental routes. For example, for airlines using Dallas as a hub, it states the edge of its range to be Anchorage, Lima, Bridgetown, and Cayenne.

The A220 and Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Alongside its high-tech construction, the A220 is also part of Airbus' efforts to transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a goal of 100% SAF by 2030. It made headlines this month for flying from Mirabel in Canada to Paris using a 50% SAF mixture. All Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with a 50% SAF blend, and the company has delivered 78% of its aircraft using this blend in 2025. Meanwhile, 75% of its aircraft deliveries in 2024 used a SAF blend. The flight was carried out to deliver a new A220 to Air France. Airbus claims this is the first time that its Canadian site has issued sustainability credentials to a customer.

Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, said: ""Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s.""

The next step is to collaborate with airlines to increase the frequency of SAF blends appearing on commercial flights, and Airbus is currently forming partnerships to make this possible. For example, it conducted an operational trial with Charleroi Airport (Brussels) and Wizz Air, involving 50 commercial flights using a SAF blend.

What Challenges Could The A220 Face?

With Boeing becoming an increasingly unreliable manufacturer in recent years, it appears that ensuring aircraft reliability is maintained and production targets are met are easy wins for Airbus and others. The A220 has been largely without major issues, with a handful of notable exceptions. In January 2025, Air Canada's AC609 (a -300) suffered a pressurization issue, forcing the aircraft to return to base. However, the cause was swiftly identified as the shearing off of an aft cargo vent flap idler bearing, and the aircraft returned to service after it was fixed.

More concerning was SWISS's 2019 grounding of its entire A220 fleet after issues involving the Pratt & Whitney engines in October 2019. SWISS told Simple Flying: ""Only following a faultless inspection will these aircraft be returned to regular flight duties. This will put substantial restrictions on SWISS’s flight operations, as numerous flights will have to be cancelled."" However, the airline successfully returned its entire A220 fleet to the skies less than a week later.

The A220's only 'accident' has also occurred with a SWISS aircraft. Flight 1885, from Henri Coanda International Airport to Zurich Airport, diverted to Graz Airport after engine issues caused smoke to fill the cabin and cockpit during cruise. All 79 people on board were successfully evacuated after landing, but 17 people had to be rushed to the hospital. One member of the cabin crew died a week later.

What Next For The A220

The main development expected from the A220 in coming years will be the A220-500, a stretched version of the aircraft set to enter service in the early 2030s. A number of airlines are already interested in a higher-capacity A220.

Some doubts still remain about whether this jet is guaranteed to come into existence. A longer A220 was also on the cards back when it was the Bombardier CSeries, but never came to pass. However, this jet has strong commercial reasoning, as it could function as a direct competitor to the 737-800 and 737 MAX 8.

Successfully rolling out this variant will require ongoing A220 production issues to be fixed. During a June 2025 Airbus Business Update, Florent Massou dit Labaquère, the Executive Vice President of Operations of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, referred to issues with plants constructing A220 pylons, systems, strut-to-wing hardware, aft fairings, wings, control surfaces, and the mid-fuselage sections.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a220-reveal-first-arrival-in-airbus-livery-13_ai-eve-a220-firstdelivery-cropped.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-04 21:56:34.018962

The carrier posted record Q2 2025 revenues of $14.4 billion, a 5% jump in international passenger unit revenue, with especially strong demand across the Atlantic. Its operating margin climbed to 8%, while earnings per share of $0.95 beat Wall Street expectations. AAL is also giving a strong net-zero push with significant investment in SAF.

Let’s deep dive into its revenue and its sustainability goals below.

American Airlines’ Passenger Growth Gives Earnings a Lift

The earnings release showed that premium cabins led the charge, with families, leisure travelers, and business flyers paying up for long-haul comfort. The airline also leaned into its AAdvantage loyalty program, which grew 7% in 2025. Upticks in co-branded credit card use and new perks like instant upgrades helped drive repeat bookings.

Together, these gains signaled more than just post-pandemic recovery—they showed targeted growth in high-margin categories.

Holiday Travel Tailwinds

Heading into the year-end holidays, American is adding capacity both at home and abroad. Routes to resilient leisure destinations are expanding, while premium travel remains a strong revenue engine. The airline is betting that higher engagement and a growing loyalty base will keep its planes full during the holiday surge.

Yet, investors are cautious. AAL shares trade at $13.39, nearly 28% below their 2025 peak of $18.66. AAL stock has been volatile, with 22 swings of more than 5% this year alone. Analysts maintain a neutral outlook, with a median 12-month price target of $13.55, suggesting limited upside unless cost pressures ease.

Q3 Forecast: Clear Skies or Turbulence Ahead?

Despite Q2 strength, management offered a more sober Q3 forecast. The company expects a loss per share between $0.10 and $0.60, missing analyst profit estimates. That guidance reflects the industry’s most stubborn challenges:

Fuel volatility – oil prices are holding around $86 per barrel.

Labor pressures – wage hikes, including a 10% pilot raise, are cutting into margins.

Tariff and macro risks – global trade uncertainties remain a drag.

Margins for Q3 are projected between -1% and +2%. At the same time, costs per available seat mile may climb another 2.5–4.5% year-on-year. Pilot shortages and weather disruptions have also played their part, denting operational efficiency.

Still, the company is leaning on its $12 billion liquidity buffer to manage volatility. With the industry facing similar headwinds, investors will watch closely to see how well the airline balances growth with cost control.

A Different Flight Path: American Airlines 2050 Net Zero Goals

While financials dominate headlines, American Airlines is also pushing ahead on climate commitments. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, but the carrier has tied its long-term competitiveness to a net-zero emissions goal by 2050. Intermediate targets for 2030 and 2035 add pressure to deliver progress sooner.

Decarbonizing air travel requires public-private collaboration, innovation, and policy support. However, the company is investing heavily in efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and next-generation aircraft within its operations.

Capital Investments with Climate Benefits

In 2024, roughly 55% of American’s capital spending supported both profitability and decarbonization. That included billions invested in new aircraft, fuel-saving initiatives, and fleet modernization. Although deliveries slowed in 2024 due to supply chain delays, the company expects to take delivery of more efficient aircraft in 2025.

Next-generation aircraft is the key to the airline’s climate playbook.

It became the largest airline to sign a conditional purchase agreement for 100 ZeroAvia hydrogen-electric engines. They can power regional jets with zero emissions beyond water vapor.

The company aims to induct hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2032 or earlier.

Betting Big on Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is widely regarded as the most critical near-term lever for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can cut life-cycle emissions by up to 85%. But supply remains limited, and high costs are slowing adoption.

It aims to replace 10% of its jet fuel use with SAF by 2030, which would avoid about 3.5 million metric tons of CO2. In 2024, the airline used 2.9 million gallons of SAF, a modest 9.7% increase from 2023 but still under 0.1% of total fuel use.

It has signed offtake deals to scale SAF. They include

Up to 10 million gallons from Valero by mid-2026.

Agreement with Infinium, an e-fuels producer, with deliveries expected as early as 2027.

The company also became a founding member of the SAF Coalition, which lobbies for federal incentives to make SAF cost-competitive.

American applies strict sourcing principles to its SAF purchases, requiring at least a 50% life-cycle emissions reduction, full feedstock impact assessments, and sustainability certifications.

Airspace Efficiency

Beyond fuel, American is working with policymakers to modernize airspace management. Better flight planning and optimized routing reduce emissions while boosting safety and on-time performance.

In 2024, the airline rolled out a flight planning optimization tool and equipped its A321 fleet with ADS-B In technology, allowing pilots to adjust routes in real-time for efficiency. These upgrades enhance both operational reliability and sustainability.

Carbon Markets as a Backstop

American Airlines also participates in voluntary carbon markets to neutralize residual emissions. The company is exploring offsets and removals as complementary tools to in-sector solutions.

Last year, it onboarded new digital tools to help corporate customers meet their own decarbonization goals, signaling growing demand for carbon-aligned travel options.

Momentum vs. Risk: Can AAL Keep Flying High?

For shareholders, AAL stock presents a mix of opportunity and risk. The airline is benefiting from record revenues, stronger loyalty engagement, and solid demand for premium travel. Yet, rising costs, $38 billion in debt, and the heavy price of climate transition investments are weighing on its outlook.

With a price-to-sales ratio of 0.16 compared to the industry average of 0.69, AAL appears undervalued. Still, challenges like wage pressures and fuel volatility temper bullish sentiment. Most analysts recommend patience, noting that future gains will hinge on execution and broader market conditions.

Looking ahead, American Airlines has shown it can soar when demand is strong, but turbulence is likely in 2025. The airline is balancing earnings volatility with billions committed to its net-zero pathway. Its ability to manage profitability while pushing forward on decarbonization will shape its role as both a leading U.S. carrier and a case study in how aviation adapts to market and climate pressures.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_738219229.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 00:56:13.847519
