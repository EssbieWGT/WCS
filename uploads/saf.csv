Στην περίπτωση της Ελλάδας εφαρμόζεται ήδη σε πτήσεις της Aegean Airlines σε συνεργασία με την Helleniq Energy.
Η κριτική στην Ε.Ε.
Πηγές της αγοράς εκφράζουν προβληματισμούς στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι, αναφέροντας χαρακτηριστικά ότι «η Ε.Ε.","Σε «σήμα κατατεθέν» της εσωτερικής αγοράς αναδεικνύονται τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα, σε συνέχεια της αυξανόμενης κίνησης του τουρισμού, με τα νούμερα να δείχνουν αυξητική τάση χρόνο με τον χρόνο.

Ενδεικτικά, πηγές της αγοράς αναφέρουν ότι η ζήτηση αεροπορικών καυσίμων έχει επανακάμψει και ξεπεράσει τα προ πανδημίας επίπεδα, με τη Helleniq Energy, επί παραδείγματι, να μετρά περισσότερες πωλήσεις στην εσωτερική αγορά έναντι των εξαγωγών.

Υπενθυμίζεται ότι, από 1ης Ιανουαρίου 2025, βρίσκεται σε ισχύ ευρωπαϊκός κανονισμός, σύμφωνα με τον οποίο τα αεροπορικά καύσιμα θα πρέπει να εμπεριέχουν 2% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ήτοι στοιχεία βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων. Σημειώνεται ότι η χρήση βιοκαυσίμων δεν αφορά χρήση τους κατά 100%, παρά μόνο συνδυαστικά με τα κανονικά καύσιμα.

Υπό το πρίσμα αυτό και στο πλαίσιο απανθρακοποίησης των μεταφορών, η Κομισιόν έχει υιοθετήσει μια συγκεκριμένη στοχοθεσία στην πορεία προς το 2050, με αυξανόμενους στόχους πρόσμιξης ανά πενταετία, ξεκινώντας από το 2% το 2025. Ειδικότερα, ο κανονισμός ReFuelEU Aviation προβλέπει υποχρεωτική ενσωμάτωση SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα με 2% φέτος και ακολούθως 6% το 2030, 20% το 2035, 34% το 2040, 42% το 2045 και 70% το 2050.

Ταυτόχρονα, οι στόχοι του ΕΣΕΚ για το SAF ανεβάζουν το μερίδιο από 1,0% το 2025 σε 41,9% το 2040, με προβλέψεις να δείχνουν εκρηκτική αύξηση της χρήσης ανανεώσιμων καυσίμων μη βιολογικής προέλευσης. Ο τομέας των αερομεταφορών είναι υπεύθυνος για το 2,5% περίπου των παγκόσμιων εκπομπών CO2 και το μερίδιο αυτό αναμένεται να αυξηθεί, καθώς αυξάνεται η ζήτηση για τα αεροπορικά ταξίδια. Ως γνωστόν, η Ε.Ε. έχει θέσει στόχο για μείωση των εκπομπών κατά 55% μέχρι το 2030 (Fit for 55 Package) και, στο πλαίσιο αυτό, προχωρά το σχέδιο αξιοποίησης SAF στις αεροπορικές μεταφορές. Ως SAF χαρακτηρίζονται αεροπορικά καύσιμα τα οποία είναι:

Συνθετικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα από ανανεώσιμο υδρογόνο και δεσμευμένο άνθρακα

Προηγμένα βιοκαύσιμα από απόβλητα και υπολείμματα κυρίως

Βιοκαύσιμα που παράγονται από έλαια και λίπη

Ανακυκλωμένα συμβατικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα. Σύμφωνα με ειδικούς της αγοράς, η αξιοποίηση SAF στις αερομεταφορές έχει δυνατότητα να μειώσει τις εκπομπές CO2 έως και 80%. Στην περίπτωση της Ελλάδας εφαρμόζεται ήδη σε πτήσεις της Aegean Airlines σε συνεργασία με την Helleniq Energy.

Χρειάζεται, βέβαια, να σημειωθεί ότι η εν λόγω δραστηριότητα, όπως επισημαίνουν πηγές της αγοράς με γνώση του θέματος, αν και σε πρωτόλειο επίπεδο ωρίμανσης ακόμη, τείνει να αποτελέσει εκ των βασικών δραστηριοτήτων για τα διυλιστήρια της Ευρώπης και δη της Ελλάδας, δεδομένης της πυκνότητας των αερομεταφορών.

Η κριτική στην Ε.Ε. Μια δεύτερη παράμετρος που θα κρίνει την ταχύτητα ανάπτυξης του κλάδου, καθώς και την εφικτότητα των στόχων που έχουν τεθεί σε ευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο, αφορά την πολιτική και θεσμική υποστήριξη που θα τύχει η εν λόγω δραστηριότητα.

Πηγές της αγοράς εκφράζουν προβληματισμούς στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι, αναφέροντας χαρακτηριστικά ότι «η Ε.Ε. επιδίδεται σταθερά στην αυστηροποίηση των κριτηρίων για τον ορισμό των βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων, όταν στην αντίπερα όχθη, στις ΗΠΑ, τα πράγματα εξελίσσονται πιο συντεταγμένα για την ωρίμανση του κλάδου».

Επένδυση στην Ελευσίνα

Όπως έχει αποκαλύψει η Helleniq Energy κατά το παρελθόν, η εταιρεία σχεδιάζει να δημιουργήσει μια μονάδα παραγωγής SAF (150 κιλά/ώρα) στον χώρο του διυλιστηρίου της στην Ελευσίνα, με ορίζοντα λειτουργίας μέχρι το 2030.

Η εν λόγω επένδυση συνιστά μέρος ενός μακρόπνοου επενδυτικού σχεδίου, που στόχο έχει να ευθυγραμμίσει τη διύλιση στα νέα δεδομένα της περιβαλλοντικής πολιτικής, διαμορφώνοντας παράλληλα τα «πράσινα» προϊόντα της επόμενης μέρας.

Η μονάδα θα χρησιμοποιεί ως πρώτη ύλη τηγανέλαιο, έχοντας, παράλληλα, τη δυνατότητα να υποδεχθεί ακόμη 10 διαφορετικές πρώτες ύλες. Σε κάθε περίπτωση, όπως επισημαίνουν οι ίδιες πηγές, το ζήτημα της πρώτης ύλης είναι ιδιαίτερα κρίσιμο, προκειμένου να υπάρξει ορατότητα και προβλεψιμότητα κατά την παραγωγική διαδικασία.",https://www.naftemporiki.gr/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aeroplano-livadi.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 13:56:08.281190

Electricity power consumption during each phase of flight of a Boeing 777-300ER is shown here.
As such, estimating aircraft electrical power requirements allows aircraft manufacturers and aviation researchers to find alternative ways to source the required amount of energy for aircraft systems.","Aircraft power requirements are driven by the need to offer passengers higher levels of luxury and comfort. Whether it is mood lighting, in-flight entertainment, or power ports for personal devices, aircraft manufacturers ensure sufficient power is generated for onboard systems. This shift has significantly increased the demand for onboard electrical power throughout the cabin.

The magnitude of power consumption onboard aircraft primarily depends on the size of the aircraft (including cabin), the number of passengers, and the phase of flight. The onboard generators must produce sufficient power to facilitate all aircraft occupants during the flight.

Several cabin systems that run on electrical power, such as the environmental control system, lighting system, etc., are shared across the cabin. However, the power required for inflight entertainment systems, reading lights, and power ports depends on the usage. The electrical power requirement on smaller, narrowbody aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 family, ranges between 20 kW and 390 kW.

However, larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 777-300ER, require anywhere between 110 kW and 720 kW, depending on the occupancy rate and phase of flight. The Airbus A380, the world's largest commercial jet, requires between 180 kW and 1,250 kW. This article highlights power requirements for the most common cabin systems, including lighting, in-flight entertainment, and power ports for personal devices.

Electrical Power Requirements of a Boeing 777-300ER

The Boeing 777-300ER is a long-range widebody aircraft with a typical seating for 400 passengers in two classes. While the type has an exit limit of 550 passengers, airlines generally configure their planes to accommodate anywhere between 340 and 420 passengers. With a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of 775,000 lb (351,533 kg), the aircraft can fly a range of 7,370 NM (13,649 km; 8,480 miles).

Two GE Aerospace GE90-115B turbofan engines power the aircraft, each generating up to 115,300 lbf (513 kM) thrust at takeoff. Since its launch, it has become a primary driver of the type's sales for the manufacturer and an economical long-haul workhorse for airlines. According to Boeing:

""The Boeing 777's unique combination of superior range, outstanding fuel efficiency, and passenger-preferred comfort has created long-range success for carriers around the world. And the 777-300ER now gives operators a perfect opportunity to extend that success. Recent upgrades further reduce costs and boost revenue, and the 777's flying experience is still number one with passengers. A more profitable fleet and more satisfied passengers. That's a better way to fly.""

The 777-300ER, like most other planes, features a range of systems that require electrical power. While this article covers only a handful of electrical systems, a comprehensive list of systems and equipment requiring electrical power is shown here.

On-seat Power Requirements of a Boeing 777-300ER

While some cabin systems require constant power regardless of the phase of flight or occupancy, on-seat power is based on occupancy and usage. On-seat systems typically include in-flight entertainment (IFE), personal reading lights, and power ports for personal devices.

Theoretically, demands for these systems vary from 50 W to 110 W per passenger, depending on the type of system and usage. Some passengers tend to use their personal devices and charge them onboard, while others spend more time using the in-flight IFE. According to a study published in the Aerospace Journal, researchers conducted passenger surveys and airline statistics to examine the media preferences of passengers during their flights. The study concluded,

""The findings indicated that 20% of respondents reported traveling for business purposes. For this group, it was assumed in the study that they would use their laptops during the flight and recharge them on board. The rest of the passengers spent 44% of the flight time using IFE and 46% using personal electronic devices (PEDs). In flight, 10% of passengers switched between IFE and PEDs. The study also presumed that passengers utilizing PEDs would charge them during the flight.""

As a general rule of thumb, laptops consume approximately 70 W, whereas personal handheld devices, including tablets, consume approximately 15 W. An IFE screen integrated into the back of the seats onboard Boeing 777-300ERs draws anywhere between 15 W and 20 W throughout the flight.

A large aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER, with its typical seating capacity, cabin length, and maximum takeoff weight, requires approximately 720 kW of electrical power for systems. Notably, taxi-out (before departure) and taxi-in (after landing) phases have the lowest electricity requirement, at 425 kW, whereas cruise has the highest, with 720 kW. Electricity power consumption during each phase of flight of a Boeing 777-300ER is shown here.

Advantages of Calculating Electric Power Requirements For Commercial Aircraft

Research indicates that global aviation is responsible for nearly 2.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions in the environment. This situation is only getting worse as global air traffic continues to grow. As such, estimating aircraft electrical power requirements allows aircraft manufacturers and aviation researchers to find alternative ways to source the required amount of energy for aircraft systems.

Electrical generators provide power produced through conventional engines, requiring fossil fuels that result in carbon emissions. Engine-driven generators are driven by the gearbox and the high-pressure spool of the engine. To achieve net-zero carbon emissions, hydrogen fuel cells are being used to curb the environmental impact. The technology uses electrochemical energy converters to convert chemical energy into electrical energy without emitting noise or other pollutants into the environment.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/main-image-16_9-52.png,N,,2025-05-24 13:56:12.552006

Των καυσίμων δηλαδή του μέλλοντος, που υπολογίζεται ότι θα ξεπεράσουν παγκοσμίως τα 25 δισ. δολάρια ως το 2030 και τα οποία παράγονται από ανανεώσιμο υδρογόνο και δεσμευμένο άνθρακα, απόβλητα και υπολείμματα από έλαια και λίπη, καθώς και ανακυκλωμένα συμβατικά αεροπορικά καύσιμα.

Στο νέο αυτό τοπίο, η ζήτηση για SAF στην ευρωπαϊκή αγορά αυξάνεται συνεχώς, ωστόσο η διαθεσιμότητά τους είναι περιορισμένη, με τους ελληνικούς ομίλους να «βλέπουν» εδώ μια ευκαιρία, μαζί με τη δυνατότητα να καλύψουν το κενό που θα προκύπτει από την ολοένα μειούμενη ζήτηση για συμβατικά καύσιμα, με νέα προϊόντα υψηλής προστιθέμενης αξίας, όπως τα νέου τύπου jet fuels.

Αλλωστε, η υποχρεωτική ενσωμάτωση SAF στα αεροπορικά καύσιμα ακολουθεί εκθετική τροχιά και σύμφωνα με το κανονισμό ReFuelEU Aviation της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης, το 2035 πρέπει να φτάσει στο 20%, το 2040 στο 34%, το 2045 στο 42% και το 2050 στο 70%.

Στη πράξη, πρόκειται για επένδυση και με εξαγωγικό προσανατολισμό προς άλλες ευρωπαϊκές χώρες και έρχεται σε συνέχεια του πιλοτικού έργου με το οποίο η ΕΚΟ προμηθεύει ήδη εδώ και μια τριετία με SAF την Aegean στο αεροδρόμιο «Μακεδονία». Το καύσιμο προέρχονταν αρχικά από τη φιλανδική εταιρεία Neste που έχει εργοστάσια στο Ρότερνταμ και τη Σιγκαπούρη, αλλά ο ελληνικός όμιλος συνεργάζεται πλέον με ολοένα και περισσότερους προμηθευτές.

Στόχος για green hub στα καύσιμα

Κοιτάζοντας τη μεγάλη εικόνα, τα νέας γενιάς αεροπορικά καύσιμα αποτελούν ένα κομμάτι μόνο από την προσπάθεια της Helleniq Energy να εξελιχθεί σε όμιλο παραγωγής πετρελαιοειδών χαμηλού άνθρακα, ενσωματώνοντας παραγωγή HVO, βιοαιθέρων, πράσινου υδρογόνου, καθώς και εγκαταστάσεις αποθήκευσης και ΑΠΕ.

Στον Ασπρόπυργο έχει ήδη ολοκληρωθεί μια επένδυση σε βιοαιθέρες που παράγει 160.000 τόνους το χρόνο, ωστόσο το πλέον μεγαλόπνοο project αφορά τη μετατροπή του διυλιστηρίου της Θεσσαλονίκης σε πράσινο.

Σε αυτό δρομολογείται η δημιουργία ενός hub καθαρής ενέργειας, που θα παράγει green hydrogen, αμμωνία και ανακυκλωμένα πλαστικά, ενώ είναι έτοιμη να ξεκινήσει η παραγωγή 45.000 τόνων ετησίως πράσινου ντίζελ. Το συγκεκριμένο προϊόν θα προέρχεται από τη κοινή κατεργασία τηγανόλαδων και ορυκτού ντίζελ.

Στην αγορά των πράσινων καυσίμων κινείται δυναμικά και η Motor Oil που έχει εντάξει στο στρατηγικό της σχεδιασμό την παραγωγή τόσο προηγμένων βιοκαυσίμων (biofuels) όσο και συνθετικών καυσίμων (e-fuels).

Εδώ έχουν τη σημασία τους και οι συνέργειες μέσω της πλατφόρμας της Elin Verde που εξαγόρασε το 2022 με αντικείμενο την παραγωγή και εμπορία βιοκαυσίμων, διαθέτοντας μεταξύ άλλων εργοστάσιο παραγωγής βιοντίζελ στη ΒΙ.ΠΕ Βόλου αλλά και την «Πράσινο Λάδι» που δραστηριοποιείται στη συλλογή και εμπορία χρησιμοποιημένων μαγειρικών ελαίων και ζωικών λιπών (που αποτελούν την πρώτη ύλη για τα βιοκαύσιμα).

Σχήμα στήριξης και πρώτες ύλες

Το πανευρωπαϊκό, ωστόσο, παιχνίδι των νέας γενιάς καυσίμων όπως το SAF, παρ’ ότι η τεχνολογία είναι ώριμη και πιστοποιημένη, απαιτεί μεγάλους όγκους πρώτης ύλης με τις διαθέσιμες ποσότητες τηγανόλαδων, ζωικών λιπών και άλλων αποβλήτων να μην επαρκούν για να καλύψουν τους τεράστιους όγκους που απαιτούνται για την επίτευξη των στόχων του ReFuelEU Aviation.

Δίχως τη ταχεία ανάπτυξη νέων μονάδων επεξεργασίας και χωρίς τη δημιουργία ενός δικτύου συλλογής και προεπεξεργασίας αποβλήτων σε όλη τη χώρα, το στοίχημα δεν πρόκειται να κερδηθεί.

Το ίδιο ισχύει και για την ανάγκη παροχής κινήτρων στους δύο μεγάλους διυλιστηριακούς ομίλους προκειμένου να ενθαρρυνθεί η παραγωγή βιώσιμων αεροπορικών καυσίμων χαμηλού ανθρακικού αποτυπώματος, η ζήτηση για τα οποία θα αυξάνεται όλο και περισσότερο από τις αερομεταφορές.

Η προηγούμενη πολιτική ηγεσία του ΥΠΕΝ είχε προκοινοποιήσει στην Κομισιόν πρόταση για σχήμα στήριξης της παραγωγής SAF στην Ελλάδα, καθώς η έγκριση της Γενικής Επιτροπής Ανταγωνισμού της EE (DG COMP) αποτελεί προαπαιτούμενο για να υπάρξει κρατική επιδότηση.

Το σκεπτικό ήταν ότι οι πόροι θα προέλθουν από το Ταμείο Εκσυγχρονισμού της ΕΕ, ένα νέο εργαλείο για τη στήριξη δράσεων απανθρακοποίησης που χρηματοδοτείται από τα έσοδα του Συστήματος Εμπορίας Δικαιωμάτων Εκπομπών Ρύπων, με τον συνολικό «κουμπαρά» για την Ελλάδα να εκτιμάται σε 1,32 δισ. ευρώ.

Στη προκειμένη περίπτωση, το σχέδιο αφορούσε τις κεφαλαιουχικές δαπάνες (capex) για την δημιουργία των μονάδων παραγωγής, καθώς οι πόροι δεν επαρκούν για να καλύψουν τη διαφορά του κόστους μεταξύ των συμβατικών ορυκτών καυσίμων και των ακριβών συνθετικών καυσίμων, κάτι που συνιστά πρόκληση για ολόκληρη την εφοδιαστική αλυσίδα των SAF, συμπεριλαμβανομένης και της αεροπορικής βιομηχανίας.

From its home at Dubai International Airport (DXB), the airline is celebrating its record $6.2 billion in recorded profit for the financial year ending March 31. How is the airline celebrating such a historic year?

Emirates, the hometown airline for Dubai, competes head-to-head with several other Middle Eastern heavyweights, namely Etihad Airways , Saudia, and Qatar Airways. Emirates has made a name for itself with the Airbus A380, which has flown to a number of key international destinations around the world and offers more seats between London and Dubai than many other carriers combined. It's news that $6.2 billion in annual profit for the 2024 financial year has made this one of the airline's strongest financial performances.

What Has Driven Such Strong Profits?

Emirates has seen a significant increase in revenue compared to the previous financial year; this has been driven by strong passenger demand, more efficient operations, and the continued rebound for long-haul travel in the post-pandemic world. In the last financial year, the airline transported more than 512 million passengers, resulting in an average load factor of 83% on most flights. This has demonstrated strong demand across its entire international network.

The airline's Chairman and CEO, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, has attributed Emirates' success to the carrier's ability to adapt to new travel trends, including the surge in premium bookings, and the introduction of its hotly anticipated premium economy cabin. The year's strong performance has reflected the resilience of the Middle Eastern carrier and its dedication to growing demand for high-quality air travel. Emirates, which is owned by the government of Dubai's Investment Corporation of Dubai, operates more than 3,600 flights a week from its home at DXB, with direct flights to more than 150 cities across 80 countries.

This year, Emirates continues to expand its international network from Dubai International Airport, one of the busiest airports on the planet. In 2025, Emirates will take off to several new destinations, including Da Nang (from June 2), Hangzhou (from July 30), Shenzhen (from July 1), Siem Reap (from June 3), and Tel Aviv (returning from October 1).

Rewarding Emirates Employees With A Big Bonus

Following Emirates' successful year, the airline will reward its employees with a six-month salary bonus. The carrier decided to give this very generous reward to recognize its staff's continued commitment and contributions to Emirates' overall success. This reward aligns with the airline's traditions of sharing profits with its employees during successful years. Emirates is the world's third-largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger kilometers, and the second-largest by freight tonne kilometers flown.

This benefit, distributed among its tens of thousands of employees, includes all ends of the spectrum, including cabin crew, pilots, ground staff, and administrative personnel. The airline has also enhanced its staff benefits by extending travel discounts and healthcare packages. The airline has reiterated that behind this bonus, its people have been instrumental in achieving such successful results in the last financial year.

The record figure of over $6 billion in profit is the best in the carrier's history and reaffirms the carrier as one of the world's most profitable airlines. The figures that concluded at the end of March represent a year-on-year increase of 18%, with the group's cash assets increasing 13% ($14.6 billion).

Investing In More Aircraft

Emirates is reinvesting huge capital from its financial success in accelerating its fleet modernization program. The Middle Eastern carrier has placed additional orders for the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X, these aircraft will further drive fuel efficiency and expand the airlines long-haul capabilities.

Emirates has also started retrofitting its existing Airbus A380 fleet (of which it has the largest in the world by a long shot), rejuvenating its cabins, and adding premium economy, a first for the airline in a push to respond to the ever-growing mid-tier luxury travel market. While the Airbus A380 is no longer in production, Emirates remains committed to the double-decker aircraft, deploying it on some of its most iconic and busiest routes, including London, Paris, Christchurch, and New York. Below is a list of aircraft on order with the carrier:

Currently, the Emirates fleet consists entirely of widebody aircraft, a model that the airline expects to continue. Several aircraft types already operate in the airline's network, including four Airbus A350-900, 116 Airbus A380-800, ten Boeing 777-200LR, and 120 Boeing 777-300ER.

Enhancing The Emirates Experience

Not only is Emirates expanding its global network by introducing a number of new routes, but the carrier is also leveraging its partnership with flydubai . The regional, low-cost carrier based at Dubai International Airport is Emirates' sister carrier, operating to a range of short—and medium-haul destinations from Dubai, such as those throughout the Adriatic and neighbouring Middle Eastern countries.

Emirates continues reinvesting in the passenger experience and has seen recent premium cabin upgrades. Expanded menus and dining options have been fueled through partnerships with Michelin-starred chefs, and those who like to sit back and relax with a good film can enjoy more than 6,500 channels on the airline's award-winning ICE entertainment system.

Fast Wi-Fi is also now available across the Emirates fleet, providing both business—and leisure-focused passengers with the ability to stay connected with friends and family around the world during flight. With Emirates being the largest A380 operator worldwide, 81 of its double deckers are progressively being retrofitted with its new premium economy seats.

Remaining Committed To The Carrier's Carbon Neutrality Goals

While Emirates will cash out millions with this year's bonus offer, the airline continues investing heavily in its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships and investments for more fuel-efficient aircraft, the airline will reach its net-zero carbon emissions target by the middle of the century.

Passengers and businesses using Emirates can also participate in this programme by offsetting their carbon emissions when booking. Here are some ways Emirates continues to make strides in lowering its carbon footprint:

Other initiatives that have supported this move to lower carbon emissions include electric vehicles in its fleet of cars that chauffeur its flight crew to and from their Dubai accommodations, which alone reduces around 14 tonnes of CO2 per month.

A Bright Future Is Ahead For Emirates

However you may look at it, Emirates's future looks bright. The carrier, synonymous with long-haul, luxury air travel, will head into the 2025 financial year with a stride in its step, coming off the back of a resounding 2024. The airline's $6.2 billion profit underscores its continued dominance in the aviation industry.

Touching on Vietnam – Malaysia relations, the diplomat stressed that PM Chinh’s visit will help deepen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries.
Vietnam has positioned its people as the centre, subject, goal, driving force, and resource for sustainable national development.","In a recent interview with the press, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Do Hung Viet, also Head of ASEAN SOM of Vietnam, stressed that the trip, made at the invitation of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his spouse, is of significance as it coincides with the 30th anniversary of Vietnam’s ASEAN membership, marking the beginning of the nation’s regional and international process.

It demonstrates Vietnam’s strong support for Malaysia’s role as the ASEAN Chair this year and reflects the shared determination for build a community that embodies sustainability, inclusiveness, solidarity and strength while consolidating ASEAN’s central role in regional peace and stability, he said, highlighting Vietnam seeks to collaborate with other ASEAN member states to shape up strategic orientations and concrete measures to solidify regional cooperation foundation while elevating the bloc’s stature in the coming time.

Vietnam's three-decade ASEAN membership shows that it is increasingly mature, confident, and proactive in both regional bloc participation and broader international integration. This period has confirmed ASEAN as a cornerstone in Vietnam's foreign policy, with General Secretary To Lam emphasising in his speech at the ASEAN Secretariat in January that standing at a new historical starting point, Vietnam and ASEAN are working together towards ambitious goals.

Over the recent past, Vietnam has collaborated closely with other ASEAN nations in developing strategic documents, particularly the ""ASEAN 2045: Our Shared Future"" to be adopted by leaders at this summit. Vietnamese ministries actively contributed from the initial stages, balancing core principles like internal solidarity and ASEAN centrality while proposing innovative, practical ideas to create breakthroughs across all three pillars of politics-security, economy, and socio-culture, and cross-sectoral areas.

Vietnam’s leadership is evident through its role in organising the ASEAN Future Forums in 2024 and 2025, facilitating discussions on essential regional issues and substantively contributing to shaping ASEAN cooperation through 2045.

Themed “Inclusivity and Sustainability”, the 46th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits are expected to chart fresh pathways for regional cooperation.

Vietnam will work with other member states across three priorities, namely reaffirming multilateralism’s values while enhancing ASEAN’s central role in the region amidst strategic volatilities; launching a new roadmap for community building towards a self-reliant, innovative, proactive, and people-centred bloc; and promoting internal and external connectivity through expanded trade-investment cooperation and fair, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading systems, according to Viet.

Touching on Vietnam – Malaysia relations, the diplomat stressed that PM Chinh’s visit will help deepen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries. Leaders of both sides will exchange notes on specific orientations and measures to inject new momentum and develop the bilateral cooperation and connectivity in a deeper and more effective manner.

He went on to emphasise that the elevation of the bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership last November represents the most solid assessment and highest expectation for the Vietnam-Malaysia relationship.

Senior leaders of the two countries have maintained regular visits and exchanges, highlighted by General Secretary To Lam's official visit to Malaysia in 2024 and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to Vietnam for attendance at the second ASEAN Future Forum in February 2025.

Recent diplomatic engagement has intensified remarkably, with PM Chinh conducting two telephone conversations with his Malaysian counterpart within a single month to share assessments of the global and regional situation while discussing measures to promote bilateral cooperation and ASEAN collaboration.

Viet described economic cooperation as an important pillar in the Vietnam – Malaysia relationship, stating Malaysia currently ranks as Vietnam's third-largest trading partner within ASEAN and 9th globally, while also standing as Vietnam's third-largest investor among ASEAN countries.

Both countries share similar development aspirations and place people at the heart of national development. Vietnam has positioned its people as the centre, subject, goal, driving force, and resource for sustainable national development.

Similarly, Malaysia aims to become one of the world's top 25 countries in human development index within the next decade. This alignment, Viet said, demonstrates profound affinity between the nations extending beyond geographical proximity to encompass long-term development philosophy and priorities.

He expressed his belief that PM Chinh’s visit will also strengthen political trust between the two countries, remove bottlenecks, and outline concrete steps to bring into full play the Vietnam – Malaysia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for the benefits of the two countries’ people as well as for peace, stability, and development in the region.",https://media.vov.vn/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_en/public/2025-05/foreign%20ministry.jpg?v=1748102048,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:13.732429

Our primary focus right now is on strengthening ethanol production, in line with the Government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program.","With the recent hike in the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane, the sugar industry in India is urging the government to revise the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar as well as ethanol prices.

In June 2018, the Indian government set the MSP of sugar for the first time at Rs 29 per kg, when the FRP for sugarcane was Rs 2,550 per tonne. Since then, while the FRP has steadily increased, rising to Rs 3,550 per tonne for the 2025–26 season, the MSP of sugar has remained unchanged at Rs 31 per kg since February 2019.

In an exclusive interview with ChiniMandi, Tarun Sawhney, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd, highlights the urgent need to revise the sugar MSP and discusses key issues facing the sugar industry, as well as the company’s strategy and outlook.

Q. India has recorded a decline in sugar production this season compared to the previous year. What, in your view, are the main factors contributing to this drop?

India has recorded a decline in sugar production this season compared to the previous year—from 31.9 million tonnes in Sugar Season (SS) 2023–24 to an estimated 25.74 million tonnes in SS 2024–25 (as of May 15, 2025). This drop can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, adverse weather conditions in key producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka which led to lower sugarcane yields and reduced availability for crushing. Secondly, diversion of sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses in line with the Government’s biofuel targets, has also impacted sugar output. Additionally, the crushing season was shorter in some regions due to early exhaustion of sugarcane supplies. Improved plant cane yield and better sugar recovery in the latter half of the season have contributed to extended operations in Uttar Pradesh. Furthermore, special crushing operations in South Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are expected to commence, potentially adding 0.4 to 0.5 million tonnes of sugar to the final tally. Despite the decline in overall production, with a projected closing stock of 5.4 million tonnes and no domestic supply concerns, the industry remains confident about meeting demand and maintaining price stability.

Q. How do you assess the current trends in sugar consumption in India? Are there any change in demand?

The current trends in sugar consumption in India remain steady and largely stable, with no significant decline in domestic demand. Despite a drop in the sugar production there is no visible stress on supply, and price stability has been maintained, indicating that consumption levels have not drastically changed.

India typically consumes around 28 million tonnes of sugar annually, and this year’s projected closing stock of 5.4 million tonnes which will allow to comfortably meet country’s demand for sugar. There’s also no evidence of a demand surge or significant shift in consumption patterns. However, the industry remains watchful as seasonal demand tends to rise during summer months and festive seasons. In that context, continued operations in select mills in UP, TN, and Maharashtra into May are helping manage regional supply efficiently.

Q. How much important role do sugar and ethanol play in the overall business of Triveni Engineering & Industries?

We are one of India’s largest sugar producers, operating eight sugar plants across Uttar Pradesh. We produced ~0.89 million tonnes of sugar in the Sugar Season (SS) 2023-24. In our Alcohol business, we produced over 180 million litres of alcohol during the Financial Year 2023-24, through our five distillery facilities, also located in Uttar Pradesh. Among these, two facilities are multi-feed and can process both molasses and grains, ensuring operational flexibility.

Sugar and Alcohol contributes approximately 90% to our overall turnover. The remaining 10% comes from our engineering operations, which include manufacturing high-speed power transmission equipment such as gearboxes, and another business focused on water and wastewater treatment solutions.

Q. Do you consider the revision of the sugar Minimum Support Price (MSP) and ethanol pricing to be top priorities for the sugar industry at present?

Sugar prices have remained largely stable, with a recent modest uptick of 2–2.5%. However, five years of price stagnation—coupled with rising sugarcane, labour, and operational costs—have severely compressed industry margins. With the FRP for sugarcane now revised to Rs 355/quintal (for Sugar Season 2025-26), revising sugar MSP to Rs 39.14/kg is critical to restore mill viability and ensure fair farmer returns. At Triveni, we continue to lead by example with timely, arrears-free farmer payments.

Agronomic challenges, especially the red rot disease plaguing the CO238 variety, demand immediate investment in resilient sugarcane alternatives for North India’s 25 million farmers—making a sugar price hike even more necessary.

Similarly, ethanol remains a key pillar in farmer income, rural development, and national energy security. While pricing varies by feedstock, ethanol from sugarcane juice commands Rs 65.61/litre, B-heavy molasses Rs 60.73/litre, and C-heavy molasses recently revised to Rs 57.97/litre. The industry expected upward revisions for B-heavy and juice-based ethanol to ease value chain pressures.

India is on track to meet its 20% ethanol blending target, with NITI Aayog now exploring higher thresholds. Achieving these goals hinges on capacity expansion, underpinned by a sustainable ethanol pricing model.

Q. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to evolve, how is Triveni adopting these technologies to improve its production processes and operational efficiency?

To increase production, streamline procedures, and improve operational efficiency, Triveni Engineering & Industries Limited is adopting digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) as essential pillars of our transformation path. Across our sugar manufacturing and other business verticals, we have implemented a comprehensive digital strategy that incorporates cutting-edge technologies, intelligent automation, and advanced analytics.

A major milestone in this journey has been the establishment of our Digital Centre of Excellence (DCoE). This hub is central to driving innovation, enabling us to monitor operations in real-time, predict equipment failures, and make faster, data-backed decisions. By leveraging AI and ML tools, we’re able to improve plant performance, increase equipment uptime, and cut down on energy use—creating a more agile and sustainable manufacturing setup.

We’ve implemented AI-powered solutions in our sugar business to improve logistics, streamline cane buying, and digitize field operations using smart dashboards and GPS tracking. Our supply chain is now more open and effective thanks to these advancements. Furthermore, we can decrease manual interventions and guarantee higher consistency and quality in our output by utilizing IoT-enabled sensors and intelligent automation on the manufacturing floor.

Digitalization is also helping us empower our people. We’re equipping our teams with digital tools and training to foster a culture of innovation and adaptability. By combining human expertise with AI capabilities, we’re making our operations smarter and more responsive.

Looking ahead, we’re actively exploring technologies like digital twins and advanced process control systems to simulate our operations and unlock real-time process improvements. These initiatives are not just about keeping up with Industry 4.0—they’re about leading it. We’re committed to making Triveni a model for how traditional industries can evolve through technology.

Q. Any future plans for Triveni to venture into biogas, SAF, or other areas of the bioenergy business?

At Triveni Engineering & Industries Limited, we’re deeply committed to supporting India’s energy transition, and our growing footprint in the bioenergy sector reflects that. Our primary focus right now is on strengthening ethanol production, in line with the Government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program.

Our production backbone includes five state-of-the-art distillation facilities strategically located across Uttar Pradesh. Notably, our grain-based plants also produce Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles (DDGS)—a high-protein animal feed by-product that has been well received by premium institutions.

While ethanol remains our immediate priority, we absolutely recognize the vast potential in emerging areas of the bioenergy space, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Compressed Biogas (CBG). India is entering a transformative phase—what many are calling an ethanol revolution—where second-generation biofuels, SAF, and CBG are expected to play a major role in the country’s long-term energy roadmap.

Though we haven’t announced specific initiatives in SAF or biogas just yet, we’re closely watching the developments in these areas and exploring opportunities that align with our capabilities and long-term sustainability vision. Our focus is on building scalable, high-impact solutions—and as the ecosystem evolves, we’re ready to diversify and lead wherever the opportunity arises.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tarun-Sawhney.jpeg,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:20.054675

KUCHING, May 24: Smallholders in Sarawak can boost their income by integrating livestock farming into their oil palm plantations, said Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg.

He explained that this integrated model allows farmers to generate two income streams from the same land—through the production of palm oil and livestock such as goats, cattle, or chickens.

“If we plant oil palm on one hectare of land according to the proper planting structure, there’s space between the trees.

“Why not raise animals in between? Chickens, goats or cattle,” he said when launching the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority’s (SALCRA) Kernel Crushing Plant at the Lubok Antu Palm Oil Mill today.

Abang Johari said the by-products from palm kernel crushing can be processed into animal feed, enabling farmers to feed their livestock at minimal cost using palm-based waste.

He pointed out that cattle prices have soared, with a single cow selling for up to RM12,000 during Hari Raya Aidiladha.

By turning palm waste into feed, rural farmers can rear livestock more affordably and profitably. From just one hectare of oil palm land, they can produce palm oil, raise animals, and feed their livestock at no additional cost.

“If we can produce more goats and cattle, we can export them overseas. That means more income. This is what we call waste-to-energy,” he added.

Abang Johari also highlighted that palm oil waste can be turned into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reducing reliance on fossil fuels to power aircraft.

“In Singapore, companies like Neste collect used cooking oil from restaurants and turn it into SAF. But in Sarawak, we are doing it using plantation waste, and the value goes back to the farmers,” he said.

He noted that the RM30 million allocated by the Sarawak government to SALCRA served as seed capital to establish the Kernel Crushing Plant in Lubok Antu, designed as a model to demonstrate how downstream activities can benefit smallholders.

“Oil palm smallholders are no longer just oil palm farmers. They can become livestock entrepreneurs too. And with two income streams, the village’s overall earnings will increase,” he said.

While the focus now is on livestock feed and SAF, Abang Johari revealed that kernel processing can also produce hydrogen gas—a clean energy source Sarawak aims to tap in future public transport systems like the Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART).

He also suggested automating waste handling in mills with conveyor belts to reduce labour and improve cleanliness.

Sarawak is the largest oil palm producer in Malaysia based on planted area.

Mærket bruger 29 millioner kroner på 3,8 millioner liter brændstof til resten af flåden.

McLarens Formel 1-biler er ikke de eneste, som kører på syntetisk benzin.

I en netop offentliggjort bæredygtighedsrapport, gør det tidligere britiske bilmærke det klart, at man i 2024 brugte millioner af kroner på syntetisk brændstof til resten af Formel 1-flåden.

Her i blandt lastbiler. Helt konkret skriver McLaren, der sidste år blev solgt til Abu Dhabi, at man sidste år købte Sustainable Aviation Fuel-certificeret brændstof for 29 millioner kroner.

Det svarer til 3,8 millioner liter. En mængde brændstof som McLaren har kunnet køre hele sin flåde af lastbiler, og dele af mærkets flyfragt, på det syntetiske brændstof.

SAF-brændstof fremstilles af affald eller fornybare kilder og kan reducere udledningen med op til 90 procent sammenlignet med almindeligt jetbrændstof, skriver Formel 1-holdet.

Når det så er sagt, stopper McLaren ikke ved brændstoffet. Ifølge bæredygtighedsrapporten er holdet oppe på nu at have genbrugt 37 procent af materialerne fra sidste års Formel 1-bil, McLaren MCL38, bliver genbrugt.

På den anden side er det ikke alt, er det ikke alt, der er røde roser i McLaren-garagen. Holdet riskerer nemlig at stå med en ekstremt stor udgift til det syntetiske brændstof lige om lidt.

Og det er faktisk generelt sådan det ser ud i hele Formel 1-feltet. De første Formel 1-chefer har da også allerede proptesteret over prisen som kaldes ‘latterlig’. Læs mere om det her.

I det hele taget er Formel 1 en dyr fornøjelse. Faktisk så dyr at holdene internt er klar på at bruge millioner – måske endda op imod milliarder – af kroner på at kapre personale fra hinanden.

That is why we are actively positioning ourselves in China and working towards establishing a presence in India.
Ahmad Sabirin said Sirim is accelerating its global expansion by establishing more international offices, with the broader objective of enabling not only its own growth but also supporting the internationalisation of Malaysian small and medium enterprises.
Asked about examples of Sirim’s research and development initiatives in the electric vehicle space, Ahmad Sabirin said, “For EV, we have the most complex system for the industries.
Currently, much of the industrial focus is centred on advancing the EV sector,“ Ahmad Sabirin said.","LANGKAWI: Sirim Bhd aims to certify 50,000 domestic companies over the next two to three years – more than double the 20,000 local firms it supported last year – as part of its broader strategy to help Malaysian businesses expand globally, with a particular focus on tapping into the vast growth and revenue opportunities in India and China.

President and group CEO Datuk Dr Ahmad Sabirin Arshad said, “We are placing strong strategic focus on two of the world’s most populous and dynamic markets – China and India. Together, these nations represent nearly three billion people, accounting for a significant portion of the global population.

“Referred to symbolically as the ‘dragon’ and the ‘elephant’, missing out on these markets would be a substantial lost opportunity. That is why we are actively positioning ourselves in China and working towards establishing a presence in India.

“Additionally, as a multiracial nation with strong Chinese and Indian communities, Malaysia is uniquely positioned to leverage this diversity as a bridge into these ecosystems,” Ahmad Sabirin told SunBiz at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (Lima 2025) yesterday.

Ahmad Sabirin said Sirim is accelerating its global expansion by establishing more international offices, with the broader objective of enabling not only its own growth but also supporting the internationalisation of Malaysian small and medium enterprises.

Given the limitations of Malaysia’s relatively small market, Sirim is also strategically targeting the broader Asean region – with its population of about 680 million and substantial consumer base – as a key market, he said.

Touching on the aerospace sector, Ahmad Sabirin said as Malaysia assumes the Asean chairmanship this year, efforts are under way to position local aerospace players for regional growth, with a vision to expand beyond domestic government contracts and establish the country as a key aerospace hub in Southeast Asia – an ambition supported by ongoing collaboration between agencies such as Sirim, the Defence Ministry and regional investment partners.

“This year, Sirim is advancing its commitment to standard and technology diplomacy by extending its services to Asean member countries, including several least developed nations. Acknowledging the disparities within the region, Sirim aims to foster a more inclusive and vibrant ecosystem, with Malaysia taking a leadership role.

“Sirim hopes this initiative will align with the prime minister’s efforts to champion regional cooperation in technology, standards, and human capital development.

“In line with global sustainability goals, Sirim continues to position itself as a key enabler in Malaysia’s net zero ambitions –particularly through its long-standing work in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” Ahmad Sabirin said.

He added that Sirim is in discussions with Petroliam Nasional Bhd to explore the potential of utilising locally sourced biomass for the production of SAF, recognising its critical role in advancing Malaysia’s net-zero carbon by 2050 goal.

With an emphasis on increasing SAF adoption across sectors, including national defence, this initiative positions Malaysia as a potential pioneer in the global SAF framework, leveraging its readily available and cost-effective raw materials to support both domestic use and international supply.

“Currently, we are purchasing SAF at a higher cost. However, by shifting processing capabilities to our own country, we can export higher-value products instead of importing them, ultimately improving our trade balance through more strategic value-added production and exports,” Ahmad Sabirin said.

Last year, Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said Malaysia planned to start producing SAF in 2027, with an initial production capacity of one million tonnes per year.

The production capacity will gradually increase based on factory output and feedstock availability, the minister told parliament.

Malaysia, the world’s second-largest palm oil producer, is in a strategic position to become one of the world’s leading SAF producers, he was quoted saying in a Reuters report.

In April of this year, Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said Malaysia was set to boost its role in the global clean energy sector with the development of a world-scale SAF refinery.

The project is a result of a strategic partnership between Bin Zayed International and local biofuel pioneer FatHopes Energy.

Describing the partnership as a “game-changer” for the country’s energy and aviation sectors, Nik Nazmi said this investment would serve as a catalyst for far-reaching transformation.

“It heralds Malaysia’s arrival as a serious player in the global clean energy and low-carbon economy,“ he said at the project’s memorandum of understanding signing ceremony.

Asked about examples of Sirim’s research and development initiatives in the electric vehicle space, Ahmad Sabirin said, “For EV, we have the most complex system for the industries. Before implementing an EV system in Malaysia, patent approval is required, and it must be validated by the country’s designated petroleum and energy research institute.

“Following patent approval, all EV systems must undergo testing and certification by Sirim QAS, while battery development and testing are handled by Sirim Research – forming a comprehensive ecosystem to support national battery innovation.

“In parallel, Sirim is actively developing standards for hydrogen, particularly as several states begin hydrogen-related initiatives.

“Ensuring safety remains a top priority, with clear standards and consistent compliance frameworks being established to guide industry practices. Currently, much of the industrial focus is centred on advancing the EV sector,“ Ahmad Sabirin said.",https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x373/0c62/480d250/none/11808/VDEC/ahmad-sabirin-za_5235551_20250523174308.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:56:21.133573

“We need volume as with volume comes efficiency. Then we can sustainably produce the outputs I mentioned earlier.

“Only then can we create a green agricultural sector – non-polluting and well-managed.

“This will benefit all mills. If one place produces two tonnes, another three tonnes, it’s not enough.

“But if we combine them, it can reach 100 tonnes, which is an efficient volume to produce the desired outputs,” he said.

He highlighted Sarawak’s commitment to a circular economy, where waste is repurposed into valuable products to support sustainable agriculture in line with global Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, enabling Sarawak to earn premium prices for green products.

Abang Johari said that while Sarawak currently produces crude palm oil, mill effluent can be further processed into components of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

He cited Neste in Singapore, which turns used cooking oil into aviation fuel, as proof of waste’s revenue potential.

“Sarawak, meanwhile, uses raw materials directly from our plantations. That’s pure income going straight to our planters,” he said.

McLaren Racing highlights major sustainability gains in 2024

McLaren Racing has published its 2024 Sustainability Report, showcasing a major investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc) and continued progress in carbon reduction, circularity, and inclusion.

Backed by Ecolab, McLaren funded one million US gallons of SAF, offsetting 100% of business air travel emissions. Combined with improvements in logistics and infrastructure, the team cut overall emissions by 8.6% and achieved a 23% per-race emissions reduction compared to 2023. McLaren also recorded 37% material circularity in car chassis construction, guided by its FIA-commissioned Circularity Handbook.

This figure provides a baseline for future regulations and industry benchmarking. Internally, McLaren opened its Optimum Nutrition Performance facility at the MTC to support staff health and wellbeing. Diversity milestones included 43% of new hires from underrepresented backgrounds and 30% female representation in early careers.

Zak Brown credited collaboration and innovation for the year’s impact: “In the same year as winning the Constructors’ Championship, we’ve made real progress in environmental and social sustainability.”

Director of Sustainability Kim Wilson said high performance and sustainability go hand in hand, with data-driven decisions shaping their long-term impact. The report positions McLaren as a leader in sustainable motorsport, with clear targets for decarbonisation and cultural inclusivity.

F1 expands sustainable fuels and logistics for European season

Formula 1 has launched its most extensive sustainability push yet for the European leg of the 2025 season, with renewable fuels, centralised energy systems, and biofueled logistics forming a core part of its Net Zero by 2030 strategy.

The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix will be the first of nine European races to use a new low-carbon energy system that centralises paddock power using hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels, and battery energy storage. Supplied by Aggreko, the rollout follows successful trials from 2023 and 2024. DHL will once again provide 37 biofuel-powered trucks to transport freight across Europe, after last year’s trial yielded an 83% emissions reduction versus traditional logistics.

Meanwhile, F2 and F3 will continue to run on 100% sustainable fuel supplied by Aramco, ahead of F1’s own transition to the fuel in 2026. Formula 1 also reported a significant reduction in aviation emissions through its investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, in partnership with DHL and Qatar Airways.

Head of ESG Ellen Jones said: “We remain on track to be Net Zero by 2030, and it is new technologies and innovations such as this that will see us hit our goal.” The strategy reflects F1’s drive to decarbonise without compromising spectacle.

Over his impressive career, Thomson has been a key player in the establishment of the Canadian renewable fuels industry.
One of his many career highlights was establishing the BC Biodiesel Association (2005) and the Alberta Biodiesel Association (2006).
“These two entities led industry development in Western Canada, eventually becoming the Western Canada Biodiesel Association in 2014.
In 2015, the scope of representation expanded, and the association became Advanced Biofuels Canada Association (ABFC).","There are few people whose names are more synonymous with biofuels in Canada than Ian Thomson. Just ask Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada.

“Ian is a pioneer leader in the development of Canada’s renewable and low carbon fuel sector,” he said.

Ghatala cites Thomson’s dedication to the industry since 2002, when he first focused on the potential use of biodiesel for reducing emissions from diesel fuel engines.

“In 2002, I started looking at fuels and alternatives and zeroed in on biodiesel as something that had potential, but nobody was really doing anything with it in Western Canada,” Thomson said.

Over his impressive career, Thomson has been a key player in the establishment of the Canadian renewable fuels industry. One of his many career highlights was establishing the BC Biodiesel Association (2005) and the Alberta Biodiesel Association (2006).

“These two entities led industry development in Western Canada, eventually becoming the Western Canada Biodiesel Association in 2014. In 2015, the scope of representation expanded, and the association became Advanced Biofuels Canada Association (ABFC). ABFC is Canada’s leading renewable fuels industry organization, promoting the production and use of sustainable, low carbon fuel alternatives to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels,” Ghatala said.

Thomson served as president of the association from 2005 to 2024, stepping aside in 2025 to serve as past-president to assist the new executive team.

In 2005, Thomson co-founded the Canadian Bioenergy Corporation (CBEC), the first biodiesel distribution business in B.C. Ghatala said the company “quickly grew from importing 1,000 litres totes of U.S.-made biodiesel to establishing tankage at terminals in North Vancouver and Calgary, and shipping railcars as far east as Nova Scotia.”

While serving as president of CBEC, Thomson also worked on the Canadian biodiesel sector’s testing and standards work with the Canadian General Standards Board.

“The first quality standards for biodiesel and biodiesel blends were finalized around 2011, which were key to providing functional fuel assurance,” Ghatala said.

That same year, Thomson and his partners shut down CBEC to co-found Waterfall Advisors Group, which staffs ABFC’s operations and serves the Canadian biofuels sector with consulting expertise and coast-to-coast coverage.

Between 2010 and 2012, Thomson led the industry associations in assisting governments with adopting the first diesel fuel RFS blending regulations in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and federally with the Canadian Renewable Fuel Regulations.

“In 2013, B.C. finally implemented its ground-breaking Low Carbon Fuel Standard; and Ontario followed with its hybrid (RFS/LCFS) Greener Diesel Regulation in 2014,” Ghatala notes.

Thomson has also played a key role in helping develop what eventually became Archer Daniels Midland’s biodiesel project, which commissioned Canada’s largest biodiesel facility (320MLY) in Lloydminster, AB. in October 2013.

“At that point we had enough demand, we reckoned, to build a plant. So, with a small group of other colleagues, put together a company that eventually co-adventured with a large global agribusiness company to build the Lloydminster biodiesel plant run by Archer Daniels Midland,” Thomson recalled.

Over the next 12 years, Thomson continued to lead the way in the growth of the renewable fuels sector with milestones such as:

Assisting with the six-year regulatory development phase of the Clean Fuel Regulations that were finalized in June 2022, and became effective July 1, 2023;

Helping develop the first low carbon fuel regulations in Quebec (2023); and B.C.’s new LCFS statute and regulation (2024); which is Canada’s most stringent fuel regulation, and includes the first SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) mandate in the Americas.

“The regulations referred to above were ground-breaking achievements in Canada, and, over 2010 to 2024, they have proven to be the most successful mechanism to reduce GHGs from fossil fuel use in transportation,” Ghatala said.

Thomson gives kudos to his colleagues of two decades including dedicated and deeply knowledgeable association staff. He also flags the indispensable work of provincial governments, especially B.C., Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, and Quebec, and the federal government for helping create a friendlier environment.

“The provinces have taken real leadership in getting regulations that give the kind of assurances that people who have capital and aspirations to build production assets need,” Thomson said. “The federal government undertaking the Clean Fuels Regulations starting in 2016, and wrapping up in 2022, was great work. It took longer than we had hoped, and ended up coming full circle back to a pretty basic local carbon fuel standard, but that was a real highlight.”

Seeing the clean fuel sectors collaborating recently has also been a highlight.

“It’s way too easy for people in the alternative fuel space to feel like they have to compete with each other,” he said. “I mean, at the end of the day, they compete. But first you’ve got to collaborate to get a market, and I think we’ve seen some really effective collaborations in Canada.”

When asked what advice he would offer the next generation looking to become active in the renewable fuels sector, Thomson says to be prepared for two steps forward and one-and-a-half steps back.

“I talk with people who are graduating from engineering programs or getting into them, or wanting to get into this space, and they think everything’s going to go hydrogen. They think everything is going to go electrification,” he said. “The view that many of us in the clean fuels space have is there’s going to be a long road for high energy density, low carbon liquid fuels. Whether those are fossil fuels with significantly lower their carbon emissions, biofuels produced out of refineries with co-processing or renewable diesel, or biofuels produced in standalone biofuel plants with low carbon intensity increasingly made from a wider range of feedstocks than just agricultural crops, the need to fuel internal combustion engines is going to be around for a long time.” •",https://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lifetime-Achievement-Awards-Ian-Thomson.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 11:56:51.032490

Honeywell International has agreed to purchase Johnson Matthey’s catalyst technologies business for about $2.3 billion. It plans to combine the business with its UOP subsidiary to create a chemical process engineering and catalysis giant.

Johnson Matthey’s catalyst business generated $930 million in sales during the company’s most recent fiscal year. The business specializes in processes related to synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and is a leading provider of technology for making syngas-derived products such as ammonia, methanol, and formaldehyde.

In recent years, the UK-based firm has been applying its know-how to low-carbon chemical production. For instance, it says its autothermal reforming technology for making hydrogen from natural gas can be easily integrated with carbon capture and storage.

Honeywell’s UOP unit had 2024 sales of about $2.6 billion from processes and catalysts for refining and petrochemicals. UOP has a particularly strong position in aromatics and derivatives. It is also active in olefins with its Oleflex propane dehydrogenation technology. In recent years, UOP has added sustainable chemistry technology, such as the Ecofining process it developed with Italian energy company Eni. Ecofining makes diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste fats and oils.

Last November, UOP and Johnson Matthey signed an agreement to join forces in Fischer-Tropsch and methanol routes to fuels from feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, residual biomass, and biogas.

“Acquiring Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business will provide our customers a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to transition their businesses to high-value products with lower emissions,"" says Ken West, president of Honeywell's Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment, in the company’s announcement of the deal.

Honeywell is in the middle of an ambitious portfolio transformation that includes spinning off its Aerospace Technologies and Advanced Materials businesses. The latter business, which generated $3.8 billion in sales in 2024, makes refrigerants and Spectra ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fiber.

Johnson Matthey has been under pressure to streamline from major shareholder Standard Investments, an affiliate of Standard Industries, which owns the catalyst firm W. R. Grace. In December, Standard Investments called on Johnson Matthey to conduct a strategic review that could include the sale of all or part of itself. Standard didn’t respond to a request for comment on Johnson Matthey’s plan to sell the catalyst business.

With the sale of the catalyst technologies business to Honeywell, Johnson Matthey will be focused on its Clean Air business, which makes vehicle emissions catalysts, and platinum group metal services.

The sale price, Johnson Matthey CEO Liam Condon says in a statement, allows the company “to realise a very attractive valuation for this business that fully reflects its strong long-term growth prospects.”

Nearly 90% of the proceeds from the transaction will be paid out to shareholders. “We would expect a strong positive share price response,” says Jefferies stock analyst Charlie Bentley in a note to clients about the deal.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Honeywell-buying-Johnson-Matthey-catalyst-technologies-business---86771?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-05-24 05:56:39.826537

The legislation adopts a series of amendments to the Texas Business Organizations Code (TBOC), which governs Texas corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships and other legal entities, that are designed to make Texas more attractive for entity formation and redomestication.

Senate Bill 29

On May 14, 2025, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 (S.B. 29) into law with immediate effect. The changes to the TBOC enacted by S.B. 29 clarify areas of existing Texas law and strengthen a company’s defenses against certain types of shareholder litigation.

Business Judgment Rule Statute

S.B. 29 enacts new Section 21.419 codifying the “business judgment rule” presumption. The statute applies automatically to public corporations (any corporation with a class or series of voting shares listed on a national securities exchange) and includes an option for any private corporation to “opt-in” by including an affirmative election in its governing documents.

Directors and officers of corporations that are subject to the statute are presumed to have acted (1) in good faith; (2) on an informed basis; (3) in furtherance of the interests of the corporation; and (4) in obedience to the law and the corporation’s governing documents, in taking or declining to take any action on any matters of the corporation’s business.

Further, the statute provides that neither the corporation nor any of its shareholders has a cause of action against a director or officer as a result of any act or omission in the person’s capacity as a director or officer unless (1) the claimant rebuts one or more of the codified presumptions and (2) it is proven by the claimant that (A) the director’s or officer’s act or omission constituted a breach of the person’s duties as a director or officer and (B) the breach involved fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act or a knowing violation of law.

Advance Independence Determination

S.B. 29 also overhauls provisions of the TBOC relevant to the evaluation and approval of certain conflict of interest transactions.

Specifically, the new legislation expressly empowers a board of directors of a public corporation or a private corporation that has opted-in to the business judgment rule statute (new Section 21.419) to form a committee of independent and disinterested directors to review and approve transactions involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and a controlling shareholder, director or officer, and to petition the Texas Business Court (or the district court in the county in which the corporation’s principal place of business in Texas is located, if that county is not located within an operating division of the Texas Business Court), to seek an advance determination as to whether the directors on the committee are independent and disinterested.

The court’s determination in such a proceeding is dispositive in the absence of evidence not presented to the court that one or more of the directors is not independent and disinterested with respect to a particular transaction involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and a controlling shareholder, director or officer.

Minimum Ownership Threshold for Derivative Actions

S.B. 29 allows public corporations and private corporations that have opted-in to the business judgment rule statute and have 500 or more shareholders (at the time the derivative proceeding is instituted) to proscribe, in the corporation’s certificate of formation or bylaws, a minimum ownership threshold for shareholders that are eligible to bring a derivative lawsuit, provided that such minimum ownership threshold does not exceed three percent of the corporation’s outstanding shares.

Limitation of Books and Records Demands

For public corporations and private corporations that have opted-in to the business judgment rule statute, S.B. 29 provides that a shareholder is not entitled to bring a books and records demand if it is reasonably determined by the corporation that the demand is in connection with (1) an active or pending derivative proceeding in the right of the corporation that is or is expected to be instituted or maintained by the holder or the holder’s affiliate or (2) an active or pending civil lawsuit to which the corporation or its affiliate and the holder or the holder’s affiliate are or are expected to be adversarial.

S.B. 29 also clarifies that, for all Texas corporations, “e-mails, text messages or similar electronic communications, or information from social media accounts” are not records that may be subject to a books and records demand, unless the particular communication effectuates action by the corporation.

Limiting Recovery of Attorney’s Fees in “Disclosure Only” Settlements

Under existing provisions of the TBOC, a court may order a corporation to reimburse a plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and other litigation costs incurred in a derivative proceeding if it is determined that the proceeding has resulted in a “substantial benefit” to the corporation. Under S.B. 29, the provision is amended to provide that additional or amended disclosures made to the shareholders, regardless of materiality, are not a “substantial benefit” to the corporation.

Waiver of Jury Trial

S.B. 29 codifies the right of a Texas entity to contain in its governing documents a provision waiving the right to a jury trial concerning any “internal entity claim,” which is a claim of any nature, including a derivative claim, that is based on, arises from, or relates to the internal affairs of the entity.

Exclusive Forum Selection

S.B. 29 also codifies the right of a Texas entity to contain in its governing documents a provision stipulating one or more courts in Texas as the exclusive forum and venue for “internal entity claims.”

Class and Series Voting Rights

S.B. 29 eliminates certain mandatory separate class and series voting requirements, providing greater flexibility for a Texas corporation to structure its voting rights among different classes and series of stock. The amendment addresses one of the more significant hurdles that corporations seeking to redomicile in Texas have historically encountered, as the rigidity of the prior regime was often incompatible with the way voting rights are typically structured in certain types of corporations with multiple classes or series of stock.

Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships

While S.B. 29 will have the greatest impact on Texas corporations, the legislation also includes a number of analogous reforms for Texas limited liability companies and limited partnerships.

Senate Bill 1057

Senate Bill 1057 (S.B. 1057) was signed by Governor Abott on May 19, 2025, and will become effective on September 1, 2025. While not as expansive as S.B. 29, S.B. 1057 allows public companies with a specific nexus to Texas, either due to the location of its principal office or its decision to list its shares on one of the new Texas-based stock exchanges, the ability to “opt-in” to a statute that applies minimum ownership requirements to shareholder proposals.

A Texas corporation is eligible to opt-in to the statute by adopting an amendment to its governing documents if it (1) has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (2) is admitted to listing on a national securities exchange; and (3) either (A) has its principal office in Texas or (B) is admitted to listing on a Texas-based stock exchange.

Once a corporation has opted-in, in order to be eligible to submit a proposal on a matter to the shareholders for approval, a shareholder or group of shareholders must (1) hold an amount of voting shares of the corporation equal to at least (A) $1 million in market value or (B) three percent of the corporation’s outstanding voting shares; (2) hold the shares for a continuous period of at least six months before the date of the meeting and throughout the duration of the meeting; and (3) solicit the holders of shares representing at least 67 percent of the voting power of shares entitled to vote on the proposal.

Summary

The changes implemented by S.B. 29 and S.B. 1057 represent a significant evolution in Texas corporate law. We expect the changes will promote new entity formation in Texas and will influence many companies organized in Delaware and other jurisdictions to consider a move to Texas. We also expect many existing Texas companies to adopt amendments to their governing documents to take advantage of various features of the new legislation.

The company plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel, state officials said.
It plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system, company officials said.
“We are thrilled to welcome Green Fuels to Acadia Parish, and we’re excited that their arrival will bring good-paying jobs for our residents,” Acadia Police Jury President Beau Petitjean said.","State and regional officials confirmed earlier reports and offered new details regarding a net-zero emissions refinery that will be built in Acadia Parish, but indicated the project will employ fewer than what was initially reported.

Officials with the Louisiana Economic Development office announced the deal Friday morning with Oklahoma-based Green Fuels Operating PC that will occupy the former Evangeline Processing Facility along the Mermentau River in the southwest part of the parish.

The company will invest $110 million to transform the facility into a net-zero emissions facility and employ 60 with an average salary of $80,000.

An announcement from Clean Refineries Inc., which claims GFO as an operating subsidiary, last week indicated the plant would employ 160 and have an average salary of more than $105,000.

GFO handles the company’s daily operations at specific sites and will be over the Acadia site, a company spokesperson said. The $110 million price tag is only part of what is planned for south Louisiana, the spokesperson said.

It has a $1 billion commitment to building net-zero emissions refining facilities throughout the state.

“This project is a major first step in a much bigger effort,” Green Fuels Operating spokesperson Madison Beam said.

The company plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel, state officials said. The existing facility has 15 storage tanks that have a capacity to exceed 350,000 barrels and will remain operational while the new GFO refining unit is developed.

It plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system, company officials said. It will also source local crude to support regional producers alongside feedstock delivered via pipeline and barge.

Construction is expected to begin in November and be complete in May 2026.

“We are thrilled to welcome Green Fuels to Acadia Parish, and we’re excited that their arrival will bring good-paying jobs for our residents,” Acadia Police Jury President Beau Petitjean said. “This facility has a long history in Acadia Parish, and seeing new investment in a legacy industrial refinery is a testament to the strength of our community and the potential for new development.”

The company received a competitive incentive project from LED, including the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

“Under Louisiana’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, it is critical that we keep pace with the changing needs of the industry, including reopening and reenergizing legacy operations like Canal Companies with technology-driven strategies,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said.

In December Green Fuels Operating announced a similar refinery project in northern Oklahoma that will make jet fuel and farm-grade diesel that will be able to bought on site, reports indicate. That facility is expected to employ 30-35.

The company says its net-zero emission technology system is revolutionizing oil refining with its odor-free clean refining technology to become a world leader in low-cost, environmentally responsible hydrocarbon processing solutions.

GFO facilities produce locally needed supplies of sustainable fuels, including diesel, jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel, marine-grade bunker fuels, road and roof asphalt binders.

“America's energy independence requires more than just drilling,” GFO CEO Derek Wiliamson said. “It demands that we refine our own oil here at home rather than shipping it overseas only to buy back finished fuels at premium prices.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/e6/1e678e79-80bf-5ebe-8a6c-2a54fd543a74/6435701dc8413.image.jpg?crop=1776%2C932%2C0%2C116&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-24 05:56:48.635872

The business jet market entered 2024 with demand finally matching the calmer rhythm typical before 2020, yet orderbooks remain anything but sluggish. According to GAMA’s February 2024 shipment report, OEMs delivered 730 aircraft in 2023 and have penciled in 755 deliveries for 2024, supported by a backlog of roughly 3 100 jets—its highest level in nearly a decade. Corporate operators that delayed upgrades during the pandemic are now executing multi-year replacement schedules, particularly for aircraft manufactured between 2003 and 2009 whose maintenance costs ballooned once flight activity rebounded in 2021-2023. ARGUS TraqPak data underscore this shift: flight hours for jets older than fifteen years fell by 210 000 cycles in 2023, while hours on aircraft younger than five years climbed steadily. In the business jet market, that behavioral change signals a sustained pull for newer models, even though overall utilization growth has leveled.

OEM production lines are adjusting accordingly. Bombardier moved Global 5500 final assembly to its modernized Toronto facility, unlocking slots for more Global 8000 units. Embraer’s São José dos Campos plant, already running two shifts, has added a dedicated Phenom 100EV line to capitalize on entry-level demand. Meanwhile, Gulfstream is maintaining G400 certification timing by reallocating engineers from the nearly complete G800 program. Such realignments reveal an industry prioritizing throughput without overheating. By creating delivery positions in the 2026-2027 window, manufacturers are meeting fleet-renewal needs while insulating the business jet market from the boom-and-bust cycles that characterized earlier decades.

Ultra-Long-Range Jets Dominate Backlogs, Challenging Traditional Large-Cabin Leaders Across OEMs

A granular look at business jet market orderbooks shows that ultra-long-range models—those capable of 7,000 nautical miles or more—capture the lion’s share of fresh commitments in the business jet market. Gulfstream’s G700 accounts for nearly 580 firm orders, Bombardier’s Global 8000 has crossed the 300-order mark since its 2022 launch, and Dassault records 132 Falcon 10X positions ahead of first flight. These figures eclipse the combined backlog for traditional large-cabin types such as the G500/600 and Falcon 8X. The narrative is being driven by multinational firms seeking nonstop links between second-tier financial centers: think Los Angeles–Riyadh or Singapore–San José.

Equally significant, performance extras are no longer the sole differentiator. Cabin cross-sections above eight feet, lower 4,000-foot-equivalent pressurization, and certified altitude ceilings of 51,000 feet are proving decisive in purchase committees. In the business jet market, passengers care less about shaving ten minutes off flight time and more about arriving rested and connected. OEMs are therefore embedding dual-band Ka-satcom antennas, predictive maintenance gateways, and inflight humidification systems as baseline, not optional. The success of this segment is reshaping portfolio strategies: Textron Aviation has shelved studies for a Citation Longitude+ and is instead evaluating an all-new platform to stretch beyond 6 500 nautical miles. Meanwhile, engine makers Rolls-Royce and GE Honda Aero are accelerating next-generation core demonstrators aimed squarely at 20,000-pound-thrust applications, underscoring how the ultra-long-range wave is redirecting R&D dollars across the entire market landscape.

Corporate Sustainability Pivots Investment Toward SAF-Compatible Engine Platforms In Fleets

Environmental scrutiny is reshaping board-level aviation policies faster than any regulation. By March 2024, 27 U.S. airports consistently supplied sustainable aviation fuel, while total global SAF deliveries to business aviation reached 300 million liters, reports the Air Transport Action Group. Multinational corporations such as Microsoft, Gucci, and Siemens have begun contractually mandating that charter providers document SAF uplift per mission. Consequently, fleet managers assessing new purchases now give ample weight to fuel-burn baselines and feedstock compatibility. In the business jet market, that tilt has dramatically favored platforms powered by Rolls-Royce Pearl and Pratt & Whitney PW800 series engines, both certified for 100% SAF blends.

Concrete investment follows principle in the business jet market. Three Fortune 100 companies placed launch orders for Bombardier’s EcoJet technology demonstrator after the Canadian OEM disclosed wind-tunnel data showing a 20-meter span blended-wing body and laminar flow savings of about 1 000 pounds of fuel on a 4 000-nautical-mile leg. At the operational level, the market logged 14 500 book-and-claim SAF transactions in 2023—triple the 2021 tally and a figure already surpassed in the first four months of 2024. The market is also exploring electric taxi systems and lightweight cabin materials: F/LIST delivered 60 ship-sets of bio-resin sidewalls to two OEMs this year, demonstrating that sustainability influences not only propulsion but every specification line item. For decision-makers, the message is unambiguous—decarbonization is no longer peripheral; it is a central filter guiding purchase approvals and residual-value expectations in the evolving business jet market.

Pre-Owned Inventory Rebounds, Reshaping Pricing And OEM Production Strategies Today

After historic scarcity in 2022, the pre-owned channel is swinging back toward equilibrium in the business jet market. JetNet iQ’s Q4 2024 briefing lists 1,098 business jets actively for sale, up from 730 a year ago yet still below the 1,600 listings considered “normal” prior to 2020. Average aircraft age on market—17.4 years—and time to sell—198 days—provide granular clues to buyer sentiment: value shoppers remain disciplined, but any aircraft with deferred maintenance languishes. This incremental supply has moderated ask prices, which settled at a median $13.2 million by April 2024. That transparent correction is welcome news for corporate flight departments budgeting replacements.

OEMs are monitoring every uptick. Gulfstream dialed back G650ER production from 36 to 28 units for 2024 to avoid overlap with gently-used 2018 airframes returning from private equity owners. Textron Aviation, by contrast, saw improving Citation Latitude residuals as a green light to add seven additional white-tail slots. Such nimble responses underscore a broader truth in the business jet market: the health of the pre-owned segment directly governs factory cadence. In the market, stakeholders now treat inventory metrics with the same gravity once reserved for macro-economic indicators. Brokers expect listings to approach 1 300 jets by year-end, but they also predict more first-time owners drawn by improved choice and transparent maintenance records thanks to digital logbooks. Thus, resurgent pre-owned supply is not a harbinger of downturn; rather, it is a pressure-relief valve keeping the market balanced and credible.

Regional Hotspots Show Divergent Growth Drivers And Delivery Profiles Patterns

Region-specific data illuminate why a single global narrative rarely suffices. North America maintained its traditional lead in the business jet market with 430 deliveries in 2023, fueled by strong corporate profits and the convenience of 5 000 paved runways suitable for jets. Europe followed with 160 units, though sanctions-related airspace constraints over Russia altered routing patterns and nudged some owners toward longer-range types. Asia-Pacific recorded 72 deliveries, with India absorbing 18 of them—its highest intake on record—as family-owned conglomerates upgraded to midsize cabins to reach Africa nonstop. Meanwhile, the Middle East and North Africa accepted 40 aircraft, boosted by sovereign funds demanding ultra-long-range models for travel to the Americas. Latin America rounded out the tally with 28 deliveries, where Mexico’s fractional start-ups ordered Phenom 100EVs to serve high-elevation strips.

These granular figures reveal distinct purchase rationales in the business jet market. Whereas U.S. buyers in the market emphasize dispatch reliability, European owners increasingly highlight emissions compliance under the EU ETS cap. In Asia-Pacific, availability of skilled crews is paramount; operators spent the first quarter of 2024 recruiting 250 additional pilots, many from commercial airlines retrenching capacity. The Middle Eastern market, by contrast, measures value through bespoke cabin finishes and quick-change medevac kits. For stakeholders, acknowledging these disparate drivers is essential when forecasting opportunities or deciding where to allocate maintenance bases. A one-size-fits-all strategy no longer suffices; rather, the business jet market requires region-tuned offerings, financing terms, and support infrastructures to capture latent demand and ensure enduring customer satisfaction.

Digitalization And Cabin Connectivity Emerge As Prime Differentiators For Buyers

In 2024, connectivity has advanced from amenity to prerequisite in the business jet market. Inmarsat counts 4,500 active Jet ConneX Ka-band terminals, up 600 units year on year, while Gogo reports 1,375 Avance L5 installations. Corporate travelers treat uninterrupted video conferencing as non-negotiable; thus, aircraft lacking dual-provider redundancy face longer selling cycles. Equally transformative is predictive maintenance. Dassault’s FalconScan and Gulfstream’s PlaneConnect Fleet are now logging more than 18 terabytes of aircraft-health data every week. These streams feed digital twins that forecast component lifetimes down to singular flight legs, cutting unscheduled events. In the business jet market, such dependability translates directly into retained value and higher dispatch rates.

Cabin interfaces follow suit. Touchless controls, OLED lighting zones, and AI-assisted voice commands powered by Collins’ Venue CMS upgrade packages are penetrating retrofit programs. Moreover, cloud-based weight-and-balance apps and Bluetooth-enabled e-tasters for baggage compartments shorten pre-flight checks, enhancing operational efficiency. The uptick in digital sophistication is not purely technical; it is commercial. Financing agreements now routinely stipulate that borrowers keep flight-data-monitoring subscriptions active, allowing lessors real-time insight into asset utilization. Put simply, the business jet market treats connectivity and data transparency as baseline value propositions that influence charter rates, residual curves, and even insurance premiums. Decision makers ignoring this shift risk fielding aircraft perceived as technologically dated well before their airframe hours suggest obsolescence.

Supply Chain Constraints Easing, But Skilled Labor Gaps Remain Persistent

Parts shortages that hampered 2022 production have largely moderated. Honeywell reduced average lead times for TFE731 turbine blades to 210 days, down from 265, while Spirit AeroSystems cleared its 1,800-unit backlog of G500/600 fuselage barrels. Nevertheless, the business jet market still contends with labor bottlenecks. NBAA’s 2024 workforce study shows 13 000 open positions for A&P technicians across North America, and Embraer’s executive-jet division cites mechanic vacancies as the sole factor limiting Phenom output. OEMs are responding with apprenticeship partnerships at Wichita State, Savannah Technical College, and École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile, collectively training 1 200 students this year.

Materials availability is another nuance. Toray’s carbon-fiber allocation for private-airframe customers is stable, yet Grade-5 titanium forgings used in wing spars remain scarce, forcing Dassault to re-sequence Falcon 10X build blocks. At the same time, avionics suppliers are normalizing chip inventories: Garmin now guarantees 16-week delivery for G3000 processors, aiding on-time completions at Eclipse and HondaJet. Still, risk lurks in concentrated sub-tier vendors; a fire at a single resin plant in March 2024 briefly halted cabin floorboard production across three OEMs. Thus, vigilance is critical. Stakeholders must strengthen dual-sourcing, invest in additive manufacturing, and, most of all, attract and retain skilled labor. Only through such holistic resilience can the business jet market transition from reactive production adjustments to a sustainable cadence that meets customer expectations without compromising quality.

Leasing And Fractional Ownership Expand Access, Redefining Utilization Metrics Globally

Leasing and fractional models are rewriting the rulebook on ownership economics. NetJets operates a fleet that surpassed 1 000 aircraft in January 2024, while Flexjet’s tally stands at 270, both posting record-high flight schedules. VistaJet reported 220 000 program hours flown in 2023 and is on pace to exceed that by mid-November 2024. Ascend by Cirium counts 280 business jets under operating lease worldwide, up from 190 in 2021, reflecting stronger appetite among banks and alternative lenders. These structures offer capital-light entry points for companies hesitant to place full purchase orders yet unwilling to depend on ad-hoc charter.

Their impact ripples beyond financing. Fractional operators drive aircraft at least twice as intensively as corporate owners, pushing mid-life airframes into heavy checks sooner and thus generating MRO demand. High utilization also accelerates cabin refresh cycles, spurring interior-modification revenue streams. In the business jet market, the resulting data troves—hours flown, mission profiles, maintenance touchpoints—feed algorithms that refine residual-value forecasts and influence insurance underwriting. New entrants such as France’s OpenJet and Dubai’s JetLease also employ app-based booking platforms that integrate carbon calculators and slot-availability forecasts, satisfying the modern traveler’s craving for transparency. For decision makers, the lesson is clear: integrating leasing or fractional options into fleet strategy not only optimizes capital but also aligns with shifting expectations of flexibility, sustainability, and digital convenience that now define the forward-looking market.

From reducing emissions to promoting greener technologies, industry players must navigate complex regulations, funding constraints, and evolving customer expectations.

At the forefront of this transition is the International Air Cargo Association (TIACA), which spearheads initiatives to guide businesses—large and small—toward more sustainable operations. In this exclusive C-Suite interview, Glyn Hughes, TIACA’s Director General, shares his insights on the industry’s key challenges, the role of collaboration, and the concrete steps TIACA is taking to drive long-term sustainability in air cargo.

Leadership and innovation in sustainability For TIACA, sustainability is a broad commitment that extends beyond carbon emissions. Speaking about the TIACA BlueSky program, Hughes emphasises, “Each organisation should establish a strategy specific to their operation, encompassing environmental, waste, people, efficiency, and community aspects.” Designed to support businesses on their sustainability journey, the program assesses their current performance across key criteria. It provides a personalised dashboard with targeted insights, guiding organisations on areas for improvement.

Global collaboration for a greener future Sustainability in air cargo requires a collective effort, and TIACA has made partnerships a core part of its strategy. “TIACA very much focuses on collaboration and partnerships,” Hughes says. The organisation shares its Insights Report, Roadmap to Industry Sustainability, and other key resources across the industry. Additionally, TIACA works closely with ESG experts and hosts the annual TIACA Sustainability Awards to highlight innovative solutions driving environmental progress.

Navigating challenges in sustainable air cargo

Achieving sustainability goals is not without obstacles. “Information overload is as challenging as lack of information,” Hughes points out, noting that regulations such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, CORSIA, EU ETS, CSRD, and ReFuelEU, create complexities for businesses, particularly smaller ones. “Carbon Offsetting is a good example,” Hughes shares. “Some smaller organisations would like to offset their emissions, either on a shipment level or for a complete business activity.” To help make that process simple, TIACA launched an Invest in Climate Action platform, enabling companies to purchase carbon credits and invest in sustainable projects in developing regions.

Projects making an impact

TIACA is actively leading several initiatives to make sustainability more accessible. “As mentioned, we have our annual Sustainability Survey, Industry Sustainability Roadmap, BlueSky assessment program, Climate Action platform, and a newly launched Training library which provides numerous ESG and general cargo training solutions,” Hughes outlines. These programs offer industry-wide assessments and targeted tools to help companies take concrete steps toward sustainability.

The future of sustainable air cargo Looking ahead, TIACA is aligning its efforts with global net-zero goals. “TIACA fully supports industry net-zero by 2050 targets. We also advocate for enhancing industry action in support of the United Nations 17 SDGs,” Hughes states. This includes pushing for greater investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and the global accessibility of SAF technology.

Beyond SAF, alternative energy sources will also play a crucial role. “SAF will need to grow exponentially from the less than 1% we see today to about 65% of industry fuel usage to help achieve the net-zero target by 2050,” Hughes says. He also emphasises the importance of green hydrogen, electrification for ground transport, and AI-driven efficiency improvements in making air cargo operations more sustainable.

Tracking progress and measuring success TIACA’s sustainability surveys provide valuable insights into industry progress. “On the positive side, the industry has taken huge steps to reduce usage of single-use plastic, and has invested heavily in modern energy-efficient fleets of aircraft and ground vehicles,” Hughes shares. However, he also notes a growing gap: “We are seeing fragmentation with larger organisations having dedicated teams and strategies in place, while smaller organisations find it more of a challenge.”

Supporting smaller businesses Bridging this gap, TIACA is helping SMEs access tailored sustainability solutions. “The BlueSky program is the best vehicle as it allows a company to receive specific personalised dashboards highlighting what they are doing well and where they need to provide more attention,” Hughes explains. By providing SMEs with structured insights and resources, TIACA ensures that sustainability is not just for major players but for businesses of all sizes.

A vision for sustainable air cargo As the industry continues its journey toward sustainability, Hughes underscores the importance of a responsible and inclusive approach. “The role air cargo plays in supporting the global economy is crucial in enabling enhanced global prosperity for all. So, we must safeguard this industry by being responsible, good global citizens,” he says. Beyond environmental impact, sustainability must also address social factors, creating opportunities for all, “regardless of gender, religion, academic background, or physical abilities.”

The power of collective action For Hughes, collective action is not just beneficial—it’s essential. “Sustainability is increasingly becoming a key enabler of business with partners, customers, employees, regulators, and financial institutions demanding action. We should all therefore do what we can,” he urges. He stresses that the industry’s collective efforts will not only drive meaningful change but also help demonstrate to regulators that air cargo is capable of managing its own sustainability journey, potentially reducing the need for additional regulation.

As TIACA continues to lead the charge in sustainability, its initiatives, partnerships, and strategic programs will play a critical role in shaping the air cargo industry’s greener future.

They revealed how the use of a different catalyst material can overcome issues with current Li-CO₂ batteries, making them more commercially viable and eco-friendly.

Li-CO₂ batteries are considered to be the next frontier energy-storage technology because of their ability to greatly outperform today’s lithium-ion batteries. They have a high energy density and reduce carbon emissions by absorbing CO2. But key challenges to making the batteries commercially viable include wearing out quickly, failing to recharge and relying on expensive rare materials such as platinum.

Recharging a Li-CO₂ battery requires breaking down lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃), which is formed as part of the chemical reaction, to release lithium and CO₂.

“One of the biggest challenges with these batteries is something called ‘overpotential’ – the extra energy needed to get the reaction going. You can think of it like cycling uphill before you can coast,” explained Siddharth Gadkari, co-author of the study and lecturer in chemical process engineering.

To overcome this ‘overpotential’ requires printing the right catalyst material on the porous positive electrode. Yet these catalysts are typically made from expensive, rare metals.

The team found an alternative catalyst, caesium phosphomolybdate (CPM), which is low-cost and can be manufactured at room temperature.

To understand how CPM worked, the researchers dismantled the battery after charging and discharging to study the chemical changes inside. They found that Li₂CO₃ could be reliably built up and removed, essential for long-term use.

Computer modelling then revealed how CPM offered the ideal surface for key chemical reactions. The material was shown to make the battery stable for 107 cycles, while storing 2.5 times the amount of charge of a lithium-ion battery.

“What we’ve shown is that CPM flattens that hill, meaning the battery loses far less energy during each charge and discharge,” said Gadkari.

Daniel Commandeur, study co-author, said: “What’s exciting about this discovery is that it combines strong performance with simplicity.

“We’ve shown that it’s possible to build efficient lithium-CO₂ batteries using affordable, scalable materials – no rare metals required. Our findings also open the door to designing even better catalysts in the future.”

If commercialised, these batteries could help cut emissions from vehicles and industrial sources – and scientists even imagine they could operate on Mars, where the atmosphere is 95% CO₂.

The Surrey team will now conduct further research into how these catalysts interact with electrodes and electrolytes. They will also focus upcoming tests on evaluating how the battery performs under different CO₂ pressures.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_battery-space-green-energy-charge-icon_Credit_Dima-Zel_shutterstock_1786180883_800x500.png?itok=QgPebtzL,N,,2025-05-23 17:56:49.912969

“The acquisition of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business broadens Honeywell’s role as a world-class technology provider of critical energy needed to drive growth into the future,” said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. “As demand for diversified sources of energy continues accelerating, we will better enable Honeywell to offer the innovation our customers need.”

Complementary technology and expanded reach

Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies segment brings over 1,900 employees and a global footprint, with headquarters in London and operations across the U.S., Europe, and India. The business specializes in catalyst manufacturing and licensing of process technologies, directly complementing Honeywell’s UOP unit, which already supplies catalysts and process solutions to the refining and petrochemicals sectors.

By combining the two portfolios, Honeywell will expand its installed base and gain access to new, high-growth end markets. Customers will benefit from integrated offerings that span technology licensing, engineering, services, and catalyst supply — all designed to convert hydrocarbon and renewable feedstocks into valuable products with lower carbon intensity.

“As we continue to expand and evolve our ESS portfolio, acquiring Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business will provide our customers a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to transition their businesses to high-value products with lower emissions,” said Ken West, President and CEO of Honeywell’s ESS segment.

Strategic realignment continues

The acquisition forms part of a broader transformation at Honeywell, which is repositioning its portfolio around three core growth areas: automation, aviation, and energy transition. Earlier this year, Honeywell announced plans to spin off its Aerospace Technologies and Advanced Materials businesses, creating three standalone public companies, each with focused strategies and markets.

Since December 2023, Honeywell has undertaken several major transactions to reshape its industrial portfolio. These include acquiring Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, the LNG business from Air Products, Sundyne, and Carrier Global’s Access Solutions division. Concurrently, the company has moved to divest its Personal Protective Equipment business, which is expected to close by mid-2025.

These transactions align with Honeywell’s capital deployment strategy and aim to drive organic growth, simplify operations, and strengthen the company’s core capabilities in technology and process automation.

Accelerating the energy transition

Honeywell’s growing ESS division has become a cornerstone of its push into cleaner, more efficient energy solutions. The integration of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies is expected to not only expand the division’s technology offerings but also help global customers advance their decarbonization goals.

The combined portfolio will enable refiners and chemical producers to navigate stricter emissions regulations and shifting energy demand by providing a full set of tools for sustainable production. Technologies aimed at converting feedstocks to SAF, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia are particularly attractive in light of rising demand for cleaner alternatives in aviation and industrial sectors.

The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2026.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20250523-144515-Johnson-Matthey.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 16:56:50.428470

The energy and chemicals company used an iron-vanadium flow battery as a backup solar power source for gas well operations. Developed with partner Rongke Power, the battery flow system can support up to five wells over its projected 25-year lifespan, Aramco said in a news release.

“Flow batteries store energy in liquid electrolytes separately from battery cells, and electrolytes pumped into the cell convert chemical energy into electricity,” the company said. “In addition to providing energy independence, flow batteries can be repeatedly discharged and recharged with minimal capacity loss. They also reduce fire risks compared to other types of batteries, while their modular design makes them easier and less costly to maintain.”

The milestone was reached as the company continues efforts to reduce emissions across its assets. Aramco already uses solar energy to power some of its remote gas wells connected to lead-acid battery systems. However, the flow battery system offers another sustainable opportunity.

Ali A. Al-Meshari, senior vice president of technology oversight and coordination for Aramco, called the system a breakthrough for the oil and gas sector.

“This is just one example of how Aramco is developing and deploying advanced technologies with the aim of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing emissions across its operations,” he said.

Neste, FedEx Seal Deal For Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer Neste has inked an agreement to supply FedEx with more than 3 million gallons of blended SAF for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

FedEx on May 20 said the fuel it purchased includes a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY SAF. As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly one-fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX, based on fiscal-year 2025 fuel forecasts, the package deliverer said. Neste’s SAF is made completely from renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of environmental affairs at FedEx. “As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Fuel delivery started earlier in May and is expected to continue throughout the next year, according to the news release.

Infinium Begins Construction of eFuels Facility in Texas

Efuels producer Infinium has started construction of its Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy-backed Project Roadrunner eFuels production site in Reeves County, Texas, near Pecos, according to a May 19 news release.

Chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels, eFuels are made with waste CO2 and renewable energy.

The project will produce about 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products when it becomes operational. That would make it the world’s largest eFuels production facility, according to the release.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

In related news, Electric Hydrogen announced May 19 its 100-megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant was selected for Project Roadrunner. Electric Hydrogen said its modular solution lowers hydrogen total installed project costs by up to 60% compared to other electrolyzer solutions.

The eFuels facility is expected to begin commercial e-fuels production in 2027.

E3 Lithium, Pure Lithium Progress Lithium Extraction, Battery Technology

Initial results of a study show lithium concentrate made by E3 Lithium can produce battery-ready lithium metal anodes using Pure Lithium’s technology, according to a May 22 news release.

As part of the study, E3 said several variations of its lithium chloride concentrate were used to make lithium metal anodes at Pure Lithium’s Boston facility. The lithium chloride was electrodeposited as pure lithium metal onto a copper substrate to create battery ready anodes, which were then assembled by Pure Lithium into batteries.

“The results of this study concluded that an easily producible version of E3’s lithium concentrate provided the most cost-effective feedstock for use in Pure Lithium’s batteries,” E3 said in the release. “It also demonstrated the robustness of Pure Lithium’s process, showing no performance differences between batteries made using lithium chloride from E3’s Leduc Brines, and those made from Pure Lithium’s standard sources.”

Results, according to the news release, showed the brine streams all achieved a very high purity level, greater than 99.9% pure lithium metal; and cells achieved over 500 cycles to date.

E3 said it continues to collaborate with Pure Lithium to develop and plan an integrated process capable of delivering the highest purity, lowest cost lithium metal anodes.

USGS: Geothermal Energy in Nevada’s Great Basin Could Play Larger Role

(Reuters) Geothermal energy in the Great Basin of Nevada and adjoining states could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply, the U.S. Geological Survey said May 22.

The projected 10% would be a major increase, considering geothermal energy currently contributes less than 1% to the nation’s power supply, the agency said in a note.

“Provisional assessment shows potential for 135 gigawatts of baseload power—if current technology works at scale in Nevada and 5 adjoining states,” it noted.

Geothermal energy refers to heat generated within the Earth that can be harnessed for uses including heating, cooling and electricity generation.

With adequate technological advancements in coming years, the geothermal potential in the Great Basin is sufficient to fulfill a significant portion of the nation's electrical requirements, the agency added.

Following the assessment in the Great Basin, the next region to be evaluated will be the Williston Basin in North Dakota, according to the agency.

Hydrogen

Deutsche ReGas Gets EU Funding for Lubmin Hydrogen Project

(Reuters) Deutsche ReGas on May 21 said it will receive 112 million euros (US$126.97 million) worth of public grants from the EU’s Hydrogen Bank for a renewable hydrogen project at Lubmin on Germany’s Baltic Sea coast.

The grant comes under EU funding schemes to promote electrolysis processes that use carbon-free electricity to kick-start a local economy producing hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels.

ReGas said the hydrogen production at Lubmin, for which the funding will be spread over 10 years, can cut 1.6 MMmt of CO2.

The EU subsidy is designed to help to close price differences between green hydrogen production costs and conventional energy prices.

The funding was awarded in a 992 million-euro auction, the second for the Hydrogen Bank, in which 15 projects from five countries were awarded money, ReGas said in a statement.

ReGas is a private developer and operator of energy infrastructure, including floating storage and regasification units and hydrogen electrolyzers.

The Lubmin plant, located near where ReGas used to import LNG on a floating reception terminal in the aftermath of the 2022 energy crisis, aims to make use of access to offshore wind energy and Baltic Sea water that can be used in the electrolysis process to make hydrogen. It is also close to both power transmission grids and a new hydrogen core transport network, set to start between 2025 and 2032.

""These solutions support our goal for 100% clean and renewable energy and will add new generation to the grid in these markets,” said Urvi Parekh, global head of energy for Meta.

The agreements lift AES’ contractual arrangements with major global hyperscalers to 10.1 gigawatts (GW), the company said.

“By providing energy solutions that offer fast time-to-power and low-cost electricity, we continue to be the partner of choice for companies, like Meta, at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation,” said AES President and CEO Andrés Gluski.

TotalEnergies Flips On Its Largest Solar Project in Europe

Paris-based oil major TotalEnergies has inaugurated a cluster of five solar projects in Seville, Spain, that together make the company’s largest solar field in Europe.

Combined, the solar projects have an installed capacity of 263 MW and the ability to produce 515 gigawatt hours per year of electricity, the company said May 22 in a news release. That is equivalent to the amount needed to power 150,000 households. The field has about 400,000 bifacial solar panels with trackers.

Olivier Jouny, senior vice President of renewables at TotalEnergies, said the project contributes to Spain’s goal of having renewables make up 80% of its energy mix by 2030. “With our 1,700 employees in Spain, we are building a competitive integrated power portfolio that combines renewables and flexible gas-fired power plants to deliver clean firm power to our customers,” Jouny said.

Most of the electricity produced will be sold via long-term power purchase agreements, and the rest sold on the wholesale market.

India’s Reliance to Start Solar Module Factory This Year, Exec Says

(Reuters) Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries will start its solar photovoltaic modules factory this year, a company executive said May 22.

“We are today building three bigger factories ... in order to produce clean energy requirements,” said Partha P. Maitra, president of strategy and initiatives at Reliance Industries.

India has been scrambling to meet its clean energy targets after falling short in 2022.

Over the past year, the country has ramped up investments in the sector, but needs to double capacity additions over the next five years to meet its target of 500-GW non-fossil power capacity by 2030, a Global Energy Monitor report showed.

Reliance aims to eventually scale up solar module capacity to 20 GW per year, Maitra said.

Its battery and micro power electronics factory will start next year, he said.

“If it happens we will be the no. 2 solar PV producer in the world. We will produce roughly 14% of total solar PV modules outside China,” the executive said.

Doral Renewables Secures $1.5B in Financing for Mammoth Solar Projects

Philadelphia-based Doral Renewables has closed on $1.5 billion of debt and tax equity financing for solar projects that are part of its 1.3-GW Mammoth Solar facility, the company said May 19.

The construction financing is for the Mammoth South, Mammoth Central I and Mammoth Central II projects, which each have a capacity of 300 MW and long-term power purchase agreements with utilities in place. Combined, the three solar projects—located in Indiana’s Pulaski County—will utilize more than 1 million U.S.-made solar panels, Doral said in the news release.

“We are thrilled to close these landmark financings in support of the construction of the remaining three phases of our Mammoth Solar project,” Doral Renewables CFO Evan Speece said.

KeyBanc Capital Markets, Banco Santander and HSBC Bank USA acted as coordinated lead arrangers for the $1.3 billion construction debt financing for the projects, which consisted of $412 million of construction-to-term loan facilities, $614 million of tax equity bridge loans and a $259 million letter of credit facility, according to the release

Doral also executed its first tax equity with Truist Bank, which made a more than $200-million tax equity commitment for Mammoth South.

Marathon Capital Markets served as the tax equity adviser, while McDermott Will & Emery provided legal counsel to Doral. CCA Group served as the tax equity adviser and Milbank LLP provided tax equity legal counsel to Truist. Norton Rose Fulbright provided legal counsel to the lenders, according to the release.

The three solar projects are scheduled to begin commercial operations in fourth-quarter 2026.

Wind

Equinor, Polenergia Agree on Polish Offshore Wind Project

(Reuters) Norway’s Equinor and Poland’s Polenergia made a final investment decision for the project to build two wind farms off the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea, the Warsaw-based company said May 19.

The two farms, each with a generation capacity of 720 MW are set to cost a total of about 6.4 billion euros (US$7.20 billion) and start generating power in 2027 and be completed in 2028.

Investors—including PGE, Orlen, Equinor and Ørsted—are developing 6 GW of offshore capacity along the Polish coast set to come online by 2030. Auctions for projects in the second round are planned for 2025.

Poland is boosting offshore potential in the Baltic Sea estimated to be as high as 33 GW, according to the Polish Wind Energy Association.

Denmark Plans Offshore Wind Tender with up to $8.3B Subsidy

(Reuters) Denmark will launch an offshore wind tender with a capacity of 3 GW, enough to power three million homes, its energy ministry said May 19, offering subsidies to developers of up to 55.2 billion Danish crowns (US$8.32 billion).

The offshore wind industry has grappled with skyrocketing costs, higher interest rates and supply chain bottlenecks—prompting governments to halt or postpone tenders due to a lack of interest from bidders.

“We need more secure green power and energy to make Denmark and Europe independent of energy from Russia,” Energy Minister Lars Aagaard said in a statement.

The bids offered in the tender will determine the level of subsidy needed, with a cap set at 55.2 billion crowns over 20 years.

“It is the bid price and the development of electricity prices that determine whether it will be necessary to support the projects, or whether money will come to the state,” the ministry said.

Denmark in January announced it would halt all ongoing offshore wind tenders to revamp its model, saying that a framework where no subsidies were offered did not work under existing market conditions.

A month earlier, the Nordic country failed to attract any bids in its biggest offshore wind tender yet, with analysts pointing to a rigid auction model and a failure to adapt to a changed economic reality for renewable energy projects.

Infinium will be using Electric Hydrogen's HYPRPlant technology in its Project Roadrunner, which will produce sustainable aviation fuel and other eFuels at a location near Pecos.

Robert Schuetzle, Infinium chief executive officer

""We do use waste CO2 as an input and have a great partner in Kinetik Holdings.""

Project Roadrunner will also provide revenue streams for its oil and gas partners by turning CO2 into a commodity.

He noted the company has built facilities in West Texas before and found it to be a great experience with a great labor market. Reeves County has also been business-friendly, he added.

The project will create a number of jobs in West Texas. Schuetzle said it will create many construction jobs and jobs for its contractors. Long-term, it will create jobs in operations, maintenance, logistics and field management.

Currently under construction, Roadrunner has secured 150 megawatts of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement. Schuetzle said Infinium also has the ability to tap into the electric grid so the plant can run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Infinium selected electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100-megawatt HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility, but will also have the capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities. Electric Hydrogen’s proprietary electrochemical stacks are built at its Massachusetts gigafactory while the chemical process modules are manufactured in Texas.

Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s chief executive officer and co-founder

""This cutting-edge project exemplifies how low-cost, industrial-scale clean hydrogen production will drive new markets for American-made fuels and support the buildout of domestic manufacturing facilities.""

A majority of the sustainable aviation fuel that will be produced will be exported, said Schuetzle.

""I see us being similar to the way liquefied natural gas grew — an abundant U.S. resource that generates fuel and exports it,"" he said.

In a defining moment for the aviation industry’s sustainability journey, Etihad Airways has stepped into the spotlight by co-hosting the IATA Regional Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Workshop 2025 in Abu Dhabi, the heart of aviation innovation in the Middle East. Held on May 22–23, this high-stakes gathering of global airline leaders, policymakers, and environmental strategists marks a turning point in the push for a greener future in flight.

As aviation grapples with mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediate, viable solution. But SAF adoption is still in its infancy. High costs, limited availability, and fragmented policies remain major hurdles. The Abu Dhabi workshop aims to break through those barriers—with urgency and purpose.

Building a SAF-Powered Future Begins in Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi, already known for bold moves in clean energy and future-forward aviation, provided a fitting stage for this workshop. With Etihad co-hosting alongside IATA and the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority, the event positioned the emirate as a regional champion for climate-aligned aviation.

The two-day agenda brought together airlines, airports, fuel producers, and regulators to focus on one mission—scaling sustainable fuel at speed. Discussions centered on policy harmonization, operational challenges, and the economics of SAF implementation.

What’s Driving the SAF Conversation in 2025?

Demand for air travel is back. But so are climate concerns. Industry leaders now face a critical inflection point: grow without compromise. That’s where SAF comes in.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. It’s the aviation sector’s most powerful tool in meeting global climate targets. However, to move from pilot projects to mainstream adoption, key systems must align—supply chains, certifications, financial models, and regulatory frameworks.

That’s why this workshop matters. It’s more than a networking event—it’s an engine for action.

From Strategy to Implementation: Inside the Workshop

Participants explored the latest global policy trends shaping SAF uptake. Experts dissected the SAF lifecycle assessment, ensuring that what’s labeled “sustainable” actually delivers measurable climate benefits.

The event also unveiled the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, which includes tools for tracking fuel usage, verifying claims, and aligning with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) compliance.

Moreover, the introduction of the CADO SAF Registry and SAF Matchmaking platform showcased how digital innovation can boost transparency, collaboration, and investment in the SAF space.

Etihad’s Role: More Than a Host—A Climate Catalyst

Etihad isn’t just participating—it’s leading. The airline has been at the forefront of sustainable aviation, conducting SAF trials, investing in fuel research, and aligning its fleet strategy with long-term emissions goals.

By co-hosting this IATA workshop, Etihad reinforced its commitment not only to climate leadership but to regional transformation. It’s sending a signal to other Middle Eastern carriers, policymakers, and investors: the time for SAF isn’t “someday”—it’s now.

Why Collaboration Is the Only Way Forward

One of the workshop’s central messages was clear—no single actor can scale SAF alone. The entire aviation value chain must come together: airlines, refineries, airports, government agencies, and financiers.

Scaling production, reducing costs, and improving accessibility will require shared risk, bold policy, and a common goal. And workshops like this accelerate that alignment.

More importantly, creating price parity with fossil fuels is essential. Until SAF becomes commercially practical, even the most climate-conscious carriers face impossible economics.

The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Passengers and the Planet

As airlines incorporate more SAF into their operations, travelers will feel the impact. Some may soon have the option to offset emissions directly by selecting SAF-powered flights. Corporate travel programs may start demanding SAF usage. Ticketing systems could evolve to reflect a new layer of eco-conscious booking.

Beyond the customer experience, the adoption of SAF contributes to real-world environmental gains—cleaner air, lower emissions, and more resilient ecosystems. And every flight powered by SAF moves the industry closer to a net-zero future.

A Defining Year for Aviation’s Green Transition

The IATA Regional SAF Workshop 2025 comes at a moment when the aviation sector is under global scrutiny. Climate activists, regulators, and even travelers are calling for urgent change.

A scathing short-seller report from Culper Research accused the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft company of systematically misleading investors about its development progress. The report alleges everything from timeline misrepresentations to questionable flight test claims.

As someone who covers Archer Aviation regularly, I'll admit the report raises some legitimate concerns that deserve investor attention. But after reviewing the evidence and considering the broader context, I'm not selling my shares. Here's why.

Aviation timelines are notoriously optimistic

Let's start with the elephant in the room: Yes, Archer Aviation's publicly stated development timelines are likely highly optimistic. The company has repeatedly accelerated its commercial launch targets, most recently promising United Arab Emirates (UAE) operations by late 2025 despite originally targeting 2026.

But here's the thing: This is incredibly common in the aviation industry, and doubly so for an entirely new form of flight like electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner was delayed by more than three years. Airbus's A380 faced similar setbacks. SpaceX has missed countless launch deadlines (though they eventually deliver). The Federal Aviation Administration's certification processes are notoriously unpredictable.

When you're pioneering electric aircraft that take off like helicopters and fly like airplanes, delays should be expected -- not shocking. The real question isn't whether Archer Aviation hits every timeline. It's whether the company is making credible technical progress toward commercial viability.

The ""fraud"" thesis feels overblown

Culper Research's core argument is that Archer Aviation is purposely misleading shareholders. They've taken what could be called a ""short sell with receipts"" approach -- citing documented timeline discrepancies and selectively analyzed footage as evidence of deception.

I'll give Culper credit: They did their homework. The inconsistencies between Archer Aviation's public statements and internal communications with the Salinas Fire Department are concerning and merit clarification. The photos showing Archer Aviation's Midnight aircraft in partial assembly in April 2025, shortly after claiming it was ""fully assembled,"" deserve a direct response.

Unfortunately, Archer Aviation's response so far has been defensive and dismissive. In its only public refutation of these claims as of this writing, the company stated: ""Christian Lamarco has a reputation for 'shorting and distorting' various stocks. Culper is not a credible research institution... His claims are baseless.""

That's not good enough. Investors aren't looking for character attacks -- they're looking for specifics. A transparent response about development challenges and certification progress would go much further in restoring confidence.

That said, Culper's leap from timeline slippage to deliberate fraud feels like a stretch. There's a meaningful difference between aggressive projections and systemic deceit. Most of what Culper surfaces reads like standard aerospace growing pains -- ambitious messaging on the front end; reality catching up on the back end.

The UAE launch is essentially immaterial

Much of the current controversy revolves around whether Archer Aviation can launch commercial operations in the UAE by late 2025. But here's a crucial point: The UAE launch is essentially irrelevant to the long-term thesis.

The core opportunity is FAA certification for operations in the U.S. -- where the real demand, revenue potential, and infrastructure scale exist. A pilot program in Abu Dhabi may help build brand equity or validate operational procedures, but it won't meaningfully change Archer Aviation's long-term value.

In fact, it's increasingly clear that the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are shaping up to be the real commercial debut. If Archer Aviation can operate aircraft safely and reliably during the Games, that could serve as a massive proof of concept for urban air mobility.

Premier partners don't waste time on questionable technology

This is where Culper's short thesis starts to crack. If Archer Aviation's technology were truly broken or years behind, why are serious industry players lining up to back it?

Palmer Luckey's Anduril Industries just signed an exclusive agreement with Archer Aviation to co-develop hybrid vertical aircraft for the Department of Defense. Luckey isn't known for backing unproven concepts. His defense start-up beat out Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman in the Air Force's autonomous systems program.

Then there's Palantir Technologies, which signed on to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into Archer Aviation's flight systems and manufacturing stack. CEO Alex Karp personally announced the partnership at Palantir's AIPCon event.

United Airlines and Stellantis also re-upped their investments in Archer Aviation earlier this year, as part of a $430 million funding round. United brings operational expertise. Stellantis brings scale manufacturing and capital discipline.

These companies don't enter long-term agreements lightly. If Archer Aviation's aircraft were fundamentally unworkable, these partnerships wouldn't exist.

Defense vs. commercial development timelines

One point the short report largely ignores: Defense applications follow different timelines and certification pathways than commercial passenger transport.

Archer Aviation already has a $142 million contract from the U.S. Air Force and is delivering aircraft for evaluation. These defense-grade aircraft don't need FAA certification for combat or logistics roles. That means Archer Aviation could begin generating real revenue from defense use cases while commercial approval is still pending.

The Anduril partnership enhances this pathway. Military applications of electric vertical takeoff and landing technology could materialize faster than passenger mobility, giving Archer Aviation a second viable market.

A long-term investment remains long-term

Let me be clear: Archer Aviation has always been a high-risk, long-duration investment. The recent share price surge doesn't change the fundamental truth that aviation is hard, slow, and unforgiving.

Designing a new type of aircraft is hard. Certifying it is harder. Building out infrastructure and proving commercial viability? That's the ultimate challenge.

But that's also why the opportunity exists. If Archer Aviation succeeds, it won't just sell a few aircraft -- it will redefine how people move across congested urban corridors. The market potential remains enormous.

Culper's report is a useful reminder to stay grounded in execution realities. But it doesn't invalidate the broader thesis. Archer Aviation remains one of the best-positioned players in a field that could reshape the future of mobility.

The investment thesis remains intact

Yes, Archer Aviation faces real challenges. And yes, investors deserve a more substantive response to Culper's allegations.

But the long-term reasons to own this stock are unchanged. Strategic partnerships with heavy hitters Anduril, Palantir, United Airlines, and Stellantis point to real traction. Defense contracts offer an alternative path to revenue while the FAA certification process plays out. And the 2028 Olympics are a credible commercial milestone.

I didn't invest in Archer Aviation because I thought they'd hit every target on time. I invested because the upside of electric vertical flight is massive -- and because Archer Aviation is building serious partnerships to make it happen.

That's why I'm holding my shares.

HON has been actively following its business transformation strategy that aims to unlock value for its shareholders. As part of the strategy, the company recently sold its Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) business to Protective Industrial Products, Inc. (“PIP”).

PIP, a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment Partners, is engaged in manufacturing and distributing PPE products globally. It’s worth noting that the transaction was valued at $1.325 billion and was carried out in cash.

The divestiture will enable Honeywell to focus more on its core businesses and realign its operating segments to three megatrends, which are automation, the future of aviation and energy transition. The company’s PPE divestment follows the sale of its Lifestyle and Performance Footwear business in 2021 and allows it to exit the PPE sector.

Concurrently, Honeywell declared its plan to acquire Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business unit for £1.8 billion in cash. Based in London, UK, the Catalyst Technologies business provides catalysts for the chemicals and energy industries with operations in the United States, Europe and India.

The inclusion of Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies unit will enable HON to strengthen its UOP business and grow its installed base across the petrochemical and refining catalysts. The buyout will allow Honeywell to provide solutions for the production of low-emission fuels like sustainable aviation fuel, sustainable methanol, blue ammonia and blue hydrogen. HON will incorporate the Catalyst Technologies business into its Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) segment.

Honeywell anticipates the buyout to be accretive to its earnings in the first year, strengthen the ESS segment’s growth potential and create cost synergies. Management expects the transaction to be completed in the first half of 2026, conditioned on the fulfillment of certain customary closing conditions.

Zacks Rank & Price Performance

Honeywell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s Aerospace segment is witnessing solid momentum, driven by strength in the defense business and growth in air transport flight hours. Strong demand across the commercial aviation aftermarket business is aiding the segment.

In the past year, HON stock has gained 12% compared with the industry’s 7.9% growth.

However, weakness in the Process solutions business, due to lower demand for smart energy and thermal solutions, has been affecting the Industrial Automation segment's performance. Also, softness in the productivity solutions and services business, owing to lower demand in Europe, remains a concern.

When it comes to the airline industry, reputation is everything. It influences loyalty, attracts new passengers, drives revenue growth and shapes brand strength in an increasingly competitive market.

Word of mouth, online and off, still remains one of the most powerful factors in how reputations are built, maintained, or damaged. At CARMA, a global media intelligence and reputation consultancy, we set out to understand what really drives airline reputation in today’s climate. Focussing on two of the most emotive topics, accessibility and sustainability, we analysed how they are reflected across the media, in social media conversations and passenger perception.

For our study with Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX), we conducted a comprehensive year-long study tracking more than 55,000 articles across traditional and social media. The analysis covered 12 leading global airlines, including British Airways, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic across the UK, US, UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.

It will come as little surprise that sustainability remained one of the most pressing issues in aviation throughout last year, given the industry’s environmental footprint. The topic received significant media attention, with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dominating much of the conversation. The broader landscape includes a range of other initiatives, from sustainable aircraft interiors and low-impact materials to innovations aimed at reducing carbon emissions across the travel experience.

Overall, the study found over half (53%) of news and mentions of aviation-related sustainability had positive sentiment, reflecting increasing recognition and encouragement of the industry’s efforts. Neutral sentiment made up a quarter (25%) of news and negative coverage stood at 22%, showing a mix of both optimism and scrutiny. Interestingly, the UK led the charge in discussions around sustainability, with 37% of coverage, closely followed by the US at 36%, highlighting the strong focus on aviation sustainability in these regions. Here, the breakdown of sentiment highlights the growing importance of sustainability in the airline sector, not just as an operational priority, but as a reputational driver closely tracked by both the media and passengers. Positive responses to meaningful sustainability efforts and achievements suggest these initiatives are well received and increasingly expected.

Our study also found that while discussions around inclusivity and accessibility in aviation have increased over recent years, reflecting greater awareness of passengers’ diverse needs, the volume of media discussions is relatively low. In 2024, accessibility accounted for just 1.2% of airline coverage and 2% of social media posts, suggesting that while accessibility is recognised as important, it has not yet broken through as a dominant media trend. Most of the coverage was neutral in tone (61%), with 30% positive and only 9% negative. The UK led in accessibility-related reporting with 43% of all coverage, followed by the US at 37% and the UAE at 11%.

One of the biggest spikes in accessibility reporting occurred last September, when Virgin Atlantic received widespread attention for its partnership with deaf Gladiators star Jodie Ounsley and deaf twin content creators, Hermon and Heroda Berhane. The trio were invited to test and provide feedback on recent improvements made for deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers, with insights to be shared with the airline’s Accessibility Advisory Board. The strong media response of 197 articles in just one day shows how impactful a major airline’s efforts can be, especially when tied to authentic partnerships with influential figures. Perhaps most importantly, it reflects a growing appetite for meaningful accessibility advancements within the industry.

As the airline industry faces increasing demand (and scrutiny) for sustainability and accessibility, it is clear that innovation and collaboration will be key drivers of success. For airline professionals, designers and aviation interiors experts, there is an opportunity to influence the future of passenger experience by shaping environments that are not only sustainable but also inclusive.

The growing attention on these topics in mainstream and social media signals a shift in passenger expectations and demands. However, while sustainability has steadily gained traction in media narratives, accessibility still receives comparatively limited attention. To bring these conversations further into the spotlight, airlines and industry players must be more proactive in amplifying their work, turning thoughtful design and meaningful initiatives into compelling, shareable stories.

For professionals across the sector, this is an opportunity to lead with innovative thinking, leveraging both sustainability-driven solutions and inclusive strategies. Those who embrace these challenges will not only enhance their brand reputation but will also help shape the future of air travel.

Congressional Biofuels Caucus Co-chairs Adrian Smith (R-NE), Angie Craig (D-MN), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Julie Fedorchak (R-ND), and Nikki Budzinski (D-IL) released the following statements celebrating the launch of the caucus for the 119th Congress and welcoming new Co-chairs Hinson, Fedorchak, and Budzinski.

“American biofuel producers have an untapped ability to power the future of liquid fuels, whether ethanol blends, biodiesel, or sustainable aviation fuel,” said Co-chair Smith. “Advancing sound policy can unlock billions of dollars in savings at the pump and hundreds of thousands of added jobs for the American people. I thank Co-chairs Craig and Pocan and congratulate Co-chairs Hinson, Fedorchak, and Budzinski for joining me to strengthen this bipartisan caucus and continue working to inform our colleagues in the House of the value of biofuels for American energy abundance.”

“Increasing the production and availability of homegrown biofuels is a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to the all-of-the-above energy policy we need to stay ahead,” said Co-chair Craig. “I’m proud to be relaunching the Biofuels Caucus alongside my bipartisan colleagues this Congress so we can continue our work to lower prices at the pump, create opportunities for local producers and strengthen our energy security.”

“Biofuels are key to Iowa’s economy and key to American energy dominance,” said Co-chair Hinson. “Since coming to Congress, I have worked tirelessly to expand access to Iowa biofuels and support Iowa’s biofuels producers by fighting to secure permanent year-round E15, increase biofuels blending targets, and replace foreign energy with homegrown biofuels. I’m honored to co-lead the biofuels caucus and will continue working with President Trump and other caucus members to increase domestic energy production and support Iowa agriculture.”

“I am glad to join my colleagues in the Congressional Biofuels Caucus,” said Co-chair Pocan. “Corn growers in Wisconsin deserve to have an even playing field in the market dominated by the oil and gas industry. This Caucus will showcase how biofuels can help us reach our emissions reduction goals while investing in rural jobs and infrastructure.”

“Biofuels are a growing part of America’s energy strategy and another way North Dakota is helping fuel the world,” said Co-chair Fedorchak. “It’s an honor to serve as a co-chair of this bipartisan caucus to advance policies that will help expand domestic energy production, empower rural America, and deliver practical solutions for North Dakotans.”

“I came to Congress to be a strong voice for the people of Central and Southern Illinois—especially our hardworking farmers. Few issues are more critical to their success than strengthening the biofuels industry and expanding market opportunities,” said Co-chair Budzinski. “That’s why promoting the use of homegrown, sustainable biofuels has been a central focus of my work in Congress, and I’m looking forward to continuing that commitment as co-chair of this bipartisan caucus.

Keolis Commuter Services, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s operations and maintenance partner for the Commuter Rail, has launched an alternative fuel pilot utilizing renewable diesel for some locomotives. Usage of renewable diesel will cut emissions and reduce the system’s carbon footprint, helping the Commonwealth reach emissions reduction goals.

Developed in partnership with the MBTA, the pilot includes all locomotives that lay over at the Newburyport Commuter Rail facility, which are now being fueled with Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil. HVO is a much more sustainable alternative as it’s made from vegetable oil and animal fats and emits less carbon than fossil diesel.

“We’re pleased to partner with Keolis on this renewable diesel pilot as we continuously seek ways to reduce our carbon footprint,” said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng. “Testing alternative fuel sources for our Commuter Rail fleet joins other efforts at the T to lower our carbon emissions, and we look forward to evaluating the results of the pilot as we continue to increase resiliency across the system.”

“Getting people out of their cars and onto the train is a great first step, and we need to do more if we are going to reach the Commonwealth’s emissions goals,” said Abdellah Chajai, CEO and General Manager of Keolis. “This pilot program is a great opportunity to utilize an innovative new approach and can reduce CO2 emissions by more than 70% for these locomotives compared to fossil diesel. We’re pleased to partner with the MBTA to make this pilot project a success.”

So far, Keolis has seen steady locomotive performance with the use of renewable diesel. At the end of the pilot program, Keolis and MBTA will evaluate the performance of the renewable fuel and decide if it can be expanded to other locations across the Commuter Rail system.

Renewable diesel allows the MBTA and Keolis to more rapidly make strides towards cutting the Commuter Rail’s carbon footprint with the existing fleet.

Keolis Commuter Services has operated and maintained the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s commuter rail system, the sixth largest commuter rail operation in North America, for over ten years. KCS is a subsidiary of Keolis North America (KNA), both headquartered in Boston, and employs approximately 2,500 people throughout the region. KCS and KNA are part of Keolis Group, an innovative global leader in transit services with more than a century of passenger transportation experience and operations in 13 countries.

These shifts won’t just change how climate targets are set - they’ll reshape what climate leadership looks like beyond compliance.","This article has been provided by Ruaridh Welsh, consultant at EcoAct, a subsidiary of Schneider Electric.

In March, the SBTi launched the draft of its revised Corporate Net-Zero Standard for public consultation.

The update marks an important step forward in aligning corporate net-zero strategies with climate science. With changes to how companies are categorised, strengthened expectations on emissions reduction, and new guidance on removals and transparency, the draft standard aims to close the credibility gap in climate target-setting.

This revision comes amid growing concern about the gap between global climate ambition and action. Despite over 90% of global GDP being covered by national net-zero pledges, the UN’s latest Emissions Gap Report suggests the world remains on track for a 2.7°C rise this century. For businesses, this makes the case for more credible, science-aligned pathways clear—and urgent.

At EcoAct, we believe that true leadership in sustainability isn’t about ticking boxes or meeting minimum standards. It’s about delivering tangible, impactful results that align with global priorities. While it is still under consultation, businesses delaying action in anticipation of the upcoming guidance may fall behind, whereas early movers who have built science-based reduction strategies and are already implementing robust climate transition plans will be better positioned to adapt.

Here’s what the revised standard means for your business.

A more inclusive standard that reflects company context

One of the most notable changes is the introduction of differentiated requirements based on company size and geography. Larger businesses in high-income countries are classified under Category A and must meet all the standard’s criteria. Meanwhile, smaller firms in lower-income regions are placed in Category B, where some elements of the standard become optional.

This is a shift toward a more inclusive, globally relevant framework. For large corporates, the message is clear: the flexibility of earlier years is gone. With more resources comes more responsibility, and full compliance is expected. For smaller businesses, especially those operating in emerging markets, the updated approach offers recognition of their more limited capacity to act.

For all companies, this change underscores the importance of understanding not just what the standard requires, but why. It’s no longer just about meeting a benchmark. It’s about doing so in a way that reflects your operating context and your capacity to lead.

What this means for existing and planned targets?

If you’re setting near-term targets now, you can continue to use the current Corporate Net-Zero Standard (Version 1.2) and Near-Term Criteria (Version 5.2) until the end of 2026. Targets set under the existing frameworks will remain valid for five years or until the end of 2030, whichever comes first.

From 2027, companies will be expected to use Version 2.0 to set both near- and long-term targets. The SBTi has committed to developing a transition process for companies with validated targets in 2025–2026 to align with the new standard.

If you have existing near-term targets, these remain valid through to 2030, unless they are set beyond, which will need to be updated. For long-term targets, guidance is still forthcoming, and more clarity is expected during the second public consultation later this year.

In the meantime, companies should continue to act in line with current guidance. Early action will still lay a strong foundation for alignment with the revised standard.

What’s changing for Scope 3?

Scope 3 emissions remain a critical focus. For Category A companies, near-term targets covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3 are mandatory. However, long-term Scope 3 targets are not currently required, though this requirement could evolve with the consultation process.

This doesn’t mean Scope 3 can be deprioritised. Businesses should continue to improve data collection, value chain engagement and focused reduction strategies. In many sectors, Scope 3 accounts for the majority of emissions so it’s critical to address them even where long-term targets are not yet mandatory.

The draft standard also moves away from the previous percentage-based boundary approach (67% for near-term targets and 90% for long-term targets) to a more focused approach that prioritises the most relevant emission sources. Companies will need to identify ‘significant scope 3 categories’ (those representing 5% or more of total scope 3 emissions) and ‘emissions-intensive activities’ in their value chain. This shift aims to make scope 3 targets more effective at driving transformation where it matters most.

Additionally, the standard places greater emphasis on non-emission metrics and alignment targets. This includes measures such as the percentage of procurement from net-zero-aligned suppliers or the share of revenue from net-zero-aligned products. These alignment indicators offer alternative ways to demonstrate progress, particularly valuable for companies facing data challenges or those offering climate solutions.

Where do residual emissions come in?

The draft standard requires companies to neutralise any residual emissions that remain at the net-zero target year and thereafter. For Scope 1 residual emissions, companies are offered three proposed options:

1. Set mandatory removal targets alongside abatement targets

2. Receive recognition for voluntary removal targets

3. Address residuals through additional reductions, removals, or a combination of both

For Scope 3, Category A companies must ensure residual emissions are neutralised either by the responsible value chain partner or by providing support to enable their neutralisation.

All options limit removals to the small portion of emissions projected to remain at the net-zero year, typically less than 10% of base year emissions. Removals must meet high-integrity sustainability and quality criteria, with more specific standards to be developed through the consultation process.

Businesses already investing in high-quality removals may find themselves well aligned with the draft’s direction. Early planning will allow companies to integrate these requirements into their financial and strategic climate planning.

Where do carbon credits and BVCM fit in?

The draft continues to recognise Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM) as important, while maintaining a clear separation from the requirement to neutralise residual emissions at the net-zero target year.

BVCM activities, such as investing in climate solutions, financing external reduction projects, and purchasing carbon credits remain encouraged as valuable contributions to global climate goals. The SBTi is actively using the consultation process to gather feedback on how to better recognise BVCM, set reporting requirements and integrate these efforts into corporate climate strategies.

Notably, the guidance recommends that companies should aim to address 100% of their remaining emissions in line with recognised third-party frameworks, and also take responsibility for historic emissions. Companies are encouraged to look to broader frameworks such as the VCMI or ISO14068 to guide their current BVCM efforts.

Bottom line for businesses: The direction is clear and so is the call to action

While much of the standard is still under consultation, the direction is unmistakable: greater ambition, earlier action and more accountability are all on the horizon. Companies should not wait for the final version to begin aligning strategies with the emerging requirements.

The draft also introduces stronger requirements for data quality, with an emphasis on improving the traceability of emissions data over time. Category A companies will need to obtain third-party assurance of their GHG emissions inventory, including for relevant Scope 3 emissions sources.

Now is the time to assess your categorisation, revisit Scope 3 strategies, plan for removals and ensure your transition plan is robust and transparent. These shifts won’t just change how climate targets are set - they’ll reshape what climate leadership looks like beyond compliance.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2024-04/web_net-zero-and-carbon-neutral-concept-net-zero-text-on-green-grass-with-forest-for-net_Credit_pcess609_iStock-1496309995_1600x900.png?itok=MKkQIRId,N,,2025-05-23 11:56:51.314782

It’s an uphill battle but it’s still gaining momentum.

Addressing climate change by reducing the carbon footprint of venues and tours is a growing concern, with transportation one of the largest sources of emissions.

According to a 2022 report by the UK-based Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, a typical arena tour can generate more than 5,500 tons of carbon dioxide and an audience can create more than 1,100 tons of CO2 per tour.

For artists and sports teams, air travel – private jets and commercial flights – is the biggest contributor with talent, crews and equipment flying long distances.

Ground transport – tour buses and semis – also add emissions, especially for large-scale productions requiring dozens of trucks. Audience travel to and from shows and games accounts for a large portion of total emission, reaching as high as 80%.

Artists including Billie Eilish and Coldplay, promoters and venue operators are trying to mitigate the impact with Eilish leading environmental activism with two new Overheated conferences planned for the UK and Germany, and Coldplay publishing a carbon report that aims to significantly reduce emissions.

According to the band’s website, Coldplay pledged to cut their tour’s direct emissions by more than 50% compared to their 2016-2017 outing and they are working with their partners and suppliers to reduce their impact and emissions as much as possible.

“We’ve teamed up with DHL as the tour’s official logistics partner in order to minimize emissions from freight and transportation. As leaders in the field of sustainable transport and logistics, DHL support the tour by offering solutions to minimize logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts, from advanced biofuels in the air to electric vehicles on land,” the band stated via the website.

Concert trucking can embrace sustainability by prioritizing best practices that can minimize their environmental impact including regular maintenance, which ensures trucks are in optimal condition for better fuel use. Many companies are investing in newer, more fuel-efficient models and adopting technology to track and reduce fuel consumption. Tours are also using trucks powered by renewable natural gas and biodiesel or hydrogenated vegetable oil. Trucking companies are also training drivers to minimize idling, which consumes a significant amount of fuel.

By prioritizing efficient fleet management, adopting alternative fuels and limiting time spent idling, concert tours can minimize their environmental impact.

Green transportation can also include train travel, electric buses and limiting flights.

According to Liverpool FC’s The Red Way report issued on Earth Day (April 22), the team made significant steps to reduce emissions from travel, including eliminating 100% of carbon emissions from domestic team flights through investment in sustainable aviation fuel. The club also uses hydrotreated vegetable oil to fuel team buses, which creates a reduction in carbon emissions of up to 90% compared to regular diesel.

Venues are also doing their part to reduce their transportation-related carbon footprint.

UBS Arena, home of the NHL’s New York Islanders, recently celebrated its 1 millionth Long Island Rail Road rider and the venue sponsors a “Ride, Dine and Have a Good Time” program to incentivize and encourage people to take the train.

Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington, and PHX Arena (formerly Footprint Center), in Phoenix, Arizona, offer free transit with an event ticket.

“We want to be a force for good,” said Rosie Selle, vice president of marketing for Climate Pledge Arena. “It’s authentic to who we are as people at the arena, but also what our arena brand stands for.”

For the second year, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Commuter Rail and Keolis Commuter Services are providing round-trip, special event train service to concerts at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. Train service has been scheduled for the full lineup of 2025 summer concerts including AC/DC, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, The Weeknd, George Strait, Coldplay and Morgan Wallen. Round-trip tickets are $20 and can be purchased two weeks before each show date.

Companies are offsetting their carbon use by supporting carbon sequestration projects, which is the process of capturing and storing atmospheric CO2. The goal is to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.

Companies are enhancing the process by supporting reforestation projects including the Orion Amphitheater in Huntsville, Alabama, which is currently undergoing a massive study to determine the exact carbon footprint of the 8,000-cap venue.

“Everything you do has a footprint. So, what do you do to offset that footprint?” said Ryan Murphy, partner at tvg hospitality, which operates Orion. “You can look at the carbon footprint of people traveling here to work, bands coming in, fans coming in – and equating that for every concert we’re doing we’re replanting X number of trees and reforesting the area around the amphitheater.”

Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, home of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild, recently launched Trees for Travel. The program, which is a partnership with the Green Cities Accord, offsets the carbon footprint for team air travel throughout the NHL regular season by helping to protect and grow the city’s urban tree canopy.

Engaging fans in sustainability efforts can make a difference. To cut emissions, venues encourage fans to carpool or take advantage of free or discounted public transit.

In Bentonville, Arkansas, they promote pedal power.

The Momentary, which features multiple performance spaces including a 6,000-cap amphitheater, offers a free bike valet for guests.

“With our proximity to downtown, it just so seamlessly fit that we would encourage the pedestrian/bike movement for our visitors,” said Ben Huss, director of operations for The Momentary. “It was like, ‘Here’s a need. Let’s see if we can figure out a way to solve it.’ And that’s how the bike valet got its wings.”

The Momentary hires Pedal It Forward, a local nonprofit that collects, repairs and distributes bikes to needy families, adults and children in Northwest Arkansas, to operate the bike valet. During evening concerts, they store between 50-55 bikes and up to 150 a day during festivals. The Momentary hosts 12 to 15 outdoor shows, two dozen indoor performances and up to four festivals each year.

“It’s such a great program for folks to be able to ride up to a concert and know that their bike is going to be taken care of, and then after the show, get back on their bike and ride to their homes and other places downtown,” said Huss.",https://static.pollstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SAF-1024x683.png,N,,2025-05-23 10:56:36.119946

The report, completed by independent advisory firm, Pollination and unveiled at an industry event in partnership with the University of NSW’s Decarbonization Innovation Hub, examines the challenges inherent in the current policy frameworks and the critical points of consideration to unlock alternative SAF accounting frameworks, such as Book and Claim.

The Book and Claim system separates the environmental benefits of SAF from the physical fuel. This allows airlines to purchase and claim the environmental benefits of SAF without physically transporting and storing the fuel, reducing the logistics costs and avoiding the additional unnecessary carbon emissions.

Book and Claim represents a significant opportunity for Australia, which has natural advantages for SAF production, including abundant feedstock resources. With this system, Australia could become an exporter of environmental benefits to regions where SAF production is limited or unavailable, creating economic opportunities by aggregating demand from both domestic and international markets, while supporting global aviation decarbonization.

Australia’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting system allows airlines to recognize emissions reductions from direct combustion of SAF, but lacks mechanisms to account for SAF that Australian airlines purchase that is used outside the country.

Comments from Virgin Australia General Manager Sustainability Fiona Walmsley:

“In partnership with Boeing and the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network, we’re thrilled to bring together industry and academic leaders to present and explore the latest research supporting aviation’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050,” Ms Walmsley said.

“SAF is the most critical decarbonisation lever for the aviation sector to reach net zero emissions, but production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel must accelerate significantly for the global aviation sector to achieve this goal.”

“This report outlines how a Book and Claim system would allow Australian airlines to contribute to aviation decarbonization even before domestic SAF production commences. By enabling airlines to purchase SAF benefits regardless of location, we can accelerate industry-wide adoption and ultimately drive down costs.”

Today, he channels that experience into a cause that transcends balance sheets: offering advice and guidance to India and the wider world toward a sustainable energy future. Having worked on projects both domestically and internationally, Singal sees a bright future for Indian and US collaboration in the sector. The transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives isn't just an environmental imperative; it's an economic and geopolitical necessity. Among the multitude of solutions, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stand out as pivotal components in this global shift.

India's commitment to green methanol is both ambitious and pragmatic. With a methanol production capacity of approximately 1 million metric tons, the nation anticipates a demand surge to 4.675 million metric tons by 2030. This growth is underpinned by the government's Methanol Economy program, which envisions methanol not only as a cleaner fuel alternative but also as a means to enhance energy security and reduce import dependence. The US is also actively participating in global efforts to reduce carbon and promoting initiatives like Green Methanol.

“I’ve always had a keen interest in all things sustainable and realized early on how vital changes are needed to meet global net-zero targets. India and the US have long been two of the leaders when it comes to green energy, and it’s commendable to see their progress. It’s great to see the mutual aspirations of both nations being achieved, and I’m excited to see how the relationship continues to flourish.” Commented Suneet Singal.

Methanol's versatility is a key advantage. It can be produced from various feedstocks, including coal, natural gas, biomass, and even captured carbon dioxide. This adaptability allows for integration into existing industrial frameworks, facilitating a smoother transition from conventional fuels. As well as this, methanol serves as an efficient hydrogen carrier, simplifying storage and transportation challenges associated with hydrogen fuel.

In the aviation sector, India has set clear targets for SAF adoption. The country plans to blend 1% SAF with jet fuel by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, initially focusing on international flights. These targets align with global efforts to decarbonize aviation, a sector traditionally reliant on high-emission fuels. Comparatively, the US is aiming to supply sufficient SAF to meet 100% of domestic fuel demand by 2050. Studies suggest that SAF could contribute between 53% and 66% toward achieving net-zero targets in aviation. With SAF only currently accounting for around 0.1% of all jet fuel consumption worldwide, this highlights both the US and India’s forward-thinking role in a sustainable world.",https://images.forbesindia.com/media/images/2025/May/img_245453_whatsappimage2025-05-21at5.45.05pm.jpeg,N,,2025-05-23 11:56:58.993996

In 2024, the U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry achieved record production. A new report, “Economic Impact of Biodiesel on the U.S. Economy 2024,” shows that the industry’s rapid growth also generated a record economic impact. The industry supported 107,400 American jobs and $42.4 billion in domestic economic activity.

The total economic impact was nearly double the figure from Clean Fuels’ previous study in 2022. That’s no surprise, since U.S. production capacity doubled between 2022 and today. Nationwide in 2024, availability of biomass-based diesel—including biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable jet and heating oil—topped 5.1 billion gallons, meeting more than 9% of fuel demand for heavy-duty, on-road transportation. The industry—both fuel producers and soybean processors—invested billions to sustain this growth.

Nevertheless, the industry is facing policy uncertainty that threatens those investments and jobs. While market demand and potential for clean fuels continues to grow—with rail, marine heating, and aviation interest strong and growing—many producers are currently shut down and laying off workers.

To bolster market certainty and resume growth, Clean Fuels advocated that the U.S. EPA make a step change in the Renewable Fuel Standard volumes for 2026 and 2027, asking for an increase of the biomass-based diesel (BBD) volume to 5.25 billion gallons in 2026. That’s 1.9 billion gallons higher than the 2025 volumes. And the industry asked for continued growth, with BBD volumes raised to 5.75 billion gallons for 2027.

In April, Clean Fuels launched a six-figure advertising campaign to back up the industry’s advocacy efforts and build support for a timely bump in BBD volumes. The campaign was designed to highlight for policymakers the unified, industrywide agreement on the request.

Earlier, in March, along with farm and feedstock groups, Clean Fuels sent a letter asking the EPA to set 2026 biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes at 5.25 billion gallons. Later that month, Clean Fuels, the American Petroleum Institute, American Soybean Association, National Oilseed Processors Association, and ethanol trade groups met with EPA to present agreed upon volumes for the 2026 rule, including the 5.25-billion-gallon BBD volume.

The group of stakeholders agree that U.S. biomass-based diesel capacity of roughly 6.5 billion gallons is more than sufficient to meet the increase in RFS volumes. Much of the existing capacity is underutilized. The stakeholders also point to projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that demand will reach 5.5 billion gallons in 2026, and capacity will continue to grow to 7.3 billion gallons.

The stakeholders further agreed that the feedstocks to produce the volumes in America are available. According to an analysis by S&P Global on behalf of NOPA, the soybean processing industry invested more than $6 billion to expand or build 20 crush facilities across 10 Midwest states. The investments will support 1.4 billion additional gallons of U.S. production by 2030, with enough capacity coming online by 2026 to support the 5.25-billion-gallon goal.

The U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel industry used more than 1 billion pounds of domestic soybean oil each month throughout 2024—an increase of 15% since 2022. Biodiesel and renewable diesel production support $1.10 in value for every bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S. Demand for 5.25 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel will create a value-added market for more than 50 billion pounds of fats and oils each year. If the trend for policy during the next several years is for domestic feedstocks and domestic production, then our industry is going to create a lot of new demand for U.S. agriculture and biomass production.

For our industry to follow through and make good on the investments and growth of the past few years—and to get American biodiesel workers back to producing much-needed fuel—we need stable policy that enables us to coordinate production growth with feedstock supplies and innovation. An appropriate step upward in the RFS program is a great start.

For centuries, the coconut has been revered as the “tree of life,” offering everything from food and fuel to shelter and shade.
Beyond nutrition, coconut trees can also be leveraged in the fight against climate change.
Moreover, as perennial crops, coconut trees are more resilient than annuals to impacts such as droughts, high winds and floods.
Organic farming and intercropping – growing coconut trees amid other crops – also supports soil health and enhances biodiversity.","In the sweltering midday heat of Chennai in southern India, the roadside vendor cracks open a green coconut with two swift blows from his hooked knife. As he hands it off to locals on their daily lunch break, its cool, fresh taste almost makes standing in the sun worth it.

But did you know that the same humble coconut that quenches your thirst could be used to power jets?

If you answer no, the International Coconut Community (ICC) has a bold vision to share—one where the coconut is not just a “tropical treat” but a climate solution that nourishes people, captures carbon, and, as it turns out, may even help power your next flight.

For centuries, the coconut has been revered as the “tree of life,” offering everything from food and fuel to shelter and shade. According to data from the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization, nearly 90 per cent of the world’s coconut production takes place in Asia and the Pacific, with Indonesia, the Philippines and India the three major producing countries.

At a side event to the ESCAP Commission session in Bangkok in April, the ICC had invited three experts to share their insights into some of the advantages of coconuts. Dr. Fabian Dayrit from the ICC Scientific Advisory Committee for Health exalted the extraordinary nutritional benefits of coconut meat, which is low in carbohydrates and sugar, packed with dietary fibre and entirely free of cholesterol. It also provides all nine essential amino acids.

At the same time, coconut milk is gaining popularity as a dairy-free alternative with a smaller environmental footprint than dairy milk as well as higher calcium content. Coconut flour and oil are also becoming pantry staples as healthy, sustainable alternatives to processed foods and dairy, lionizing traditional, local food systems.

Beyond nutrition, coconut trees can also be leveraged in the fight against climate change. These trees are surprisingly effective carbon sinks—absorbing an average of 15 to 25 tons of CO₂ per hectare annually, explains Dr. K Balachandra Hebbar, Director of ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute in India.

When scaled across 12 million hectares, that is more than 200 million tons of CO₂ captured – a significant contribution to climate action. Moreover, as perennial crops, coconut trees are more resilient than annuals to impacts such as droughts, high winds and floods. Organic farming and intercropping – growing coconut trees amid other crops – also supports soil health and enhances biodiversity.

Countries are now experimenting with monetizing coconut plantations through global carbon markets through new projects like the Pollachi Fresh Air initiative in India, where farmers are attempting to establish a large carbon sequestration belt, or Vanuatu’s small island carbon credit pilots.

“Carbon credit initiatives in coconut farming present a viable opportunity for farmers to generate additional income while contributing to climate change mitigation,” Hebbar explains. “Engaging in such programmes can enhance sustainability and provide financial benefits.”

However, many hurdles remain, such as lengthy certification processes, delayed payments and complex data collection. These make the carbon credit world a challenging, albeit hopeful, terrain for small farmers.

Even further away from the traditional uses of coconuts, a renewable energy power generation company from Japan is proposing a novel idea: making Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from non-standard coconuts.

In 2022, SAF accounted for less than 0.1 per cent of the global jet fuel supply. The Green Power Development Corporation of Japan wants to change that by using off-spec coconuts, which are considered unsuitable for food markets because they are too small, cracked, sprouted or rotten.

The process of creating SAF involves sourcing, sorting and tracing the coconuts from producer countries, drying, compressing and then extracting the oil before shipping it to a processing plant where it is converted into a high-quality fuel called “neat SAF”. This uses a specially developed, low-hydrogen process tailored to coconut oil’s unique carbon structure. The company hopes to realize the commercialization of SAF in Japan by 2030.

The impact? Up to 80 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel – and no competition with food crops due to the use of off-spec coconuts.

The coconut is clearly no longer just a kitchen staple. It is a versatile, renewable resource with positive impacts for our health, energy supply and the environment. While it hides in plain sight, the right research, policies, partnerships and investments can transform it into a superfruit that helps us build a more sustainable future.

So, the next time you sip on coconut water or apply some coconut oil to your hair, imagine this: that same fruit could one day help save the planet and carry you across the sky.",https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/2025-05/Image%20by%20Pexels%20from%20Pixabay_2025-M05-23.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 10:57:24.640476

Trump talks about “America First,” he means putting the needs and desires of the American people ahead of global concerns.
The House Republican’s One Big Beautiful Bill expands by $45 billion the biofuel tax credit created by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.
The 2024 Joint Tax Committee expenditures report projected that the IRA’s biofuel tax credit, known as section 45Z, would cost $8.4 billion over three years.
It’s the only Biden green energy credit targeted to be bigger when it ought to be zero.
There probably isn’t the political will to bring a permanent end to the biofuels tax credit.","When Donald J. Trump talks about “America First,” he means putting the needs and desires of the American people ahead of global concerns. It’s an admirable goal, and he’s making it manifest throughout the marketplace.

This is especially true in the energy sector, where his adoption of the “drill baby, drill” attitude to energy exploration has already created a drop in the price at the pump. Things need to go further, beyond the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels until the production of synthetics and biofuels are included.

For more than 20 years, taxpayers have financially supported the ethanol and biodiesel industries through generous tax subsidies.If it ever was, this is no longer something from which the American people derive benefits sufficient to justify the costs. It is an exercise in central economic planning that continues largely for the enrichment of multinational commodity giants and fuel exporters.

Consider Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The House Republican’s One Big Beautiful Bill expands by $45 billion the biofuel tax credit created by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. It gives multinationals larger tax breaks for exporting “green” jet fuel to help meet European mandates than it does for supplying biodiesel and ethanol to American consumers. This ignores the U.S. consumers’ needs and puts foreign interests ahead of domestic ones. Nonetheless, some in Congress argue this will somehow boost America’s energy security and reduce our reliance on foreign oil.

That’s not the way it works out. It’s just another example of corporate welfare masquerading as a social and economic good. Companies that benefit most from the subsidies have the financial and logistical capacity to scale production quickly, optimize their operations to maximize tax credits, and exploit global markets that offer higher returns by, for example, utilizing the European Union’s sustainable aviation fuel mandates. Many of these multinationals are positioned to take advantage of trade loopholes that allow them to avoid tariffs on feedstocks imported from China. Small and mid-sized American farmers and biofuel cooperatives meanwhile struggle to compete, despite being the original intended beneficiaries of such subsidies.

These credits aren’t worth the cost. The 2024 Joint Tax Committee expenditures report projected that the IRA’s biofuel tax credit, known as section 45Z, would cost $8.4 billion over three years. This week the House voted to expand that to $45 billion and extend it by four years. It’s the only Biden green energy credit targeted to be bigger when it ought to be zero.

There probably isn’t the political will to bring a permanent end to the biofuels tax credit. It’s too important to too many powerful interests. Why not then enforce export limits on fuels produced with taxpayer assistance so that publicly funded benefits contribute to the nation’s energy needs and economic progress before being sent overseas. Ensuring taxpayer subsidized biofuel is only sourced, produced, and used in the U.S. would maximize the domestic economic and environmental benefits, increase domestic supplies, and reduce the cost of the credit to American taxpayers.

A Heritage Foundation report suggests additional tapping of our energy abundance would spur job growth and increase family incomes except that “Today, America’s position as a dominant producer of oil and gas is threatened by misguided government policies that have restricted oil and gas production on federal lands and federally controlled offshore areas and attempted to stifle oil and gas production on private land through overregulation.” These conditions prohibit Americans' potential to excel in the energy industry both at home and abroad.

In the first two hundred days of his new administration, President Trump has created new energy opportunities for us all. In February, the National Energy Dominance Council was established. The nation’s untapped energy resources are once again going to open to exploration. To further strengthen our energy future, let’s end the preferential treatment shown to corporations engaged in environmental virtue signaling at the expense of what America needs. Policies should reward those who invest in American infrastructure, innovation, and the workforce to lower costs, generate growth, and offer more options for American consumers.

It's time to put the country first. The Biden approach to “think globally” needs to be replaced with a resolve to “act locally.” If Congress won’t rein the biofuels credits and use the savings to lower the corporate rate to 15 percent to the benefit of all businesses, American taxpayers will be left less well off than they might be. Let’s lessen America’s involvement in multinational schemes that erode our domestic economic resilience.

It's part of Vueling’s wider strategic approach to reducing its emissions and improving its environmental impact.

MicroTau’s Riblet Modification Package consists of an innovative film that mimics the microscopic texture of shark skin and is applied to the exterior of the body of aircraft to improve aerodynamic performance, which could reduce carbon emissions by up to 4%*.

Although a shark’s skin appears smooth, it’s covered in microscopic grooves known as riblets, which help reduce drag as the animal moves through the water.

Taking inspiration from nature, MicroTau’s Riblet Modification Package applies the same fluid dynamics principles to the outside of aircraft, reducing drag without requiring any structural modifications.

Franc Sanmartí, director of sustainability at Vueling, said: “The possibility of implementing MicroTau’s cutting-edge technology across our aircraft once it is certified will mark an important milestone in Vueling’s journey toward sustainable aviation.

""This innovation not only supports our goal of improving fuel efficiency but also reinforces our commitment to reducing our CO2 emissions through forward-thinking solutions.”

“Our partnership with MicroTau will be an important part of how we achieve our sustainability goals both in the short and long term, as we work to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and move towards a more sustainable future for the aviation industry.”

Henry Bilinsky, CEO of MicroTau, said: “Efficiency is hard-won in aviation, with most decarbonisation solutions decades away from implementation or carrying a substantial cost premium.

""MicroTau is laser-focused on delivering our end-to-end riblet solution to aircraft operators to reduce emissions and save operational costs in the process, and it’s fantastic to have Vueling on board as a key customer and partner to make this happen.”

This initiative is one element of Vueling’s broader sustainability strategy and reinforces its dedication to adopt initiatives that drive meaningful change.

This includes using Sustainable Aviation Fuel and optimising flight paths to reduce its emissions, and other measures like reducing the weight of its aircraft to keep advancing in its sustainability roadmap.","http://www.travolution.com/dynamic-images/30000-30999/30354/30354_c=(17,0,674,354)_w=1200_h=630.webp?v=20230522122229",N,,2025-05-23 10:57:29.753124

President Trump’s return to The White House has created a whole host of uncertainties, one of which is the commitment to fighting climate change and reaching the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Despite this, decarbonisation remains a major goal for the aerospace sector.

Reasons for optimism

Since being established in 2022, the Sustainable Skies World Summit (SSWS) has grown from 169 registered attendees to more than 1,300 in 2025. This numerical growth is also reflected across the sector with over 1,000 aviation sustainability announcements made over the last month alone, according to Jonathon Counsell, Group Head of Sustainability at IAG, who gave an address on the opening day.

On that very day, the UK Government announced £400,000 of funding to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the country. Although the different varieties of SAF offer potentially exciting technologies to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, they suffer drawbacks including high costs and unproven technology (See ‘Scaling up SAF’ AEROSPACE March 2025). It is concerns such as this that have led to a backlash against decarbonisation efforts in the US and Europe. However, Dr James Richardson, chief scientist for the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) defended decarbonisation efforts in a keynote address. “The transition is sweeping across sectors and your transition is coming soon,” he said. He explained the CCC’s role as an independent body monitoring the UK and devolved governments’ efforts to address climate change, adding that after the next ‘carbon budget’ period of 2038-42 and into the 2043-50 timeframe, aviation, alongside shipping, will remain one of the most emitting sectors. “We have been very successful at decarbonising electricity, pushed coal of the electricity supply,” Dr Richardson said.

The need for certainty

Companies all over the world are looking to deploy SAF, but need financial certainty in order to do so. (Airbus)

As part of decarbonising the electricity grid, large scale renewable energy has been rolled out using methods such as solar and offshore wind power. The latter has had its funding levels guaranteed under ‘contracts for difference,’ where eligible companies are shielded from volatile electricity prices. As many sustainable aviation technologies remain in their infancy, a key issue is funding their development and upscaling.

On the second day, a panel discussing finance heard that the certainty revenue certainty mechanisms have provided for the renewables industry would prove invaluable for enabling long term investment and research into SAF and other carbon reduction technology in aviation. Joshua Garton, Head of Financial and Investment Analysis at GSI, explained the importance of certainty to the banks, emphasising that: “once the sector scales to that commercial level, the markets develop and markets will then carry the weight of financing these projects.”

Examples of innovation

Through the use of laminar flow technology, Otto Aviation hopes its new design will prove sustainable. (Otto Aviation)

For all of the work going into finding new fuels to decarbonise aviation, the most effective way to do this could, in fact, come from other methods such as improved aerodynamics and management of contrails (See 'Contrail Control Gathers Pace'), particularly as there is a general reluctance to manage demand. One potential way forward is blended wing body (BWB) designs with the aircraft’s engines, wings and fuselage all incorporated together. Several primes and startups are exploring these for civilian and military applications. On a panel considering the future of sustainable aviation, Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President Public Affairs and Sustainability at Alaska Airlines claimed that BWBs could cut emissions by up to 50% even when using conventional jet fuel and existing components. To this end, the airline has invested in JetZero, one company trying to bring BWBs to market, which claims its design could not only benefit from SAF, but also be future proofed for hydrogen propulsion in the longer term.

Also present at the summit’s ‘Accelerator Hub’ was SORA Aviation, a UK-based eVTOL firm which is looking to bring a six engine (one on a forward wing, two on the rear) aircraft to market. Capable of carrying up to 30 people on routes such as airport transfers, the company presents its product as benefiting from economies of scale through carrying the equivalent passenger number of seven four seat eVTOLs.

Another intriguing presentation came from US-based Otto Aviation which is developing a business jet, which could later be scaled up to regional size, using laminar flow technology. NASA has called this the ‘Holy Grail’ of aerospace design because the company uses supercomputer design and advanced manufacturing techniques to produce a ‘teardrop’ shaped aircraft. The advantages of what the company calls this “revolutionary, game changing aircraft” are the ability to fly at 51,000 feet, above most airliners, therefore eliminating the carbon effects of contrails and burning 60% less fuel. The company claims that the significance of the latter is that when using SAF, this use reduction will cancel out the so-called ‘sustainability premium’ which arises from SAF being more expensive.

Future talent

With many of these emerging technologies presenting promising routes to decarbonisation, the sector still faces a major challenge if these are to become a reality. Since the COVID 19 pandemic, the issue of how to ensure a sustainable aviation workforce has been at the forefront of the industry, with ways sought to a sustainable pipeline of labour.

Attending SSWS were a large number of students aged 13 to 17 who were given insights into potential careers in the industry and. RAeS CEO David Edwards FRAeS, chaired a panel exploring common perceptions around careers in aviation. One of the myths that the panel sought to debunk is the view that the majority or roles in the sector revolve directly around flight for positions such as pilots, with vital supporting positions such as procurement and finance overlooked.

On this theme, the former CEO of London Heathrow Airport John Holland-Keye once described the hub as “a city” with all the key jobs such as human resources that this entails. The panel also discussed ways overcome barriers such as using social media posts to explore ‘a day in the life’ of key aerospace employees, demonstrating the reality of roles that are available. The panel was followed by another featuring panellists who are early in their careers across of the sector, exploring how initiatives such as ‘career coaches’ can pass on experience from employee to employee.

Work to be done

As the summit drew to a close, the continued interest in decarbonising aviation was plain to see, despite skepticism about how achievable many of the objectives are. The number of challenges to be overcome remain daunting, but if obstacles such as finance and providing the right workforce can be surmounted, the potential for many of the ideas on display to become a reality exists, even if some of the deadlines may be met later than originally envisaged.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26501/otto-aviation-main.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:30.007131

Price elasticity of demand for aviation probably means that surcharges lead to erosion of the underlying fares.","Reported comments in early Mar-2025 by IATA DG Willie Walsh have questioned aviation's commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

CAPA - Centre for Aviation's sister company Aviation Week quoted the global airline trade body's boss at the ISTAT Americas conference: ""We are going to have to revisit [the net-zero target]"".

This came only weeks after a Feb-2025 revised roadmap to 2050 net zero by 'Destination 2050', which represents European aviation across the supply chain.

More recently, on 27-Mar-2025, the European airline body A4E said it remained ""fully committed"" to net zero by 2050.

On the same day, a report by Boston Consulting Group forecast that aviation would fall significantly short of its 2030 SAF commitments, but noted ""the long-term momentum for structural change in the aviation industry remains strong"".

Mixed messages from aviation on this crucial issue could be counterproductive, when many politicians and a growing strand of public opinion are looking for ways to stifle the industry's growth.

IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego has warned that funding the green transition means ""flying is going to be more expensive"". Meanwhile, Lufthansa Group has announced an Environmental Cost Surcharge to help with the additional costs of meeting environmental regulations.

Air France-KLM has had a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of between EUR2 and EUR24 since 2022. However, Lufthansa Group's environmental surcharge, of between EUR1 and EUR72, is also aimed at defraying other green transition costs.

European airlines face a greater range of such costs than most other regions.

As with fuel surcharges, the effectiveness of environmental surcharges in genuinely raising additional revenue is debatable. Price elasticity of demand for aviation probably means that surcharges lead to erosion of the underlying fares.

However, they send a signal to governments and regulators. They may help to stem the tide of taxes imposed on aviation in the name of the environment, but which effectively divert funds away from financing the green transition.

The UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), which advises the government, published its advice on the nation's Seventh Carbon Budget (2038 to 2042) on 26-Feb-2025.

Aviation's path to net zero in 2050 requires growth in the consumption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), improved operational efficiency, new propulsion technology, demand management, and paying the cost of ""engineered removals"" to offset its residual emissions.

A key theme of the CCC report is the role of demand management while SAF availability grows. To some extent this will happen naturally, as the costs of decarbonisation feed through to higher fares and lower demand.

However, the CCC notes that further demand management measures may also be necessary, including additional taxes and charges and limiting airport expansion. Its 'citizens' panel' expressed support for such measures.

The coinciding of the CCC report with recent UK government support for new runway capacity at both Heathrow and Gatwick is somewhat ironic. Expect renewed resistance to airport expansion from environmental groups, local politicians and local residents.",,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:39.104584

However, it would very much put canola oil back in the game.
Zandar Capozzola, principal consultant for renewable fuel with Argus Media, said 45Z has been a disaster for the U.S. biofuel sector.
“The market has been hit really hard by this transition to the 45Z credit,” said Capozzola.
Canola oil accounted for five per cent of total feedstock use in February, down from 11 perc ent a year ago.","SASKATOON — Canola oil would be one of the main beneficiaries of proposed changes to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit making their way through U.S. Congress, says an analyst.

The feedstock is not eligible for the credit under the current rules because of its unfavourable carbon intensity (CI) score.

However, under new rules contained in the budget bill that recently passed through the U.S. House of Representatives, canola’s carbon intensity score drops to 38.5 grams of carbon dioxide per megajoule from 54.9.

That means it would qualify for the credit because of new rules that eliminate the indirect land use change (ILUC) penalty, which is responsible for a large chunk of canola’s poor CI score.

It means canola would receive a 45Z tax credit of US$0.19 per gallon for biodiesel, $0.22 for renewable diesel and $0.39 for sustainable aviation fuel.

That is still the lowest of the five major feedstocks, which are soybean oil, canola oil, tallow, used cooking oil and distillers corn oil.

However, it would very much put canola oil back in the game.

Zandar Capozzola, principal consultant for renewable fuel with Argus Media, said 45Z has been a disaster for the U.S. biofuel sector.

It replaced the blender’s tax credit, which gave biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers a $1 per gallon credit irrespective of what feedstock they were using.

The 45Z credit is based on a shifting scale of value based on feedstock and production process. Its average value has been $0.43 per gallon since it was introduced on Jan. 1, 2025.

“That’s a 57 per cent reduction in the tax value afforded to producers,” he said during a recent webinar.

Renewable diesel and biodiesel producers responded by slashing production. January’s output was 20 per cent below a year earlier with plants running at 47 per cent of capacity, down from 93 per cent in December 2024.

Things have improved since then with plants running at 63 per cent capacity in April, but it is still well below 2024 levels.

“The market has been hit really hard by this transition to the 45Z credit,” said Capozzola.

Biodiesel margins turned negative at the start of 2025, declining 75 per cent year over year through May. Renewable diesel margins fell 50 per cent over the same period.

Canola-based fuel was hardest hit because the feedstock doesn’t qualify for 45Z.

Tallow, used cooking oil and distillers corn oil have been the biggest beneficiaries, with corn oil earning an average $0.75 per gallon credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel production.

Foreign used cooking oil is not eligible for the credit (except for sustainable aviation fuel), pressuring domestic supplies of the feedstock.

The upshot is that 45Z has caused a move away from crop-based feedstocks. Canola oil accounted for five per cent of total feedstock use in February, down from 11 perc ent a year ago.

Tallow has surpassed soybean oil to take top spot, accounting for 31 per cent of feedstock compared to 26 per cent a year ago.

Total feedstock use in February was down 27 per cent compared to a year ago as many plants shuttered or paused production.

The 45Z policy changes contained in the draft budget proposal would be a boon for crop-based feedstocks.

For instance, soybean-oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules compared to $0.22 under the existing regulations.

“We could see a tremendous reshuffling of the feedstock slate should this draft bill move forward in its current state,” said Capozzola.

The numbers for waste-based feedstocks would stay the same because they don’t face any ILUC penalty under the existing rules.

The draft budget bill also extends 45Z through 2031 and restricts feedstocks to the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is also good news for Canadian canola growers.

Capozzola noted that the proposed new 45Z rules would not “play well” with California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which caps crop-based feedstocks at 20 per cent.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/22153240/131383_web1_RKA07152024_canola_bloom.jpeg,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:42.416191

Part 23. - Leeham News and Analysis,Bjorn Fehrm,,,,,https://leehamnews.com/2025/05/23/bjorns-corner-air-transports-route-to-2050-part-23/,"We examined Alternative 1’s emissions improvement two weeks ago and compared it to the normal improvement in new airliners’ fuel consumption last week.
The problem is that last year, airlines consumed 1 million tonnes of SAF out of a total consumption of 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel.
This would require the SAF industry to produce about 1 million tonnes of SAF per year until 2030 and then 3 million tonnes.
Neste, the largest producer of SAF, is producing 1.5 million tonnes this year, with a growth to 2.2 million tonnes by 2027.
In the years before, it would have been an 8% reduction, or 25 tonnes of Jet fuel, with the CO2 reduction at 64 tonnes.","May 23, 2025, ©. Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

We have since we started in October last year looked at:

Alternative, lower emission, propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids, and new concepts for Jet-Fuel and Hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also looked at recent research into the role of CO2, NOx emissions and Contrails generated by airliners.

Three weeks ago, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

We examined Alternative 1’s emissions improvement two weeks ago and compared it to the normal improvement in new airliners’ fuel consumption last week. Now, we examine the improvement that SAF can offer compared to the other two.

Improvement in emissions from SAF

SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, differs from the normal Jet-A1 fossil-based fuel by having its source’s CO2 absorbing phase in the same time period as the fuel’s oxidation into CO2 and other emission products in an aircraft engine. By it, a total CO2 emission reduction of about 80% can be achieved.

The problem is that last year, airlines consumed 1 million tonnes of SAF out of a total consumption of 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel. The problem comes from SAF being more expensive than Jet-A1.

Right now, the industry is in a chicken-and-egg situation. Low demand and, therefore, production make SAF costly as it lacks scale. Its higher price throttles further demand.

We have also written that SAF can’t replace normal jet fuel 100% in present aircraft, as the fuel systems and engines need some of the fossil Jet fuel’s aromatics to keep their seals supple. As new-generation airliners enter the market, this limitation will gradually disappear as the sealant materials are updated with materials that don’t require these aromatics to keep seals fit.

A path away from this stalemate is that states mandate a specific blend of SAF in an airline’s fuel consumption. The 27 European EU states decided on such a mandate in 2023, called ReFuelEU. It requires aircraft that depart from EU airports of a minimum size (800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of freight per year) to any destination (EU or outside EU) to fuel their aircraft at the airport with jet fuel that has the following blend of SAF:

We see that the blend requirement is 2% until 2030, then rises to 6%, and so on. This would require the SAF industry to produce about 1 million tonnes of SAF per year until 2030 and then 3 million tonnes. Neste, the largest producer of SAF, is producing 1.5 million tonnes this year, with a growth to 2.2 million tonnes by 2027. While airlines are worried about sourcing the required SAF volumes from 2030, the SAF industry says it will meet the demand.

How much will SAF reduce CO2 emissions?

Right now, the only region with a mandate for SAF blending is the EU. As traffic from such EU airports represents about 20% of worldwide aircraft traffic, on a worldwide basis, we apply a fivefold reduction of the SAF effect from this mandate.

If we take the 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel consumed in 2025, where 1 million tonnes of these would be SAF before 2030, then 3 million tonnes, growing to 10 million tonnes after 2035, and so forth, we finish with a 70% blend of SAF from EU airports in 2050.

On a worldwide scale, if we assume that the improvement in fuel consumption from new aircraft keeps the yearly jet fuel consumption at 300 million tonnes, we will have a 14% reduction of fossil Jet Fuel consumption by 2050, or 42 tonnes, with an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions, or 106 million tonnes. In the years before, it would have been an 8% reduction, or 25 tonnes of Jet fuel, with the CO2 reduction at 64 tonnes.

We shall remember these numbers when we come to compare the three different alternatives in future Corners.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-05-23 05:56:50.582954

BEIJING – European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it is willing to support China, its largest single-country market, in building sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, into an emerging industry, as it believes that the nation has all-around advantages in the development of SAF.

Airbus said it will continue to strengthen cooperation with Chinese suppliers to promote the use of SAF to contribute to the sustainable growth of the aviation industry.

“SAF, as the biggest contributor, helps with the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Compared to fossil jet fuel, it can reduce 80 percent of carbon emissions on average in the entire SAF life cycle,” said Claire Kauffmann, head of SAF and carbon dioxide removal global ecosystem at Airbus.

Kauffmann said that China has great advantages in the production of SAF, given its rich resources of feedstock and rapid development of renewable energy. China’s strong manufacturing capability, unified government policies and a stable business environment provide continuous impetus for the long-term development of the sector.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of Airbus’ operations in the country. The aircraft manufacturer said it has always been committed to long-term and trustful partnerships with the Chinese aviation industry.

Besides SAF, Airbus has continued to expand its industrial footprint by investing in various activities. It is expanding the A320 aircraft’s final assembly capacity in Tianjin with a second line, and the new facility is expected to be put into operation by early 2026.

As a global company with roots in Europe, Airbus said it advocates for fair and open trade, and win-win cooperation. China has been insisting on high-standard opening-up and improving its business environment, an effort that Airbus highly respects.

For the development of SAF, China has abundant types of raw material resources, including waste cooking oil, agricultural and forestry waste, and urban organic waste, providing a solid foundation for building a globally leading green aviation industry system. It is predicted that by 2030, the annual available raw materials for producing SAF in China will support a potential production capacity of up to 12 million metric tons.

China, the European Union and the United States have all introduced policies to encourage the use of SAF.

In the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), the Civil Aviation Administration of China proposed that the cumulative consumption volume of SAF in China should reach 50,000 tons over the period, and the annual consumption volume of SAF in 2025 should exceed 20,000 tons.",https://asianews.network/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pIZEZ2dGropt2XXETO9vRf_ycKpre-BFKMfat7bUeMs.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 05:57:07.256636

Kim Reynolds to veto a bill restricting carbon sequestration pipelines.
Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuel Association’s executive director, said on the call that HF 639 does not protect landowners from eminent domain, but specifically targets carbon capture pipelines.
“This fall, Iowa will no longer be the world’s most profitable place to turn corn into ethanol,” Shaw said.
“We still have work to do to ensure Iowa bans eminent domain for carbon pipelines,” Jess Mazour with the Sierra Club said in the release.","Iowa ethanol advocates and farmers are urging Gov. Kim Reynolds to veto a bill restricting carbon sequestration pipelines.

The advocates said in a press conference Thursday the bill is “extremely problematic” to biofuels, farming, energy and Iowa economies.

The bill, House File 639, which passed the Iowa Senate May 12 and is awaiting a signature from Reynolds, would change definitions of a common carrier and increase insurance requirements for pipelines transporting liquid carbon dioxide. It would also set requirements for the Iowa Utilities Commission and expand who can intervene on dockets with the commission.

Advocates and lawmakers in favor of the bill oppose the use of eminent domain by the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol facilities in Iowa, and neighboring states, to underground storage in North Dakota.

Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuel Association’s executive director, said on the call that HF 639 does not protect landowners from eminent domain, but specifically targets carbon capture pipelines.

“You hear a lot of talk about principles, but what we see are bills that are about preferences,” Shaw said.

Impact to other projects

Mike Jerke, the CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, an ethanol facility in Council Bluffs, said the bill would impact his ability to connect to the Tallgrass Trailblazer carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska, even though he has been able to secure 100% voluntary easements for the project.

The project in Nebraska is operated by Tallgrass and converts an existing pipeline owned by the company into a carbon capture pipeline that is projected to be operational at the end of 2025. Jerke said SIRE has plans to start capturing its CO2 by mid 2026, following the construction of the technology.

Jerke said even though he has no need nor intent to use eminent domain to connect to the pipeline in Nebraska, HF 639 would impact his project.

HF 639 requires pipeline operators to carry insurance that would cover any loss or injury that occurs from accidental, negligent or intentional discharges from the pipeline. It also requires pipeline operators foot the bill if landowners have increased insurance premiums because of the pipeline.

“So apparently, we need to go find a product, an insurance product, who will allow us to do something that would be in violation of the very permit that we’re applying for,” Jerke said.

Jerke said his project, and future projects in the state, are also impacted by the provision in the bill that limits carbon sequestration pipelines to just a single, 25-year term, without an opportunity for renewal.

“We’re making a significant investment — we have contracts in place for over $45 million to build the equipment on our site to capture and compress the CO2,” Jerke said. “Apparently, this is going to be, if this were to stand or be signed into law, something that we would only be able to operate for 25 years.”

Shaw no one would built a house or a business on Main Street if they knew in 25 years, they would have to walk away from the project, without the ability to sell it, or renew the permit.

“This fall, Iowa will no longer be the world’s most profitable place to turn corn into ethanol,” Shaw said. “The moment Tallgrass starts operating and the plants hooked up to Tallgrass in Nebraska can sequester, the premium they will get in the market … will make Nebraska the most profitable place in the world to produce ethanol.”

Shaw said this will impact Iowa facilities, not just in terms of canceling planned carbon capture expansion, but could also lead to the closure of several plants.

Vic Miller, a Fayette County farmer and member of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the bill impacts the “very viability” of corn growers.

Corn farmers are projected to produce nearly 16 billion bushels in yield this year and have around 1.8 billion in carryout, or grain left after demand, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data analyzed by National Corn Growers Association.

“It’s ahead of anything we’ve ever raised,” Miller said. “Once you get above that 2 billion mark in carryout, basis widens, everything just goes south.”

Corn farmers and the ethanol industry see entry to ultra-low carbon markets, most prominently the sustainable aviation fuel industry, as the best opportunity to expand the market.

Those in support of the bill, including the Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club and the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, have been celebrating the passage of HF 639.

A press release from Bold Alliance and the Iowa Easement Team said the bill does not fulfill landowners’ primary goal of banning eminent domain for CO2 projects, but does “protect landowners” via the new insurance mandate and impact the Summit project via the change in definition of a common carrier.

“We still have work to do to ensure Iowa bans eminent domain for carbon pipelines,” Jess Mazour with the Sierra Club said in the release. “We will be back in 2026 to fight for a ban …. This will be a leading election issue.”

The Free Soil Foundation, a citizen group opposing CO2 pipelines, urged Iowans to call the governor’s office and voice support for the bill, which it called “a major step forward in protecting Iowa landowners and preserving constitutionally-protected property rights.”

IRFA has also been urging its members to call the governor, who has not indicated if she will sign the bill or veto it.

“What would happen if she signs it? I’m not willing to think about that yet,” Shaw said. “I’m only worried about how we can get Iowans to reach out and say, regardless of how you feel about CO2, this bill has really massive negative unintended consequences that will impact all forms of energy, all forms of economic development across the state.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8614-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 05:57:10.516484

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels.
Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.
In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity.
“The SAF Coalition applauds the House of Representatives for extending the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition.","The U.S. House of Representatives early on May 22 narrowly passed a reconciliation bill that includes provisions updating and extending the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. The bill, H.R. 1, commonly known as the “big, beautiful bill,” will now be considered by the U.S. Senate.

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Section 111112 of the H.R. 1 aims to limit availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. It also aims to exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel and directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure.

The draft bill would extend the 45Z credit through Dec. 31, 2031. Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

Section 10106 extends funding for the USDA’s Biobased Markets Program and the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels program through 2031. The Biobased Markets Program, commonly referred to as the Biopreferred Program, aims to expand the use of biobased products through a voluntary labeling program and federal procurement requirements, while the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels program provides payments to eligible producers of advanced biofuels. According to the bill language, current funding levels of $3 million and $7 million per fiscal year, respectively, would be continued through 2031.

H.R. 1 leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact but aims to enact restrictions on transferability. Specifically, the legislation would repeal transferability for carbon capture equipment where construction begins two years after the bill’s date of enactment. It also restricts access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

While H.R. 1 includes several provisions benefiting the biofuel and bioenergy industries, it also aims to repeal and scale back numerous other clean energy tax credits, including the clean hydrogen tax credit and the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for advanced refueling property placed in service during a give tax year, including property used to dispense E85, biodiesel blends of B20 or greater, natural gas, hydrogen, propane, and electricity. The credit value is 30% of the cost of the property, up to $100,000. The credit is currently scheduled to retire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the sunset date of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

Also related to biofuels, H.R. 1 aims to repeal Section 60108 of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allocated funding to the U.S. EPA to support certain functions related to the Renewable Fuel Standard This includes $5 million to the EPA to support the development and establishment of tests and protocols regarding the environment and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive; perform internal and extramural data collection and analyses to regularly update applicable regulations, guidance, and procedures for determining lifecycle GHG emission of a fuel; and review, analyze and evaluate the impacts of all transportation fuels, including fuel lifecycle implications, on the general public and on low-income and disadvantaged communities and $10 million to the EPA to fund “new grants to industry and other related activities…to support investments in advanced biofuels.” . Any unobligated funds would be rescinded.

The bill also aims to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit, which was established by the IRA and allows taxpayers to claim a credit per kilogram of qualified clean hydrogen produced for sale or use. The credit is based on GHG emission rate of the production process, with a value of up to 60 cents per kilogram. The clean hydrogen tax credit is currently available for facilities that commence construction before Jan. 1, 2033. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

Another section of the draft bill aims to phase-out a credit that supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances and residential oil furnace or hot water boilers that are rated to be fueled with eligible biobased fuels. The legislation would terminate the energy efficient home improvement credit, which currently allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for household energy efficiency improvements. The value of the credit is 30% of qualified expenses, up to $1,200 annually, or $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves. The credit is currently set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity. The credits are not currently set to expire. The draft bill, however, aims to phase out the credit by reducing the value of the credit by 20% for facilities placed into service after 2029, by 40% for facilities placed into service in 2030, and 60% for facilities placed into service 2031. No credit would be available for facilities placed into service after 2031. Bill provisions also restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

H.R. 1 will now be taken up by the Senate, where the bill will likely be amended. Any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill will likely be resolved via conference committee with the goal of crafting a piece of legislation that can be subsequently passed by both houses of Congress. Once the House and Senate are able to pass identical versions of the bill, the legislation will be delivered to the White House for President Donald Trump’s consideration.

Representatives of the biofuel and bioenergy industries are speaking out to applaud H.R.1’s 45Z provisions.

“The budget reconciliation bill passed by the House this morning includes several provisions that are important to America’s ethanol producers and farmers,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “In addition to extending the 45Z clean fuel production credit by four years, the bill also reinstates crucial tax benefits that will stimulate research, experimentation, and innovation across the ethanol supply chain. As the bill now moves to the Senate, we hope additional improvements can be made to ensure these tax policies truly drive demand growth for American-made renewable fuels.”

“We’re grateful to our champions on Capitol Hill who have worked hard to preserve and extend rural priorities, like the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “This budget reconciliation package would give farmers and ethanol producers the freedom and flexibility to deliver for the American people. It ultimately delivers on the President’s agenda—it’s good for rural communities, good for innovation, good for investment, and good for American energy dominance,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “We urge the Senate to protect the 45Z tax credit and get this bill onto the President’s desk, so we can unlock billions of dollars of investments in new markets for farmers and U.S. clean energy innovation.""

The American Biogas Council applauded the crucial changes the bill makes regarding carbon intensity scoring for manure-based biogas projects. “We urge the Senate to follow quickly suit and pass legislation that also includes the House provisions favorable to biogas, which will accelerate the deployment of biogas systems that capture energy from organic materials like manure, food waste and wastewater solids as they break down,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC. “These systems transform this waste into clean, American-made energy, while reducing pollution and stimulating economic growth in rural communities.

“To fully realize the potential of biogas, we also call on the Senate to extend support for biogas systems under the clean electricity (Sections 48E/45Y) and clean hydrogen (Section 45V) tax credits, which are critical for farmers, municipalities and other operators who are limited from using Section 45Z but still seek to generate renewable energy from decomposable waste,” Serfass added.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition is applauding the bill’s 45Z provisions. “The SAF Coalition applauds the House of Representatives for extending the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition. “Sustainable aviation fuel is a vital solution for advancing U.S. energy dominance, driving rural economic growth, and establishing the United States as a global frontrunner in SAF production.

“This legislation provides the long-term certainty SAF producers need to scale operations, drive private sector investment, and benefits American farmers and rural economies,” Graab added. “The Coalition is encouraged by the extension and looks forward to the Senate’s support.”

The Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) is also speaking out in support of the bill’s 45Z provisions. “The advanced biofuels industry is grateful to see the House include a multi-year extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) in its reconciliation package,” said Michael McAdams, president of the ABFA. “Certainty is essential for businesses to invest in the infrastructure and workforce to grow American energy dominance in the advanced biofuels space.

“We look forward to working with biofuels champions in the Senate to make additional improvements to the credit as the legislative process continues to further expand America’s advanced biofuels capacity and strengthen the nation’s energy security.”

What are renewable fuels?

Renewable fuels are low-carbon fuels made from renewable sources that are chemically identical to regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel. These renewable fuels produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions while performing the same as regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel. They can be used as a drop-in fuel without modification to engines or infrastructure. Renewable fuels are made from waste, animal fats, and used cooking oils, as well as organic materials such as soybean oils.

What is HydroFlex™

With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low-value feedstocks into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meets all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications. HydroFlex™ is by far the most successful renewable fuels technology globally.

Unlocking first-of-a-kind clean industrial projects California is an economic powerhouse responsible for more than 14 percent of US GDP.
At the event, we heard directly from leaders advancing real-world industrial decarbonization projects.
To accelerate deployment at scale, there is a need for an ecosystem of actors working in coordination to support industrial decarbonization from multiple angles.
Industrial decarbonization has the potential to do so much more than mitigate climate change.","Why it’s golden hour for decarbonization in the Golden State.

Last month on Earth Day, RMI, Mission Possible Partnership, and the Bezos Earth Fund gathered project developers, local policy makers, NGOs, and financial institutions in downtown Los Angeles to celebrate progress and take stock of the journey ahead to decarbonize industry and heavy transportation in California.

More than 30 percent of California’s emissions come from heavy industry and heavy transport, including aviation, shipping, and heavy-duty trucks. This pollution not only contributes to smog and poor air quality, it also adds fuel to a warming planet, supercharging the extreme weather events, like wildfires and storms, that have come to plague the Golden State.

The good news is, California is uniquely positioned to decarbonize these sectors. The state has some of the most ambitious environmental regulations in the nation, including targets to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% clean energy by 2045. Project developers in California are taking advantage of this policy environment, with over 60 industrial decarbonization projects announced across the state. However, many announced goals and projects have not reached a final investment decision (FID) or become operational.

That made it ideal for RMI and Mission Possible Partnership, with support from the Bezos Earth Fund, to launch a clean industrial hub in California to provide technical assistance, analysis, and facilitation to directly support 10 first-of-a-kind decarbonization projects, and conduct research and host convenings to enable a broader ecosystem for project developers to be successful. To date, seven out of the ten projects, have reached final investment decision (FID), compared to just 20 percent of proposed projects globally.

At the event, we heard from local leaders who are decarbonizing shipping, ports, and drayage trucking; building first-of-a-kind (FOAK) industrial decarbonization projects; and mobilizing a broader ecosystem of enabling policy, finance, and community engagement to support decarbonization throughout California.

Decarbonizing shipping, ports, and trucking

California’s ports are critical to the state’s economy, but are also significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution. The Port of Los Angeles is the nation’s busiest container port, moving more than 8 million containers in 2023. Port infrastructure, such as heavy-duty trucks, cargo ships, and material handling equipment, contributes the lion’s share of emissions at ports. As part of the California clean industrial hub, RMI and Mission Possible Partnership worked with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to map drayage truck routes and identify the most impactful locations to install charging infrastructure to enable the fleets that serve the port to transition to zero-emission trucks.

Decarbonizing these systems is complex: goods must continue moving efficiently, yet their carbon and pollutant footprints must be significantly reduced to meet state climate targets and improve local health outcomes.​

At the convening, participants heard from leaders addressing different aspects of ports decarbonization. Paul Gioupis of Zeem Solutions, a fleet management and EV transition service provider for heavy-duty trucks, discussed the potential for electric vehicle (EV) trucking to replace diesel drayage fleets. Today, most drayage trucks run on diesel, making trucking the largest source of emissions at the Port of LA, responsible for 43 percent of its emissions in 2022. Fleets switching to EVs would significantly reduce emissions and pollutants in surrounding communities. Maggie Messerschmidt of C40 Cities illustrated the importance of collaboration across stakeholders, outlining the successful development of green shipping corridors between Los Angeles and Shanghai and Los Angeles and Singapore, coordinating decarbonization across port-to-port routes. Amber Coluso from the Port of Los Angeles’s Air Quality Team emphasized local air quality management strategies targeting reductions in PM2.5 and NOx emissions, such as electrification of cargo handling equipment.

The panelists also discussed several structural barriers that persist. Infrastructure and grid constraints, such as limited transmission capacity and long interconnection timelines, hinder the scaling of zero-emission technologies. High upfront capital costs and unclear return on investment remain barriers for private actors. Additionally, coordinating among port authorities, utilities, municipalities, trucking companies, and regulators presents challenges in aligning timelines and investment decisions.​

Nevertheless, the panelists highlighted notable advancements. Demonstration projects involving zero-emission cargo handling equipment have proven technical feasibility. Green shipping corridor initiatives are moving from concept to implementation, particularly where strong bilateral port agreements exist. Early electric truck deployments are achieving high utilization rates at charging depots, reinforcing the business case for continued investment in electrification.​

While historically ports have been part of the problem, today the ports and respective cities managing them are leading on solutions and have become key actors enabling decarbonization projects in the shipping and trucking sectors. California is showing that it’s not only a leader in renewables, but a blueprint for other coastal communities worldwide working to maintain a robust economy built around global trade while increasing the health and prosperity of local residents.

Unlocking first-of-a-kind clean industrial projects

California is an economic powerhouse responsible for more than 14 percent of US GDP. The state boasts a thriving industrial sector: refineries, trucks, airports, ports, and other industries are major drivers of the economy, but are responsible for 80 million metric tons of CO2 per year, making California the third-largest industrial emitter in the nation. Project developers, with more than 60 announced projects, are working to decarbonize California’s industrial sector, which will require moving beyond announcements to implementation. Without a significant increase in operating projects, especially in sectors like cement, fuels, and industrial heat, California risks missing its 2045 net-zero target.

The Greater Los Angeles area, home to roughly half the state’s population, hosts many of the proposed decarbonization projects across heavy industry and heavy transport, from the truck charging terminals discussed above to cement plant decarbonization to sustainable aviation fuel production. At the event, we heard directly from leaders advancing real-world industrial decarbonization projects. Steve Regis, COO of CalPortland, the largest cement and construction materials producer in the western United States, shared the company’s work to reduce emissions from cement production, a sector responsible for 10 percent of industrial CO₂ in California. Josh Stolaroff of Mote, a clean hydrogen start-up based in California, described their approach to producing carbon-negative hydrogen from biomass waste. Mote recently closed a $7 million Series A funding round, and aims to produce 20,000 tons of low-emissions hydrogen annually while removing and sequestering 350,000 tons of CO2 per year. Corey Stewart, of RMI’s aviation team, highlighted the path forward for scaling sustainable aviation fuel and other FOAK fuel technologies, and Felix Hennebert from Rondo Energy discussed thermal battery systems as a solution to electrify industrial heat and reduce both operating costs and emissions for heat-intensive production processes.

Despite their varied technologies and sectors, these innovative companies are encountering a common set of challenges. Complex and often delayed permitting processes can stall even well-prepared projects. FOAK technologies carry perceived commercialization risks, making it difficult to attract private investment at scale. High capital costs, especially when combined with limited revenue certainty, remain a key barrier to moving from pilot to full deployment.

Still, momentum is building. California’s public funding programs, including state grants, federal support through the Inflation Reduction Act, and clean hydrogen hub initiatives, are catalyzing FOAK projects and helping de-risk early investment. The state’s strong regulatory framework, such as clean energy and zero-emission fuel mandates, is sending long-term signals that support early adoption. And some technologies, such as electrified kilns or zero-emission fuels, are beginning to move beyond the lab and into commercial settings.

The clean industrial hubs model plays a key role in overcoming these barriers. By providing technical assistance, convening stakeholders, and supporting project developers as they navigate complex permitting and financing landscapes, the hubs model helps ensure that more FOAK projects move from concept to construction.

Creating the enabling ecosystem: policy, finance, community engagement

Decarbonization projects don’t exist in isolation. Even the most promising technologies can stall without the right enabling environment. Today, many developers still face the challenge of acting in a vacuum: pushing projects forward without the necessary policy clarity, financial backing, or community trust. To accelerate deployment at scale, there is a need for an ecosystem of actors working in coordination to support industrial decarbonization from multiple angles.

The panelists at the convening spoke about how to mobilize the broader ecosystem of policy, finance, and community engagement. Daniel Adomian of California’s Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank discussed how state financing mechanisms can help derisk capital for early-stage projects.

Carmelita Miller, a leader in energy equity, emphasized the integral role communities play in project development. Carmelita spoke to the need for clean industrial development to have early, sustained collaboration with frontline communities, not as a procedural box-check, but as essential partners in shaping projects that deliver durable, equitable benefits. This approach both creates a win-win situation and ensures projects move forward rather than stall out through opposition.

Sean Knierim of Side Porch, a consulting firm specializing in designing and implementing social impact strategies through cross-sector collaboration, spoke about the importance of grounding decarbonization projects in community partnerships that go beyond compliance to build true shared value.

Michelle Kinman, of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI), discussed how LACI’s Transportation Electrification Partnership has fostered public-private collaboration to create an investment blueprint for zero-emission truck charging infrastructure, integrating community input to guide equitable deployment.

Several pain points emerged from their discussion. Fragmented and sometimes misaligned policy signals, across jurisdictions and agencies, can slow or confuse investment decisions. Investors and lenders often view FOAK and community-based projects as risky or unproven, making it difficult to secure financing. And traditional approaches to community engagement remain transactional, too often treating communities as stakeholders to manage rather than partners to empower.

The conversation also surfaced what’s working. Strategic philanthropic funding is being used to fill early-stage gaps: supporting planning, permitting, and ecosystem coordination. Labor and community organizations are stepping in as true project partners, offering critical insights and accelerating local acceptance. And perhaps most importantly, cross-sector collaboration, across finance, government, industry, and civil society, is becoming the norm rather than the exception in leading projects.

What’s ahead

Looking out to 2030, hundreds of zero-emissions projects will need to be developed in California to meet state — and global — climate targets. RMI and Mission Possible Partnership’s work creating clean industrial hubs of first-of-a-kind projects and enabling ecosystems to unlock industrial decarbonization at scale is a critical piece of the puzzle.

Industrial decarbonization has the potential to do so much more than mitigate climate change. It is an opportunity to clean up air quality, leading to improved health in our neighborhoods, lower healthcare costs, and less strain on medical resources. It can bring tangible benefits to impacted communities like jobs and funding for schools through novel community benefits agreements. And it can help better steward our natural resources, so the beaches, forests, and wildlife so many Californians love are there for future generations.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1647949123-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:57:03.507306

Long-Term Benefits The biggest difference between fossil diesel and renewable diesel is the raw materials used.
As a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, Neste’s renewable diesel can typically deliver above 60%, even up to 75% less GHG emissions over its life cycle compared to fossil diesel.
Furthermore, as a drop-in fuel, renewable diesel works in all types of diesel engines without requiring any modifications to current infrastructure.
While manufacturers continuously improve engines, renewable fuel producers are exploring the next generation of raw materials to produce renewable diesel.","For some who don’t believe in technology neutrality and favor hydrogen or electric vehicles, renewable fuels are often described as bridge fuels, transition fuels or stopgaps. However, several major car manufacturers are scaling back on their ambitious EV production targets, which highlights the challenges and complexities of transitioning to a sustainable transportation system. There is no silver bullet to reduce all the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the transportation industry, and we need to leverage all the possible solutions to fight against climate change. As a drop-in solution that works for all types of diesel engines, renewable diesel is already well positioned to be a significant player in the long-term energy landscape.

Long-Term Benefits

The biggest difference between fossil diesel and renewable diesel is the raw materials used. Fossil diesel is derived from crude oil, which accelerates climate change, while renewable diesel is produced from 100% renewable raw materials, even from waste and residue materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Hydrotreatment technology specially adapted for processing renewable materials allows carbon molecules that already exist in the environment to be used over and over again to create renewable diesel, which means that their combustion in engines does not release any new carbon into the atmosphere. The proprietary NEXBTL technology allows Neste to turn a wide variety of low-quality raw materials into premium-quality renewable products. In 2024, waste and residue materials accounted for 90% of Neste’s total renewable material inputs.

As a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, Neste’s renewable diesel can typically deliver above 60%, even up to 75% less GHG emissions over its life cycle compared to fossil diesel. Furthermore, as a drop-in fuel, renewable diesel works in all types of diesel engines without requiring any modifications to current infrastructure. For fleet operators, the switch to renewable diesel can immediately cut the carbon footprint of their fleet without costly investment in new equipment or interruptions to business.

Neste has produced renewable diesel since 2007 and began selling it in the United States in 2012. Over the past decade, Neste has observed an increase in the consumption of renewable diesel globally as well as in the U.S., mainly driven by two factors: businesses adopting lower-GHG-emission goals and more sustainable solutions to demonstrate commitment to sustainability, as well as supportive policy frameworks like low carbon fuel standard frameworks in states like California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico that help promote the use of renewable diesel.

Applications Beyond Road Transportation

Today, renewable diesel is primarily used to reduce GHG emissions from on-highway transportation. However, it is also poised to play a significant role in decarbonizing other heavy-duty segments, such as construction, mining and power generation. These harder-to-decarbonize industries rely heavily on fossil fuels for their operations and lack immediate solutions, such as electrification, to achieve net-zero emissions.

For the construction sector, renewable diesel can power heavy machinery and equipment, reducing emissions from excavation, materials handling and transportation within construction sites. Neste’s partnership with Power Engineering, a construction company specializing in heavy-civil and marine construction, is a good example. Enabled by one of Neste’s fuel distributors, Diesel Direct, Power Engineering transitioned its entire harbor craft marine fuel supply and land-based equipment fleet to run on Neste’s renewable diesel in 2023. In just one year, the switch to renewable diesel helped Power Engineering reduce up to 470 tons of GHG emissions and enabled the company to be compliant with dynamic regulations while maintaining operational performance.

For the mining industry, renewable diesel can be used in mining vehicles, blast operations, haul trucks and more to reduce its climate impact. For power generation, renewable diesel can serve as a cleaner fuel source for backup generators and remote power systems, ensuring that critical infrastructure can remain in operation during outages. In Finland and Singapore, respectively, Neste has helped data center operators Verne and ST Telemedia Global Data Centres transition to renewable diesel to power their backup generators.

The adoption of renewable diesel in these off-highway applications is crucial for achieving broader decarbonization goals and transitioning toward a more sustainable future. While road transportation has been a primary focus for GHG emissions reductions, renewable diesel offers a viable solution for decarbonizing these hard-to-abate sectors and complements other solutions that are in early stages of development.

Internal Combustion Engines and Liquid Biofuels

According to a recent research study commissioned by the Engine Technology Forum for heavy-duty vehicles, internal combustion engine (ICE) technology will power one-third to one-half of the new vehicle fleet in 2032. Presently, the few battery-powered and hydrogen-fueled vehicles available typically deliver shorter ranges than ICE engines. Most modern EVs offer a range of over 250 miles on a full charge, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can typically offer a driving range of 300 to 400 miles on a full tank of hydrogen. Multiple OEMs are developing hydrogen internal combustion engines (hydrogen ICE). According to Cummins, it has debuted two hydrogen ICE concept trucks, and the heavy-duty truck is expected to have an operating range of more than 500 miles. However, as of 2024, there are only 54 hydrogen stations in the U.S., with most of them in California. While waiting for the numbers of hydrogen vehicles and stations to grow, ICE manufacturers are continuously working to make the next generation of diesel engines combust more efficiently and reduce emissions more significantly.

While manufacturers continuously improve engines, renewable fuel producers are exploring the next generation of raw materials to produce renewable diesel. Currently, hydrotreatment is the most common process employed by commercial fuel producers, with animal fats, used cooking oil and vegetable oils being among the most common raw materials. However, these materials alone are not sufficient to meet long-term forecasted demand. To continue driving innovation, producers like Neste are working to develop technologies that can diversify supply with new, scalable materials, such as novel vegetable oils produced with regenerative farming practices and lignocellulosic waste and residue materials. Novel vegetable oils refer to renewable raw materials produced using regenerative agricultural practices that help restore soil health and increase farm productivity. For example, in early 2025, Neste signed a memorandum of understanding with Bayer that aims to develop a winter canola ecosystem in the U.S. Winter canola not only has the potential to be a lower-carbon-intensity raw material, but can also bring additional environmental benefits to cropping systems. Once they become scalable, these raw materials can play a crucial role in meeting the growing global demand for renewable products.

Renewable diesel is readily available at scale, and it can deliver immediate GHG emissions reduction for road transportation as well as a variety of heavy-duty industries. For all these reasons, it is evident that renewable diesel is not just a bridging solution, but will continue to play a vital role in the future energy mix for decades to come. We need all the available solutions to fight climate change, and renewable diesel enables us to take actions today to help transportation and heavy-duty industries operate with reduced emissions.

Meanwhile, maritime programs, such as the FuelEU Maritime Regulation, are expected to drive RD demand, but feedstock competition and infrastructure gaps remain.","As global efforts to decarbonize aviation and ground transport accelerate, the urgency to grow the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acid (HEFA)-based renewable diesel (RD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) business has never been greater. Yet, for producers and developers of such projects, one of the biggest barriers to growth isn’t infrastructure—it’s sourcing consistent, traceable feedstock and complying with complex and evolving regulations.

Despite these challenges, demand for SAF in the U.S. continues to climb. The market’s momentum underscores a growing urgency to overcome feedstock and compliance challenges. In February 2025, U.S. domestic demand for SAF was five times higher than the average monthly demand in 2024, as reflected in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s D4 renewable identification number (RIN) generation data. (Figure 1)

This surge in demand reflects more than just market enthusiasm—it signals a critical juncture for SAF and RD developers. As the industry scales, the ability to align innovative project concepts with the realities of feedstock availability and regulatory expectations becomes a defining factor in long-term viability.

The Feedstock Challenge

To reach a final investment decision, SAF and RD project developers need long-term feedstock security. However, this is often complicated by geography. SAF and RD feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO), tallow, soybean oil and canola are often not produced in the same regions where the finished fuels are consumed. For example, UCO is often collected in densely populated urban centers or imported from Asia, whereas SAF production and consumption are frequently concentrated near airports or coastal hubs. This disconnect raises costs and increases lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), which can make it difficult to participate in credit programs like California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard and similar state and provincial programs.

Technology flexibility adds another layer of investment costs. While most SAF-capable facilities can also produce RD, the reverse is often the case, requiring additional processing infrastructure. As SAF demand grows due to airline decarbonization targets and environmental, sustainability and governance reporting, production flexibility—the ability to switch between RD and SAF—is becoming a strategic advantage for developers. However, adding SAF capacity to an existing RD facility adds capital expenditure and operational expenditure.

Traceability and Compliance Risks

As feedstock values rise, so does the risk of fraud. For example, regulatory programs in the European Union and United Kingdom restrict or cap many virgin oil feedstocks and create an incentive for UCO fraud in major UCO exporting countries. In some cases, suppliers may fry a single item in virgin oil and falsely label it as UCO to qualify for compliance programs. This not only undermines compliance integrity and increases scrutiny from regulators, but it also disincentivizes the proper end-of-life treatment of materials, as economic pressure favors labeling waste streams as renewable feedstocks, regardless of origin. Feedstock traceability tools that include detailed documentation of origin, transportation and chemical analysis are now critical for maintaining regulatory alignment across jurisdictions.

Recent cases underscore the risk. In Norway, for example, retroactive credit callbacks were issued when imported tallow failed to meet compliance standards. These events signal the growing need for robust chain-of-custody systems and strict supplier verification.

Aligning Facility Design with Feedstock Geography

Regional advantages must drive feedstock decisions. Tallow is abundant in cattle-producing regions like Texas, Montana and Brazil. UCO thrives in countries with high rates of deep-frying, particularly across Asia. Woody biomass and agricultural residues are prevalent in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern U.S. Eschewing regional logic in favor of convenience often leads to high CI scores and lower credit values.

Furthermore, transportation emissions, energy inputs and process efficiency can impact the CI score of the fuel. Therefore, facility siting decisions should also reflect access to both feedstock and low-carbon energy inputs.

Timing is Everything

In one recent case, a production facility was built and feedstock secured, only for the company to realize that EPA pathway approval would take nine months to a year to complete. Early engagement with federal and state regulators, as well as third-party advisors with regulatory and compliance expertise, is essential to run in parallel to engineering, procurement and front-end planning stages. This approach sets investors and stakeholders on a path to realizing long-term value creation for their RD and SAF investment.

It is also important for SAF and RD developers to work backward from their targeted start date, identifying milestones for life-cycle assessment modeling, feedstock validation and tax credit registration and compliance.

US, EU Policy Picture

Meanwhile, policy uncertainty continues to hamper progress. In the U.S., SAF and RD producers are awaiting further guidance on the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. Without it, revenue modeling and investment decisions remain speculative. Meanwhile, the expiration of the Section 40B tax credit and uncertainty surrounding the import treatment of feedstocks, such as tallow, further complicate the market.

In the EU, mandates under ReFuelEU Aviation, part of the “Fit for 55” package, require increasing volumes of SAF in aviation fuel starting in 2025, with targets rising steadily to 2050. It is worth noting that in the EU, the amount of UCO feedstock that can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive is capped at 1.7% in the road transport sector, but it is not capped in aviation fuel mandates. Meanwhile, maritime programs, such as the FuelEU Maritime Regulation, are expected to drive RD demand, but feedstock competition and infrastructure gaps remain. Globally, a unified SAF credit and traceability system is lacking, forcing producers and airlines to juggle multiple compliance frameworks with differing definitions and requirements.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Figure1_04c56c1451.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:56:24.996750

“But without a stable domestic ethanol base, one promising route for British SAF production will struggle to take off,” the executives said.
“Any change in future US bioethanol availability could then leave the UK with serious fuel security issues if our industry has already closed,” the group added.
The UK began importing significantly more US ethanol after adopting the E10 fuel standard (up to 10% ethanol) in September 2021.","The UK’s domestic bioethanol industry is warning of severe consequences following a new trade agreement with the United States that removes a 19% tariff on imported US bioethanol. Industry leaders say the move, announced on May 8, threatens to undercut local production and could lead to the closure of the country’s two remaining bioethanol plants, reports Fastmarkets.

Vivergo, based in Saltend near Hull, and Ensus, located in Teesside, produce around 840 million liters of bioethanol annually — enough to meet 95% of the UK’s current petrol requirements, based on a 5.5% blend rate. If petrol blending increased to 10%, these plants would still supply around half of the demand, according to the Renewable Transport Fuel Association (RTFA).

Executives from ABF Sugar, which owns Vivergo, and Crop Energies, which owns Ensus, have publicly condemned the tariff removal. In a joint statement issued on May 11, they warned that the policy could force both plants to shut down, saying, “This vital sector is now facing imminent collapse because of the trade deal… In our current situation, we will have to close these plants.”

They also pointed out that both facilities are capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through an alcohol-to-jet pathway — a key part of the UK government’s decarbonisation strategy. The government’s SAF mandate, signed into law in late 2024, requires jet fuel to include 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

“But without a stable domestic ethanol base, one promising route for British SAF production will struggle to take off,” the executives said.

The RTFA also raised concerns about the wider economic fallout, particularly for agriculture. Vivergo is a major buyer of feed wheat in northeast England, and its closure could significantly impact local farmers. The plant also produces animal feed, offering a home-grown alternative to imported soya-based products.

“The decision has major repercussions not just for the staff at the two large UK bioethanol plants who now face a very uncertain future, but for the wider supply chains that these plants support,” the RTFA said in a social media post on May 12.

The RTFA further warned that if domestic ethanol production shuts down, the UK will have to rely entirely on imported bioethanol to meet fuel standards, which require petrol to contain at least 5.5% ethanol.

“Any change in future US bioethanol availability could then leave the UK with serious fuel security issues if our industry has already closed,” the group added.

The UK began importing significantly more US ethanol after adopting the E10 fuel standard (up to 10% ethanol) in September 2021. By 2024, US imports made up nearly half of all bioethanol supplied in the UK — 701 million liters, or 48.6% of the total, according to provisional government data.

That’s up from 626 million liters in 2023 (44.5%) and 343 million liters in 2022 (27.6%). The trend reflects the growing role of US ethanol in the UK market since the country left the EU and its former trade protections, including anti-dumping duties on US ethanol.

Ensus, which uses corn as its main feedstock, has faced production cuts in recent years due to poor margins. Its parent company, Crop Energies, announced in 2023 a €100 million investment plan to improve profitability and reduce emissions at the facility. However, the new trade deal casts uncertainty over those plans.

Meanwhile, Vivergo, which also uses sugar as a feedstock, has had inconsistent output in recent years but was nearing full production capacity in 2022, according to AB Sugar.

With domestic producers under pressure and rising reliance on imported ethanol, stakeholders are urging the government to reconsider the trade deal’s implications before long-term damage is done to a sector they say is vital to both the environment and the economy.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-6.png,N,,2025-05-22 14:56:50.219066

As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly one-fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX and is the largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX to date. Delivery of the fuel began earlier this month and will continue over the next year.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of environmental affairs at FedEx, in a statement. “Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

This fuel purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create sustainable aviation technologies with other industry leaders, including the ecoDemonstrator flight-test program with Boeing, the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% SAF in both engines that was conducted in 2018.

In addition to the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple avenues to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft fleet modernization, fuel conservation initiatives and flight planning optimization. Collectively, fleet modernization and fuel-saving efforts enabled FedEx to successfully achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity in fiscal year 2024 from a 2005 baseline.",https://www.smartenergydecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ss_green_airplane.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 17:56:33.665149

Under the contract, Microsoft can purchase up to 622,500 metric tons of Sublime’s cement over a period of six to nine years. Microsoft can claim the carbon reductions associated with that cement in its own emissions accounting, even if it doesn’t use the material itself. If Microsoft passes on buying the product, the Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime can sell it to local buyers but the software giant still gets to claim the carbon savings.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process that eliminates limestone, which is cement’s main ingredient and releases carbon dioxide when it’s heated up and broken down.

Microsoft’s push to build more data centers supporting artificial intelligence has driven the company further away from its goal of becoming carbon-negative by 2030. That AI expansion has helped boost the tech giant’s emissions by 30% since 2020. More than 96% of the company’s emissions are Scope 3, or indirect, and materials like cement used in data center construction make up a big share of them.

It’s Microsoft’s first time doing a deal like this for building materials, though the company and others have used the same approach for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable energy. Called an environmental attribute certificate, it allows the purchasing company to make a sustainability claim based on environmentally friendly goods – like clean jet fuel, renewable electricity or low-carbon cement – that it didn’t use directly. But these certificates often promise more than they deliver, research shows.

“Our priority, first and foremost, is always buying and installing low-carbon materials physically that are already on the market today,” said Katie Ross, Microsoft’s director of carbon reduction strategy and market development. “But the challenge is they don’t exist at the scale or in all of the locations that we need to procure today.”

The companies declined to say how much the deal is worth.

The challenges of green cement

It’s not just a Microsoft problem. Although cement accounts for about 8% of global emissions, it’s hard to decarbonize partly because construction is a risk-averse industry with thin margins and high safety standards, according to Nik Sawe, a senior policy analyst in the industry program at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology LLC, an energy and climate think tank. That means construction companies have been reluctant to take up cement alternatives developed by startups, which are cleaner but also currently more expensive and untested in the real world.

At its 250-ton-per-year pilot plant in Somerville, Sublime has reduced emissions by 90% compared to traditional cement, according to Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Leah Ellis. Sublime will start delivering on its deal with Microsoft when its first 30,000-ton commercial plant is operational. It’s slated to be completed in 2027.

Cement is heavy, and transporting it over long distances doesn’t make sense economically, Ellis said. The deal allows Microsoft to support the scale-up of Sublime’s technology even if it doesn’t have a construction project near the startup’s plant, she added.

Do environmental attribute certificates work?

In the past, some of these certificates have supported renewable projects that would have been developed anyway, meaning they didn’t help bring additional wind and solar online as promised, studies show. Microsoft has said it plans to phase out its use of unbundled renewable energy certificates in future years.

If deals like the one the company signed with Sublime proliferate, the clean cement industry will need to prove that the certificates it is offering are verifiable and avoid carbon emissions that manufacturers would have generated otherwise, according to a 2024 report on structuring demand for lower-carbon materials co-published by RMI and Microsoft. That includes ensuring that the products’ environmental benefits aren’t double-counted, or claimed by multiple entities as a reduction on their emissions ledger.

“Checks must be in place along the way to increase confidence that every purchase of a certificate will deliver its expected outcome,” the report’s authors wrote.

For this deal with Microsoft, other customers who buy Sublime’s cement won’t be able to lay claim to its environmental benefits, Ellis said.

On Thursday, the FTSE 250 company said it would sell its catalyst technologies division to American rival Honeywell, the sprawling industrial conglomerate.
The sale comes as Liam Condon, the Johnson Matthey chief executive, faces pressure from the company’s biggest backer, Standard Industries, to rapidly turn around the business.
Johnson Matthey said the sale would deliver a large cash boost while leaving the main business more “streamlined”.
Johnson Matthey blamed “challenging” global conditions, including cuts to production by car makers that use its catalytic converters.","British chemicals manufacturer Johnson Matthey (JM) has agreed to sell its net zero aviation fuel business for £1.8bn amid weak global demand and pressure from activist shareholders.

On Thursday, the FTSE 250 company said it would sell its catalyst technologies division to American rival Honeywell, the sprawling industrial conglomerate.

The offloaded division includes the company’s interests in biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and bioethanol, as well as “blue” hydrogen which is produced using natural gas.

SAF has been touted by the aviation industry as the best way to reduce global carbon emissions from flying, but last year demand was just two thirds of what had been predicted.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has blamed lacklustre demand for SAF, which is more expensive than traditional jet fuel, on “mixed signals” about its adoption coming from governments around the world.

The expected growth of the market for SAF was used by Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

“A lot has changed in aviation, and sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand,” she said in January.

The sale comes as Liam Condon, the Johnson Matthey chief executive, faces pressure from the company’s biggest backer, Standard Industries, to rapidly turn around the business. It follows accusations that he and the rest of the board have “destroyed shareholder value” through poor investments.

Demand for SAF has proved disappointing, according to airlines, with the IATA saying that just 1m tonnes was produced last year compared to forecasts of 1.5m tonnes.

Mr Condon said: “We will now fundamentally reshape Johnson Matthey into a more focused and leaner business.”

He added: “JM is a great company and we are confident that the actions we have announced today will deliver substantial and sustainable value to our shareholders.”

Airlines claim they are keen to adopt the greener SAF but have been reluctant to pass the costs on to customers through air fares, instead arguing for governments to subsidise production to make the product cheaper.

Johnson Matthey said the sale would deliver a large cash boost while leaving the main business more “streamlined”.

The company is holding on to its “clean air” business, which primarily makes catalytic converters, as well as a platinum metals group division that is working on technologies related to “green” hydrogen including electrolysers and fuel cells.

Johnson Matthey’s talks with Honeywell about a potential deal for its catalytic technologies division are understood to have taken place on and off since before Standard joined the shareholder register in 2022, though the deal will still be seen as a defensive measure.

It came as the company reported an 11pc drop in sales and virtually flat profits, at £263m for the year to March 31. Johnson Matthey blamed “challenging” global conditions, including cuts to production by car makers that use its catalytic converters.

It also warned of a “slowdown in the energy transition” which had hit demand for green hydrogen technologies.

In the long-term, the company is betting that demand will continue for catalytic converters, primarily from larger vehicles that are difficult to decarbonise, even as governments encourage consumers to switch to electric cars.

On Thursday, it said that the internal combustion engine’s lifespan also looked longer than previously thought, due to slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles and government policies that will continue to allow some hybrids to be sold.

The company added: “Over the past three years, we have seen a global slowdown in battery electric vehicle penetration and the regulatory environment has also supported internal combustion engine longevity.”

Along with cars, the company said it also saw opportunities in the rapidly growing data centre market, as demand surges for back-up generators which also use catalytic converters, as well as direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

Its platinum-based metals business, which refines key materials used in converters, is meanwhile hoping to tap into growing demand for metals recycling and future demand for hydrogen.

The division also refines metals for the pharmaceutical, defence and agricultural industries.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000345989197_17479077260880_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-05-22 14:56:56.893158

Whether they make airplanes, cars, tractors or trains, manufacturers are working to minimize their carbon impact and that of their products.

Newsweek partnered with Plant-A Insights Group and GIST Impact to launch a ranking of America's Greenest Companies 2025, recognizing companies committed to reducing their environmental impact in key areas like greenhouse gas emissions, water management and waste reduction. Transportation industry leaders, including Boeing, John Deere, Cognizant Technology Solutions, BorgWarner and CSX, made the list.

Beyond the ranking, Newsweek dove into the latest sustainability reports issued by some of the highest-rated transportation companies to see how they're tackling efforts to green their businesses and learn about the latest trends in the industry.

Supporting Sustainability Goals of Brands They Supply

The airline industry is actively adapting to a greener business environment. A key component of that is the use of airplane-specific biofuels, called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The fuel type is created using renewable or waste products and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Boeing will be building airplanes that are 100 percent SAF-compatible by 2030. Boeing will build airplanes that are 100 percent SAF-compatible by 2030. That year is significant as it's the self-imposed deadline Delta Air Lines has set to ensure 10 percent of its fuel is SAF. Both Delta and United Airlines have set the goal of having zero-emissions fleets by 2050. Currently, just 0.1 percent of United's overall fuel used is SAF.

Boeing, Airbus, Dassault Aviation, GE Aerospace, RTX's Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Safran are part of the International Aerospace Environmental Group's Working Group 13 (WG13), a group assigned to study the impact of 100-percent use of SAFs on aviation systems.

With Boeing leading the group, WG13 will coordinate SAF testing efforts, recommend best practices and study the switchover to 100 percent SAF, working with key stakeholders like airports and fuel suppliers to investigate what support is necessary as the industry moves toward a zero-emissions future.

Developing Greener Products

For some companies, having more sustainable product manufacturing processes isn't enough. They are going further, developing products that make the world around them more sustainable as well.

While physical products are still vital parts of John Deere's business, the company's technology footprint has been growing over the last decade, amounting to everything from autonomous drive systems for tractors in the fields to precision grading technology utilized to build roadways of the future.

A recent John Deere collaboration with Sonoma County Winegrowers trialed Smart Apply, a precision spray technology that utilizes precision data to allow farmers to more precisely apply chemicals and water, greatly reducing chemical runoff, airborne drift and water waste.

The partnership results showed cost savings related to fewer materials used and efficiency gains.

Using Technology to Find Areas of Potential Impact

Cognizant Technology Solutions has a vast portfolio of products. Among them are sustainability advisory services and solutions, a tailor-made approach to helping businesses achieve their green goals.

The company's digital stack includes machine learning, data mining, digital twins and robotic automation. This makes a company's business operations more easily trackable, leading to the discovery of opportunities for efficiencies and greening throughout all aspects of the business environment, including product cycles and supply chains.

In the transportation industry, Cognizant's technology can be used to assist fleet operators. Through the company's artificial intelligence-enabled data and analytics digital footprint, those operators can manage fleet use to enable fleet decarbonization.

Investing in Green Transportation Solutions of the Future

One of the auto industry's top Tier 1 suppliers, BorgWarner, has shifted its business portfolio toward eco-friendly transportation solutions of the future. The company's 2024 Sustainability Report lays out the goal of maintaining the majority of its revenue from electric vehicle and emissions-reducing products.

While the supplier currently offers a number of internal combustion powertrain-related products, including turbochargers, all-wheel drive units, engine control units and intakes, it is also developing and manufacturing inverters, thermal management systems, electric drive motors and battery systems that are used in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles.

Driving the company's goal toward being a carbon neutral company by 2035 is a portfolio of products in development that further that agenda. For example, next-generation battery packs are expected to be more efficient and have longer lives.

The company is also investing in its workforce. BorgWarner's ""Power to Evolve"" program retrains its engineers who have worked on internal combustion engine components to work on electrified vehicle products like inverters, batteries and electric motors.

Testing New, Cleaner Fuel Solutions

In April 2024, CSX debuted its first hydrogen-powered locomotive, just one year after it announced it would collaborate with Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) on the technology. CSX adapted an existing diesel locomotive to run the hydrogen fuel cell technology using a conversion kit developed by CPKC.

Ultimately, CSX plans to build 20 of the units and deploy them concurrently for a one-year period, collecting data that can be analyzed to determine the feasibility of the fuel for widespread use.

CSX isn't alone. Sierra Northern Railway recently completed its first successful test of a hydrogen-powered switcher and plans to continue testing the technology through the end of 2027.

The deployment of the sustainable aviation fuel initiative addresses the global call for decarbonisation, with the potential to reduce life cycle carbon emissions by about 80 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

Also, it can power aircraft engines without modification, making it an immediate and viable solution for greener air travel and also mitigating the environmental impact on the aviation industry.

Event

In line with that, a two-day high-level workshop for aviation industry stakeholders to build capacity to drive progress towards sustainable aviation practices has been organised in Accra by the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Participants include key national stakeholders from the aviation, energy, agriculture and environment sectors.

Adoption

The Minister of Transport, Joseph Bukari Nikpe, in a speech read on his behalf by the Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture, John Dumelo, said the production and adoption of aviation fuels required a clear understanding of the nation’s potential, policy frameworks, technical capabilities and investment opportunities.

He said Ghana had already developed the National Energy Transition Plan (2022-2070), which establishes a comprehensive framework to effectively support the country in fulfilling its commitments as outlined in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

The minister said the plan recognised the inherent unsustainability of the current energy landscape and the challenges it presents.

“It, therefore, draws a pathway to achieving a net-zero emission future for Ghana’s development and aspirations.

“We aim, among others, to establish policies and regulatory environments to support sustainable aviation and cleaner energies and also develop a clear roadmap and action plans for national SAF deployment in Ghana,” he added.

Beneficiaries

The Deputy Director-General in charge of Finance and Administration at GCAA, Juliet Okae, said Ghana was one of the countries selected to benefit from the feasibility studies.

“SAF can be produced from feedstock, used cooking oil and other waste materials.

There is a huge potential for Ghana to create jobs in line with the government's agenda to create opportunities for the youth and promote economic development in a sustainable way,” she said.

The Project Coordinator at ICAO Office of Environment, Cesar Velarde, said sustainable aviation fuel presented opportunities not only in the environment sector but also for economic growth and development.

“The workshop is a kick-off of a six-month technical assistance project which would include a feasibility study by working closely with GCAA and national stakeholders to establish the materials that are appropriate for SAF,” he added.",https://www.graphic.com.gh/images/2025/may/22/Dumelo.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:57:11.662556

The initial 8,000-gallon delivery, completed on May 12, 2025, marks a significant milestone in broadening the accessibility of SAF in a new region of the United States.

This milestone makes Overland Aviation the first FBO in the Midwest to receive a delivery of SAF through Avfuel’s network. The announcement comes just ahead of the 2025 European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva, where sustainability and innovation are expected to be key themes.

“We’re proud to help lead the charge in introducing SAF to the Midwest,” said Tanner Overland, president and founder of Overland Aviation. “Our goal is to provide world-class services that support a more sustainable future for aviation—this special fuel load is an important milestone in that commitment.”

Overland Aviation is known for delivering premium, globally oriented services to both domestic and international travelers. Its capabilities include on-site U.S. Customs and Border Protection clearance, 30-minute quick turns, full-service ground handling, aircraft maintenance, and FAA Part 135 air charter operations. The addition of SAF to its fuel offerings enhances its commitment to efficiency, safety, and sustainability.

The SAF delivery was made possible by a supply agreement between Avfuel and Valero Marketing and Supply Co., a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corp. The fuel itself was produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc.

The SAF was manufactured using the HEFA SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) process. This method uses renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and other lipids, resulting in a cleaner fuel alternative that can significantly reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. When used in its neat form, SAF can cut emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. When blended at a 30/70 ratio with traditional jet fuel, it can still reduce emissions by approximately 24%.

“This announcement represents an exciting step forward in expanding SAF availability and accessibility across the United States,” said Joel Hirst, senior vice president of sales at Avfuel. “We were thrilled to work with Overland Aviation to showcase the viability of SAF’s expansion into the Midwest while offering the FBO’s global customer base a more environmentally responsible fueling option.”

As aviation continues to evolve toward more sustainable practices, this strategic collaboration reflects a broader industry commitment to reducing environmental impact.

FedEx’s largest SAF deal to date: Over 3 million blended gallons of sustainable aviation fuel secured for use at LAX over one year.

Strategic emissions reduction: SAF will cover ~20% of FedEx’s annual jet fuel use at LAX, advancing its 2040 carbon-neutral goal.

Market signal to SAF industry: FedEx reinforces demand for low-emissions aviation solutions, spotlighting the need for industry-wide scale-up.

FedEx has launched its most significant U.S. deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), securing over three million gallons of blended SAF from Neste for use at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

The agreement, which spans a one-year period, marks a milestone for both companies—and the air cargo sector—as FedEx commits to using fuel that contains at least 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This SAF purchase will account for nearly 20% of FedEx’s annual jet fuel consumption at LAX, making it the largest SAF procurement by a U.S. cargo airline at the airport to date.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and VP of Environmental Affairs at FedEx.

The deal underscores FedEx’s broader environmental strategy, which includes aircraft fleet modernization, flight planning optimization, and ongoing fuel conservation efforts. These initiatives enabled the company to reach a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity by fiscal year 2024—meeting a goal it first set in 2008.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” said Richard Smith, COO, International, and CEO, Airline, FedEx. “While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Neste, the SAF supplier, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal for global decarbonization in air logistics.

“FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation,” said Carl Nyberg, Senior VP, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This move builds on a history of collaboration between FedEx and industry partners to pioneer sustainable aviation solutions—including the 2018 ecoDemonstrator test flight with Boeing, which marked the first commercial airplane flight powered by 100% SAF in both engines.

This article explores why SAF is fast becoming the cornerstone of aviation decarbonisation, how it links into the broader renewable energy ecosystem, and what makes it a compelling opportunity for strategic investors.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a next-generation substitute for conventional jet kerosene. Produced from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and forestry waste, SAF delivers a substantial reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Crucially, it functions seamlessly with current aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure, making it a rare clean energy solution that requires no immediate capital overhaul. Although global usage remains limited today, SAF is now scaling faster than any other aviation fuel alternative.

The aviation industry contributes approximately 2% of global CO₂ emissions. Unlike other sectors, it cannot decarbonise rapidly through electrification. SAF steps in as a tangible solution for existing fleets, avoiding the decades-long wait for hydrogen or electric aircraft to become mainstream. Government initiatives are supporting this shift with ambitious targets and funding programmes that back both supply and demand growth, creating a solid foundation for industry-wide adoption.

Challenges remain, particularly around feedstock availability and production costs. Today’s SAF is typically more expensive to produce than fossil jet fuel, but innovations are narrowing that gap. New feedstock sources, from wet waste to woody biomass, are expanding the supply base. At the same time, technological advances such as alcohol-to-jet and power-to-liquid fuels are pushing the boundaries of efficiency and scalability.

The trajectory is steep but promising. SAF production is forecast to more than double by the end of the decade, with a growing number of commercial-scale facilities under construction worldwide. As volumes rise, economies of scale and regulatory support are expected to compress costs and drive broader adoption. Policy incentives, including tax credits, carbon pricing mechanisms and fuel mandates, are already stimulating investment and improving profitability across the SAF value chain.

Feedstock innovation is particularly exciting. Novel production pathways using renewable electricity and captured CO₂ offer ultra-low carbon intensity, while avoiding food-versus-fuel debates. These approaches are still emerging but are backed by robust investment, setting the stage for commercial breakthroughs in the next five to ten years. The result is a dynamic environment where multiple SAF technologies are converging to create a flexible, resilient and sustainable fuel network.

For investors, SAF is more than a green fuel, it is a strategic position in the future of aviation and energy infrastructure. The opportunity spans early equity stakes in production facilities, partnerships with logistics providers, and participation in emerging carbon offset platforms. As long-term supply agreements between airlines and fuel producers become more common, investor visibility and confidence are increasing.

Market risks remain, price volatility, regulatory shifts and execution complexity must be managed. Yet, with growing demand, supportive policy frameworks and expanding technological options, SAF is uniquely positioned as a scalable, investable solution aligned with net-zero goals. The next phase of growth will favour those who move early, capitalise on innovation and align with partners building long-term SAF capacity.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:57:29.458066

It will use a new form of environmental credits related to that purchase to claim emissions reductions related to data center construction.

Under the deal, announced May 22, Microsoft will claim 622,500 metric tons of emissions reductions over a six-to-nine-year period against its Scope 3 footprint — which accounted for 96.5 percent of the technology company’s total footprint in its 2023 fiscal year.

For perspective, Microsoft used 605,000 carbon credits that year to make its carbon neutral claim. It has also purchased credits for close to 20 million tons of carbon removal.

Microsoft plans to use Sublime’s cement in data centers, infrastructure and offices wherever geographically possible. Most cement is used within a few hundred miles of where it is produced.

Microsoft’s footprint rose 31 percent between 2020 and 2024, largely because of data center expansion. Concrete and steel are carbon-intensive materials that together contribute 13 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. With much ado being made about the huge energy appetite of data centers that fuel artificial intelligence, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all seeking ways to address their construction-related emissions.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process instead of a combustion-driven kiln to manufacture a replacement for ordinary portland cement. The company, spun out of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has raised $200 million. That includes funding from venture capital firms including The Engine, Lowercarbon Capital and Energy Impact Partners, along with an $87 million award by the Department of Energy in 2024 — funding that so far has not been affected by the Trump administration’s shifting priorities.

“We see a big opportunity to both domesticate and modernize U.S. cement making,” said Sublime CEO and Co-founder Leah Ellis. The U.S. imports more than 20 percent of its cement, and Sublime’s technology could change that locus. Two factories in the Northeast have closed in the past 18 months because of outdated technologies.

Microsoft is the anchor customer for Sublime’s first commercial facility being built in Holyoke, Massachusetts, slated to begin deliveries in 2028. One of the biggest construction companies in the Northeast, Suffolk, announced a $3 million investment on May 21 to buy cement from the factory.

“Sublime’s mission is no less than fundamentally reshaping a cornerstone of the global built environment landscape, and we are proud to support them through our capital, our network and our commitment to building a more sustainable world,” said Jit Kee Chin, executive vice president and chief technology officer for Suffolk’s investment arm, Suffolk Technologies.

Credits for low-carbon cement and steel

Terms of the Microsoft-Sublime deal weren’t disclosed, but the company is positioning the contract as a way to provide early demand signals for the startup’s first factory, which will produce about 30,000 tons of cement annually. “Microsoft is a market maker,” Ellis said.

Sublime’s first commercial deliveries are slated for 2028; the startup hopes to support a full-scale facility with a capacity of 1 million tons potentially by 2030, she said.

Microsoft is using a new category of environmental attribute certificate (EAC) for concrete and steel to justify its investment. The certificates are legal mechanisms companies use to calculate emissions reductions. One common type is renewable energy certificates, which many businesses use to offset emissions from purchased electricity.

Environmental attribute certificates are used to spur investments in technologies that decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors including aviation, freight rail and maritime shipping. The new ones that will be issued under the Microsoft-Sublime deal are based on a methodology Microsoft developed with carbon management consulting firm Carbon Direct.

“While we prioritize deploying physical material whenever possible, this EAC approach helps both buyers and sellers overcome geographic, supply chain, cost and other barriers that make it challenging to introduce new technologies,” said Katie Ross, director of carbon reduction strategy and market development at Microsoft.

Goal: Scale availability of low-carbon cement

Microsoft’s purchases will be independently verified, although the details of how that will happen haven’t yet been determined, said A.J. Simon, director of industrial decarbonization at Carbon Direct. The certificates will be managed by a book and claim system, similar to what’s in place for sustainable aviation fuel.

The methodology published as a guide for other companies recommends that certificates be vetted using seven criteria, such as whether purchases will complement direct procurement of steel, cement and concrete.

“The intention is to set high-integrity standards for commodity EACs that will improve confidence in this mechanism,” Simon said. “The thresholds for quality in the report reflect Microsoft’s decarbonization; other companies may decide to weight the criteria differently.”

The prepurchase commitments made possible by the EACs act as accelerants for startups, Ellis said. Despite uncertain macroeconomic conditions, Sublime isn’t making big adjustments, and it’s working closely with three of the world’s largest cement producers — Holcim, Amrize and CRH — to focus on the long term. “This isn’t an industry that pivots quickly,” Ellis said.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WS-Development_Lobby-Pour-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:57:33.366345

The acquisition of London-based Johnson Matthey’s catalyst unit expands the Charlotte-based tech and electronics manufacturing giant’s energy and sustainability business segment, Honeywell CEO and chairman Vimal Kapur said in a statement Thursday.

Johnson Matthey designs and manufactures catalysts for the automotive, energy and chemical industries, according to the company’s website. The catalysts remove pollutants and improve efficiency in industrial processes.

The all-cash transaction is expected to be completed within the first half of next year, pending regulatory approvals.

The deal means Honeywell will be able to offer customers “a comprehensive solution for the production of lower emission, critical fuels including sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, blue hydrogen and blue ammonia, which enhance energy security and reduce emissions,” Honeywell said.

“As demand for diversified sources of energy continues accelerating, we will better enable Honeywell to offer the innovation our customers need,” Kapur said.

Johnson Matthey’s catalyst business has about 1,900 employees in the U.S., Europe and India. Honeywell has 1,300 employees in Charlotte and nearly 100,000 workers worldwide.

Honeywell’s latest moves

The Johnson Matthey acquisition is the latest in a series of moves by Honeywell as it reconfigures parts of its operations.

In February, Honeywell said it would spin off its automation and aerospace tech businesses. The separations are expected to be completed by the second half of 2026.

In October, Honeywell announced it would spin off its advanced materials business, a transaction that is expected to be completed this year.

The splits will create three independent, publicly-traded companies.

Charlotte will be Honeywell’s automation business headquarters, while the aerospace business headquarters will be based in Phoenix, Arizona, and advanced materials business will be in Morris Plains, New Jersey.

Since December 2023, Honeywell has announced closing on $11 billion in acquisitions, including: Carrier Global Corp.’s security business, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, Air Products LNG business and Sundyne.

We have set out below an overview of the current regulatory frameworks governing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the key jurisdictions of the UK, EU and USA.

SAF has emerged as a critical component in the global drive to decarbonise the aviation sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF offers substantial reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions by incorporating renewable feedstocks and innovative production technologies.

Recognising its potential to drive sustainable growth, policymakers across the UK, EU, and USA are actively shaping regulatory frameworks to accelerate its deployment and adoption.

Note that this is an evolving regulatory landscape that is subject to change – however, this overview sets out the current regulations and initiatives of each of the UK, EU and USA – and strongly indicates the direction of travel of each of these jurisdictions.

We conclude with a comparison of these jurisdictions and analyse their strengths and limitations in fostering market growth. We also examine potential pathways for future development, including harmonisation of international standards, technological advancements, and policy synergies.

By presenting such analysis and exploring projected trends, this overview offers insights into the role of regulation in shaping the trajectory of SAF as an essential enabler of sustainable aviation.

United Kingdom

The UK SAF landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

The UK’s SAF industry is progressing rapidly, driven by a number of policy measures that integrate SAF into the UK’s broader decarbonisation goals. With increasing regulatory and financial support, the UK aims to position itself as a global leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use.

A key component of this strategy is the SAF Mandate, alongside other legislative and market-based incentives designed to accelerate SAF adoption. Under these principles, SAF is defined based on achieving a minimum level of greenhouse gas emission reductions and specific sustainability criteria.

The key features include the introduction of compulsory, incrementally increasing SAF supply requirements, a buy-out mechanism to enforce compliance, and funding incentives to support industry growth.

The Jet Zero Taskforce (JZT) (building on the previous Government’s Jet Zero Council) was announced by the UK Government in November 2024 to advance sustainable aviation. Members include UK Government ministers, industry leaders and academics. Established to accelerate the transition to net zero aviation by 2050, the JZT aims to streamline aviation decarbonization priorities and support the development, production, commercialisation and use of SAF in the UK and globally.

Legislation

The UK is at the forefront of SAF development as the one of the first countries in the world to legislate for mandatory SAF requirements. The UK’s key policy to decarbonize aviation and secure demand for SAF is the SAF Mandate.

SAF Mandate

Key terms (2025 onwards):

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024 came into force on January 1, 2025. This introduced compulsory SAF requirements for suppliers of at least 15.9 terajoules (c.468,000 litres) per year of aviation fuel to the UK: from 2025, SAF is required to make up 2% of the total UK aviation fuel mix, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

SAF suppliers earn Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for SAF supplied to the UK that meets certain GHG emission reductions and sustainability criteria (SAF must comprise fuel that achieves minimum GHG emission reductions of 40% relative to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel). Evidence of the SAF supplied to UK needs to be provided to the Department for Transport to assess and award corresponding certificates. The number of certificates issued will be proportionate to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered (i.e. the greater the reductions, the greater the number of certificates issued). Suppliers can either use their certificates to demonstrate that they have complied with their obligations or trade them to other suppliers.

HEFA Caps (2027 onwards):

SAF produced through hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) can contribute 100% of SAF for the first 2 years of the Mandate and thereafter decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

This is due primarily to HEFA’s emission reduction inefficiencies (when compared to SAF alternatives) and feedstock sustainability concerns.

Power to Liquid (PtL) Obligations (2028-2040):

A separate PtL obligation requires 0.2% of UK aviation fuel to be sourced from PtL commencing in 2028 and thereafter rising to 4.4% by 2040.

PtL requires energy-derived production of aviation fuels (from e.g. green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide).

Buy-out Mechanism (2025 onwards):

Fuel suppliers unable to meet their SAF Mandate requirements must pay a buy-out price determined by their SAF or PtL shortfall amounts.

The aim is to create a financial incentive to prioritize SAF, with the buy-out prices (currently £4.70 per litre for SAF and £5.00 per litre for PtL) being set at a level to encourage the supply of SAF over the use of the buy-out.

SAF Revenue Support

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill (2024) was announced in the King’s speech on 17 July 2024, proposing a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers investing in UK-based facilities. A number of funding options were proposed and, in January 2025, the UK Government confirmed that the Guaranteed Strike Price mechanism was the preferred option.

The Guaranteed Strike Price is envisaged to operate akin to a contract-for-difference (as utilised in the UK renewable power sector), offering price stability for UK SAF producers. The mechanism will operate through a private law contract between a UK SAF producer and a designated Government agency, establishing a strike price (being the guaranteed price the producer will receive for eligible SAF over a specified period). If the reference price surpasses the strike price, the producer reimburses the Government agency for the difference, and, if the reference price falls below the strike price, the Government agency compensates the producer for the shortfall.

In line with the “polluter pays” principle, the UK Government has confirmed that it intends for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by aviation fuel suppliers.

Further SAF Incentives

To further promote UK SAF development, the UK Government has implemented various financial incentives:

Advanced Fuels Fund: First launched in 2022 with £165 million of grant funding available, the Advanced Fuels Fund aims to support the establishment and development of first-of-a-kind SAF projects in the UK.

SAF Clearing House: Any new aviation fuel must meet strict specifications and undergo testing to meet industry standards; the cost and complexity of which can be a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. The UK SAF Clearing House provides technical support and funding to SAF producers.

Furthermore, aircraft operators can reduce their obligations under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by using eligible SAF, which qualifies for emissions reductions under the scheme.

Projections and Insight

It is estimated that, by 2050, the global aviation industry will need approximately 400 million tonnes of SAF annually to meet international decarbonization goal and, whilst the SAF market is still in a nascent stage of its development, the UK is positioned to play a significant role in the global effort to decarbonize aviation. The development of SAF production facilities in the UK are key for the successful implementation of the UK Government’s SAF goals.

The SAF Mandate has only just come into force and the revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers has yet to be finalized and take effect. As such it remains to be seen whether these mechanisms will be sufficient to meet international decarbonization goals and position the UK as a leader in SAF development, production, commercialisation and use:

The success of the buy-out mechanism in incentivizing the production and use of SAF will depend on the future production costs of SAF. Whilst the buyout rates are currently projected to exceed SAF production costs, if the buy-out price is set too low (for example, if production costs spiral), suppliers may choose to simply pay the buy- out price.

With respect to the revenue certainty mechanism, there are a number of questions and policy decisions that remain outstanding: what will be used as the “reference price” (unlike in the power market where there is a published market price for electricity, no such benchmark exists for SAF)? How will the strike price adjust over time? Precisely how will the mechanism be funded? At a most fundamental level, the deployment of significant capital into SAF development will require further clarity regarding the revenue certainty mechanism.

For further clarity on the information above, we set out below (at Figure 1) a timeline of key projected regulatory developments in the UK SAF market.

European Union

The EU SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Despite efforts to curb its growth, commercial flights in the EU could rise by up to 42% by 2040 compared to 2017. Recognizing the pressing need to address the climate impact of the aviation sector, the EU has prioritized the development of a SAF market. By leveraging the collective action potential of its member states, the EU is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF implementation.

SAF is defined by the EU as a “drop-in” aviation fuel, including advanced biofuels or biofuels produced from sustainable feedstocks, recycled carbon fuels, or synthetic fuels.

With mandates introduced in 2023 and effective as from January 2025, the European Union is meticulously crafting a policy framework to stabilize the SAF market, foster innovation, and create a level playing field, driving progress toward its Fit-to-55 climate goals.

Legislation

The European regulatory framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been shaped by two key legislative milestones: the Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

The RED have progressively established binding renewable energy targets across the EU, including for the transport sector, and have increasingly integrated SAF into the broader energy transition strategy. From RED I (2009), which set initial renewable energy targets, to RED II (2018), which introduced incentives for SAF, and finally RED III (2023), which reinforced sector-specific mandates, these directives have paved the way for SAF regulation.

Complementing this framework, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in 2023, marks a decisive shift in SAF development by imposing direct obligations on fuel suppliers at EU airports. Unlike the RED directives, this regulation is immediately applicable across the EU and imposes a progressive incorporation of SAF into jet fuel, with binding quotas extending to 2050. Together, these two instruments define the roadmap for SAF deployment, balancing long-term policy incentives with immediate regulatory requirements.

RED Directives

RED served as the cornerstone for establishing the EU’s shift toward greener fuels.

Adopted on April 23, 2009, the RED I Directive introduced ambitious renewable energy targets across EU Member States:

General Targets: Each Member State was assigned a binding target to achieve 20% renewable energy in its final energy consumption by 2020. These targets varied for each country: Some countries were optimistic about their renewable energy potential and set ambitious targets, such as Sweden with 49% by 2020, Denmark with 30%, and France with 23%. Others, however, were more cautious, with the Netherlands setting a target of 14% and Italy aiming for 17%.

Transport Sector: A specific target of 10% renewable energy was set for the transport sector by 2020. This included biofuels and other renewable fuels but did not explicitly address aviation.

Impact on SAF: While RED I did not explicitly include SAF, it established a foundation for their future integration by defining sustainability criteria and promoting advanced biofuels.

Entering into force on December 11, 2018, the RED II Directive strengthened the EU’s renewable energy framework in response to increased climate ambitions:

Revised Targets: The overall binding target for emissions reduction was raised to 32%, with a renewable energy target of 14% for the transport sector.

Promotion of SAF

AdvancedBiofuelsandRFNBOs: The RED II Directive encouraged the use of advanced biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), explicitly including SAF. Advanced biofuels refer to biofuels produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to land-use changes that could negatively impact biodiversity. They are typically derived from waste and residues, or non-food crops such as algae and plant fibers. As for RFNBOs, they are fuels produced from renewable electricity rather than biological sources.

IncentiveMultipliers

Biofuels derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX (including advanced biofuels) count twice their energy content towards renewable targets, meaning that for every unit of energy produced from these fuels, it counts as two units towards the target.

Fuels supplied to the aviation sector (including RFNBOs) count as 1.2 times their energy content, meaning that for every unit of energy from these fuels, it counts as 1.2 units toward the target.

Limitations on Food-Based Biofuels: These are capped at 7% to mitigate adverse effects on land use and food production.

Adopted on October 18, 2023, the RED III Directive was a decisive step towards integrating SAF into the EU’s energy framework, by:

Enhanced Targets: The share of renewable energy in the EU’s overall energy consumption must reach 42.5% by 2030, with a binding target of 29% for the transport sector.

Sectoral Sub-Targets: Specific targets were introduced for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs, solidifying SAF’s role as a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization.

Aviation Catalyst: RED III emphasized increased SAF integration into national energy strategies while supporting emerging technologies, such as synthetic fuels.

Directives are legal acts that generally need be transposed into national law by EU member states, meaning that each country must adopt its own legislation to achieve the directive’s objectives. Therefore, the RED directives’ provisions need to be transposed into national law. There is generally an 18-month deadline for member states to do so, with an occasionally shorter deadline for some provisions.

Member States successfully met the RED I targets, despite varying national goals, demonstrating the EU’s commitment to renewable energy. This progress laid the foundation for the more ambitious targets in RED II and RED III, and Member States are on track to achieve these goals. In particular, the push for SAF under these directives is progressing well, with ongoing efforts to scale production and expand infrastructure. While challenges remain, Member States are well- positioned to meet the targets for both renewable energy and SAF by 2030, especially with the introduction of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation.

ReFuelEU Aviation regulation

Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of October 18, 2023 through ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU Aviation) represents a cornerstone of the EU’s strategy to decarbonize aviation in line with the Green Deal objectives and the Fit-for-55 package. This regulation establishes a comprehensive legal framework to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the EU.

Finalized in 2023, most of its provisions entered into force on 1 January 2024, with Articles 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 becoming applicable from January 1, 2025. As an EU regulation, ReFuelEU Aviation is directly applicable in all Member States without requiring transposition into national law.

The regulation imposes binding SAF blending obligations on aviation fuel suppliers, requiring them to progressively integrate SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandated SAF share begins at 2% in 2025 and will increase incrementally to 70% by 2050, of which a dedicated sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels starts at 0.7% in 2030, reaching 35% by 2050 (see Figure 2). For instance, the goal for 2040 is to achieve a 42% share of SAF in the aviation fuel supplied to EU airports, with 15% of that being synthetic.

To be eligible, SAF must comply with the sustainability and emissions reduction criteria set out in RED I. Acceptable SAF sources include advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels derived from renewable hydrogen, and recycled carbon aviation fuels. Fuel suppliers may also utilize hydrogen for direct aircraft propulsion or synthetic low-carbon fuels.

Within this regulatory framework, synthetic fuels—particularly e-kerosene—are set to play an increasingly prominent role, with a specific mandate ensuring their integration into the fuel mix.

EU airport operators are required to facilitate access to SAF, while aviation fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators must systematically collect and report data to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and national competent authorities to ensure regulatory compliance.

The regulation further establishes enforcement mechanisms, designating national competent authorities responsible for supervision. Fuel suppliers failing to meet their SAF blending obligations will face financial penalties and must compensate for any shortfall by supplying the missing volume the following year.

By setting clear, long-term SAF quotas through 2050, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation creates a stable and predictable market framework, reinforcing the EU’s ambition to achieve a more sustainable aviation sector.

Figure 2: SAF Mandate Levels in the ReFuelEU Directive

Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and Financial Incentives for SAF

In addition to the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, the EU’s climate strategy for the aviation sector is reinforced by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established under Directive 2003/87/EC. As a “cap-and-trade” mechanism, the EU ETS aims to progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on total emissions while allowing market- based trading of emission allowances. Initially, free allowances were allocated to aircraft operators based on the average emission of the sector and their historical performance. In 2023, approximately 22.5 million aviation allowances were allocated for free, while about 5.7 million were auctioned.

To accelerate decarbonization, the EU has initiated a phased reduction of free emission allowances for aircraft operators:

In 2024, free allowances were reduced by 25%;

In 2025, they will be further cut by 50%;

By 2026, all free allowances will be phased out, requiring operators to fully cover their emissions through auctioning.

This transition is designed to incentivize the adoption of SAF, as airlines can lower their compliance costs by integrating SAF into their fuel mix. To support this shift, the EU has introduced targeted financial incentives within the EU ETS framework:

A dedicated SAF allowance mechanism provides 20 million allowances (valued at approximately €1.7 billion) until 2030, rewarding aircraft operators based on SAF usage. This mechanism helps bridge the price gap between conventional aviation fuel and SAF. SAF remains significantly more expensive to produce. However, by reducing compliance costs for airlines under the EU ETS, it makes SAF adoption more financially viable, supporting the transition to cleaner aviation fuels while maintaining competitiveness in the sector.

SAF that meets RED sustainability criteria is attributed zero emissions under the EU ETS, reducing the number of allowances airlines must purchase.

Beyond emissions trading, the EU has also introduced monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) measures for non-CO₂ aviation effects, with additional policy proposals expected by 2028.

Financial Support Mechanisms for SAF Development

Recognizing the financial and technological challenges associated with SAF production, the EU has established several funding instruments to support research, innovation, and large-scale deployment:

EU Innovation Fund (EUIF): A €40 billion fund aimed at de-risking SAF production across various technology readiness levels. For example, the Innovation Fund awarded in 2023 a €167 million grant to the Biorefinery Östrand project, which seeks to develop, construct, and operate the world’s first large-scale biorefinery dedicated to producing renewable SAF and naphtha, in Östrand, Sweden.

Horizon Europe: The EU’s flagship €95.5 billion research and innovation program, which funds SAF-related projects.

InvestEU: A €26.2 billion initiative supporting sustainable infrastructure investments, including SAF production facilities. One of the most notable projects funded by InvestEU is the INERATEC synthetic fuel production facility in Frankfurt. Backed by a €70 million investment, this initiative is supported by a €40 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million non-repayable grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The funding will help develop Europe’s largest carbon-neutral synthetic fuel plant, set to open in 2025.

Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking: A €1.7 billion public-private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautics industry to accelerate the development of new aviation technologies.

Projections and Insight

While the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation establishes a robust framework and clear mandates for SAF adoption, several policy areas will require further clarification and potential amendments. The regulation’s overall timeline is generally aligned with industry expectations, but additional interventions may be necessary to ensure a smooth and effective implementation:

Penalty enforcement and cost volatility: The current penalty mechanism for suppliers failing to meet SAF quotas is directly tied to SAF costs, which remain highly volatile due to potential supply shortages. If SAF prices surge, penalties could become unsustainable, adding financial pressure on suppliers while delaying compliance. Additionally, without a price cap mechanism, rising SAF costs could impact air travel affordability, potentially triggering public and industry backlash.

Exploring a tradable SAF system: Under Article 15 of ReFuelEU, the European Commission is mandated to assess additional measures to enhance SAF market liquidity and ensure supply stability. One key consideration is the creation of a book-and-claim system, which would enable fuel suppliers and aircraft operators to purchase SAF credits and allocate them flexibly across EU airports. As of January 2025, the Commission’s report on these measures remains pending.

Beyond regulatory refinements, the political landscape in the EU is evolving, with recent electoral shifts favoring parties historically opposed to Green Deal policies. As EU policymakers shift their focus toward an Industrial Deal, maintaining strong momentum for SAF adoption will be critical. Ensuring a stable regulatory environment and continued financial support will be essential to securing the long-term success of SAF integration within the aviation sector.

The effectiveness of SAF regulations in the EU stems from the fact that they are binding, compelling operators to take immediate action and enhance their performance.

Despite its relatively high cost, airlines and operators are eager to contribute and even exceed their obligated SAF targets as early as possible. They understand that this is the only way to assert themselves in the market and to ensure the long- term sustainability and viability of the industry, which must adapt to greener practices to secure its future.

United States of America

The U.S. SAF Landscape

Current Status and Future Developments

Aviation represents roughly 3.3% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and jet fuel consumption is forecasted to increase by 2-3% annually through to 2050. This obviously presents significant opportunities for SAF investment, and the market has responded: projects have been announced in recent years that are projected to meet over 10% of U.S. jet fuel demand. Nonetheless, the biggest challenge SAF faces in the U.S. is that it is not cost-competitive with fossil jet fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, SAF currently costs two to ten times more than fossil jet fuel. Consequently, the federal and state incentives discussed in this section are playing and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of SAF in the U.S.

Federal Support for SAF

The U.S. government supports SAF development in several ways: annual renewable fuel regulatory mandates; tax policy; and grants. Several of these incentives are in flux, however, given the shift in the balance of political power in the U.S. Congress and the White House.

Regulatory Mandates:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issues annual regulations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program that require the national pool of transportation fuel to contain a certain percentage of alternative fuels such as SAF. Production and use of biofuels under these mandates is tracked using a system of tradeable credits (Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs). Among other requirements, eligible SAF must have lifecycle GHG emissions that are at least 50% below a 2005 fossil fuel baseline.

Although compliance with the program’s mandates falls on fossil fuel producers and importers, RINs implicitly subsidize biofuels such as SAF. Depending upon the feedstock and production process, SAF can generate RINs that may be used to meet the biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel or cellulosic biofuel mandates and value of the RIN varies by type. RINs generated by producing SAF can be “stacked” with federal tax credits for SAF, such as those provided by the 2022 IRA, as well as state credits relevant to SAF.

Tax Policy:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has a significant impact on the SAF market in the U.S. by offering comprehensive support to encourage the production and adoption of this fuel. Instead of setting mandates, the IRA offers SAF credits for qualified neat fuels and provides grants for SAF production and distribution.

The IRA supports SAF through two credits. First, IRA created a new SAF blender’s tax credit under Internal Revenue Code section 40B, available through to the end of 2024. Then, from January 1, 2025 through to December 31, 2027, the IRA made available a new technology neutral production credit for clean fuels including SAF, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The section 45Z credit provides a tax credit for the production of clean fuels that are “suitable for use in a highway vehicle or aircraft” and meet a specified threshold for emissions reductions. The credit is worth up to $1.00 per gallon for transportation fuels and $1.75 or more per gallon for SAF, provided that prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The 45Z credit is claimed by the producers of SAF, rather than the blenders, but can be transferred or sold to third parties as a means of monetizing the credit.

Since August 2022, significant work has been done by a multi-disciplinary task force including the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, the Energy Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the White House to implement the section 45Z credit and publish tax guidance. Most recently, on January 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2025-10 and Notice 2025-11, establishing an intent to propose regulations and clarifying annual emissions rates for the credit. At the same time, the 119th Congress is currently reviewing tax legislation that may include revisions to several clean energy tax credits established by the IRA, including section 45Z. As a result, airlines, SAF producers, and conventional energy companies are queuing up to talk to Congress and Trump tax officials about the future of federal tax support for clean fuels, since the current production credit is set to expire at the end of 2027.

Grants:

IRA Section 40007 establishes a grant program for eligible U.S. entities involved in SAF production, transportation, blending, or storage, administered by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grants program.

Section 324 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 2023 allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to pilot SAF usage, with a plan to be implemented by FY2028, while permitting waivers under certain conditions.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023 and 2024 authorize discretionary grants for airport infrastructure that supports SAF’s distribution and storage, provided they meet the 50% lifecycle GHG reduction requirement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America program also provides grants and loan guarantees to rural businesses and agricultural producers for renewable energy projects, including SAF production facilities.

State Incentives for SAF Production and Innovation

State-level policies further support SAF production and consumption by allowing producers to generate and sell credits to fossil jet fuel suppliers. In 2009, California established the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions in the state and develop a range of low- carbon and renewable alternatives to reduce petroleum dependency. This market-based program sets an annual average carbon intensity (CI) benchmark for all fuels – fossil and renewable – produced or imported into the state. Fuels with a CI below the benchmark (such as eligible SAF) generate credits that producers can sell to other fuel producers in the state as a revenue stream. Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted similar fuel programs.

In other states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska – per-gallon SAF production tax credits promote SAF alignment with national objectives.

Projections and Insight

By 2030, domestic SAF production is expected to reach 3 billion gallons annually – a 130-fold increase from 2030 consumption. By 2050, production could rise to 35 billion gallons per year, reflecting a 12-fold increase from the 2030 target.

The shift towards SAF represents a long-term transition in the aviation industry. Given the international nature of air travel, SAF is a clean fuel whose market drivers are largely insulated from the political swings of the US; and American airlines and airports will need to access this fuel to comply with global emissions standards. Driven by discretionary grants from the FAA, significant investments in airport infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage are anticipated. This could lead to an improved supply chain and logistics, facilitating broader SAF availability at major airports by 2025. Increased funding through grants and tax credits may accelerate research and development of new SAF feedstocks and production technologies, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This could also lead to advancements in alternative feedstocks, potentially doubling production efficiency by 2030. As government initiatives and incentives ramp up, it is likely that the market share of SAF in total jet fuel consumption will increase significantly from the current less than 0.1%. Projections estimate reaching 5 -10% market share by 2030, depending on regulatory support and industry adoption.

The incentives enacted under the IRA constitute a good beginning in establishing the support necessary for overcoming barriers to SAF adoption. With investors comparing the short three-year timeline of the IRA’s section 45Z clean fuel production credit to ten-year timelines for other clean energy technologies, producers and airlines are making a long-term legislative extension of the credit a top priority for 2025. State level initiatives, like the California LCFS program, look to play a critical role in driving SAF adoption. Other states may follow suit, creating a patchwork of supportive policies that could incentivize producers while also fostering competition among states for SAF leadership.

Conclusion: Comparative Analysis of SAF

Regulatory Frameworks in the UK, EU, and US

The regulatory approaches adopted by the UK, EU, and US to promote SAF reflect distinct policy priorities, economic

structures, and aviation market dynamics. Whilst all three jurisdictions recognize the need to scale SAF production to achieve net-zero aviation emissions, their methods for incentivization, mandate enforcement, and industry engagement exhibit some notable divergences.

Key Similarities

Despite differences in policy mechanisms, several overarching themes emerge across all three jurisdictions:

Mandatory Blending Requirements: The UK, EU, and US each employ a mix of blending mandates and incentives to encourage SAF adoption. The UK’s SAF Mandate (starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 22% by 2040) aligns with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which also begins at 2% in 2025 but escalates to 70% by 2050. Although the US lacks a direct federal blending mandate, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs create market-driven demand for SAF.

Financial Incentives: Each jurisdiction incorporates financial incentives to lower SAF’s production costs and bridge the price gap with fossil-based jet fuel. The UK’s proposed Revenue Support Mechanism, the EU’s SAF Allowance Mechanism under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the US’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits all aim to de-risk SAF investment. Notably, the US offers the most aggressive tax-based support via the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which directly rewards SAF producers.

Technology-Specific Targets: Recognizing the need for diversification in SAF production pathways, the UK and EU establish dedicated quotas for Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels and synthetic fuels, whereas the US allows greater flexibility in feedstocks, as seen in its Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and LCFS programs. The UK’s PtL obligation has similar aims to the EU’s sub-target for synthetic fuels, indicating a shared commitment to emerging technologies.

Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms: Each jurisdiction incorporates a credit trading system to enhance compliance flexibility. The UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs), the EU’s ETS allowances and (if to be applied) book-and-claim system, and the US’s RIN (Renewable Identification Number) market under the RFS facilitate compliance while stimulating a secondary market for SAF credits.

Key Differences

Despite these similarities, the jurisdictions differ in several key respects:

Direct v Market-Based Approach:

The EU and UK impose direct mandates on fuel suppliers, ensuring binding obligations for SAF blending. The UK’s buy-out mechanism acts as a penalty for non-compliance, while the EU enforces fines and requires compensation for missed SAF quotas.

The US primarily relies on market-driven incentives, with no direct SAF blending mandate at the federal level. Instead, state-based programs such as California’s LCFS and financial incentives like the IRA credits encourage voluntary SAF adoption.

Policy Longevity and Stability:

The EU offers the longest regulatory certainty, with ReFuelEU Aviation’s SAF mandates extending to 2050. The UK’s SAF Mandate provides clarity through 2040 but leaves open questions regarding future expansion.

The US approach is, potentially, more politically vulnerable. The IRA’s Section 45Z tax credit is set to expire by the end of 2027, raising questions about long-term investor confidence. This contrasts with the EU’s more predictable long-term regulatory trajectory.

Scope of SAF Eligibility and Feedstock Restrictions

The UK and EU impose stricter sustainability criteria, progressively limiting HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) (or similar) feedstock eligibility. The UK caps HEFA at 92% by 2027, declining to 35% by 2040, while the EU limits food-based biofuels to prevent indirect land-use impacts.

The US allows broader feedstock eligibility, including corn ethanol-derived alcohol-to-jet SAF, which the EU explicitly excludes. This reflects the political influence of the US agricultural sector, leading to a pragmatic approach to scaling SAF production with available resources.

Enforcement Mechanisms and Market Oversight

The EU employs oversight through the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and national regulatory bodies, ensuring strict compliance through direct penalties. The UK SAF Mandate will be administered by the UK’s Department for Transport and will be responsible for enforcing the scheme with power to revoke certificates or issue civil penalties.

The US relies on tax compliance mechanisms and voluntary participation in state-based LCFS (or similar) markets, which, as an incentive-driven approach results inleading to comparatively less stringent enforcement as can be expected in the EU and UK.

Comparative Insights and Future Implications

Each jurisdiction’s SAF strategy reflects its unique regulatory philosophy and economic priorities. The EU’s highly structured, mandate-driven approach aims to achieve rapid SAF integration but places cost burdens on fuel suppliers and buyers. The UK’s hybrid model, combining mandates with revenue support mechanisms, seeks to balance regulatory certainty with investment incentives. Meanwhile, the US favors a market-driven, incentive-based model, fostering innovation but opening up potential regulatory uncertainty due to shifting political landscapes.

This evolving landscape reflects a multi-faceted approach, balancing stringent emissions reduction targets with mechanisms that incentivise investment and production. The UK has introduced ambitious mandates within its Jet Zero strategy, while the EU’s Fit-to-55 package integrates SAF quotas through the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Meanwhile, the USA leverages tax credits and grant programs under initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act to stimulate domestic SAF production. These diverse regulatory tools aim to address the significant challenges of scaling SAF, including high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure constraints.

Looking ahead, international policy harmonization will be critical to ensuring the global scalability of SAF. The International Civil Aviation Organization and industry stakeholders may push for greater alignment between EU- style mandates and US-style incentives, potentially influencing future SAF policies. Additionally, ongoing bilateral agreements between the UK, EU, and US on carbon accounting, emissions reporting, and SAF certification will play a crucial role in fostering a globally integrated SAF market.

Despite their differences, the UK, EU, and US share the common goal of scaling SAF production to enable a net zero aviation future. While their paths to achieving this differ, their collective efforts will be instrumental in driving the technological and economic transformation needed for sustainable aviation. As regulatory frameworks evolve, continued cross-border collaboration and policy adjustments will be essential to maximizing SAF’s impact on global decarbonization goals.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9762_2059.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:57:26.354044

He emphasised the urgent need to develop a master plan for SAF development, participating in CORSIA towards achieving two goals of ensuring the competitiveness of the aviation industry, and implementing a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""Participation in the ICAO's CORSIA is not only an international responsibility, but also an opportunity for the Vietnamese aviation industry to improve its capacity and proactively adapt to increase technical standards. SAF is also an important part of a strategy for developing a circular, green, and sustainable economy,"" he said.

At the event, representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, aviation enterprises, airport service operators, and petroleum businesses discussed adaptation capacity, assessed the level of impact on economic efficiency and competitiveness by using SAF, participating in CORSIA; scale and demand for SAF use in Vietnam; the ability to supply and produce SAF among domestic petroleum enterprises; and support policies to encourage the production, business, and distribution of SAF.

The DPM assigned the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam to complete a dossier and report to the Ministry of Construction (MoC) to submit to the competent authority for approval.

Domestic petroleum production and processing enterprises were asked to draw up plans to develop SAF production, including technology, land, tax, finance, and market assessment to ensure efficiency and avoid internal competition.

The Vietnam Airports Corporation will coordinate with aviation fuel suppliers to review and develop storage infrastructure, pipelines, and SAF fuel filling systems at major international airports.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment shall preside over and coordinate with relevant parties to develop a legal framework for the carbon market, implement a carbon credit exchange mechanism, and recognise the aviation industry's emission calculation method in accordance with ICAO standards.

He also directed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study the fee collection mechanism for international flights departing from Vietnam; tax policies and financial support to encourage the development of the domestic SAF market; limit the export of raw materials for domestic SAF production; coordinate with the ICAO and the European Union in the negotiation process to ensure unity and harmonization of common standards;

According to a report by the MoC, SAF is produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, animal fat, agricultural by-products, urban waste, and others that have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel (Jet A-1). SAF can be blended with Jet A-1 and used directly for existing aircraft without changing technical infrastructure.

At present, Vietnamese airlines are adapting to the EU's SAF regulations when operating flights to this bloc. They are preparing to participate in CORSIA according to the ICAO roadmap.

Karen Walker:

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Window Seat, our Aviation Week Air Transport podcast. I'm ATW and Aviation Week Network Air Transport Editor-in-Chief Karen Walker. Delighted to welcome you on board. Now, joining me today are three of my editor colleagues. They are ATW Europe and Middle East Editor Alan Dron, who is based in London, ATW and Routes Senior Editor Aaron Karp, and CAPA Senior Analyst Americas Lori Ranson. Aaron and Lori, like me, are based in the Washington, D.C. area, so a big welcome to everyone. Thank you for joining me today. Our discussion is going to focus on two big air transport industry topics, safety and sustainability. Think about it as the two S's, and more specifically, how the approaches and priorities towards air transport safety and sustainability by governments and agencies either side of the Atlantic have shifted this year.

In the U.S. there was a fatal collision in January between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet that was on final approach to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. There have also been multiple near-miss accidents involving airliners at or over major U.S. airports. This month, the new Trump administration announced big and urgent plans to modernize the country's air traffic management system. New DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has also announced a plan for New York Newark Airport, that saw three ATC system outages in April and May. Newark, Duffy said, has become a top priority for new ATC equipment and modernization and reorganization. While that work gets underway, airlines are being asked to cut the numbers of flights in and out of the busy New Jersey airport, which is also a hub for United Airlines.

Over in Europe, the air traffic management coordinator, Eurocontrol, has warned of a potentially bad summer of air traffic congestion and delays unless urgent action is taken, which presumably will also mean cutting flights. In the UK, meanwhile, hundreds of airline industry and fuel experts gathered in May at a Sustainable Skies Summit in Farnborough to discuss the increasingly uncertain likelihood of the global air transport industry meeting its goal of being carbon net zero by 2050.

Why are these things linked? Well, in my opinion, the swerve toward maintaining or restoring safety in the skies has become the number one topic this year when it comes to commercial aviation, and that I think has implications for how much focus, investment and research will go into aviation sustainability, which of course is also a huge topic. I think there's a practicality and inevitability that when there are two big problems, air travel safety and air travel sustainability, with both being very complicated and expensive tasks, safety will obviously win.

With that, Aaron, let me start with you. Timelines for the U.S. DOT plan for ATC modernization in general and for Newark in particular are vague, but Secretary Duffy has referred a lot to the 2025 to 2028 window in general and to now in Newark. Is that realistic?

Aaron Karp:

In a word, I would say no. First of all, there's a real money issue here. In the Biden administration's last budget proposal, they proposed 8 billion over five years for ATC modernization, and you mentioned the word vague. There's been a lot of vagueness about how much this is going to cost, and the estimate being thrown out there is about 12.5 billion. You can see that there would be a significant increase needed, but I think there's a lot of feeling out there that it's a lot more than 12.5 billion. Congress is right now wrangling with a budget bill, and they're going to put or have said that they're going to put ATC modernization in there, but we'll see. I think that that's the problem and has always been the problem with ATC modernization, is that they have to rely on funding from Congress and a procurement process for technology and that sort of thing.

I think there's a structural issue. We've talked before on this podcast about how the FAA has an inherent conflict of interest, in that they both regulate and operate the ATC system. There's been debates for a year about ATC privatization and going to a model more like, say, Canada or the UK, where Canada has Nav Canada operating air traffic control and also doing a lot of innovative things, in fact developing their own technology that they often then sell to the rest of the world. Then Transport Canada regulates it. There's a division there and one can focus on the operation, one can focus on the regulation, and you get a lot of the bureaucracy out of ATC and ATC is able to function on a more consistent monetary timeline.

I think, also in terms of the structural issues, there's been a lot of talk about equipment and modernizing the equipment. The average age of an ATC tower in the United States is 40 years. The average age of an en route center is 62 years. The FAA has said ... and this is a quote ... that these facilities have functioned beyond their intended lifespans. In some sense you're talking about having to, if you really want to modernize the system, rebuilding these facilities or significantly modernizing them, because there's a lot of maintenance issues that are constantly cropping up just because of the age.

The last thing I would say is that air traffic control technology moves faster than often the ability to modernize it. You come up with a system in, say, 2015, and you do the procurement and you install it, and then by the time you install it, there's new technology out there. The thing that air traffic control providers are really trying to move towards is something called trajectory-based operations, or TBO, which would mean that the airplane, from the moment it taxis from the gate at one airport to the moment it lands at the other airport, is constantly sending information to air traffic control, so the people in the tower are not just getting the aircraft just before it's coming into their airspace.

They're getting information the whole way, and so they can say, long before the airplane gets to the airport, ""Change your route a little bit here, avoid this weather there."" That would create significant efficiencies, but that's something that's still being worked on. That would require equipment in airliners. It's an ongoing process, and even if you do everything you can, even if they achieve everything they can, they won't have fixed some of the underlying problem, not just in the U.S., in the world, that air traffic control is very reactive rather than predictive. That reactive nature inevitably leads to inefficiencies.

Karen Walker:

There's a really good point, Aaron. Thank you. I think it's interesting that you raised about privatization. I think with this whole thing, you and I and Lori, we've heard this over and over again for so long. Secretary Duffy, with all due respect, has not. He's only just come into this world this year. I don't think there is an understanding of just the amount of bureaucracy and how slow this machine works when it comes to these things. As you say, it's not just a money thing, although the money is big. It's not really even just an equipment thing. It's how the system is managed. Right now they are 3,000 short of air traffic controllers as well, and you can't just pick people off the street and pop those into the towers and it all works. There's a lot to do. Lori, you live in the States too. What's your thoughts here, and what do you think prompted Secretary Duffy to make these announcements so soon in his tenure?

Lori Ranson:

Well, he walked into his job right as that jolting and fatal crash happened at National, and since then we've seen some other high-profile incidents, again at National and elsewhere in the U.S. airspace system. That has prompted some partisan rhetoric that the system was safer under the previous administration. Coming out, I think, with a bold plan for these ATC upgrades is in some ways a show of force to the public, that DOT is going to finally move the needle in a significant way on ATC reform. Of course, Duffy has claimed the Biden administration failed to do that.

Even without the fatal crash in January and other recent incidents, though, aviation is such a high-profile industry that working to achieve some reforms will be a major win. Also, just simply, given the major disruptions at Newark, the crash and other incidents, no action from the DOT or the FAA just makes for bad optics.

Karen Walker:

That is very true, yeah. You've got to be seen to be doing something here. Yeah, that is true. Alan, can we just turn to Europe? You're based in the UK, which used to be part of Europe, and so you have firsthand experience of the types of air traffic congestion and delays there. It amused me that Eurocontrol is putting out this warning of a potential bad summer of congestion and delays. I'm thinking, ""So what's new?"" It always is there, isn't it? We've just had the Paris Orly Airport have a big outage of its control tower, just this week. What's your perspective of what Eurocontrol is trying to do there?

Alan Dron:

Well, Karen, Eurocontrol has put forward a plan to hopefully get through the busy summer period, and that includes things like filing realistic flight plans, prioritizing the first rotation of the day and ensuring that schedules are realistic, which I have to say sounds so basic that you wouldn't really have thought those things would need to be said. I was talking to Eurocontrol yesterday and they're forecasting a 5% increase in flights this summer, but potentially a 20% increase in delays over 2024, and 2024 wasn't exactly good.

Now, to be fair to Eurocontrol, they do point out that they've been urging countries to invest in new equipment and more controllers for years, but that's the point. It's ultimately down to individual governments and ANSPs to sort out funding, and it's just not happening. Eurocontrol estimates it's 10 to 20% down on the number of air traffic controllers needed in certain countries. Not all, certain countries such as Spain, Germany, Greece, and several in the Balkans. The Spanish and Greek situation doesn't bode well for people taking Mediterranean holidays this summer. You might be advised to perhaps pack a good paperback to read while you're waiting at airports, like War and Peace perhaps.

Eurocontrol also makes the point that the war in Ukraine has made about 20% of its airspace unusable, which has led to much heavier traffic flows around that country, and countries on the periphery just haven't been staffed up to cope with displaced flows. That's fair enough. As an Airlines for Europe spokesman said to me this week, ""Well, yeah, we understand, but the war's been going on for three years now. Surely they could have worked something out by now."" Will airlines reduce summer flights this late in the game if delays become too bad? I guess the answer is only if they have absolutely no choice in the matter.

Karen Walker:

I love the point you made at the beginning there of it almost begs belief, really, how basic, the things Eurocontrol are saying that they're going to make a priority this year. You just think, ""Well, why weren't they always a priority?"" If you're talking about asking airlines to cut their schedules for this summer, that should have been done last year before they set their schedules. They've set their schedules. They've sold the tickets. It just seems again like they're just making decisions too late. It just seems like more of the same. I don't know about you, but ... it sounds like we're on the same page here ... I don't feel a lot of optimism that just because they put the warning out, that something's going to happen.

Alan Dron:

I feel you're right. I feel it could be a pretty bad summer for people trying to get around Europe this year.

Karen Walker:

Alan, I said this was about safety and sustainability. I'm going to turn back to you on sustainability, now because you were at that Sustainable Skies Summit in Farnborough just a couple of weeks back. Can you just give us a little flavor? What was the mood among speakers there and attendees, in terms of we know that there is now much more uncertainty about meeting the 2050 goal? We also know that they're putting out a lot of estimates on big numbers for costs for all of this, and now everybody's turning to safety. Did this come up in the conversation? What was the general mood, and optimism or not?

Alan Dron:

As you know, Karen ... you and I have been in enough conferences over the years ... sometimes it is not what's actually said at a conference that strikes you, it's just a gut feel. The gut feel I came away from after two days was that, as you said, there's just an awful lot of uncertainty. Uncertainty about government policy, uncertainty about government support in funding terms, uncertainty about whether the economics of sustainable aviation fuel plants are even there.

I have to say, when you have the head of sustainability at the UK regulator, the CAA, stand up and say there's a, quote, huge amount of uncertainty, close quote, as to whether the UK aviation sector will be able to hit its sustainability targets, and that it is going to be, quote, incredibly hard, close quote, to meet emission reduction targets, I think you've got problems.

You may recall, about three years ago now, the then-head of Qatar Airways, the very forthright Akbar Al Baker, rather put the cat among the pigeons when he basically said there was no way in hell that commercial aviation would meet its hopes for 2050 targets. I have to say increasingly I feel perhaps he was right.

Karen Walker:

Yeah. Sadly, I'm with you there. I concur. I think there's been a big reality check, and now it's an even bigger issue because of, like I say, this understandable switch to safety. As you say, they probably can't both be done together at the strength that they need to be done. Aaron, Lori, if I can turn back to you, IATA has often said that if the European single skies initiative was implemented ... that's a modern integrated ATM system across Europe ... the efficiencies could reduce airline emissions by as much as 12%. Presumably they'd be the same kind of metrics if the U.S. had implemented NextGen, its own ATM modernization plan, that has essentially gone nowhere. I wonder whether either of you feel that there is a potential sustainability payoff if there was ATM modernization fast-tracking on both sides of the Atlantic. Aaron, can I start with you?

Aaron Karp:

Sure. I actually think they're very related, in that if sustainable aviation fuel is going to be a challenge and is increasingly seen as unrealistic, the engine technology, I mean, if you talk to experts like at Embry-Rendell University, they'll say the jet engine has reached its ... the increasing amazing improvements in efficiency that have been made generation to generation have reached the end of the line, that you can't improve the efficiency much more. We're still dealing with the same aerodynamic airframe design.

The really realistic path for reducing emissions would be air traffic control. I think airlines could pivot, certainly, to saying this is not just a safety issue. If you want to reduce emissions, like you said, there's the 12% that they've talked about, the integrated sky. I mentioned trajectory-based operations. There's a lot of talk that that would significantly reduce emissions.

It seems to me, at least in the near term, that if you're saying that SAF is unrealistic and the technology, hydrogen technology, that sort of thing, is unrealistic, then the best way, the best realistic way to reduce emissions, would be to modernize ATC to have much more efficient flight paths. I think there is a real connection there.

Karen Walker:

Yeah, absolutely. Lori, what about you? I mean, they've known this for the longest time, or at least on the airline side they've been saying, ""We also need efficient air traffic management systems."" Is this the moment, the light bulb moment, for the governments too?

Lori Ranson:

Well, and I think airlines need to push the sustainability aspect of air traffic modernization, because it's inherent. With these new procedures, in terms of takeoff and landing procedures, airspace procedures, the aircraft just burn less fuel, far less fuel. If you can implement these procedures, your emissions are going to be cut. Your emissions are going to decrease. I don't understand why airlines don't push for the sustainability angle as well as the safety angle, because I think they're intertwined, like you said earlier.

Karen Walker:

Yeah. It makes sense, and that could be a pivot that actually would be useful. As you say, the procedures are a huge part of this, but it's also all those planes ... especially in Europe, as Alan knows ... that are doing endless circles because of congestion. They're burning fuel, aren't they? Alan?

Alan Dron:

Yeah. I just smiled to myself when you talked about implementing the equivalent of Single European Sky as a modern integrated ATM system in the United States. As you and I know, Single European Sky, well, let's just say I've seen glaciers move faster than the Single European Sky project. For non-European listeners, one of the main objects of the Single European Sky was to get rid of some of the national airspace boundaries and combine larger multinational areas into what they call functional airspace blocks.

Now, this largely simply hasn't happened, for three main reasons. Firstly, some countries frankly don't like the idea of giving up sovereignty over their airspace. Secondly, air traffic control unions are fearful of job losses. Thirdly, frankly, there's no political momentum behind it. It just never comes to the top of the things-to-do agenda. Single European Sky, I'm told it is progressing, but at a very, very slow pace. It's really not delivering the benefits that people had hoped for.

Karen Walker:

As you say. Well, the problem there, a lot of the problem anyway, part of the problem, is national thinking when they're supposed to be thinking across all of the space, the European Union, but they're not. They do like to also think of sustainability in national terms too. They all have their own ideas, but they still came around an EU mandate, if you like, when it came to sustainability. Again, maybe a light bulb could eventually go off.

Everyone, can I just finally ask, I mentioned about the increasing costs of transitioning aviation to net zero. IATA has put that at around $4.7 trillion over 30 years. If there is less financial support from governments, oil companies, investors, et cetera, who's going to pay for that? We know it can't all come down onto the airlines. They haven't got any money. The public says it wants clean flights. We're always hearing that, but will they pay higher fares for them, or will they just be happy to focus on, ""Is my flight safe,"" and not worry about sustainability as this goes forward? Lori, can I start with you on that one?

Lori Ranson:

Yeah. I would say for a lot of travelers, I think there's a disconnect between wanting to be environmentally responsible and paying higher airfare. I would just point to look at the demise of passenger carbon offsetting programs at airlines. Airlines said, ""Oh, we're going to move our focus to staff and other investments,"" but the reality is there's little uptake from the passenger side in those programs. I don't think you can pass a lot of the cost increase on to passengers.

Karen Walker:

No, I agree. The point, is it one airline's got to be the brave one to make the move, and they'll back off if all the others don't raise their fares, I think. Aaron, your thoughts?

Aaron Karp:

Well, one thing I would mention is that if we get to a point where it looks like the airlines are not going to meet their targets, you could see governments and I think you very well may see governments saying, ""We're going to reduce the number of operations that are allowed."" If that creates more scarcity, that would increase airfares in and of itself. Not being able to hit sustainability targets, especially I would think in Europe, where there's so much focus on this ... and we've already seen airports like Schiphol trying to limit flights ... if, because the airlines aren't meeting their targets, the governments mandate fewer flights, then fewer flights means higher fares. I think that there may be no way to avoid the sustainability issue.

I think in terms of airline investment, to get to a really, really efficient air traffic control system, as I said, will require equipment on planes that would be sending a lot of data to air traffic control centers. Airlines could pivot to saying, ""Well, we're going to invest money in the equipment to make the air traffic control system better, if investing in SAF is not something that is going to meet the demands."" I think it may not be so simple if governments get involved and say, ""Well, we're going to reduce the flights,"" because reducing flights by definition will raise fares.

Karen Walker:

Alan, maybe a quick last word from a European perspective?

Alan Dron:

Yeah, I'm very much with the lottery on this one. I mean, every survey that is done with passengers comes out with pretty much the same result, namely about 90% of people say, ""Oh, yes, yes, we want cleaner flights,"" and, ""Are you prepared to pay for them,"" and it goes down to maybe 5%. The number of people who actually stump up for, as you say, the offsetting schemes, is even lower. Yeah. Frankly, no. The public may want clean skies but not be prepared to pay for them, sadly.

Karen Walker:

Yeah, I think you're right. The Europeans are so used now to their ultra low-cost carriers and the really almost ridiculously cheap flights, but it gets them to where they want for their vacations, as you say, and I don't see them wanting to add a lot of cost to that to make it so-called sustainable.

British chemicals manufacturer Johnson Matthey (JM) has agreed to sell its net zero aviation fuel business for £1.8bn amid weak global demand and pressure from activist shareholders.

On Thursday, the FTSE 250 company said it would sell its catalyst technologies division to American rival Honeywell, the sprawling industrial conglomerate.

The offloaded division includes the company’s interests in biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and bioethanol, as well as “blue” hydrogen which is produced using natural gas.

SAF has been touted by the aviation industry as the best way to reduce global carbon emissions from flying, but last year demand was just two thirds of what had been predicted.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has blamed lacklustre demand for SAF, which is more expensive than traditional jet fuel, on “mixed signals” about its adoption coming from governments around the world.

The expected growth of the market for SAF was used by Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

“A lot has changed in aviation, and sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand,” she said in January.

The sale comes as Liam Condon, the Johnson Matthey chief executive, faces pressure from the company’s biggest backer, Standard Industries, to rapidly turn around the business. It follows accusations that he and the rest of the board have “destroyed shareholder value” through poor investments.

Demand for SAF has proved disappointing, according to airlines, with the IATA saying that just 1m tonnes was produced last year compared to forecasts of 1.5m tonnes.

Mr Condon said: “We will now fundamentally reshape Johnson Matthey into a more focused and leaner business.”

He added: “JM is a great company and we are confident that the actions we have announced today will deliver substantial and sustainable value to our shareholders.”

Airlines claim they are keen to adopt the greener SAF but have been reluctant to pass the costs on to customers through air fares, instead arguing for governments to subsidise production to make the product cheaper.

Johnson Matthey said the sale would deliver a large cash boost while leaving the main business more “streamlined”.

The company is holding on to its “clean air” business, which primarily makes catalytic converters, as well as a platinum metals group division that is working on technologies related to “green” hydrogen including electrolysers and fuel cells.

Johnson Matthey’s talks with Honeywell about a potential deal for its catalytic technologies division are understood to have taken place on and off since before Standard joined the shareholder register in 2022, though the deal will still be seen as a defensive measure.

It came as the company reported an 11pc drop in sales and virtually flat profits, at £263m for the year to March 31. Johnson Matthey blamed “challenging” global conditions, including cuts to production by car makers that use its catalytic converters.

It also warned of a “slowdown in the energy transition” which had hit demand for green hydrogen technologies.

In the long-term, the company is betting that demand will continue for catalytic converters, primarily from larger vehicles that are difficult to decarbonise, even as governments encourage consumers to switch to electric cars.

On Thursday, it said that the internal combustion engine’s lifespan also looked longer than previously thought, due to slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles and government policies that will continue to allow some hybrids to be sold.

The company added: “Over the past three years, we have seen a global slowdown in battery electric vehicle penetration and the regulatory environment has also supported internal combustion engine longevity.”

Along with cars, the company said it also saw opportunities in the rapidly growing data centre market, as demand surges for back-up generators which also use catalytic converters, as well as direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

Its platinum-based metals business, which refines key materials used in converters, is meanwhile hoping to tap into growing demand for metals recycling and future demand for hydrogen.

The division also refines metals for the pharmaceutical, defence and agricultural industries.

Today, RMI released Version 2.0 of its Green Upgrade Calculator – a free, advanced tool that enables home contractors, residential energy program implementers, and policy advisors to more accurately estimate the cost, energy, and environmental benefits of clean residential technologies. This includes any combination of upgrades such as rooftop solar, battery storage, air- and ground-source heat pumps, weatherization, heat pump water heaters, induction cooktops, and electric vehicles.

Since Version 1.0’s release one year ago, more than 10,000 individuals have used the Green Upgrade Calculator, and multiple home upgrade programs and HVAC software sales companies are integrating the calculator’s API to deliver custom results within their own platforms.

Improvements in Version 2.0

Version 2.0 builds upon these successes with three key improvements that make the tool even more useful:

Geothermal heat pumps are now an upgrade option

Results include a new energy use impact section

Results are more accurate with further refinement options

New upgrade option: Geothermal heat pumps

Geothermal (i.e., ground-source) (GSHPs) are around 400% to 500% more efficient than gas heating and roughly 50% to 100% more efficient than air-source heat pumps (ASHPs). As a result, they can significantly reduce both energy bills and carbon pollution.

A common question GSHP contractors or incentive programs receive from homeowners is: Will these bill savings pay back, and are ground-source heat pumps more cost-effective than air-source heat pumps?

With GSHPs now included in the calculator, contractors and program administrators can answer that question more confidently. For example, RMI used the calculator to model a home in Ithaca, New York, and found that GSHPs were the least-cost HVAC upgrade, around $10,000 less than a central AC and gas furnace — owing in good part to the large New York State GSHP incentives. These results will vary significantly across New York and the United States — in nearby Maryland, the same home would see the lowest costs by upgrading to an ASHP — so we recommend using the calculator to assess the best option for each specific home.

New result section: Energy impacts and usage estimates

In addition to cost and carbon pollution, Version 2.0 now includes an estimate of a home’s annual energy consumption by end use. This can be especially helpful for companies pairing rooftop solar with electrification upgrades, or for programs reporting energy savings in evaluation metrics.

For example, if the home above was curious about pairing rooftop solar with a GSHP, a contractor could use the calculator to estimate the annual electricity usage for the home after installing a GSHP (around 11,700 kWh per year). With that insight, they could recommend the most cost-effective rooftop solar system (around 8.5 kW) sized to offset most of the home’s annual electricity usage.

Even more accurate results with further refinement ability

Estimating the cost or carbon impact of a home upgrade often comes with the answer: “It depends.” And it truly does — on a wide range of factors. That’s why Version 2.0 of the Green Upgrade Calculator builds on Version 1.0’s 100+ optional inputs with even more ways to tailor results to specific homes and systems.

New features allow users to refine hybrid heat pump configurations to minimize costs and specify HVAC refrigerants and leakage rates to see carbon pollution impact.

For example, if the home above was interested in a hybrid heat pump, a contractor could now compare the operating costs of using a new air handler (around $1,450) versus leaving the furnace in place (around $1,600) with a 20 degrees F switchover temperature. They could also now quantify the environmental benefits of switching from R410a to R32 refrigerant in the heat pump (around 0.3 fewer tons of CO2e per year — equivalent to avoiding the consumption of over half a barrel of oil).

Lastly, with leveraging the newest data updated across all inputs in Version 2.0, users can trust the tool’s results to reflect today’s market and assess how effectively the selected upgrades can address rising energy costs.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/house-render-no-text-resized.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 11:57:33.997106

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said: “Microsoft is pleased to build on our relationship with Exomad Green and Carbonfuture to deliver high-quality, high-impact, and high-integrity durable CDR through biochar.","Carbon removal provider Exomad Green announced a new deal with Microsoft, with the tech giant agreeing to purchase at least 1.24 million tonnes of carbon removal credits over ten years, generated from Exomad Green’s biochar projects in Bolivia.

The transaction marks the largest-ever biochar carbon removal purchase agreement globally, and one of the largest durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) agreements of any type to date, according to Exomad Green.

The agreement also integrates digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) from CDR data solutions provider Carbonfuture to track and verify the carbon removed under the deal. The transaction follows an earlier 32,000 tonne carbon removal agreement between Microsoft, Exomad Green and Carbonfuture announced in 2023.

According to Exomad Green, the large-scale deal signals the industrial-scale readiness of biochar as a carbon removal solution, and will support the company’s goal of sequestering one million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2027.

Diego Justiniano, CEO of Exomad Green, said:

“Today’s historic deal is testament to the relationship we have formed between Microsoft and Exomad Green, powered by Carbonfuture’s dMRV. Microsoft has shown true climate leadership and commitment by seizing the immediate potential of biochar as a carbon removal solution that is measurable and scalable, while demonstrating significant co-benefits across communities and in improving soil quality.”

Biochar, or biological charcoal, is produced by heating biomass, such as forest residue, wood or crop waste, in the absence of oxygen, creating a stable form of carbon, which when buried in soil enables centuries-long carbon sequestration, in addition to leading to improved soil fertility. Biochar is emerging as an increasingly popular solution for carbon removal, providing a series of benefits and favorable attributes, including the ability to lock carbon for hundreds of years, scalability, with an abundance of biomass available, and low cost relative to other CDR technologies, as well as its agricultural benefits.

Exomad Green currently operates two biochar facilities in Bolivia, which were recently expanded to double capacity, and the company is constructing a third facility, with an additional two sites now in the planning stages. The company’s approach transforms waste biomass from sustainably sourced forestry residues into biochar, which is then delivered to local communities to use in agricultural soil improvement programs.

Carbonfuture’s dMRV system, Carbonfuture MRV+, will be used to ensure that every tonne of carbon removed under the new agreement is tracked across the lifecycle from carbon capture to credit issuance, for verification under the Biochar Methodology set by carbon-crediting platform Puro.earth. Additionally, the companies said that the agreement also includes key features to trace the origin of all biomass to uphold sourcing and traceability sustainability requirements, and product quality assurance, including regular quality testing ensures that the biochar consistently meets international standards for carbon sequestration and soil enhancement.

Hannes Junginger-Gestrich, CEO of Carbonfuture, said:

“This agreement sets a new precedent for how quality is built into carbon removal from day one. By embedding dMRV into the contract, this deal delivers the transparency and traceability the market needs as it scales toward megatonnes of impact.”

The new agreement further solidifies Microsoft’s already substantial lead as the largest corporate buyer of carbon removal credits globally, with carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) platform CDR.fyi estimating Microsoft’s purchases to date at more than 21.6 million tons, well ahead of the Frontier buyers group in second place at 1.25 million tons. The transaction also places Exomad Green in the top 5 CDR suppliers, according to CDR.fyi.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said:

“Microsoft is pleased to build on our relationship with Exomad Green and Carbonfuture to deliver high-quality, high-impact, and high-integrity durable CDR through biochar. We value Exomad Green’s commitment to high standards for biomass sustainability and traceability through its establishment of a new Forest Monitoring Center and recognize biochar’s significant co-benefits for community and soil quality in addition to its carbon removal potential.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Microsoft3-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 11:57:42.482982

Supporting broader EU automotive workforce goals This initiative directly supports the European Union’s Automotive Action Plan and Union of Skills, launched in early 2025.","As Europe races toward a zero-emission future, its automotive industry stands at a crossroads – facing not only technological transformation but a critical shortage of skilled workers.

In a bold move to future-proof the sector, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) and global talent leader the Adecco Group have launched a landmark partnership aimed at bridging the automotive skills gap.

This initiative marks a decisive step toward building a resilient, future-ready workforce capable of powering the industry through its green and digital evolution.

Denis Machuel, CEO of The Adecco Group, explained: “With around 13 million people employed across the European automotive value chain, it is essential to equip its workforce for success.

“Our collaboration with ACEA seeks to address the skills transformation necessary for sustaining competitive advantages in this rapidly evolving market.”

Preparing for a zero-emission future

The shift toward zero-emission mobility is reshaping the automotive landscape. Electric vehicles (EVs), connected car technologies, and AI-driven manufacturing require an entirely new skill set.

As combustion engines give way to electric drivetrains and digital systems become standard, the sector must urgently invest in upskilling its workforce.

Without significant training reforms, Europe risks facing a shortage of workers equipped to support this technological revolution.

This transformation demands not only engineers and technicians familiar with battery systems and power electronics but also digital experts capable of managing automation, cybersecurity, and data analysis.

Strategic collaboration for a skilled future

Recognising these challenges, the ACEA and the Adecco Group have unveiled a strategic partnership to address current and emerging skills shortages.

Central to this collaboration is the EU Automotive Skills Gap Analysis, a detailed study set for release in mid-2025.

This analysis will identify existing workforce capabilities, anticipate future demands, and reveal where the most significant gaps lie.

Regional action plans to drive local change

Building on the insights from the skills gap study, the initiative will establish a High-Level Regional Fora.

These region-specific groups will design targeted strategies to address local workforce needs, bringing together stakeholders from government, industry, and education to ensure alignment and impact.

This decentralised approach ensures that training programmes and employment pathways are tailored to the specific needs of each region.

,,2025-05-22 09:16:49+00:00,ICIS Explore,ChemOne to incorporate bionaphtha as feedstock at upcoming PEC - exec - ICIS,Nurluqman Suratman,,,,,https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2025/05/22/11103487/chemone-to-incorporate-bionaphtha-as-feedstock-at-upcoming-pec-exec,"SINGAPORE (ICIS)– ChemOne Group is planning to incorporate bionaphtha as a feedstock for its upcoming $5.3 billion Pengerang Energy Complex (PEC) in Johor, Malaysia, a senior company executive said.
Bionaphtha thus presents itself as a renewable alternative to fossil-based naphtha,” Rahman said.
Other innovations like mild hydrocracking configurations that allow for targeted production of bionaphtha fractions can also enhance the overall efficiency of bionaphtha production, he said.
More importantly, however, advancements that allow for better hydrogen recovery are particularly crucial in enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of bionaphtha production.
“This also enhances the efficiency of downstream SAF/bionaphtha production and thereby improves production economics, both of which enhance the supply and cost appeal to facilitate further scaling of bionaphtha production.”","SINGAPORE (ICIS)– ChemOne Group is planning to incorporate bionaphtha as a feedstock for its upcoming $5.3 billion Pengerang Energy Complex (PEC) in Johor, Malaysia, a senior company executive said.

The PEC is expected to process 150,000 barrels/day of condensate plus a side feed of naphtha, that will in turn produce 2.5 million tonnes/year of aromatics, 3.8 million tonnes/year of energy products output, and hydrogen output of 26,000 tonnes/year, according to Mobin Rahman, ChemOne Group’s Vice President for Technology.

Construction of the PEC project is expected to start by mid-2025 after its operator secured an agreement for $3.5 billion of financing, with the start-up of the complex expected in Q4 2028.

The hydrogen produced will be used to support the production of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), which in turn can be processed into sustainable bionaphtha, according to Rahman.

“The incorporation of bionaphtha as a feedstock in PEC will then advance ChemOne’s work in creating a sustainable, circular petrochemical chain,” he said.

Bionaphtha, a byproduct of HVO and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, is increasingly used in Asia’s petrochemical industry for sustainable plastics, packaging, and fuel blending.

“The petrochemical industry globally is heavily reliant on fossil-based naphtha as a feedstock in steam crackers to produce olefins. Bionaphtha thus presents itself as a renewable alternative to fossil-based naphtha,” Rahman said.

“This signals the potential for greater integration of bionaphtha into the petrochemical industry as its technology matures and supply increases,” Rahman noted.

However, its relatively higher cost as compared to conventional fossil-based naphtha makes its adoption limited.

Moreover, converting bionaphtha to paraxylene (PX) through catalytic reforming is challenging primarily due to the feedstock’s composition and the inherent limitations of the process.

Bionaphtha, derived from bio-crude oils, often contains a high proportion of normal paraffins and other non-aromatic components, which are difficult for catalytic reforming to convert into aromatics.

BIONAPHTHA USE IN ASIA INCREASING

Major petrochemical companies in Asia are incorporating bionaphtha in their steam crackers as a drop-in feedstock in place of fossil-based naphtha, or in a mix with fossil-based material to produce partially renewable chemicals.

“As a region that consumes the most plastics globally, the demand for plastics remains constantly high,” Rahman said.

“When coupled with the increasing eco-conscious preferences among consumers, we see a resulting heightened demand for bioplastics. This has, as such, been a significant driver in the region’s demand for bionaphtha as a feedstock for its production.”

In line with the global green transition, multiple countries in Asia have also enacted fuel blending mandates.

Singapore, for example, has set a 1% SAF blending mandate from 2026 onwards.

Given the current mandate by countries to ensure that SAF is blended with jet fuel, the production of SAF, and consequently the use and production of bionaphtha, is set to rise, Rahman said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute to a 65% reduction in emissions, much needed by the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Just like fossil-based naphtha, bionaphtha can also be used as a gasoline blending component – offering a more sustainable fuel blend to help countries and companies achieve their decarbonization goals, according to Rahman.

While carbon capture & storage (CCS) and green hydrogen also offer valuable decarbonization strategies, bionaphtha provides a relatively easier and expected to be more readily available pathway.

“Looking ahead, the global momentum towards sustainability will likely continue to see an increasing demand for bionaphtha in petrochemical production processes.”

BIOPLASTICS USE GROWING

One of the most promising downstream applications for bionaphtha lies in bioplastics, Rahman noted, including polyethylene furanoate (PEF), bio-polyethylene (bio-PE) and bio-propylene (bio-PP).

PEF is a fully bio-based alternative to PET, while bio-PE and bio-PP are drop-in biopolymers with varying levels of bio-content, with bio-PP currently achieving up to 40% through the bio-mass balance process.

In South Korea and Japan, leading beauty brands are already incorporating bio-naphtha into packaging and product development, setting a precedent for other industries to follow, Rahman noted.

Companies like Japanese producer Nippon Shokubai and Indonesia’s Chandra Asri are exploring the use of bionaphtha in super absorbent polymer production (SAP), utilizing mass balance processes and independent certification bodies to ensure transparency and sustainability.

South Korea’s LG Chem has also been manufacturing eco-friendly plastic products using bio-naphtha since 2020.

LG Chem since 2021 has been shipping its bio-balanced SAP products – also certified with ISCC Plus – to overseas markets.

ISCC PLUS is an international certification system that verifies the sustainability of bio-based and bio-circular raw materials throughout the supply chain.

Separately, Mitsubishi Chemical has partnered with Japanese beverage company Suntory and apparel manufacturer Goldwin to use sustainable plastics for their end-products.

The conglomerate also locked in partnerships with providers of the key bioplastics ingredient bionaphtha. It announced a strategic partnership with Finnish company Neste for the bioplastics supply chain.

SUSTAINABILITY MANDATES TO PLAY KEY ROLE

Regulatory frameworks and sustainability mandates play a significant role in accelerating the adoption of bionaphtha, Rahman said.

“Policies surrounding the reduction of plastic waste – like Japan’s Plastic Resource Circulation Act for example – can incentivise manufacturers to adopt more sustainable production materials, while also encouraging retailers and consumers to opt for biobased plastics as an alternative to single-use plastics.”

“In addition to that six other Asian governments – Philippines, China, South Korea, India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia – are regulating plastic waste, thereby building a potential market for biobased alternatives.”

Other regulatory frameworks surrounding the general reduction of carbon emissions also help drive the adoption of bionaphtha in the petrochemical sector, as companies seek to harness potential financial incentives and avoid regulatory penalties, Rahman noted.

“Take for example carbon taxes implemented in countries like Singapore, with carbon tax rates that will increase at least thrice within the decade to reach $80 per tonne of GHG [greenhouse gas] by 2030,” he noted.

“Companies looking to comply with such regulatory requirements, or to be eligible for carbon credits and offsets, may turn towards bionaphtha to help reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain.”

South Korea’s emission trading scheme also specifically rewards companies that integrate renewable feedstocks into their petrochemical production, providing a financial incentive for the adoption of bionaphtha in the industry, Rahman added.

BIONAPHTHA MARKET SET FOR RAPID GROWTH

The market size for bionaphtha continues to expand at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% and is projected to reach more than 3 million tonnes by 2032, according to Rahman.

The expansion is due to increased environmental awareness, policies that encourage the use of sustainable energy, and improvements in production technology, he said.

“Currently, about 15% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production results in bio-naphtha as a byproduct. If demand continues to rise, this ratio can be increased to 40%, but the industry must also grapple with the limited availability of bio-based raw materials such as waste cooking oil.”

“To ensure long-term viability, diversification of feedstock sources and the development of alternative production methods are imperative.”

COST COMPETITIVENESS REMAINS AN ISSUE

The key challenge for bionaphtha revolves around cost competitiveness, and this is especially pertinent for Asian petrochemical producers who operate on thinner margins compared to their Middle East and US counterparts who benefit from cheaper feedstocks, according to Rahman.

“Investing in low-carbon technologies is difficult for Asian producers if it further erodes their profit margins,” he said.

“Besides, in terms of feedstock, while bio-based alternatives such as bionaphtha are available, many petrochemical complexes still rely on fossil-based naphtha.”

“This is due to the comparatively higher prices of its alternatives, limited supplies depending on international supply chains, as well as potentially incompatible infrastructure where retrofitting is too costly.”

Steam cracking operates at temperatures above 800°C and consumes large amounts of energy.

This is mostly powered by fossil fuels, as its alternative – the electrification of steam crackers, requires high-capacity renewable energy that is not cost-competitive in Asia at the moment.

“Even if high-capacity renewable energy becomes more accessible, the electrification of steam crackers requires a complete redesign or a retrofit that would incur very high costs. As such, decarbonizing these steam crackers poses significant technical and economic hurdles for businesses,” Rahman said.

TECHNOLOGY TO THE RESCUE

Technological advancements – like the introduction of new hydrotreating catalysts, help to improve conversion efficiency and reduce coke formation, according to Rahman.

Other innovations like mild hydrocracking configurations that allow for targeted production of bionaphtha fractions can also enhance the overall efficiency of bionaphtha production, he said.

More importantly, however, advancements that allow for better hydrogen recovery are particularly crucial in enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of bionaphtha production.

“Especially in complexes like ChemOne Group’s PEC, where hydrogen is produced as a by-product and used in the downstream production of hydrogenated vegetable oils, embedding strong hydrogen recovery systems can help improve yield efficiency and reduce costs. This in turn better primes its production for scalability,” he said.

“In addition, at ChemOne Group’s Pengerang Energy Complex, engineering-driven improvements in its LD-PAREX technology have yielded an almost 10% increase in conversion percentage from its Condensate Feedstocks to its higher value aromatics products,” Rahman said.

“This also enhances the efficiency of downstream SAF/bionaphtha production and thereby improves production economics, both of which enhance the supply and cost appeal to facilitate further scaling of bionaphtha production.”",https://www.icis.com/explore/wp-content/themes/icis-2020/assets/images/social-share-image.png,N,,2025-05-22 11:57:56.773194

Two major players advancing SAF adoption from an energy standpoint are Neste, the global leader in renewable diesel and SAF production, and FedEx, the world’s largest express cargo airline.

The companies have entered a landmark agreement to supply 8,800 tonnes of blended SAF to FedEx at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), marking the largest SAF purchase by a US cargo airline at the airport to date.

Energy collaboration for SAF uptake

The agreement centres around Neste’s blended SAF, which will include at least 30% neat Neste ‘MY SAF’.

As a “drop-in” fuel, neat SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used seamlessly within existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure.

This fuel is expected to comprise about 20% of FedEx’s total jet fuel consumption at LAX for FY25.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and Chief Executive Officer, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Neste's ‘MY SAF’ can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuels.

It is made entirely from renewable waste and residue materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, making it a viable long-term energy alternative.

FedEx’s broader energy strategy

FedEx has long invested in SAF as part of a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy.

Beyond Neste, it has collaborated with Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator programme, which achieved the first commercial aircraft flight powered by 100% SAF in both engines in 2018.

Additional efforts to reduce aviation fuel consumption include fleet modernisation, operational efficiency improvements and advanced flight planning.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years,” comments Karen Blanks Ellis Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally... we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

These strategies helped FedEx reach a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity by FY24, from a 2005 baseline.

U.S. industrials conglomerate Honeywell International said it agreed to buy Johnson Matthey's catalysts unit for 1.8 billion pounds ($2.42 billion), lifting shares in the British platinum refiner.

The sale of the unit, which designs and produces catalysts for the chemicals and energy industries, is expected to deliver net sale proceeds of about 1.6 billion pounds to Johnson Matthey, the U.K. company said.

Honeywell said it expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first year.

The combination of Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business with Honeywell's Energy and Sustainability Solutions unit will boost the group's growth and create cost synergies, the U.S. group said.

The two businesses complement each other, Honeywell said, adding that it will for the first time be able to offer solutions for the production of lower emission fuels such as sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, blue hydrogen and blue ammonia.

Following the transaction, Johnson Matthey will focus on its Clean Air business and the processing of platinum group metals, the London-listed group added.

Shares in the U.K. chemicals company rose 33% in early morning trade Thursday on the back of the announcement. The stock is up 36% year to date, trading at 18.27 pounds.

The disposal comes after Johnson Matthey came under pressure from its biggest shareholder, the U.S.-based conglomerate Standard Industries, which said that Johnson Matthey's board destroyed shareholder value.

In an open letter sent in January, Standard Industries highlighted what it called the ""continued lack of urgency and incapacity of the current Board to do what is necessary to turn Johnson Matthey around and help it to realize its potential.""

The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions of U.K. assets by U.S. companies, including DoorDash's purchase of U.K. food delivery company Deliveroo.

Meanwhile, Johnson Matthey posted revenue of 11.67 billion pounds for the year ended March 31, down 9% on year.

Its operating profit grew to 538 million pounds from 249 million pounds, while pretax profit rose to 486 million pounds from 164 million pounds.

Analysts had expected revenue of 12.08 billion pounds, pretax profit of 733.3 million pounds, and operating profit of 793.4 million pounds, according to company-compiled consensus estimates.

The board proposed a final dividend of 55 pence a share.

Airbus said it will continue to strengthen cooperation with Chinese suppliers to promote the use of SAF to contribute to the sustainable growth of the aviation industry.

""SAF, as the biggest contributor, helps with the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Compared to fossil jet fuel, it can reduce 80 percent of carbon emissions on average in the entire SAF life cycle,"" said Claire Kauffmann, head of SAF and carbon dioxide removal global ecosystem at Airbus.

Kauffmann said that China has great advantages in the production of SAF, given its rich resources of feedstock and rapid development of renewable energy. China's strong manufacturing capability, unified government policies and a stable business environment provide continuous impetus for the long-term development of the sector.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of Airbus' operations in the country. The aircraft manufacturer said it has always been committed to long-term and trustful partnerships with the Chinese aviation industry.

Besides SAF, Airbus has continued to expand its industrial footprint by investing in various activities. It is expanding the A320 aircraft's final assembly capacity in Tianjin with a second line, and the new facility is expected to be put into operation by early 2026.

As a global company with roots in Europe, Airbus said it advocates for fair and open trade, and win-win cooperation. China has been insisting on high-standard opening-up and improving its business environment, an effort that Airbus highly respects.

For the development of SAF, China has abundant types of raw material resources, including waste cooking oil, agricultural and forestry waste, and urban organic waste, providing a solid foundation for building a globally leading green aviation industry system. It is predicted that by 2030, the annual available raw materials for producing SAF in China will support a potential production capacity of up to 12 million metric tons.

China, the European Union and the United States have all introduced policies to encourage the use of SAF.

In the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), the Civil Aviation Administration of China proposed that the cumulative consumption volume of SAF in China should reach 50,000 tons over the period, and the annual consumption volume of SAF in 2025 should exceed 20,000 tons.",,N,,2025-05-22 04:57:45.340190

This allows airlines to purchase and claim the environmental benefits of SAF without physically transporting and storing the fuel, reducing the logistics costs and avoiding the additional unnecessary carbon emissions.

Book and Claim represents a significant opportunity for Australia, which has natural advantages for SAF production, including abundant feedstock resources. With this system, Australia could become an exporter of environmental benefits to regions where SAF production is limited or unavailable, creating economic opportunities by aggregating demand from both domestic and international markets, while supporting global aviation decarbonisation.

Australia’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting system allows airlines to recognise emissions reductions from direct combustion of SAF, but lacks mechanisms to account for SAF that Australian airlines purchase that is used outside the country.

Comments from Virgin Australia General Manager Sustainability Fiona Walmsley:

“In partnership with Boeing and the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network, we’re thrilled to bring together industry and academic leaders to present and explore the latest research supporting aviation’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050,” Ms Walmsley said.

“SAF is the most critical decarbonisation lever for the aviation sector to reach net zero emissions, but production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel must accelerate significantly for the global aviation sector to achieve this goal.”

“This report outlines how a Book and Claim system would allow Australian airlines to contribute to aviation decarbonisation even before domestic SAF production commences. By enabling airlines to purchase SAF benefits regardless of location, we can accelerate industry-wide adoption and ultimately drive down costs.”

""Enabling a Book and Claim system helps to avoid logistics costs and unfavourable environmental outcomes that occur from having to move fuel from where it is produced to where a customer is based.”

Comments from Boeing Sustainability Lead Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific, Dr Kimberly Camrass:

“Book and Claim is critical to scaling SAF uptake globally. It eliminates geographical barriers, allowing airlines to access the environmental benefits of SAF even when they operate in regions where production is not possible or not yet established. This creates a truly global market for SAF, which is essential for meeting the commercial aviation industry’s net zero targets,” Dr Camrass said.

“Ensuring collective action by governments and industry is underpinned by world-leading research, such as that occurring through the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network, is vital.”

The report was commissioned by Virgin Australia with the support of Boeing. It is available here on the Virgin Australia website.

Good vibrations

This NBA season, blind and low-vision basketball fans have been able to follow the action from their arena seats using a handheld device that describes the game through vibrations. Seattle-based start-up OneCourt was founded in 2021 and its haptic device debuted with the Portland Trail Blazers in January. The technology uses wi-fi and 5G to transmit data from arena sensors and cameras; coupled with a live broadcast, fans who can’t see the game can follow the action as the device signals, for example, where a three-point shot was taken.

The early-stage start-up has raised $475,000 (€420,000) from angel investors, including Microsoft’s ceo, Satya Nadella, and five NBA teams have signed up for the service. OneCourt has also engineered versions for baseball and football, which could be used during the Fifa Club World Cup that kicks off on 14 June. Co-founder Jerred Mace and his team currently make the OneCourt device in-house but he hopes to produce it at scale for an underserved market of sports fans who will be able to use it at home too. “We want to have a product that doesn’t just live in the stadium,” he says.

Out for a spin

Private helicopter transfers tend to be functional affairs, with cramped cabins and the lingering scent of jet fuel. Helsinki Citycopter, a Finnish firm founded in 2020, does things differently: the five helicopters in its fleet, which includes two Airbus ACH130s and an H125, have spacious interiors with leather seats, noise-cancelling headsets and efficient climate control. Powered by sustainable aviation fuel and modern low-emission engines, the aircraft also leave a smaller environmental footprint than many of their competitors. “There’s a unique advantage to helicopter travel,” says co-founder Joonas Nurmi, who spent 15 years with Finnair. “You get perspectives that you don’t see from a plane or car and you can land almost anywhere.”

Now the market leader in northern Europe, the company has steadily expanded, adding a Cessna Citation CJ4 private jet to its portfolio and launching a flight academy for helicopter and fixed-wing pilots. In addition to transfers, the firm enables travel to remote destinations, including Lapland, the Finnish archipelago and the Lofoten Islands. “Our product is nature,” says Nurmi. “And we fly where no one else does.”

Growth opportunity

When Donald Trump launched his first tariff broadsides at Canada’s economy in February, Canadian shopping habits shifted abruptly – away from American-made goods and towards more homegrown brands. That presents an opportunity for independent Canadian food companies. Among them is Lufa Farms, the innovative urban agriculture firm and marketplace for Québec-grown produce, which was co-founded in Montréal in 2009 by Lebanese engineer and entrepreneur Mohamed Hage and is currently expanding its reach across the country.

Inspired by the rooftop fruit-and-vegetable gardens that are a fixture of urban life in Hage’s home country, Lufa Farms operates as a network of rooftop hydroponic greenhouses on the flat roofs of industrial buildings, warehouses and big-box retail complexes in Montréal and across the broader region. The vegetables cultivated inside, which are watered by a system of rainwater- and ice-melt collection from the greenhouse roofs, are then picked and assorted into weekly grocery baskets.",https://monocle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/da9964de-08ef-434b-88f4-3e614f326fb9_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 20:57:06.473080

With global demand for eco-friendly jet fuel soaring, Ghana is positioning itself to become a regional hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, unlocking new investment, jobs, and a greener aviation future.

Accra, Ghana. Ghana is positioning itself to tap into the multi-million-dollar Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market as part of a collective global effort for aviation to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Stakeholders at the just-ended International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) workshop on the Assistance, Capacity Building and Training Programme for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF), held in Accra, Ghana and hosted by the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), committed to harnessing the potential in the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in Ghana.

Ghana and other African countries are yet to tap into this multi-billion-dollar industry despite the availability of raw materials for SAF production, such as cooking oil, plant oils, wood chips, treated straw, algae, municipal waste, waste gases, and agricultural residue.

For nearly two decades, Ghana has experimented with the production of plant-based sustainable fuels mainly from the Jatropha plant. The technology developed so far, has been only able to produce biodiesel for use by small-scale agro-processing machines.

The setting up of waste treatment plants in Accra and Kumasi by the Jospong Group of Companies holds a lot of promise for Ghana to venture into the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The raw materials—organic and inorganic waste—abound in a country struggling to contain and properly dispose or reuse the millions of tons of municipal waste across the country.

In Ghana, about 12,710 tons of solid waste is generated daily. The capital city, Accra, generates as much as 15,000 tons of solid waste per day. Research on the waste composition of Ghana’s solid waste in 2020 shows that it is predominantly organic (60%), plastic (14 %), paper (5%), metals (3%), and glass (3%).

Dignitaries in attendance underscored the national importance of the programme for the environment and the financial benefits of going into SAF production using locally available raw materials.

The dignitaries included: Hon. Joseph Nikpe Bukari, Minister for Transport; Hon. John Abdulai Jinapor, Minister for Energy; Hon. Dr. Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, Minister for Environment, Science and Technology; Hon. Eric Opoku, Minister for Food and Agriculture; and Hon. Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson, Minister for Finance.

They noted that the workshop aligns seamlessly with Ghana’s roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, demonstrating a strong link between national and global aviation sustainability goals.

A key focus of the discussions revolved around the ICAO’s extensive work on SAF, which began with the first international conference on aviation and alternative fuels in Rio de Janeiro in 2009. Initial efforts concentrated on demonstrating the safety of SAF as a viable alternative to conventional jet fuel. Subsequent conferences in 2017 and a pivotal ICAO Assembly resolution in 2020 further solidified the global commitment to long-term carbon emissions reduction in aviation.

The ACT-SAF program, a crucial facilitator of this roadmap, supports countries in adopting sustainable aviation practices. The workshop delved into ICAO’s four key “building blocks” for achieving this goal: policy and planning, regulatory framework, implementation support, and finance.

Ghana’s existing national decarbonization goals were cited as a fundamental element of the policy and planning block, with action plans already in place.

Industry estimates say that demand for CORSIA-eligible carbon credits will hit 101 to 148 million tonnes (MtCO₂e) during Phase I (2024–2026). Demand will rise quickly in Phase II (2027–2035).

Cumulative needs are expected to be between 502 and 1,299 MtCO₂e. This will depend on how much international air traffic grows and how CORSIA expands its coverage.

This big increase comes from the rebound in international air travel and the start of Phase II in 2027. During this phase, most ICAO member countries must take part.

By 2035, demand might exceed 1 billion tonnes in high-growth scenarios. That’s about the same as the yearly emissions of a major industrialized country.

To summarize projected cumulative demand:

Phase I (2024–2026): 101–148 MtCO₂e

Phase II (2027–2035): 502–1,299 MtCO₂e

This growth presents both challenges and opportunities. Airlines need enough credits to comply with regulations. At the same time, project developers and suppliers face pressure to increase the verified supply of eligible credits.

Price Outlook: A Wide Range with Upward Pressure

The report outlines three price scenarios for carbon credits based on different market dynamics:

Low Scenario: Prices start at $14/tonne in a tight supply scenario and grow slowly to $25/tonne in under supply scenario.

Medium Scenario: Prices rise from $15/tonne to $29/tonne.

High Scenario: Prices climb sharply from $16/tonne to $34/tonne.

Even in the conservative case, prices show modest growth. But in the high-demand scenario, prices could grow over the next decade.

On the other hand, MSCI outlines a range of price scenarios for CORSIA-eligible carbon credits as follows:

Phase I (2024–2026): $18–$51 per tonne

Phase II (2027–2035): $27–$91 per tonne (by 2033–2035)

This price rise shows that airlines face more pressure to secure high-quality credits. This is especially true as more projects focus on long-term removal instead of just temporary avoidance.

High prices might lead some airlines to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or insets. These options help reduce emissions in their operations.

Supply Gaps and Quality Filters

CORSIA doesn’t allow just any carbon credit. ICAO has strict rules for what qualifies — including restrictions on project start dates, crediting periods, and approved methodologies. Only credits from approved programs (like Verra, Gold Standard, and ART TREES) that meet these standards are eligible.

The report estimates that:

Only about 543 MtCO₂e of eligible credits will be issued by 2027.

Supply is projected to lag behind demand. Reports suggest possible deficits of 12–43 MtCO₂e in Phase I. Phase II may face even larger shortfalls. This is likely if stricter quality filters are used. These filters include co-benefits, permanence, and additionality. The exact numbers for filtered supply aren’t given, but these criteria would greatly lower the usable pool.

Currently, most eligible supply comes from avoided deforestation (REDD+) and renewable energy projects. As demand increases and quality standards get stricter, the market will likely move toward lasting carbon removal solutions. This includes methods like reforestation, biochar, and direct air capture (DAC).

Regional Insights: Where Supply Comes From

The current credit supply under CORSIA is heavily concentrated in a few countries:

India, China, and Brazil together account for over 50% of the available supply.

Africa has fewer CORSIA-eligible credits now. However, it is expected to grow. This growth will focus on nature-based solutions, such as afforestation and cookstove projects.

This geographic concentration means that any changes in policy, political stability, or project approvals in key countries could disrupt supply. For example, if India were to change its rules on carbon credit exports — as some officials have suggested — global supply could shrink quickly.

Interest is growing in boosting credit generation in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Many areas there have good land for reforestation and carbon farming.

Market Trends and Implications for Airlines

CORSIA credits are part of the larger voluntary carbon market. This market has attracted a lot of interest from companies and governments. According to MSCI report, voluntary carbon markets could reach $250 billion annually by 2050.

But today’s CORSIA credits are selling for far less than the cost of removing CO₂ using high-tech methods like DAC, which can exceed $300 per tonne. This price gap has raised questions about credit quality and how buyers can demonstrate real climate impact.

Some key trends include:

Airlines such as Delta, United, and Lufthansa are now mixing credit purchases with investments in SAF. They also support offsets from reforestation or engineered removals.

Programs like SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) encourage firms to reduce emissions. They also promote high-quality removals instead of bulk offsetting.

For airlines, this means they may need to:

Budget more for compliance over time

Diversify carbon offset portfolios

Communicate clearly about the credibility of their offsets

The Bigger Picture: What Comes Next

The Allied Offsets report shows that corporate buyers, like airlines, play a key role in global carbon markets. Their large, long-term offtake agreements — such as Microsoft’s 18 MtCO₂e deal with Rubicon Carbon — are shaping demand signals for the next decade.

ICAO plans to tighten CORSIA rules in future reviews. This may mean more removals and limits on older avoidance projects. This could further reduce supply and raise prices.

Policymakers can boost support for in-sector measures. This includes increasing SAF production and encouraging new removal technologies.

Airlines face challenges now. They must deal with rising prices, new rules, and increased scrutiny on carbon offsetting. In the long run, using durable carbon removals could change aviation and the climate finance system.

CORSIA is entering a critical phase. Demand is set to rise sharply. Meanwhile, supply is tightening due to stricter quality controls. As the report shows, the window to build a balanced, credible carbon market is narrowing. The next few years will shape the cost and credibility of airline decarbonization for decades to come.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2510038883.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 19:56:48.583718

Selling its Catalyst Technologies is expected to be welcomed by some shareholders who have argued that Johnson Matthey has been insufficiently focused on higher-growth businesses with more obvious potential to generate financial returns.

The London-listed company has been under siege from Standard Industries, the US-based conglomerate which is its biggest shareholder with a stake of over 10%.

Standard Industries wrote an open letter to Johnson Matthey's board in January, accusing it of destroying shareholder value.

It said the British company's directors were guilty of a ""continued lack of urgency and incapacity...to do what is necessary to turn Johnson Matthey around and help it to realise its potential"".

The Catalyst Technologies arm accounted for roughly a fifth of group sales in the half-year to the end of August, but about a third of group profit.

The global energy landscape is undergoing constant change as energy security and diversification shape the future of fuel.

Among the most promising avenues in this transition is the production of renewable fuels, which offer a viable alternative and supplement to traditional fossil fuels.

Hydrotreating is a ubiquitous technology present in every refinery in the world. It is commonplace for a refinery to have several different hydrotreating units, each designed and optimised to treat different fractions from the initial distillation of crude oil, including naphtha hydrotreaters, diesel hydrotreaters, and FCC pretreat units. The process conditions and catalyst systems are tailored to the specific requirements of the different feed streams while meeting the required specifications for each product stream.

At one level, adapting hydrotreating technology to process renewable feedstocks to produce hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFAs) represents one of the lowest-cost, easiest-to-implement options in the transition from fossil to renewable-based products.

However, the production of renewable fuels for both existing refiners and new producers is not without its challenges when it comes to the catalytic processes involved. The catalyst system must be designed to manage the specific characteristics of renewable feedstocks and produce high-quality fuels. This article explores the critical role of catalysts in renewable fuels production, the challenges associated with processing renewable feedstocks, and the innovative solutions that are driving the industry forwards.

Complexities of Renewable Feedstock Processing

Hydrotreating catalyst systems have evolved over the years such that most units today are loaded in layers of catalysts, each with different catalytic functions. The top layer comprises guard bed catalysts specifically designed to remove contaminants such as nickel and vanadium metals from fossil feed streams while minimising the build-up of pressure drop to ensure this function does not limit the operating cycle of the unit.

The next layers comprise catalyst developed for maximum hydrogenation efficiency to remove sulphur and, if needed, also saturate aromatics. The system may include catalysts to remove nitrogen if this is required (for example, for hydrocracking units). At the bottom of the hydrogenation unit is a catalyst layer designed to minimise sulphur recombination.

Renewable feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste oils, pose unique challenges compared to traditional fossil-based feedstocks. The complex reaction mechanisms involved in hydrotreating renewable materials differ significantly from those of conventional petroleum refining. If catalysts are not specifically designed to handle these complexities, the consequences can be severe: poor product yield, byproduct formation, accelerated catalyst deactivation, and pressure drop build-up.

Additionally, the hydrotreated product has to meet the required product specifications, namely ASTM D-975 for diesel and D-7566 for SAF, including the cold flow properties, which are critical for fuel performance in colder climates (diesel) or at altitude sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

To address these challenges, catalyst systems must be tailor-made for renewable feedstock processing. This involves developing catalysts that can effectively manage the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of renewable feeds, improve cold flow properties through isomerisation, and maintain stable operation under varying conditions.

To meet these complex requirements, Topsoe has developed specialised catalysts for these purposes, enabling the production of on-spec renewable diesel and SAF without operational issues.

Catalyst Innovations for Renewable Fuels

Central to this has been the introduction of a range of dedicated catalysts designed specifically for the hydroprocessing of renewable feedstocks. Recently launched to the market are third-generation Topsoe HDO catalysts selective for the hydrogenation route designated TK-3001, TK-3002, and TK-3003. These will provide producers with better HDO selectivity via the hydrogenation route, higher activity, and high metals, resulting in a significantly longer cycle length. The higher HDO selectivity throughout the cycle length of the catalyst will result in a significantly higher average product yield compared to the previous generation of HDO catalysts, which will increase the profitability of the plant.

The catalyst loading also includes an isomerising dewaxing catalyst to ensure that the renewable diesel and SAF meet the required cloud point and freeze point of the final product. The specialised guard beds catalysts are designed to pick up the contaminants in the feedstock, such as P, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ni, and V. The most significant poison is typically phosphorus (P). To address this, Topsoe has developed a more efficient P guard, TK-3000 PhosTrap, which picks up four to six times as much P on a volume basis as its previous P guard in renewable service.

Reduced Complexity and Lower Costs

In addition to picking up contaminants, the guard bed catalysts are designed to use the hydrogenation route like the main bed catalyst to ensure that the oxygen in the triglyceride is converted to water instead of CO₂. The hydrogenation route improves the product yield and will not make CO₂ as opposed to the decarboxylation route, which produced significant amounts of CO₂.

The fact that Topsoe’s specialised HDO main bed catalysts and guard bed catalysts produced almost no CO₂ is the reason why its licensed process technology called HydroFlex does not include an amine unit in the high-pressure loop. The elimination of the amine unit from the process layout has many advantages, such as reduced Capex and Opex, lower carbon intensity (CI score), and decreased operating complexity.

The effectiveness of these HDO and dewaxing catalysts has been demonstrated in more than 25 industrial units, and many of Topsoe-licensed units have used loads of its HDO and dewaxing catalysts.

Choosing the Right Catalyst for Co-Processing

Introducing even minor amounts of biomaterial into a fossil diesel or kerosene hydrotreater requires a thorough understanding of the implications and strategies to mitigate potential risks. Co-processing renewable and fossil feedstocks introduces additional complexities. The hydrotreater must still convert all organic sulphur and nitrogen in the fossil portion of the feed to meet product specifications, while the HDO catalysts must convert all of the renewable feed.

To achieve these multiple objectives, the HDO-graded bed catalysts are typically loaded on top of a NiMo fossil catalyst. The trick is to load the right amount of each type of catalyst so that the cycle length of the HDO catalyst matches that of the fossil NiMo catalyst while maintaining a stable pressure drop across all the catalysts. The ratio of the different types of catalysts is, of course, governed by the percentage of co-processing.

It is also important to determine if a dewaxing catalyst is needed in the bottom of the reactor (below the fossil catalyst) to ensure that the mixture of fossil and renewable diesel still meets the required cloud point. Topsoe is experienced in designing the loading of a co-processing unit to meet all product and cycle length objective and has more than 20 hydroprocessing units currently in operation in co-processing mode.

Conclusion

The production of renewable fuels represents a significant step forwards in the diversification of the global energy landscape. However, success depends on the development and deployment of advanced catalysts that can handle the unique challenges of renewable feedstock processing. Topsoe’s third-generation HDO catalyst, selective towards the hydrogenation route, and its specialised graded bed HDO catalysts are effective in both co-processing and standalone units.

The catalyst and process technology not only ensure the production of high-quality renewable fuels but also enhance the profitability of the unit by increasing the product yield and extending the cycle length, thus improving the onstream performance. The enhanced capacity for picking up contaminants, including phosphorus, helps the refiner process lower-quality renewable feedstocks to further enhance the profitability of the operation.

As the industry continues to evolve, the role of catalysts in enabling the energy future cannot be overstated.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/Catalysts%20for%20Renewable%20Fuels%20Production.png,N,,2025-05-21 17:56:46.739089
