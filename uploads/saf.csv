Holland Hydrogen 1

Holland Hydrogen 1 is taking concrete form. Shell is constructing Europe’s first major renewable hydrogen plant, with a capacity of 200 MW. Last year, Shell and TenneT signed a connection and transport agreement for the high-voltage grid, and the plant is now linked to it. A hydrogen pipeline, which will also be part of the national hydrogen network, connects the hydrogen plant to the port of Rotterdam.

ELYgator

Earlier this year, the French company Air Liquide announced its plans to develop, construct and operate a 200 MW electrolyser at the first conversion park on the Maasvlakte. This hydrogen plant, named ‘ELYgator’, produces low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy and is expected to be operational by the end of 2027. Air Liquide will harness power from the OranjeWind and Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) wind farms off the Dutch coast to produce hydrogen for the TotalEnergies refinery, among others.

Production and storage of sustainable aviation fuel

At the end of 2024, Power2X and Advario announced the joint development of a large-scale production and storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) with a capacity exceeding 250,000 tonnes of e-SAF per year. This facility will produce enough environmentally friendly fuel for approximately 7,000 flights between Amsterdam and New York each year, while the demand for hydrogen continues to rise.

Succesful ammonia bunkering

In April 2025, Trammo, OCI, and James Fisher Fendercare successfully conducted an ammonia bunkering pilot between two vessels in the port of Rotterdam. This represents an important step in preparing the port for the bunkering of green ammonia. During the pilot, 800 cubic metres of liquid ammonia at -33°C were transferred, validating the port’s safety framework. The first vessels capable of using ammonia as bunker fuel are expected in 2026 or 2027.

The first vessels capable of using ammonia as bunker fuel are expected in 2026 or 2027.

Porthos

Porthos is the first large-scale CO2 transport and storage project in the EU, comprising a 30 km land pipeline, a compressor station on the Maasvlakte, and an injection platform located 20 km offshore in the North Sea. Meanwhile, 80% of the land pipeline has been completed. With the arrival of the Valaris drilling platform, offshore work for the construction of the Porthos infrastructure has clearly begun. From here, CO2 is pumped to a depleted gas field, a sealed space of porous sandstone at a depth of over 3 km beneath the North Sea bed. An important step in the development of low-carbon hydrogen production in Rotterdam.

Offshore wind park Zeevonk II

The Zeevonk II project involves the development of a 2 GW offshore wind farm, a 50 MWp floating offshore solar farm, and an electrolyser with a capacity of up to 1 GW at the second conversion park on the Maasvlakte. It will make it possible to convert wind farm energy into green hydrogen. Zeevonk II is a joint venture of Vattenfall and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), which won the government tender for an offshore wind farm with integration systems. The wind farm is expected to be commissioned in 2029.

Green hydrogen from Brazil to Germany via Rotterdam

The ports of Pecém (in Ceará, Brazil), Rotterdam, and duisport (Germany) are collaborating to facilitate the transport of alternative fuels. CEO Port of Rotterdam Authority, Boudewijn Siemons: ‘We recognise Brazil’s potential as a supplier of green hydrogen. We are pleased to welcome duisport to this collaboration aimed at establishing an end-to-end supply chain for green hydrogen.’ In the short term, transport from Rotterdam is possible via inland shipping and will be facilitated by pipelines from 2032.

Fertiglobe

Fertiglobe has been awarded the tender for the first H2Global pilot auction for green ammonia. The product will be imported via the port of Rotterdam and sold by Hintco in standardised volumes through annual auctions. In this capacity, Hintco acts as a ‘market maker’, stimulating new markets for green hydrogen and low-emission fuels.

CO2next

The CO2next project for the temporary storage and handling of liquid CO2 at the Maasvlakte in Rotterdam is entering the FEED phase. Shell and TotalEnergies have partnered with Gasunie and Vopak in this collaboration. The terminal will be supplied with liquid CO2 by vessels and will be connected to empty North Sea gas fields via the Aramis pipeline. With an initial annual capacity of 5.4 million, it has the potential to grow to 15 million tonnes per year. The investment decision is scheduled for 2025. Commercial activities are anticipated to begin in 2028.

Ammonia terminal and cracker VTTI

VTTI aims to develop an ammonia terminal and cracker in both Rotterdam and Antwerp. The European Commission has designated the project as a Project of Common Interest and is providing an €11.6 million EU contribution for Rotterdam. Given the significant market interest in the open season, VTTI is now starting the Heads of Agreement Phase with interested parties to further advance the project.

Construction hydrogen network

The construction of the national hydrogen network commenced in 2023 in the port of Rotterdam. Hynetwork is rolling out the network in phases, with the first section in Rotterdam expected to become operational in 2026. By 2030, the infrastructure will be available in industrial clusters along the Dutch coast. Simultaneously, connections to Germany and Belgium will be established. Between 2031 and 2033, all industrial clusters will be fully interconnected. The west-east connection of the national hydrogen network (the hydrogen pipeline from the Delta Rhine Corridor) will also be completed by that time.

Delta Rhine Corridor

The government has decided to prioritise the development of hydrogen and CO2 infrastructure within the Delta Rhine Corridor (DRC). The hydrogen pipeline needs to be constructed quickly to get the hydrogen market going. This is significant news for companies contemplating investments in the production, storage or purchase of hydrogen. It is important not only for Rotterdam, but also for other industrial clusters in the Netherlands, Germany, and Northwest Europe. The hydrogen pipeline is projected to be completed between 2031 to 2032. The development of an ammonia pipeline between Rotterdam and Germany is no longer included in the DRC scope but will proceed as a standalone project.

Skyven’s proven Energy-as-a-Service model allows industrial manufacturers to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs without the upfront capital expenditure.

XTS Energy

XTS is currently developing a project using alcohol-to-jet technology (“ATJ”) to meet the growing demand for clean transport fuels by building, owning and operating the infrastructure to produce 30 million gallons per year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) and Renewable Diesel using ATJ technology with low carbon ethanol as a feedstock.

As SAF is critical to aviation’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050, XTS’s project will help bridge supply gaps while meeting carbon reduction targets in a market projected to demand 120 billion gallons of SAF per year. Strategically positioned to leverage U.S. economic incentives and comply with the strictest regulations in the EU, U.S., and Asia, XTS presents a compelling investment opportunity in clean fuel solutions for sustainable aviation and regulatory compliance.

Terragia Biofuel, Inc.

Terragia is developing innovative biotechnology to convert cellulosic biomass (the parts of plants that have evolved over time to be recalcitrant and hard to break down) into ethanol. Terragia’s novel approach, a combination of better biology and consolidated processing, unlocks that potential, providing a liquid fuel alternative that is not only more sustainable than fossil fuels but cost competitive as well. Integration of Terragia’s technology in corn ethanol plants will increase ethanol yields and enhance coproduct value while improving sustainability metrics.

Celluol

Waste biomass, such as agricultural residues, has unrealized potential to be a critical feedstock in the production of net-zero fuels and chemicals. Current solutions for the conversion of these residues have faced technical challenges due to the difficulty and cost in the crucial step of degrading this biomass into utilizable free sugars. Celluol has engineered a bacterium that can directly degrade and ferment waste biomass into ethanol using a one-step process similar to how we make beer or wine.

This breakthrough directly addresses the challenges encountered by current cellulosic conversion technologies, simplifying the process and making it significantly less expensive.

Celluol’s simpler and cheaper process can be rapidly deployed, starting by co-locating at first-generation ethanol plants that currently use corn or sugarcane and have abundant biomass wastes. By further capturing and converting the CO2 produced during the fermentation process into ethanol, Celluol’s technology has the potential to decrease the amount of land required for sustainable biofuel production by up to three times.

https://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/aircraft-propulsion/viewpoint-how-saf-makes-bizav-green-affordable

Climate change is a topic of much debate by governments and industry alike. Views are largely split along political lines in the U.S. Under the current administration, regulations to slow global warming are being supplanted. Nonetheless, many companies across virtually all industries, from airline operators to global service corporations, remain committed to reducing their carbon footprint.

Companies with direct means of production, such as factories, generally have multiple options to reduce their carbon footprint. But what of consulting firms, banks, and technology companies whose carbon footprint isn’t directly tied to their everyday activities? How are emissions generated by these types of corporations and how can they reduce their emissions?

The primary source of emissions for “corporates” is business travel; further, approximately 90% of travel emissions come from air travel. But most corporations do not own airplanes or directly influence the carbon intensity of the fuel that goes in them, leaving them with limited options for achieving their carbon reduction goals.

A leading solution for these firms is to buy scope 3 emissions credits, commonly referred to as SAF certificates or “SAFc.” SAFc is an emerging product that corporations are leveraging to reduce their carbon footprints. For business aviation, the emergence of SAFc offers a rare opportunity to lower their carbon footprints without pushing operating costs through the roof. Innovative business aviation operators see this opportunity and are quickly capitalizing on it.

3 Products In 1

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, comes from non-fossil feedstocks that are converted to fuel through a technology pathway which ultimately has a lower carbon footprint than conventional jet fuel production and use. Examples of these pathways include production of SAF from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal tallow via the well-established Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process, and emerging routes such as volatile fatty acids-to-synthetic paraffinic kerosene (VFA-SPK), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Power-to-Liquids (PtL). Each of these processes yields a jet fuel with a lower carbon footprint than conventional jet fuel.

Scope 1 emissions are the emissions from the direct activities of a company. For aviation operators, the burning of jet fuel constitutes a scope 1 emission. A business traveler, such as a consultant flying to a customer meeting, riding on an aircraft burning that jet fuel also accrues emissions, but they are classified as scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are based on the indirect activities of a company, such as business travel. When SAF is used instead of conventional jet fuel, the difference in carbon intensities equates to the abatement of scope 1 emissions for the aviation operator and abatement of scope 3 emissions for the traveler. This has value.

The carbon abatement achieved with SAF can be packaged into separate products: scope 1 emissions abatement and scope 3 emissions abatement, or SAFc. These credits can be sold into voluntary markets to “inset,” or lower, the carbon footprint for the buyer. In essence, SAF is 3 products in 1: a physical fuel, a scope 1 emissions credit for aviation operators, and a scope 3 emissions credit for travelers. While the physical fuel is sold at commodity price, the abatement value is sold in voluntary markets for additional value. This additional value helps to offset the increased cost of producing SAF.

A Unique Tool

Global companies are under the microscope for their environmental impact, typically measured in terms of carbon intensity. By purchasing scope 3 emissions credits via SAFc on the voluntary market, corporations can claim the “green benefit” of the abated carbon from using SAF rather than high-carbon intensity jet fuel. This, in turn, reduces their scope 3 emissions and the overall carbon footprint of their business, enabling them to meet their sustainability targets.

With few other options to lower their carbon footprints, many corporations have the desire and the ability to pay the “green premium” that often hinders green product adoption. To date, many global corporations have engaged in SAF transactions to lower their scope 3 emissions, including Deloitte, Microsoft, and JP Morgan Chase, among others. A recent survey by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) found that the average “willingness to pay” by corporations for SAFc is approximately $300/ton of CO2 abated. There is clear market demand for the value this product brings.

A Value For Business Aviation

It is well established that fuel is one of the largest operating expenses for airlines. In countries across the globe, fuel contributes 20-30% of the total cost of operations. Hence, airlines are challenged to accept any increase in fuel prices. Today, SAF is more costly to produce than conventional jet fuel from fossil sources. Options to reduce the net cost of SAF will be most welcome by airlines seeking to lower their carbon footprint.

Recall that a gallon of SAF can be viewed as 3 products in 1. The operator can burn the physical fuel to operate their aircraft, retain the scope 1 credit, and monetize the scope 3 credit to corporate travelers who are showing a strong willingness to pay. Some SAF technologies, including VFA-SPK, are able to offer physical fuel and scope 1 abatement close to cost parity with Jet-A coupled with competitively priced scope 3 abatement.

The aviation operator can then “separate” the scope 3 benefit, via SAFc and sell the certificate to corporate travelers. Doing so effectively brings the operator’s SAF fuel price to near parity with Jet-A. For the business aviation operator, engagement in SAF yields fuel that is sustainable without increasing costs, two concepts rarely found together.

A Win-Win

For business aviation, the purchase of SAF creates the opportunity to reduce carbon footprint without increasing net fuel price. Who knows, as SAFc demand grows, it may serve to reduce net fuel costs.

Business aviation is uniquely placed for the decoupling of physical fuel and sustainability benefit. Operators are concerned with controlling cost and corporate travelers are concerned with carbon footprint. Innovative business aviation companies are recognizing that SAF satisfies both.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f53542_c7e74b0ffb5e4049b51ef8581ea21e25~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f53542_c7e74b0ffb5e4049b51ef8581ea21e25~mv2.webp",N,,2025-05-07 23:56:08.895921

The investigation is carried out numerically using reactive Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Finite Rate Chemistry (FRC), incorporating the effects of turbulence as well as crucial chemical differences between the fuels. Two cases are studied: a simple premixed bluff body flame and a generic aeroengine-like spray combustor operated at idle and cruise conditions. The targeted fuels include conventional Jet A, a pure alcohol-to-jet SAF called C1, and an aromatics-heavy test fuel called C5. A set of correlations is developed to capture the liquid properties of these fuels across all relevant temperatures.

The more volatile fuels C1 and C5 have more compact flames than Jet A; this causes them to burn at a higher equivalence ratio, increasing NOx emissions. C1 and C5 also experience stronger thermoacoustic fluctuations, which is likely caused by their high vaporizability but may also be linked to their low Cetane numbers relative to Jet A.}}, author = {{Åkerblom, Arvid}}, isbn = {{978-91-8104-506-2}}, issn = {{0280-1990}}, keywords = {{Computational Fluid Dynamics; Large Eddy Simulation; Sustainable Aviation Fuel; Jet Engine; Turbulent Combustion}}, language = {{eng}}, month = {{04}}, publisher = {{Department of Energy Sciences, Lund University}}, school = {{Lund University}}, series = {{LUTMDN/TMHP-25/1180-SE}}, title = {{Large Eddy Simulations of Alternative Jet Fuel Combustion}}, url = {{https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/files/218561326/Thesis_Arvid_Aakerblom.pdf}}, year = {{2025}}, }",,N,,2025-05-07 19:56:35.097764

Skyven Technologies

Skyven Technologies works with industrial manufacturers by recovering waste heat to produce clean, emissions-free steam using their Arcturus steam generating heat pump. Skyven’s proven Energy-as-a-Service model allows industrial manufacturers to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs without the upfront capital expenditure.

XTS Energy

XTS is currently developing a project using alcohol-to-jet technology (“ATJ”) to meet the growing demand for clean transport fuels by building, owning and operating the infrastructure to produce 30 million gallons per year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) and Renewable Diesel using ATJ technology with low carbon ethanol as a feedstock.

As SAF is critical to aviation’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050, XTS’s project will help bridge supply gaps while meeting carbon reduction targets in a market projected to demand 120 billion gallons of SAF per year. Strategically positioned to leverage U.S. economic incentives and comply with the strictest regulations in the EU, U.S., and Asia, XTS presents a compelling investment opportunity in clean fuel solutions for sustainable aviation and regulatory compliance.

Terragia Biofuel, Inc.

Terragia is developing innovative biotechnology to convert cellulosic biomass (the parts of plants that have evolved over time to be recalcitrant and hard to break down) into ethanol. Terragia’s novel approach, a combination of better biology and consolidated processing, unlocks that potential, providing a liquid fuel alternative that is not only more sustainable than fossil fuels but cost competitive as well. Integration of Terragia’s technology in corn ethanol plants will increase ethanol yields and enhance coproduct value while improving sustainability metrics.

Celluol

Waste biomass, such as agricultural residues, has unrealized potential to be a critical feedstock in the production of net-zero fuels and chemicals. Current solutions for the conversion of these residues have faced technical challenges due to the difficulty and cost in the crucial step of degrading this biomass into utilizable free sugars. Celluol has engineered a bacterium that can directly degrade and ferment waste biomass into ethanol using a one-step process similar to how we make beer or wine.

This breakthrough directly addresses the challenges encountered by current cellulosic conversion technologies, simplifying the process and making it significantly less expensive.

Celluol’s simpler and cheaper process can be rapidly deployed, starting by co-locating at first-generation ethanol plants that currently use corn or sugarcane and have abundant biomass wastes. By further capturing and converting the CO2 produced during the fermentation process into ethanol, Celluol’s technology has the potential to decrease the amount of land required for sustainable biofuel production by up to three times.

The Pennycress Company

The Pennycress Company bioengineers and sells pennycress seeds so farmers and biorefineries can increase profits and ecosystem health. They connect the supply chain from farmers to commodity traders who process the seed to be used in numerous products from cooking oil to sustainable aviation fuel. While growing on farmers' fields, pennycress sequesters carbon, increases biodiversity, and protects topsoil.

U.S. production of “other biofuels,” the category the U.S. Energy Information Administration uses to capture SAF in its Petroleum Supply Monthly, approximately doubled from December to February.

Investments in SAF have increased, according to EIA, because of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, federal tax credits and state programs and tax credits incentivizing use of the fuel.

In addition to SAF, EIA’s “other biofuels” category includes renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline and other emerging biofuels that are in various stages of development and commercialization.

Prior to 2025, renewable naphtha and renewable propane, which are byproducts of renewable diesel production, made up most of the “other biofuels” production and was increasing because of growing renewable diesel production.

SAF made up only a small portion of “other biofuels” production because of limited production capacity.

At the beginning of 2024, U.S. SAF production capacity was only around 2,000 barrels per day, with just two plants capable of producing SAF: World Energy’s plant in Paramount, California, and Montana Renewables’ plant in Great Falls, Montana.

U.S. SAF production capacity increased by about 25,000 barrels per day in late 2024.

Phillips 66 completed its 10,000-barrel-per-day SAF project in Rodeo, California, in the third quarter of 2024, before temporarily halting production in the fourth quarter.

Diamond Green Diesel completed its 15,000-barrel-per-day SAF project in Port Arthur, Texas, in the fourth quarter.

A couple of smaller projects will bring additional SAF production capacity online in 2025.

New Rise Renewables announced it began SAF production at its plant in Reno, Nevada, in February, adding up to 3,000 barrels per day of SAF production.

Par Pacific plans to begin SAF production at its plant in Kapolei, Hawaii, in the second half of the year, adding about 2,000 barrels per day of SAF production capacity.

With SAF production capacity now around 30,000 barrels per day and growing in 2025, SAF will likely drive significant growth in “other biofuels” production and make up most of the fuel in that EIA category.

In January, U.S. production of “other biofuels” reached 33,000 barrels per day, nearly 30 percent more than the previous record high set in September.

Production increased another 30 percent in February to 44,000 barrels per day.

In EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, it forecasts that U.S. production of “other biofuels” will more than double between 2024 and 2025 and increase by about another 20 percent in 2026.

Although EIA does not publish a forecast for each fuel that makes up the category, it expects increased SAF production to drive most of that growth.

Despite strong growth in SAF on a percentage basis, the absolute volumes will remain relatively low, making up less than 2 percent of about 1.7 million barrels per day of U.S. jet fuel consumption in 2025 and about 2 percent in 2026.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_aad2a0d202174beeae582293b683333c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_925,h_537,al_c,q_85/80995f_aad2a0d202174beeae582293b683333c~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-07 23:56:22.375814

Aaron Karp:

Hello, and thank you for joining us for Window Seat, our Aviation Week Air Transport podcast. My name is Aaron Karp, and I'm a Senior Editor with Routes and Air Transport World.

My guest today really needs no introduction: David Neeleman, the CEO and Founder of Breeze Airways. He has been involved in founding five airlines, starting with Morris Air in 1984, which was eventually bought by Southwest Airlines. He was involved in founding a Canadian carrier, WestJet in the late '90s. And then I think what you're most well known for is JetBlue in the year 2000. You then went on to found Azul Brazilian Airlines in Brazil, and in 2021 founded Breeze Airways, a startup US carrier that already has a network of more than 70 cities and 280 routes. So David, thank you so much for joining us.

David Neeleman:

Sure, great. Thanks for having me on, Aaron.

Aaron Karp:

We'll start with the big picture view. How do you view the US airline market right now in this post-pandemic time? We've moved past the immediate post-pandemic time. How do you view the market right now?

David Neeleman:

I think you could probably sum it up as the haves and the have-nots. COVID just changed some things. I think it was maybe coincidental too, because I think the big airlines, Delta, United, American, you can even put Alaska in that category, they're doing really well. They had a plan. I think over the years they looked at JetBlue and said, ""Wow, it's pretty cool to have TVs on your airplane."" Well, yeah, I mean, giving free wifi seems to make a lot of sense. Let's go with leather seats. Let's add 20, 30 seats on those airplanes, not because we're going to squish people in, but let's go to an Airbus A321. Let's bag the A319s, let's go to the Boeing MAX-9s and if we can get MAX-10s, all the better. And then let's really focus on our hubs, but let's really step up our game and really focus on our credit cards, our frequent flyer miles. And it's been in the works for a long time.

I think about what these big guys were during, and there were more of them obviously before the mergers. Before, when I started JetBlue, they were just not good. And today they're good, they're really good, they've really got their act together and they're doing a really great job. So I think you've got to really distinguish yourself. You’ve got to be a little bit different, you got to do something different. You can't just be flying the same routes, doing the same things.

And on the ULCC side, Spirit and Frontier, and to a lesser degree, Allegiant, thought, well, if we can just put more and more seats in an airplane and we can get bigger and bigger and bigger, there's just no way that anyone can compete with this. And then we can just have the lowest fare, that'll always win, it doesn't really matter. But then those two things collided, and all of a sudden you had incremental seats on the big guys and they said, ""Hey, I've got these 20 or 30 seats cheaper than you do on yours. I don't care how many seats you put on an airplane, and we can match you and create basic economy."" And so there's been a divergence really, since COVID.

And I think obviously there was a lot of money passed out during COVID as well, which certainly would've caused more bankruptcies had that not happened, had not the $57 billion been given out by the US government. So yeah, it's interesting times for sure in the US business. And I talk to Europeans and they say, ""Well, Ryanair's still doing great. Why are these other guys not doing great? Why is it different in the US?"" And I think it has to do with overlap. When you're flying wingtip to wingtip, you're just more susceptible to competition.

Aaron Karp:

And Breeze ultimately is going to have 90 A220-300s in its fleet, and so you're taking a lot of new aircraft. Right now there's a lot of concern about the supply chain and delivery delays for aircraft. How do you see that right now? Are you confident in your deliveries? And more broadly, how do you see how the manufacturers are doing in getting these airplanes out to airlines?

David Neeleman:

Well, it's a challenge. Again, last time I checked we're four years beyond COVID and we still have supply chain issues. It's what happened during that time. But we're getting new deliveries, they're not on schedule, but we're getting them. Maybe two to four to six to eight weeks late, and we see it coming so we can adjust the schedules for that. And obviously the bigger issue is the engines. We do have geared turbofan engines and our tech ops team does a great job of taking care of our engines. We're in a fairly benign environment compared to some of the other environments that planes fly in.

So right now, knock on wood, we're hanging in there with the engines, we're working really close with Pratt, they're being really supportive. And so I think planes keep coming, engines keep going to the shop and coming back. And so, we don't have any parked airplanes like some of the others, but for now we're just out doing our own thing and controlling what we can control.

Aaron Karp:

And do you think the supply chain issues will get better, particularly with the tariff issue now, now a big deal? Do you see improvement coming or is this a problem we're stuck with for a while?

David Neeleman:

Well, the tariff issue is interesting because I was in Washington last week and had some really good meetings back there. And one thing I didn't realize as I got educated from others in the industry, and as I had the ability to tell the story, not only of Breeze but also of the industry, one of the focuses of the administration is trade imbalance. We first saw those tariffs come out and we're like, wait a second, why are we tariffing Vietnam? 45%, 40%? Because they don't have a 40% tariff on our stuff and we learned that it was because of a trade imbalance. It wasn't reciprocal, it was reciprocal in the imbalance. And then we hear a lot about China's six to one trade imbalance with us. Obviously a lot more Chinese stuff coming in than we export to China.

Well, it's just the opposite for aviation. The United States of America is the greatest exporter of aviation-related parts and planes and engines and avionics in the world. We have a 6 to 1 ratio to the rest of the world. We exported $124 billion worth of goods last year to the world and only imported $20 billion. So, I think when that word gets out and if that's really the goal of the administration, and there has been this understanding since 1980, 1979, there was an agreement that aviation was the economic driver of the world. We contribute about 7% of the world GDP. And so you don't want to tax that, because this creates a lot of movement of goods and services and people and business and all that kind of stuff.

So the industry's telling the story and saying look … there could be some really bad consequences for American products and companies, especially Boeing, if there were reciprocal tariffs from the other side. So hopefully, got my fingers crossed, that that gets worked out and aviation, it goes back where it was prior to Liberation Day.

Aaron Karp:

And given that Breeze is taking Airbus aircraft, is this something you're worried about or are your aircraft being actually manufactured in Alabama?

David Neeleman:

Yeah, our planes are manufactured in Alabama. There is potentially some tariffs because their parts come in from other places, but the engines come from the United States, more than 51% content. Our flight deck, all the most expensive parts on the airplane, are done by US companies.

Aaron Karp:

And another issue that has cropped up is air traffic control and some of the shortages of controllers. Do you see an issue now, in terms of the efficiency of the system and being able to fly everywhere you want to fly and on time and just generally the US market and how air traffic control is affecting the efficiency of the airline system?

David Neeleman:

Well, thank goodness. Thank goodness we don't go flying to congested airports and congested airspace. That's part of our business plan, is that we don't go to JFK or LaGuardia or Newark. We go to Islip, we go to White Plains, we go to Stewart. We go to these secondary airports that are outside of this metro area, but we are affected by it. I'm not saying that we aren't, because there is flow control coming from the Jacksonville Center, and it's concerning, and especially since it takes so long to create an air traffic controller. We've read over the weekend about the issues of Newark and one person working in the tower and walkouts and all that kind of stuff.

But I am hopeful, because I have had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Duffy at the Department of Transportation, he's very good and he's very solicitous to the industry. What can he do? He's focused on getting the money together to fix the technology from the air traffic control system, but he's also dealing with the personnel issues. He's been to Oklahoma City, he's upped the wages, the training pay wages. He's including other schools in the training. And so, he's got a plan and we're here to support him as an industry and we're really confident and happy that he's in that position.

Aaron Karp:

And before we get into Breeze specifically, one other issue that's really talked about these days is the environment and whether airlines can grow efficiently and lower their carbon emissions. There's been some concern lately that there's no new aircraft coming online, that sustainable aviation fuel, there's just not enough of it, it's too expensive. Where do you see all that and whether the industry will continue to grow and will be allowed to grow by governments?

David Neeleman:

I don't know about what's going on in Europe, but this whole thing has been a facade for so long, this SAF thing, it's all just fake. It's billions of dollars wasted on fake solutions. It's not a solution at all. It's just window dressing. It's basically politicians trying to feel good about themselves. And industry leaders, particularly in Europe, kind of mimicking and parroting and saying they'll be carbon-neutral by 2050 when none of them will be working at those airlines. It's all just BS. I'm not a climate denier and I obviously think it's something that we have to think about as we make a next step to hydrogen or whatever, or maybe we can do some things at a much smaller scale.

I was at a conference with Willie Walsh, who's head of IATA, in Amsterdam last year, and he said that to convert the whole industry to SAF, it would be $167 billion a year in extra costs, and we only make $20 billion as an industry worldwide. So basically, when he got through saying that and he was sort of pushing it, I just said, ""Well, no one in this room is going to have a job. You might as well shut down aviation because there's no way to pay for that."" And then you’ve got to worry about food supply and making sure people have food to eat. So, it's all just nonsense and I'm happy to see the veneer is just falling off it now and people aren't really talking about it anymore. Not to say that we shouldn't come up with something. Like I said, the next generation, but SAF is not the answer, it is not the answer.

Now, I do believe that as we go more and more electric with cars and gasoline goes away, because diesel is just one cut of the barrel of oil, it's like 30%. So if all the gasoline goes away, we're going to get refineries going out of business and then our fuel will go up in cost if there's no refineries. So, maybe we do something as an industry to help other industries. Maybe I propose a $5 tax per ticket worldwide that would go into a fund that would only go to offset other people who use distillates, power plants … trucks that use diesel. And get rid of everybody else using diesel so we can have it all to ourselves, and I think that'd be a much smarter path.

Aaron Karp:

Let's get into Breeze. You founded Breeze in 2021. What motivated you? Why did you think Breeze was necessary in the market and what led you to found this new airline?

David Neeleman:

We actually started and launched it before COVID, and obviously it took us a while to get going because of COVID, and this has accelerated since then. But before COVID, what we saw was this thing that I started with, where planes were getting bigger and bigger and bigger. You basically had the regional jets that were capped at 74 seats, the A319s, which were very inefficient airplanes because they were shrunk down A320s. And 737-700s and-500s, and all of that was going away. People were going to the 737-800, MAX-8, MAX-9, getting rid of A321s, even moving away from A320s and going to A321s. And it just left this wide open area right in the middle where people were just abandoning.

And I looked at this amazing map that showed, there were 123 airports in the United States that lost at least 25% of their air service over the last 10 years. So I'm like, okay, well let's dig through the database of the DOT … and there was also this migration of people that were leaving the Northeast and were going to smaller cities. Where people usually would go from New York to Miami, or then moved from New York to LA, they [instead] were moving to places like Charleston and they were going to Raleigh and they were going to Greensboro, Spartanburg, South Carolina, and they were going to Huntsville, Alabama. And all of these places, Pensacola, Florida, people were moving and spreading out and finding cheaper real estate. So we really thought that there was a place for a lower-trip cost airplane that was new technology instead of old technology. So using the Airbus A220 with the newest technology and using the E-jets that we started with that were basically stretched versions of the 74-seaters, we got more seats for basically the same price, and then we could do some point-to-point service.

And so today, four years in, we'll have our four-year anniversary of flying, we will be in about 280 city pairs. We're … coming up at 70 cities today. By the end of the month we'll have about 72. We’re the sole carrier on about 87% of our routes, we fly twice a week in some markets, we fly twice a day in other markets, so it just depends on which market it is. But this is really the key for us. We generate, I would say eight or 10 times more traffic than we steal, if we steal any at all. We're really just generating traffic.

I remember I was in Charleston for [a route] announcement and there was a lady that worked at the Charleston Airport and she said, ""My mother lives in New Orleans and I only go visit her once or twice a year, but now, with tears in her eyes she told me this, ""I'm going to go and see her every month because now I can."" It's not just the cost, it's being able to get over there, see her mother and then come back and stay a weekend. And so, it's just taking the friction out of travel by [eliminating] making a connection. And we're finding a lot of people buying second homes between places where we fly down into Fort Myers or Vero Beach or into these other cities where people will go and buy a second home because it's just easier to get back and forth. And so generating all this traffic in these markets and getting people to fly more often or fly when they wouldn't have flown otherwise, is really our business.

Aaron Karp:

And you mentioned that on 87% of your routes, they're noncompetitive. Do you have a concern about the majors coming in and trying to steal some of your traffic and push you out of these markets, or do you think they're essentially going to ignore you?

David Neeleman:

Like I said, we have lower trip costs with the airplane and we have a premium section. So, we're kind of doing the same thing that everyone else is doing, where we have 12 first class seats, we have 45 extra legroom seats, we have wifi. And our plan, we think depending on what airline it is, it's about a 20% to 30% advantage on trip costs. And they can try and come with a regional jet with 74 seats, but the economics aren't that great on that airplane.

I think where the ULCCs have gotten into trouble is that they went right into the heart of [the majors’} business and started really just taking business away that was on an existing route. Where we create most of our traffic, we're not really hurting anyone, we're just generating new traffic. And also, we have this lower trip cost airplane, but if they want to come into a route, we've identified 1,500 routes that we can serve and we're flying 280 of them. And if someone comes into five or 10, we're not building office buildings, we've got mobile assets we can pick up and go anywhere we want to. And that flexibility is really important in this business.

Aaron Karp:

And how about flying internationally? When do you expect that that could occur?

David Neeleman:

We do fly internationally today. We have a charter authority, so we do charters internationally … but we really want to do scheduled service. And so there's a process you go through with the FAA once you get your regular certificate, you get what's called flag status so you can fly international. And so it's revising the manuals and we've submitted all that to the FAA and they're reviewing it. And then once they check off on all that, you do proving flights, you do 50 hours of flying. And once we get that, we'll be certified to fly international, and we're hoping that by this winter we'll be able to add some international destinations.

Aaron Karp:

And what kind of range will you have with the A220 to go international?

David Neeleman:

The plane has about a 3,000-mile range, 3,200 miles, so seven hours of range. So yeah, we can get into South America, all through Central America, if we go from Florida. We can't go too far over the ocean like to Hawaii or anything yet until we get the ETOPS certification. But there's a lot of things we can do from going south and hopefully going west, and even some destinations going east at some point in time.

Aaron Karp:

And you mentioned South America, that's a good segue to talk about Azul. Well, you've had a real success in breaking into the Brazilian market and the South American market. How do you see the South American market right now, in terms of where it stands and how much growth potential there is down there?

David Neeleman:

We believe there's a lot. I mean, Azul is a great story. It's got a little sad chapter in it, and that was COVID. Unlike the US carriers, the Brazilian government did not support [airlines]. It's not a rich government to be able to give billions to industry, they were more worried about feeding their people. So Azul was one of the most profitable airlines in the world prior to COVID, and then came out of COVID with a significant amount of debt. And so all of our competitors, pretty much, LATAM, GOL, Aeromexico, with the exception of Copa, filed for bankruptcy. And so we're in the midst of a restructuring now. The core business, it does very well. It's more profitable than it's ever been, but it's laden with a lot of debt. And so we're restructuring all that and converting that to equity, that's really the goal.

To answer your question directly, there's a lot of growth, especially in Brazil. The amount of people that travel in Brazil compared to even Mexico or Chile or even Colombia is far less, so we think there's a huge opportunity there. And Azul's a little bit like Breeze in a sense, because we patterned Breeze a little bit after Azul. Azul serves 150 cities in Brazil, more than double what our competitors do. We have 1,000 flights a day and a wide-ranging fleet. There's growth opportunity, especially in the developing areas of Brazil and agribusiness and other areas. So, we're really positive on the futures of Brazil and the growth potential there.

Aaron Karp:

And it seems like one thing in South America is there's so many people that haven't flown before or are flying once every two or three years. Do you see that more people will be able to fly and does that drive growth in Latin America?

David Neeleman:

Absolutely, yeah. I mean, the more you can be efficient and offer fares and the more the economies develop and people move into the middle class and they can afford to buy airline tickets, then that's what helps the market growth.

Aaron Karp:

And do you see any potential tie up between Breeze and Azul, in terms of connecting passengers?

David Neeleman:

Absolutely, yeah. Breeze is growing our Orlando operation world now, something with Azul in the not too distant future where people can come from all the cities we serve from Orlando and make a pretty good connection and head off to Brazil. Azul serves four cities, I think, four cities from Orlando into Brazil. So yeah, with the cities we serve, with the 20 or so cities, combining with Brazil, there'll be lots of options for people to go visit Brazil or go visit family if they're from there.

Aaron Karp:

Well, we really appreciate your time. One final question. How is Breeze doing in terms of finances, and is there any thought of taking it public?

David Neeleman:

Well, every airline talks about going public. And I think the really good thing about Breeze, when you're growing quickly, and we grew about 50% this year, the markets that you fly in your first six months, you always lose money because you have no repeat business, and nobody knows who you are. They got to come back and fly again and layer on top of it, and that's the maturity of the market. So as we get more and more mature markets, then obviously we move to profitability. So we didn't actually make money in the fourth quarter last year. The first quarter is always not the best quarter because of January, but we're doing good in the second quarter. Still hoping, knock on wood, to make a little money in the second quarter. And then if we can do that, then we got a really good shot of making money for the year. So that's really the key for us, is getting the profitability and even in this really tough environment and people struggling, it could always be better but we feel very fortunate to be in a position we're at.

by Jim Giles (Trellis) Environmental group and aviation industry disagree on how to assess the full climate impact of fuel made from corn and soybeans. -- Key Takeaways: Scaling the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from corn and soybeans is the focus of U.S. plans to decarbonize aviation, but researchers at the World Resources Institute are urging a rethink.

The U.S. produces around just 1 percent of the quantity of SAF needed to hit a government target of 3 billion gallons of domestic production by 2030, according to the Department of Energy.

SAF made from corn and soybean is a core part of plans to scale.

But when land-use change is considered, corn and soybean-based SAF creates more emissions than fossil jet fuel, the WRI concluded in a report released last week.

The crops “are not a viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation,” said Audrey Denvir, a WRI research associate and author on the report.

Industry figures questioned key details of the analysis.

“Context is everything,” said Adam Klauber, who oversees sustainability and digital supply chains at World Energy, a SAF producer. Klauber argued that the WRI analysis relied on global averages for the impacts of biofuel crops and overlooked the higher performance of crops grown in the U.S.

...

World Resources Institute urges U.S. policymakers and businesses to exclude corn and soybean fuels from plans to decarbonize aviation.

Industry places both sources at the heart of expansion of sustainable aviation fuel use.

State and federal regulators will likely be the key arbiters that shape company decisions.

...

Almost all SAF is currently produced from used cooking oil and other inedible biomass, and is broadly agreed to lead to real carbon savings when it displaces fossil jet fuel. But current production is tiny: The U.S. produces around 1 percent of the quantity needed to hit a government target of 3 billion gallons of domestic production by 2030, according to a 2024 Department of Energy report.

...

“Purpose-grown crops could constitute the majority of the supply within six to 10 years,” estimated Adam Klauber, who oversees sustainability and digital supply chains at World Energy, an SAF producer.

To qualify as SAF, fuels produced from these crops need to emit no more than 50 percent of the emissions from fossil jet fuel.

...

In a report released last week on how biomass can be used to decarbonize the U.S. economy, the researchers used a metric called “carbon opportunity cost” to calculate spillover impacts of fuel crops. As global demand for food grows, dedicating land for this purpose leads to forests and other native ecosystems being converted to agriculture, releasing additional emissions in the process.

...

Industry figures questioned key details of the analysis. Klauber argued that relying on global averages for the impacts of biofuel crops overlooks the higher performance of crops grown in the U.S. “Context is everything,” he said. In the case of soy production, for example, Klauber said the researchers used a carbon intensity figure that was several times higher than the one other academic and environmental organizations use.

Specific farming practices are also critical, he added. For example, biofuels can be grown either alongside and simultaneously with food crops, or during the shoulder season on either side of them. “That is broadly accepted as a sustainable practice, but it’s not yet at commercial scale,” said Klauber. “We’re working to increase that, because that really will be a way to increase the productivity of land without impacting food.”",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 17:57:04.859357

That has been, I think, the hallmark of what has driven so much of American energy [innovation] over the years.” Gordon spoke to about 350 attendees of the Next Frontier Energy Summit, an annual event organized by the Wyoming Energy Authority, at the University of Wyoming on Tuesday.
The two-day conference featured speakers representing utility giant PacifiCorp, nuclear energy manufacturer BWXT Advanced Technologies, and leaders in the oil and gas and uranium mining industries.
“It is elevating education and job training for Wyoming, as well as a future U.S. workforce,” Crane said.
However, Crane noted, PacifiCorp isn’t giving up on Wyoming coal.","LARAMIE—Wyoming is on the cusp of a nationwide nuclear power resurgence with the backing of a presidential administration that also promises to overhaul federal regulations to ensure the state’s coal, oil and natural gas are positioned to meet booming electrical demand while lowering carbon emissions, Gov. Mark Gordon told an audience of energy enthusiasts.

In Wyoming, he said, “We talk about what’s practical, what’s good and what can we accomplish if we really put our minds to it. That has been, I think, the hallmark of what has driven so much of American energy [innovation] over the years.”

Gordon spoke to about 350 attendees of the Next Frontier Energy Summit, an annual event organized by the Wyoming Energy Authority, at the University of Wyoming on Tuesday. The two-day conference featured speakers representing utility giant PacifiCorp, nuclear energy manufacturer BWXT Advanced Technologies, and leaders in the oil and gas and uranium mining industries. The governor suggested that, after decades of visionary work by state leaders to create regulatory pathways and boost investor confidence to scrub carbon from fossil fuels, markets and national policies are finally beginning to align with Wyoming’s attitude to “find a way forward.”

In fact, Gordon said, he’s recently modified his long-touted mantra of an “all-of-the-above” energy and environmental strategy: “Now, we need to talk about the best of all-of-the-above.”

“We have opportunities to innovate,” he said, “to make mistakes, to correct from those mistakes and to really drive through to a future that is efficient, that is environmentally sound, that has a mix in the energy portfolio — everything from renewables in the appropriate place to fossil [fuels] done right to nuclear done right.”

Faith in Wyoming nuclear, natural gas and coal

As evidence of Wyoming leading on the next generation of energy, PacifiCorp CEO Cindy Crane noted the utility’s tentative agreement to take on TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear power plant under construction near Kemmerer. Not only will Natrium — among the first “advanced small modular reactors” in development in the nation — help the six-state utility secure reliable, low-carbon electricity, it fits within PacifiCorp’s penchant for proven technologies over more speculative endeavors and political favor.

“We don’t shift our strategy based on who’s in the White House,” Crane said. “We don’t manage our business on politics. We manage our business for our customers, first and foremost, and for our states and their energy policies, not the federal government’s policies.”

A big part of what makes advanced nuclear attractive to PacifiCorp, according to Crane, is the partnerships between the utility, TerraPower, the state, federal agencies and the University of Wyoming to build a domestic nuclear energy supply chain and workforce to back it up.

“It is elevating education and job training for Wyoming, as well as a future U.S. workforce,” Crane said. “It is building a transition for our existing and experienced workforce, and it is positioning Wyoming to continue and grow its electrification and supply of power throughout the western U.S.”

After burning more than $5 billion worth of Wyoming coal at its power plants over the decades, PacifiCorp is making the shift — although critics say too slowly — to not only renewables backed by energy storage, according to Crane but to nuclear and natural gas.

In fact, PacifiCorp has converted two of four coal-burning units at its Jim Bridger power plant outside Rock Springs to natural gas, and will convert the final two coal-burning units at the Naughton power plant near Kemmerer to natural gas in 2026. However, Crane noted, PacifiCorp isn’t giving up on Wyoming coal. The company is still evaluating whether it makes sense to retrofit coal units at its Jim Bridger and Dave Johnston power plants with carbon capture, use and sequestration technologies.

Despite a steep price tag for such retrofits, if they move forward — estimated at over $1 billion — the efforts would create thousands of construction jobs and sustain hundreds of existing jobs in the state, Crane said.

“This is truly an example of planting the seeds for long-term jobs and economic prosperity in the state,” she said.

Gordon noted that such efforts to push new commercial-scale technologies are expensive, including for customers, but suggested it is worth the investment.

“The technologies that have come along over the last couple of years are remarkable,” Gordon said. “Yes, some of them are very expensive. First-generation stuff generally is. But we’ve all had the benefit of lessons of time to develop the technologies and see what can be done better.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mark-gordon-laramie-energy-conf-may-6-2025-dbleizeffer1746638790.jpeg?h=af4ce5f3&itok=Tgaf52Ls,N,,2025-05-07 20:57:00.287861

The United Investment

This investment by United Airlines Ventures is not an unpredictable one, as it comes from their designated Sustainable Flight Fund, allied with contributions from partners such as GE Aerospace, Embraer, Google, and several airlines.

The fund’s sole purpose is to invest and support companies focusing on the production, research and technological advancements needed to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and more importantly, scale it for the industry as a whole.

United have set clear commitments and goals to help the aviation industry go green. Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, said:

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels. Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured, providing them with the flexibility to commercialize their technology and grow their operations expediently.”

Why Twelve?

This new investment by United, follows an impressive period of growth and investment for Twelve. Twelve’s $83 million Series C funding round and project financing will see them now build their first SAF production facility which, once production begins this year, will produce up to 50,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Nicholas Flanders, Twelve’s co-founder and CEO, highlighted the partnership’s significance:

“United’s investment accelerates our transition from innovation to implementation. With AirPlant One launching soon, we’re creating a scalable pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational and environmental goals.”

This exciting collaboration underscores United’s commitment to creating sustainability in the aviation industry and an investment in Twelve’s mission of decarbonisation could go a long way to change the state of the aviation fuel industry for the better.

A lack of policy for sustainable aviation fuel has created some industry challenges.

David Cobb with Clean Fuels Alliance America says SAF production is taking shape.

“It’s underway, but it’s very small,” he says. “Once we get policies right, and I think we will eventually, that will help to get things going.”

He tells Brownfield the Renewable Volume Obligations from 2023 has resulted in industry setbacks.

“The levels that they set were way below what our industry could do,” he says. “Certainly it has created some challenges. We have some members that have gone out of business, others are idled. The damage is done. The one good thing one is they have actually hard data to back up the assertion that we need to get those volumes up.”

Cobb says the organization is expecting a final decision from the EPA by the end of the month.

Commercial Engines

Our engines power the widebody aircraft that underpin international trade and travel, ensuring that the world remains within reach for everyone.

Overview

Innovation is in our DNA

In a world that increasingly thrives on connectivity, the need to bridge distances—both for people and products—has never been greater.

Long-haul travel is on the rise after the pandemic. This is thanks to several long-term trends: a growing middle class in developing countries, increased need for connection around the world, and products from all over the globe that need to be transported to long-distance markets quickly.

GE Aerospace’s widebody engines – CF6, GEnx, GE90, and GE9X - represent the pinnacle of aviation technology.

Translating into lower operating costs for airlines, reduced environmental impact, and an overall enhanced passenger experience.

Powering flight in the most extreme conditions and across the longest distances, the durability and reliability of our engines, and the unmatched breadth and flexibility of our maintenance services have given GE Aerospace a market leading position: 57% of all widebody aircraft departures are powered by a GE Aerospace engine.

Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul, said “the effort to expand tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel is greenwashing an existing production system that has serious environmental and community impacts.” He added that “we should be prioritizing tax breaks for people, like renters and first time homebuyers, rather than corporations producing sustainable aviation fuel, which isn’t actually sustainable.” Many skeptics of sustainable aviation fuel believe that boosters’ emission reduction estimates aren’t accurate, and that policymakers should emphasize alternative transit options like high-speed rail.","Sustainable aviation fuel is having a moment in Minnesota.

Lawmakers are considering a broad expansion of tax credits for producers of the fuels, in hope of positioning Minnesota as a leading manufacturer.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency recently awarded a grant to the University of Minnesota to study a new oil-producing field crop that holds promise as a chief component of the fuel.

And last fall, a fuel company announced a $5 billion investment in a production facility in Moorhead that’s expected to go online in 2030.

Like other types of lower-carbon fuels, including corn ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel has attracted its share of critics concerned about slapping a “green” label on products and practices that continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as well as farm pollutants into the ground and water.

But from an environmental perspective, air travel is a different, much dirtier beast than vehicle transit. It’s responsible for about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions. And the opportunity to shrink the carbon footprint of the airline industry has drawn support even from environmental groups that have been critical of the push for corn ethanol.

A comprehensive switch from traditional jet fuel to sustainable fuels could reduce total air transit emissions by 70% or more.

“Aviation is really hard to decarbonize,” said Trevor Russell, water program director of the Friends of the Mississippi River. “The best first thing we can do is bend the carbon intensity curve of the fuels we are currently using.”

The problem with ethanol

Ethanol derived from corn and other types of biomass has been promoted as a greener alternative to traditional fossil fuels, and over the past several decades state and federal lawmakers have enacted subsidies to support the farmers who grow the crops as well as the fuel companies mixing and refining the final product.

While the resulting fuel is less carbon-intensive than fossil gasoline, many researchers have argued that when you factor in the increased agricultural land use as well as the processing costs, it may actually produce even more carbon dioxide in the long run.

As a result, many advocates believe that it’s better to encourage a shift to fully-electric cars than to promote half-measures like ethanol.

The situation in aviation is different, however. Batteries are heavy, meaning there’s no realistic path to fully electric flight in the near term, especially not on longer routes. And air travel is incredibly carbon intensive, meaning that even modest changes to efficiency would yield major carbon benefits.

A half-measure like less carbon-intensive fuel, in other words, might be the best near-term option for the industry.

A better jet fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel boosters in Minnesota are particularly excited about using winter cover crops, like camelina and pennycress, as sources of biofuel. Planting them as cover crops on existing fields doesn’t require tilling additional land and would provide farmers with an additional revenue stream that doesn’t interrupt their regular crop rotations.

“They can share the same acres — they grow in the fall and are harvested in the spring,” Russell said. “You get all of the environmental benefits of cover crops, but producers can actually harvest and sell that cover crop as a sustainable aviation feedstock.”

Preliminary research suggests that camelina-based jet fuel could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75%. But whether those gains could fully scale up to an industry-wide solution remains an open question. Hence, the need for tax credits.

In 2023, lawmakers passed a credit of $1.50 per gallon for producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel. In his 2025 budget, Gov. Tim Walz called for allocation of an additional $20 million toward the credits over the next decade. Lawmakers are currently negotiating final numbers in the ongoing budget discussions.

While support for sustainable aviation fuel is generally bipartisan, not everyone at the Capitol is sold on it. Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul, said “the effort to expand tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel is greenwashing an existing production system that has serious environmental and community impacts.”

He added that “we should be prioritizing tax breaks for people, like renters and first time homebuyers, rather than corporations producing sustainable aviation fuel, which isn’t actually sustainable.”

Many skeptics of sustainable aviation fuel believe that boosters’ emission reduction estimates aren’t accurate, and that policymakers should emphasize alternative transit options like high-speed rail.

Advocates for the fuel, including Friends of the Mississippi River, the Nature Conservancy and Fresh Energy, have published a set of what they call “guiding principles” to ensure that any new fuels live up to their green promises. Those guidelines call for policies to measure lifecycle emissions properly; ensure no new cropland gets created; minimize impacts on water and air quality; and position winter cover crops like camelina, rather than corn or other sources of biomass, as the preferred feedstocks.

“There are some concerns with over-relying on summer annual or traditional biofuel feedstocks,” Russell said. “Those crops would be lower carbon but would not meet anyone’s definition of sustainable.”

Minnesota’s first camelina crops were planted in 2021, and producers plan to scale up to about 5,000 acres this year, according to the MPCA.

Advocates hope to push production up to 1 million acres by 2035.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2171429907-2048x1357.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 13:57:06.180595

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Policies, regulations and initiatives have been put in place to provide encouragement and impetus to make the energy transition a reality. At the same time, technology innovators have developed various state-of-the-art solutions to address challenges across all stages of the energy transition value chain.

The path to net zero involves a combination of short-term and long-term initiatives, such as improving energy efficiency; adopting renewable energy sources; and electrification, among others. One of the most impactful initiatives to date is the shift toward sustainable or renewable fuels.

Hydrogen opportunity

Hydrogen, being a carbon neutral molecule, produces zero emissions when burned or used as fuel. When produced using fossil fuel free process, green hydrogen, a compelling option in the push to achieve net-zero emissions.

The direct use of hydrogen has matured in some sectors while several other sectors are still under development.

Currently, these sectors are considered challenging for decarbonisation through direct use of hydrogen due to various operational and safety aspects. Hard-to-abate sectors, such as the maritime sector, can achieve decarbonisation through hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia or methanol, while the aviation sector can benefit from sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for its decarbonisation efforts. However, due to hydrogen’s extremely low molecular weight, handling it safely can be challenging – especially in terms of transportation and storage.

The industry has explored several options for low-risk transport, with converting the gas into a liquid found to improve its ability to be transported, especially across border or over long distances. Cryogenic liquefaction, carriers such as ammonia, or utilisation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), are proving attractive. Carriers are then converted back into hydrogen for direct use through specific technologies. However, significant energy is lost during this conversion process from hydrogen carriers back to hydrogen, negatively impacting the economics.

Economics

The production of hydrogen and its derivatives is facing significant economic challenges, and as the economic viability of producing hydrogen derivatives depends on the cost-effective production of hydrogen, derivative production facilities are complex and capex intensive. Overall facility optimisation is crucial for economical production alongside other key drivers, such as supply chain optimisation.

A typical hydrogen and derivatives production plant is shown in Figure-1.

Production challenges

The following challenges and constraints should be addressed when harnessing renewable power through electrolysis technology to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives:

Identifying the optimum capacity utilisation factor (CUF) and addressing the intermittency of renewable power.

The CUF for solar or wind is fixed for a given location. However, for a combined solar and wind facility, achieving a satisfactory CUF requires identifying the optimal mix. It is important to note that these facilities are highly capex intensive.

Energy storage is essential to address the renewable energy production intermittency, therefore identifying optimal capacity is crucial. The storage requirement is often large and represents another capex intensive element. While costs have reduced significantly in recent years, energy storage still contributes heavily to overall capex and production costs.

Identifying the optimum CUF of the electrolyser. The CUF of the electrolyser depends on the upstream and downstream facilities, as well as the overall economics of the integrated facility. Therefore, identification of CUF is complex and requires thorough investigation.

Identifying the optimum capacity of a hydrogen derivative production plant. Although hydrogen derivative production facilities are not capital intensive, overcapacity in such facilities directly leads to overcapacity in front-end systems, such as electrolysers, power and hydrogen storage, and other feedstock units such as nitrogen or carbon-dioxide (CO2) capture plants, and balance of plant (BOP) systems. This in turn, significantly increases the overall capex meaning identifying the optimum CUF of hydrogen derivative plants is crucial.

Optimisation and integration of BOP systems. The BOP system contributes significantly to the overall capex, therefore optimisation and further enhancements through integration become crucial for reducing capex and improving production economics.

All the above factors influence the economics of production greatly. Additionally, other technical challenges also persist which further impact the overall production economics:

Integration strategy of electron-to-molecule production facilities.

Managing the intermittency of renewable power across the entire facility.

Managing the capability boundaries and limitations of each unit, such as the electrolyser, hydrogen storage, hydrogen derivative plant, nitrogen generation plant or CO2 capture plant, and BOP systems.

The dynamic capability of technologies and their susceptibility to fatigue, meaning design and integration of the system respecting fatigue cycle is crucial for optimisation. This aspect may vary from one technology licensor to another.

Balancing the production eco system

The operational strategy of an integrated process facility – starting from the electron and progressing to the molecule – will facilitate optimisation. The concept of plant design, integration and optimisation should be practicable and implementable to ensure this reflects how the overall plant is designed to be operated and controlled, with each unit of the integrated complex having its own operating boundaries. The integration of every unit must respect the individual capabilities and limitations.

There is an opportunity to incorporate innovation into optimisation to make the business case more attractive and economically favourable. An integrated dynamic model with sufficient capability and flexibility can effectively facilitate various optimisation strategies for the integrated plant, from the electron to the molecule.

Typically, derivative production plants are a catalytic conversion process. The processes involved in molecule production normally operate under high temperature and high-pressure conditions. The overall technology is built on multiple units of operations and processes with limited operational flexibility, particularly when addressing intermittency. Therefore, understanding their capabilities and limitations is essential for effective integration with upstream processes. Expanding these capability boundaries through innovation presents the most sensible approach to achieving further optimisation.

Configuring the process: integrated dynamic model

Typically, the following key units are involved in a hydrogen derivative production plant. An ammonia production facility is considered here as an example, however the same principles can be applied to e-methanol, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants as well.

Typical key units

• Renewable facility

• Energy storage system

• Hydrogen production using electrolysis technology

• Hydrogen storage and compressor

• Ammonia production facility (ammonia loop)

• Nitrogen generation unit to supply ammonia production

Worked example: ammonia

The operations of these units can be envisioned under various options for the following operating modes, as detailed in table 1:

Operating mode: Option-1

Operating mode: Option-2

Operating mode: Option-3

A visual representation of the above combinations is presented in Figure 2, below:

Multiple combinations of integrated operating scenarios are possible; three straight options are shown in the table, which are:

Option 1: Complete dynamic operations of all the units, which facilitates minimal storage requirements

Option 2: Complete stable operations of all the units, except renewable power, this scenario requires maximum storage capacity

Option 3: Staged operation of major units, except renewable power and hydrogen storage

Combining these options across all the units results in numerous possible scenarios. An integrated approach along with insights of all units across the value chain will identify the most practical solution. Some combinations can be eliminated qualitatively, after which quantitative evaluations are necessary to determine the optimal solution.

Optimisation objective

A particular project may encompass various optimisation objectives, such as:

Best combination of solar and wind energy generation

Targeted production of hydrogen or its derivatives

Minimum hydrogen storage

Minimum power/energy storage

Minimum Capex of the overall facility

Minimum levelised cost of energy/hydrogen/hydrogen derivatives

One targeted objective should be prioritised to obtain a unique solution from all possible scenarios. However, a quantitative analysis can be carried out which combines multiple objectives and illustrates the optimal solution.

For instance, objective (b) can be grouped together with (a), (c), and (d), with one objective fixed and the other elements treated as variables. To understand the sensitivity of each objective, separate scenarios should be modelled with comparisons drawn that identify the optimal approach.

Modelling approach

In the integrated dynamic model, the typical key units (as listed above) are included due to their significant economic contribution to the overall capex and, consequently, the production cost.

The aim is to develop a solution for an integrated production facility that accounts for all the challenges and constraints, such as technology, the capability boundaries of each unit, capital costs, product capacity and desired product specifications.

The integrated dynamic model has the capability to review production scenarios, perform sensitivity analysis, and help in identifying optimal solutions that can be practically implemented.

Insights that deliver confidence

The valuable exercise of integrated dynamic modelling is performed to identify the unique and implementable solution while satisfying the optimisation objective. The output of the model will identify the following:

Configuration of the integrated facility,

High-level operation and control strategy of the integrated facility,

Possible innovation opportunities in the process configuration and integration

Optimum capacity of units within the integrated facility,

The final output of objective functions, such as levelised cost, and Capex

Understanding the sensitivity of each major unit in relation to the objective function.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks.
Through Wheels Up’s program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.
Commitment to Sustainability With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.
Jill Greer, Wheels Up’s executive vice-president, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented: “We are delighted to launch our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.","Wheels Up Experience Inc. has announced the launch of its new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.

Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative are able to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, ultimately allowing private fliers to participate regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

What is SAF?

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks.

SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel’s lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification.

By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80 percent reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work?

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to ‘fly on SAF’ has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights.

Through Wheels Up’s program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up’s charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF.

Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.

This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up’s executive vice-president, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented:

“We are delighted to launch our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up’s commitment to sustainable aviation.”

Charlotte Lollar, director of sustainable aviation fuel at Delta Air Lines, added:

“We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta’s SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we’re able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions—even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.”

This investment by United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund follows Twelve’s $83 million Series C funding round and project financing for its first SAF production facility, AirPlant One, located in Moses Lake, Washington.

The facility is expected to begin production this year and plans to produce 50,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Last year, Twelve secured a SAF purchase agreement with a large European airline company.

Under the 14-year contract, Twelve will supply 260 million gallons of SAF to support five airline brands.

Fuels derived from petroleum have long been the cornerstone of the transportation sector providing a reliable energy source for more than a century. However, increasing global concerns over climate change, air quality, and environmental degradation have intensified the need for clean and sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. (1,2) In this context, synthetic fuels─commonly referred to as e-fuels─are gaining prominence as they are produced through the utilization of captured CO2 and green hydrogen. This innovative approach not only contributes to carbon neutrality but also aligns with global efforts to mitigate climate change. (3,4)

One of the main advantages of e-fuels is their compatibility with existing infrastructure and internal combustion (IC) engines, which allows them to potentially replace fossil-fuels without significant modifications. This characteristic positions e-fuels as a practical solution for transitioning away from conventional petroleum-based fuels. However, it is important to note that the physicochemical properties of synthetic fuels can differ significantly from those of traditional petroleum-derived fuels. (4,5) These disparities necessitate the incorporation of specific additives to ensure that synthetic fuels meet stringent engine performance and emission standards.

Fuel additives play a crucial role in optimizing combustion processes, enhancing fuel stability, preventing deposits, and reducing harmful emissions. (6,7) They serve various functions, acting as catalysts for combustion, lubricity improvers, corrosion inhibitors, and boosters of octane or cetane levels (Table 1). (8−13) Furthermore, it is essential to utilize renewable-source-based synthetic (green) fuel additives to achieve an overall reduction in the carbon footprint associated with these fuels. (9,10) As the demand for low-carbon transportation fuels continues to grow, synthetic fuel additives are likely to become an increasingly important component of the sustainable energy basket.

Recent advancements in sustainable fuel additives underscore their relevance in addressing current energy transition challenges. Innovative technologies such as Power-to-X (PTX) are revolutionizing fuel production by converting excess renewable energy into synthetic fuels. This process not only facilitates the integration of intermittent renewable resources into the energy system but also provides a pathway for reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. PTX technologies enable the conversion of renewable electricity into hydrogen via electrolysis, which can then be combined with CO2 captured from industrial processes or directly from the atmosphere to produce various hydrocarbons. This not only helps in achieving carbon neutrality but also addresses energy storage challenges associated with renewable energy sources.

Additionally, biofuels derived from biomass are emerging as viable alternatives that not only lower greenhouse gas emissions but also enhance energy security by utilizing locally available resources. Recent studies have demonstrated that integrating biobased additives can significantly improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions in various engine types. For example, research has shown that incorporating fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) can enhance fuel properties while mitigating particulate matter emissions in diesel engines. (14−16)

The incorporation of environmentally friendly additives is critical for ensuring that synthetic fuels meet established quality and performance standards while adhering to stringent environmental regulations. Recent findings indicate that biobased additives can effectively improve fuel stability and performance while minimizing negative environmental impacts. Moreover, ongoing research is exploring novel additive formulations derived from agricultural residues and waste materials, which could further enhance sustainability in fuel production. (17−20) However, their widespread adoption faces significant challenges including high production costs, limited infrastructure, and the need for technological advancements. The economic viability of alternative fuels is often hampered by high production costs. Second-generation biofuels, derived from nonfood feedstocks such as agricultural residues and waste, face challenges due to complex processing techniques. For instance, enzymatic hydrolysis, which is required to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars is energy-intensive and expensive making these fuels less competitive against fossil fuels. (21) Similarly, hydrogen production can be costly particularly when derived from the electrolysis of water by using renewable energy sources. The initial investment in electrolyzers and associated infrastructure can be substantial leading to higher overall costs for hydrogen fuel compared to conventional fuels. (22−25)

Additionally, the logistics of collecting and transporting biomass feedstocks contribute significantly to high costs. The need for specialized equipment and transportation for agricultural residues can make biofuel production economically unfeasible in certain regions. (26−28) Furthermore, producing synthetic fuels from captured CO2 and renewable energy (power-to-liquid technology) involves high capital expenditures and operational costs. These processes are still in their infancy and require further technological advancements to reduce cost effectively. (21,29−31)

The widespread adoption of alternative fuels is also hindered by a limited infrastructure. In many regions, the availability of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations is inadequate. For instance in India, existing CNG stations are concentrated in few states with demand significantly outpacing supply nearly three times higher than the available stations. (32) The lack of blending facilities for biofuels further limits their availability in the market as many gasoline stations are not equipped to handle biofuel blends, restricting consumer access and acceptance of these fuels. (21) Moreover, the infrastructure required for hydrogen storage and distribution is still underdeveloped. High costs associated with building hydrogen refuelling stations deter investment in this area limiting the market penetration of hydrogen as a fuel. (33−36) As e-fuels gain traction, the need for compatible refueling infrastructure becomes critical. Nevertheless, the current network of refueling stations may not support the anticipated demand for vehicles powered by these alternative fuels. (37−40)

Technological limitations further impede the progress of alternative fuels. Current conversion technologies for producing biofuels from biomass are often inefficient and require further development to enhance the yield and reduce costs. For example, traditional fermentation processes may not effectively utilize all available sugars in biomass feedstocks. (21,26−28) While algal biofuels are touted as a sustainable alternative significant technological advancements are needed to improve cultivation methods and extraction processes to make them commercially viable. (41−43)

Additionally, many existing vehicle engines are not optimized for alternative fuels necessitating significant modifications or the development of new engine technologies that can efficiently use these fuels without compromising performance. (44,45) Finally, there is a need for comprehensive lifecycle assessments to better understand the environmental impacts of various alternative fuels. Current methodologies may not fully account for emissions associated with production processes which could undermine their sustainability claims. (46−48)

To overcome these economic hurdles and enhance sustainable advanced technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology hold significant potential for revolutionizing biofuel production. Biotechnology for instance, offers pathways to optimize biofuel production through the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). (49) For example, researchers have engineered yeast strains to enhance ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, a low-cost and abundant feedstock, thereby reducing production costs. (50,51) Nanotechnology can significantly improve catalysis and separation processes, critical steps in biofuel production. For instance, the use of nanoscale catalysts can enhance the efficiency of transesterification in biodiesel production, reducing reaction times and improving product yields. (52,53) Moreover, nanomaterials offer the potential for developing more efficient membranes for biofuel separation and purification, leading to lower energy consumption and reduced environmental impact. (54−56) The development of these and other effective technologies is crucial to boost productivity, reduce environmental impact, and meet the growing demand for biofuels.

Achieving large-scale deployment of sustainable fuels and their additives by 2050 will require not only technological breakthroughs but also new regulatory frameworks that ensure cost-effective production methods. For example, specific alternative fuels, such as synthetic natural gas (SNG), methanol, and ammonia, present unique challenges and benefits. While these fuels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels they also raise safety concerns and require careful management of their environmental impacts. (57)

It is essential to acknowledge that while biofuels can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions they may also lead to other environmental issues such as acidification, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss if not managed sustainably. (58,59) Additionally, even nonrenewable alternative fuels still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions throughout their lifecycle. The role of alternative fuels and their additives in logistics─across air, land, and sea─also presents commercial, environmental, and operational challenges. For instance, the integration of alternative fuels into existing transportation systems requires addressing infrastructure gaps and ensuring compatibility with current vehicles. Potential solutions include developing hybrid systems that utilize both conventional and alternative fuels to ease the transition. The transition to these fuels and additives necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their potential benefits and the hurdles that must be overcome. This article proposes potential green additives for synthetic and biofuels, which upon meeting the required fuel properties and performance criteria can be considered for use as effective and sustainable fuel additives thereby contributing to the urgent need for cleaner transportation fuels and aligning with global imperatives to achieve net-zero emissions targets.

1.1. Exploring Sustainable Fuel Additives

Sustainable fuel additives derived from renewable resources are crucial in the transportation sector offering environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional fuels. For example, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) improve combustion efficiency and decrease particulate matter emissions, (60,61) while plant-based antioxidants enhance fuel stability. (62,63) Sustainable fuel additives encompass a diverse range of compounds each tailored to specific functions that improve fuel properties and engine performance Table 1 outlines these additives and their purposes.

Sustainable fuel additives optimize fuel characteristics by enhancing combustion efficiency, stability, and engine performance, while reducing harmful emissions. They facilitate clean combustion, improve lubrication, and elevate octane or cetane levels, which are vital for maintaining high fuel quality. Additionally, sustainable fuel additives improve fuel economy by optimizing vehicle performance allowing engines to achieve better results with less fuel consumption this reduction in fossil fuel usage contributes to a lower carbon footprint without requiring extensive modifications to existing internal combustion engines.

As industries seek environmentally friendly solutions to combat climate change, integrating sustainable fuel additives into current fuel systems offers a viable pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing operational efficiency. Advances in additive technology promise further innovation in sustainable fuels, contributing to a cleaner energy future. The development of sustainable fuel additives is driven by innovative technologies and collaboration among academia, industry, and research institutions. Bioengineering advances have enabled novel production methods using waste biomass as feedstock for additive synthesis. Catalytic processes convert agricultural residues into high-performance additives reducing reliance on fossil resources. (64,65) Studies, such as those represented in Figure 1, have demonstrated that the use of green fuel additives can lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions during combustion, while also contributing to enhanced fuel economy by optimizing combustion processes and minimizing energy losses. (66) As regulatory standards become more stringent globally the integration of sustainable additives will be essential in meeting these requirements while advancing toward net-zero emissions goals. (67)

Despite being a rapidly developing field the sustainable fuel additives industry remains in its early stages with widespread adoption still underway. To address this, this Perspective aims to bridge existing gaps by exploring the potential of sustainable fuel additives derived from renewable resources. The primary objective is to ensure that these additives effectively fulfill their functions without compromising the inherent properties of sustainable fuels thereby laying the groundwork for further advancements in sustainable energy solutions.

2.1. Synthetic Fuels and the Need for Additives

Additives are chemical compounds added to a base fuel during manufacturing or through aftermarket supplements to enhance the desirable properties of a particular fuel for specific applications or protect the engine. Fuel additives play a crucial role in enhancing various aspects of engine performance. They contribute to improved fuel economy, overall engine efficiency, and cleanliness. By employing fuel additives, engines can experience a boost in performance metrics such as horsepower, torque, and a quicker response during acceleration. (14,15) These additives effectively prevent the accumulation of deposits in the fuel system, reducing wear and tear, while facilitating smoother acceleration. Moreover, fuel additives enhance the lubricating properties of the fuel, providing protection against wear and potential damage to engine components and thereby reducing instances of fuel pump failure. Additionally, their use helps in reducing carbon deposits on injectors ensuring the consistent and proper spraying of fuel which is essential for maintaining optimal engine performance. (1−5) They are used in both conventional and synthetic fuels but their specific roles may vary. Synthetic fuels, (16,17) also known as alternative or renewable fuels, are gaining prominence as viable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based fuels in the quest for a sustainable energy future. They are classified with respect to their production pathway, scalability, and sustainability as per the following.

Biofuels further can be divided under two categories. (18−60)

a)

Oxygenated biofuels (Bioalcohols and bioesters). (76,77)

b)

Deoxygenated biofuels (namely Bio-ATF, Green LPG, SNG, green gasoline and diesel). (78,79)

Synthetic fuels differ from their traditional petroleum-based counterparts in terms of composition and molecular structure. These variations can have a significant impact on combustion behavior and overall efficiency, posing challenges when using synthetic fuels in engines designed for petroleum-based fuels. Sustainable additives play a pivotal role in bridging this gap, tailoring the properties of synthetic fuels to ensure seamless integration with engines and optimize performance. (14,15) By acting as performance enhancers, additives refine the combustion process and adeptly address specific issues associated with the unique attributes of synthetic fuels.

The significance of additives in synthetic fuels is underscored by their capacity to customize fuel properties to the requirements of modern automobile engines.

Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the different fuel additives which, when used conventionally in transportation fuels result in soil, water, and air pollution, affecting ecosystems and posing health risks. Detergents, oxygenates, and diesel additives have potential carcinogenic effects and can harm aquatic life. The integration of alternative renewable additives is crucial to alleviating these detrimental impacts, ensuring a sustainable approach that safeguards ecosystems, human health, and efficient fuel production while maintaining optimal engine performance. Considering the aforementioned facts, it is of utmost importance to develop green additives for use in synthetic fuel to achieve net-zero emission targets.

Green advances in transportation fuel additives typically focus on reducing emissions and improving the overall environmental impact of vehicles. When comparing them to conventional fuel additives, these eco-friendly alternatives aim to utilize renewable sources, decrease harmful emissions, and promote sustainable transportation fuels. Green additives often involve biobased or renewable additives, such as bioethanol, biodiesel, or synthetic fuels derived from organic waste or renewable resources, aiming to reduce carbon footprint and reliance on fossil fuels. (128,129) The main goal is to contribute to the transition to sustainable transportation by offering cleaner, more efficient, and renewable alternatives for powering vehicles. These innovations tend to focus on decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing pollutants, and promoting a more sustainable energy future.

2.2. Evolution of Fuel Additives: From Lead to Sustainable Solutions

The journey from lead-based additives to cleaner oxygenates, biofuels, hydrogen, and advanced biofuels underscores the industry’s commitment to sustainable and environmentally conscious fuel solutions (Figure 2). Each stage has presented unique innovations and challenges, driving the pursuit of eco-friendly options in the transportation sector.

2.3. Challenges and Preparations for Transition

The transition from conventional fuel sources to sustainable alternatives necessitates meticulous consideration of diverse challenges and preparatory measures. The paradigm shift toward sustainable alternatives demands a comprehensive understanding of both the obstacles inherent in the adoption process and the requisite groundwork for a successful transition. The ensuing (Table 5), featured above, offers a systematic comparative analysis, delineating the intricate web of challenges and the requisite preparations associated with both conventional fuel sources and emerging sustainable alternatives, aiming to facilitate an informed and strategic approach toward this critical energy transition. This table outlines the key challenges faced in transitioning from conventional to sustainable fuels alongside the necessary preparations for improvements between conventional and sustainable fuel alternatives.

There are several advanced characterization techniques continually evolving for assessing sustainable fuel additives (165−167) some of the cutting-edge methods are included below.

Beyond conventional techniques, newer methods and in situ and operando analyses have emerged, offering enhanced surface analysis and real-time monitoring capabilities. However, when these additives are blended into fuels, the need for new analytical methods and specialized equipment arises. Altered properties in blended fuels require specialized devices for real-time in-line monitoring during the blending processes. Innovative mass spectrometry techniques, portable field-deployable devices, and sensor-based systems have become imperative for continual quality assessment, ensuring optimal performance and compliance with regulatory standards in fuel applications.

These advanced techniques offer more comprehensive insights into the chemical, physical, and structural properties of sustainable fuel additives, enabling a deeper understanding of their behavior and performance. The characterization of renewable additives earmarked for integration into both current and forthcoming sustainable fuels holds paramount significance in the realm of eco-friendly energy solutions. As the landscape of sustainable fuels continues to evolve, thorough analysis of these additives becomes increasingly imperative. The comprehensive characterization serves as a linchpin for understanding, fine-tuning, and guaranteeing the efficacy, safety, and regulatory adherence of these additives within fuel formulations.

2.5. Environmental Benefits of Using Sustainable Fuel Additives

Sustainable fuel additives offer a range of environmental benefits including reduced emissions, improved fuel efficiency, and a lower environmental footprint. These additives play a crucial role in making transportation fuels to combat climate change and reduce pollution. The environmental benefits of using sustainable fuel additives are the following. (168)

While both conventional and sustainable fuels benefit from sustainable additives, the extent of emissions reduction and fuel efficiency improvement varies due to inherent fuel properties, compatibility with engines, and their impact on emissions and engine deposits (Table 8). Sustainable fuels often exhibit lower emissions and higher efficiency as a starting point, and the addition of sustainable additives further reinforces their eco-friendly attributes.

3. Green Additives for Synthetic Gasoline

Click to copy section linkSection link copied!

Petroleum gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons that includes alkanes, alkenes, isoalkanes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes, and aromatics. The calorific value of gasoline is 45–48 MJ/kg. Alkenes and aromatics provide traditional gasoline with the desired octane number. However, clean synthetic fuels, which lack aromatics and alkenes, require octane boosters for improvement in fuel efficiency. Table 9 gives an overview of the properties of fossil and synthetic gasoline. (170−174) Oxygenates, such as ethanol, methanol, MTBE, and ETBE are used as octane boosters. However, MTBE has been banned in some countries due to its potential to pollute groundwater.

The following important fuel characteristics need to be considered when oxygenated substances are to be evaluated as gasoline additives: (76,77,99)

Miscibility with gasoline: Oxygenates are generally polar in nature, which may lead to compatibility problems when blended with gasoline.

Energy density: The energy content of oxygenates is lower than gasoline, which may require modifications to fuel injection systems to achieve desired range.

Viscosity: Low viscosity of fuels may cause leakages, while high viscosity may overload the injection system.

Octane number: High octane numbers generally lead to increase ignition delays and higher combustion temperatures, which may increase NOx emissions.

Oxidation stability: Fuel degradation by autoxidation can lead to the formation of insoluble products and deposits in fuel storage tanks, combustion systems, and injection systems. The presence of additives should not reduce oxidation stability of blended gasoline.

Engine load and emission control characteristics: Conventional gasoline emissions mainly comprise of hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The use of oxygenates can reduce HC, CO, and NOx emissions.

Unlike fossil fuels, alcohols used as gasoline blend components pose corrosion due to their hygroscopic nature. To mitigate this issue, corrosion inhibitors are added, depending on the gasoline-alcohol blend ratio.

For dehazing and demulsifying gasohol blends, popular choices include nonionic detergents such as polyethers and sugar-fatty acid esters (Figure 4), formulated in optimized hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) ratios. Among nonionic surfactants, ethylene oxide condensates and polyoxyalkylenepolyols are particularly favored as demulsifiers for fuels. These molecules can be designed with specific molecular weights and solubilities to control the demulsification processes. By reacting ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or butylene oxide with compounds like alkyl phenols, sorbitol, glycerol, or glycol, the desired products can be obtained. The ratio of alkylene oxide in the molecule influences the solubility of the resulting product in water or hydrocarbon.

Anionic surfactants such as alkyl- and dialkylsulfosuccinates also play an important role in achieving effective water separation. Careful selection of a suitable surface-active compound is crucial to ensure adequate water separation in fuel blends. It is convenient to incorporate these additives (typically at concentrations of 5–20 mg/kg) into a multifunctional package containing other performance additives.The effectiveness of demulsifiers in fuels can be evaluated using ASTM D 1094 method. (169) This test method provides a means of assessing the performance of demulsifiers and their ability to separate water from fuel blends. When a demulsifier is introduced into a fuel blend containing water, it adsorbs onto the interface between water and the fuel phase, thereby disrupting the interfacial tension between water and the fuel phase. This action weakens the emulsion stability, causing the water droplets to coalesce. It is important to note that the specific mechanism of demulsification can vary depending on the type of demulsifier used and the composition of the fuel blend. Different demulsifiers may have varying affinities for the water-fuel interface and different abilities to reduce the interfacial tension. This can impact their effectiveness in separating water from fuel blends. (175)

3.1. Biocides (176)

In water-contaminated fuels, the presence of moisture provides a favorable environment for the growth of fungi and bacteria in storage tanks. To prevent such microbial growth, biocides are commonly used as additives. These biocides are compatible with fuels and help to inhibit the proliferation of microorganisms. Some of the most commonly used fuel-compatible biocides include (Figure 5):

Thiazoles: Thiazole compounds, such as benzothiazole and methylbenzothiazole, are effective biocides used to control microbial growth in fuel systems. They exhibit antimicrobial properties and help prevent the formation of biofilms.

Thiocyanates: Thiocyanate compounds, such as sodium thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate, or ammonium thiocyanate, possess biocidal activity against a wide range. of microorganisms. They are often employed as fuel additives to inhibit microbial growth.

Isothiazolins: Isothiazolin compounds, such as methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and benzisothiazolinone (BIT), are commonly used as biocides in various applications, including fuel systems. They exhibit strong antimicrobial properties and help control microbial contamination.

Cyanobutane: Cyanobutane is a biocide that acts against bacteria, fungi, and algae. It is frequently utilized to prevent microbial growth in water-contaminated fuels and storage tanks.

Dithiocarbamates: Dithiocarbamate compounds, such as sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, are effective biocides used to inhibit microbial growth in fuel systems. They possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and are particularly useful in controlling bacterial growth.

It is important to note that the selection and use of biocides should adhere to regulatory guidelines and industry standards to ensure safety, efficacy, and compatibility with the fuel system. The appropriate concentration and application method of biocides may vary depending on the specific fuel type, storage conditions, and extent of microbial contamination.

3.2. Octane Booster Additives (80,81)

When an unburned fuel/air mixture beyond the boundary of the flame front is subjected to a combination of heat and pressure, detonation occur. Detonation is characterized by an instantaneous, explosive ignition of at least one pocket of fuel/air mixture outside of the flame front, producing an audible sound also called “knock”. Operation on fuels of inadequate octane quality produces unwanted noise from detonation and may result in engine damage. Octane booster additives prevent ignition of unburned fuel during the engine’s expansion stroke and therefore prevent knock. Modern spark ignition engines have a typical octane requirement in the range of 90–98 research octane numbers (RON). In general, synthetic gasoline has a higher octane rating than conventional gasoline. This means that they are less likely to knock, which is a harmful preignition phenomenon that can damage an engine. Some renewable octane booster additives that can be blended with conventional gasoline or synthetic gasoline to enhance its octane rating are listed below (Figure 6, Table 10), along with their mode of action.

Renewable octane boosters work by chemically modifying the fuel to improve its combustion characteristics, reduce engine knocking, and enhance overall engine performance, while potentially reducing emissions.

Examples: Ether-based additive for gasoline octane boosting

Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), tert-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) from biobased isobutene can be used as octane booster additive for gasoline. Ethers have high octane values and can be added to gasoline as octane enhancers. Ethers are free of sulfur, olefins, and aromatic molecules. The type of oxygenate, blending ratio, operating circumstances, characteristics of the engine, and many other factors affect emissions reductions.

3.3. Soot Emissions Compression and Antiknock Additives

Soot formation is a major concern of petroleum derived fuels. Soot formation occurs through polymerization of unburnt carbon, and PM 2.5 is designated as potential carcinogen by WHO. Thus, soot emission reduction is becoming important. Presence of oxygenated additive can aid full burning of carbon, reducing soot formation. Transportation liquid fuel components, such as 5-(Ethoxymethyl) furan (5-EMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL) can play a significant role in synthetic gasoline. Figure 7 shows that the etherification reaction between furfural (FA) and ethanol (EtOH) takes place in the presence of a mild acidic catalyst, resulting in the formation of 2-EMF. 2-EMF possesses excellent properties for reducing soot emissions in compression ignition engines. Among them, 2-EMF demonstrates superior antiknock qualities compared to the reference Euro 95 gasoline. (177−182)

4. Green Additives in Synthetic Diesel

Click to copy section linkSection link copied!

Synthetic diesel, also known as renewable diesel or green diesel, is produced through a synthetic process, Gas-to-Liquid (GTL), and Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) technology. This process involves converting feedstocks like biomass, or waste materials into synthesis gas, followed by catalytic polymerization of CO and H2 molecules known as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, resulting in liquid hydrocarbons that mimic the properties of diesel fuel. (183,184) Conventional diesel and synthetic diesel are two distinct types of fuels with notable differences in their compositions (Table 11). Synthetic diesel has similar chemical composition to conventional diesel, but with potential differences in carbon chain lengths and specific hydrocarbon distributions. Synthetic diesel has lower sulfur and aromatic content, resulting in reduced emissions and air pollution. It has a higher cetane number and better ignition quality. Additionally, synthetic diesel offers environmental benefits as it can be produced from renewable feedstocks, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint.

It is important to note that synthetic diesel is still a hydrocarbon-based fuel, and its combustion process and engine compatibility are similar to those of conventional diesel. However, the differences in production methods and fuel composition can result in varying environmental impacts, performance characteristics, and potential for renewable content. For MTBE, ETBE, TAME, and TAEE blending research, the octane number (RON) is 105–123 and motor octane number (MON) 95–105. Renewable diesel can further be broadly classified into three main types (Table 12) each with distinct production processes and feedstocks. FAME-based diesel, also known as biodiesel, is produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats, such as soybean oil, canola oil, and cooking oil. This type of diesel can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel in diesel engines with little or no modification. Green diesel, on the other hand, is produced through hydrotreating, which involves the hydrogenation of triglycerides and other biomass-derived feedstocks, including vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste fats and greases. It has properties very similar to petroleum diesel and can be used interchangeably without engine modifications. Lastly, Fischer–Tropsch (FT) diesel is produced through the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process, converting carbon-rich feedstocks, such as natural gas, coal, biomass, or municipal solid waste, into liquid hydrocarbons. FT diesel is noted for its high energy density and excellent combustion characteristics. These renewable diesel types offer significant environmental benefits over petroleum diesel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particulate matter emissions, and other pollutants while also promoting energy independence by utilizing domestic feedstocks. The choice of feedstock often depends on regional availability, production facilities, and environmental and economic considerations.

Table 11 shows that synthetic diesel may have a lower density, higher cetane index, and lower sulfur content than fossil diesel. Additives can help optimize certain properties, such as improving lubricity, enhancing stability, reducing emissions, cloud point or improve its cold filter plugging point (CFPP) and ensuring compatibility with existing fuel infrastructure and engine requirements. By carefully selecting and incorporating appropriate additives, synthetic diesel can meet the required fuel standards and specifications while performing well in engines.

4.1. Cold Flow Improvers (CFI)

Cold flow additives help prevent the formation of wax crystals and improve the low-temperature operability of diesel fuel. Renewable additives derived from biomass sources, such as biodiesel or renewable diesel, can enhance the cold flow properties of synthetic diesel, preventing fuel gelling and improving fuel flow in cold weather conditions. (185,186)

Renewable cold flow improvers for diesel fuels, whether synthetic or conventional, employ similar modes of action to address the formation of wax crystals and improve the low-temperature performance. Here is an overview of the mode of action of renewable cold flow improvers in diesel.

4.2. Emission Reducers

Certain renewable additives, such as biodiesel and renewable diesel, have been found to reduce emissions of particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and other pollutants. These additives can help improve the environmental performance of synthetic diesel by lowering harmful emissions and promoting cleaner combustion.

Here are a few examples of renewable emission reducers for use in synthetic diesel with their mode of action and a scheme:

(a)

Methoxy ethyl acetate (MEA) and Diethyl ether (DEE): MEA and DEE are renewable oxygenated compound that can be used as an emission reducer in synthetic diesel (Figure 8). It works by reacting with NOx to form nitrogen and water reducing the formation of NOx emissions. (187)

This reaction is very efficient and can reduce NOx emissions by up to 90%.(b)

Oxymethylene ether (OME): Oxymethylene ether (OME) is a low-sooting organic additive for improving the efficiency and reducing the emissions of NOx in alternative diesel fuel. Oxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OMEn) are potential compression ignition fuels or blend components that enable drastic reductions in pollutant formation. OME does this by reacting with NOx to form nitrogen and water, and by forming a protective film on engine components. By combining multiple conversion steps, OMEn can be produced from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) produced using renewable electricity. They can also be produced using methanol from waste biomass. (188−192)

4.3. Anti-Oxidants and Stabilizers

Biobased antioxidants and stabilizers are required to be added to B100 to improve its stability and inhibit oxidation. This helps extend the fuel’s shelf life, prevent degradation, and maintain fuel quality over time.

Here are some examples of renewable antioxidants and stabilizers, along with their mode of action:

It is important to note that the selection and effectiveness of renewable antioxidants and stabilizers can depend on factors such as the specific composition of the synthetic diesel, operating conditions, and desired storage lifespan. Proper formulation and testing are necessary to determine the optimal concentration and combination of these additives for effective antioxidant and stabilization performance.

4.0d. Lubricity Enhancers

Lubricity enhancers are additives that improve the lubricating properties of diesel fuel, reducing wear and tear on engine components. Biobased lubricity enhancers derived from vegetable oils or renewable sources can be added to synthetic diesel to enhance its lubrication performance and protect the engine.

Here are a few examples of renewable lubricity enhancers (Figure 12) with their structure and mode of action that can be added to synthetic diesel:

4.4. Pour Point Depressant

Renewable pour point depressants are additives used in synthetic diesel to lower the pour point temperature, which is the lowest temperature at which the fuel can flow. These additives help to improve the low-temperature operability of the fuel by reducing its viscosity and preventing wax crystal formation.

Here are some examples of renewable pour point depressants along with their mode of action. (197)

The mode of action of renewable pour point depressants involves disrupting the formation, growth, and aggregation of wax crystals that can lead to fuel thickening and poor flow characteristics at low temperatures. (197,198) By modifying the wax crystal structure or inhibiting their growth, these additives allow the fuel to remain fluid and pumpable under cold conditions, enhancing its cold-weather performance (Figure 14).

5. Green Additives in Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Click to copy section linkSection link copied!

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or alternative aviation fuel refers to aviation fuel that is produced from nonpetroleum-based renewable feedstocks. These fuels are designed to be more environmentally friendly compared to conventional aviation fuels, which are typically derived from fossil fuels. Some key differences between synthetic aviation fuel and conventional aviation fuel are given in Table 13. It is important to note that the properties of synthetic aviation fuel can vary depending on the specific production process and feedstock used. Additionally, advancements in technology and ongoing research may lead to further improvements and refinements in the properties of synthetic aviation fuel. SAF needs the addition of certain additives in order to meet the specifications and improve its performance.

5.1. Static Dissipator Additives (SDAs)

When a liquid flows through a pipe, friction between the liquid and the pipe can generate static electricity. This static charge can build up and potentially discharge as a spark, which could ignite fuel vapors or cause other safety hazards. SDAs work by reducing the surface tension of the fuel, which helps to dissipate any static charges that may be present. SDAs are used in aviation fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to reduce the buildup of static electricity during fuel handling and transfer processes. The additives help dissipate static charges and prevent potentially hazardous situations. Here are some examples of potential renewable static dissipator additives for sustainable aviation fuel. (199−202) Some of the most common additives include the following:

One example of a biobased surfactant that can be used as an SDA in SAFs is alkyl polyglucoside (APG) is a type of nonionic surfactant that is derived from glucose and fatty alcohols. (203) The structure of APG consists of a hydrophilic glucose headgroup and a hydrophobic alkyl tail. The length and branching of the alkyl tail can be varied to tune the properties of the surfactant for different applications. APGs have been shown to be effective at reducing the surface tension of fuel and dissipating static charges, making them a promising alternative to SDAs.

5.2. Corrosion Inhibitors

Corrosion inhibitors help to prevent the corrosion of the engine components.

The utilization of biopolymers (Figure 15) as a promising alternative to toxic corrosion inhibitors is regarded as a new trend and an innovative approach for preventing metallic corrosion. One of the primary advantages of these biomacromolecules is their ability to provide an increased number of attachment sites to the metallic substrate, leading to the formation of high-quality films and improved adhesion compared to small molecule inhibitors. This capability can be further enhanced by incorporating additional adsorption sites, such as functional groups, into the backbone of the biopolymers.

On the other hand, these biopolymers possess several desirable characteristics, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, affordability, and nontoxicity. Furthermore, they are readily available and are derived from renewable sources. These remarkable qualities make them well-suited for effectively mitigating metallic corrosion, while also being environmentally friendly.

5.3. Fuel System Icing Inhibitors

Recent guidance issued in January 2025 by the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Agriculture outlines the compliance requirements for claiming and maximizing the credit, highlighting the critical role of third-party verification to ensure accuracy and traceability. Additionally, the guidance provides pathways for producers to increase their credit value through further reductions in carbon intensity.

This article unpacks the verification requirements based on the IRS guidance for transportation fuel and the USDA’s Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) program as they relate to the 45Z tax credit.

Verification for Transportation Fuel Under 45Z

For transportation fuels other than sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), third-party verification is not required to claim the 45Z tax credit. However, voluntary market demands—such as buyers requiring assurance under transferability provisions—may lead producers to seek verification.

For non-SAF fuels utilizing the 45ZCF-GREET model, a Safe Harbor provision is available for those claimants who choose to substantiate their emissions rates. To qualify for this provision, taxpayers must provide the certifier with all inputs into the 45ZCF-GREET model, along with the specific fuel type and category from the applicable emissions rate table and supporting data consistent with SAF certification requirements.

For SAF claimants, third-party certification is mandatory. The IRS requires certification from an independent, qualified certifier to ensure compliance, traceability and accurate lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessments. The SAF certification process includes:

Production and Sales Statements:

• A statement confirming the accuracy of the SAF production process and inputs used to determine lifecycle GHG emissions.

• Verification of the number of SAF gallons sold in a qualifying sale.

Conflict of Interest Declarations:

• The certifier must confirm they have no financial interest in the value of the 45Z credit, no involvement in SAF transactions and no familial or employment ties to the taxpayer.

Qualified Certifier Statement:

• This includes the certifier’s name, contact information, qualifications and a description of their accreditation. If the certifier acts as part of an organization, additional organizational details are required.

Facility Information:

• Information about the qualified facility, including data on metering devices and confirmation of their calibration and accuracy.

• Emissions rate accuracy must be within ±5% or 2 grams of CO2e per mmBTU, whichever is higher.

Supporting Documentation:

• Any additional documentation required by the certifier’s accrediting body and circumstances of the facility.

45Z Transportation Fuel Certifier Accreditations

While certification is mandatory for SAF producers utilizing the 45ZCF-GREET model to determine their emissions rate, non-SAF producers who opt for certification must also use entities accredited by the American National Standards Institute National Accreditation Board or the California Air Resources Board Low Carbon Fuel Standard (CARB LCFS) program.

Alternatively, SAF producers using the CORSIA or CORSIA Actual model to determine their emissions rate must engage a certifier accredited by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), or other International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)-approved sustainability schemes.

USDA’s Interim Rule On Climate-Smart Agriculture

The USDA’s interim rule provides guidelines for quantifying, reporting and verifying GHG reduction benefits from CSA practices. By integrating third-party verification into the biofuel feedstock supply chain, renewable fuel producers can unlock new opportunities to reduce the fuel’s overall carbon CI, resulting in greater value from the 45Z tax credit.

Verification standards for CSA practices ensure the authenticity of net GHG emissions reductions, bolstering credibility and trust, expanding market opportunities for U.S. farmers cultivating biofuel feedstocks.

Verification Requirements

The USDA’s CSA guidelines aim to establish a transparent and accountable system that rewards sustainable practices, further driving the adoption of climate-smart agricultural methods in biofuel production.

Under these guidelines, third-party verification is required at every stage of the supply chain once feedstock leaves the farm. The responsibility for initiating the audit process falls on the first point of aggregation—the first location where the crop is collected after leaving the farm. This could be a storage facility, a processing facility (such as a soybean crushing plant) or a biofuel refinery. From that point onward, audits are mandated at every subsequent transfer of ownership.

Annual Audits:

• All first points of aggregation, intermediary entities and biofuel refiners must undergo annual audits by accredited third-party verifiers.

Farm Audits:

• Farms supplying reduced-CI crops may be selected for audits by the first point of aggregation’s verifier. Selection criteria includes geographic location, crop type, quantity supplied and associated CI values.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cont2_Soil_Sample_4ffa3e0058.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 13:58:13.645342

Beginning this month, the US has implemented a 125% import tariff on Chinese UCO, a move that has already halted most shipments.

China exported a record 3 million metric tons of UCO last year, according to Chinese customs data.

“For now, US arbitrage is shut, and we expect it to stay that way in the medium term,” said Richard Dickinson, head of trading at Shanghai-based Amarus Trading, one of the largest players in the Chinese UCO market.

“Some volumes are being redirected to Europe, as well as to new markets in Asia, including South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and India.”

Industry sources noted that at least four new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plants — relying on UCO as a key feedstock — have recently launched or will come online this year in Thailand, Malaysia and Japan, with a combined annual capacity of over 700,000 metric tons.

UCO exports to the US had already begun to decline late last year after Beijing scrapped export tax rebates and the US introduced a new clean fuel tax credit structure that disincentivises imports.

Both countries, as well as Indonesia, also saw the total private green investments they attracted shrink in 2024.

Last year, private green investments into solar doubled, while investment into improving waste management increased by 60 per cent from 2023.
Scaling up blended finance While climate investments increased in 2024, Southeast Asia has an annual investment gap of US$50 billion by 2030 to reach its decarbonisation goals, noted the report.","Malaysia and Singapore together drew over 60 per cent of the US$8 billion in green investments made in Southeast Asia in 2024, according to a study released on Tuesday by consultant Bain & Company and Singapore state investor Temasek.

The outlay was a 43 per cent increase from 2023’s US$5.6 billion, due to the rise in investments in solar projects as well as spend on renewables-powered data centres.

Malaysia and Singapore have seen sizeable increases in green investments and are on track to meet national targets, but progress has been uneven in other parts of the region, said researchers of the annual Southeast Asia’s Green Economy report.

According to the latest data, although the Philippines’ solar and wind financing expanded and Vietnam saw at least 95 per cent of all its green investments directed to renewable energy, both Southeast Asian nations are lagging in terms of how their national climate goals drive sustainable investment-friendly policies. Both countries, as well as Indonesia, also saw the total private green investments they attracted shrink in 2024.

The Philippines is the only country in the region which has yet to announce a net zero goal, although it has pledged to the United Nations that it will reduce harmful greenhouse gases by 75 per cent by 2030. Vietnam vowed to achieve net zero by 2050, through a conditional emission reduction target of 27 per cent by 2030.

“Over the past decade, the region has demonstrated growing ambition toward sustainable development. Yet, progress has been uneven, and with only five years remaining to meet the critical 2030 climate targets, Southeast Asia s not yet on track to fulfill its climate pledges,” said Dale Hardcastle, partner for Asia Pacific, Bain & Company.

“The opportunity to alter this trajectory is narrowing rapidly, underscoring the urgency for bold, coordinated action at this moment of inflection.”

Malaysia secured financing of US$900 million last year for the initial operation of a 98-megawatt (MW) data centre in the southern state of Johor. Johor has come up with guidelines to encourage future data centres to use renewable energy; it has also rejected applications that do not meet green standards.

The country, which leads the bloc’s energy transformation agenda, also saw a fourfold increase in its solar power investments through solar energy systems. The scheme incentivises property owners to invest in rooftop photovoltaic systems and offset their electricity bills and potentially earn revenue from surplus energy generation.

Private deals in the country into green hydrogen also totalled US$400 million, up from zero in 2023. The particular project in Perak focuses on hydrogen production using solar power technology.

Singapore attracted new funding of about US$320 million for a solar panel manufacturer, along with fuel substitution, hydrogen and waste-to-energy plants investments.

The report authors observed that Indonesia experienced a slowdown in green investments due to a lack of investment in fuel substitution measures, which typically involve replacing a more dirty fuel like gasoline or diesel with a lower-emissions alternative such as natural gas.

Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest emitters, fell behind in meeting its climate targets last year as it was unable to receive favourable funding terms from foreign financiers to phase out coal power, and did not acquire any new clean energy investments, according to the report. But it rebounded before the close of 2024 by attracting funds for a 5GW wind power plant and another 5GW for rooftop solar to be completed by 2030.

The Phiippines was one of those that lead the region in attracting green investments in 2023 but last year, its standing took a plunge when waste management financing it pulled in dropped from US$600 million to none in 2024.

Last year, private green investments into solar doubled, while investment into improving waste management increased by 60 per cent from 2023.

Scaling up blended finance

While climate investments increased in 2024, Southeast Asia has an annual investment gap of US$50 billion by 2030 to reach its decarbonisation goals, noted the report.

Blended finance, which refers to investment funds that combine public or philanthropic capital with private, is emerging as one of the solutions to augment this gap, but it remains constrained by small deal sizes, red tape, and investor mismatch, found the study.

The report authors suggested that blended finance could be scaled through national policy development such as the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate in Indonesia or Singapore’s announcement of its intention to import 6GW of low carbon electricity by 2035. Indonesia had earlier said that SAF needs to be used for all international flights departing from the country from 2027.

Complex transactions and long negotiations due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders can be prevented if standards are harmonised, the authors added. For instance, the Asean Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance has been gaining ground as it serves as a framework for mobilising capital and prioritises high-impact projects that align with global standards.

The gap between investors and local realities must also be addressed. Commercial investors and lenders require regulatory certainty and bankability, while concessional lenders need additional reporting such as impact reporting, which adds to the expenses of projects, said the authors.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/3_MWp_Penang_Bosch_e3YK8Ao.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-05-07 00:57:08.391571

Par Pacific plans to start production from its SAF plant in Kapolei, Hawaii, in the second half of the year, adding 2,000 bbl/d.

EIA forecasts that production of “other biofuels”, including SAF, will more than double by the end of 2025 and increase another 20% next year.

However, SAF adoption remains limited. SAF is expected to still make up less than 2% of the 1.7 MMbbl/d of U.S. jet fuel consumption this year.

Under the programme, Wheels Up charter customers can opt to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel’s lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

“We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programme. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up’s commitment to sustainable aviation,” said Wheels Up’s executive vice president Will Greer.

Delta is part of a consortium that owns 95 percent of Wheels Up.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel made from nonpetroleum feedstocks. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it can be developed from food and yard waste, woody biomass, agricultural waste, cooking oils, animal fats, and algae.

SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modification. Its use can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Wheels Up said SAF is currently too scarce for customers to request and pay for on their flights. By allowing customers to pay toward the procurement of SAF, however, the carrier hopes to increase demand for the fuel.

Last year, Twelve secured a SAF purchase agreement with a large European-based airline company. Under the 14-year contract, Twelve will supply 260 million gallons of SAF to support its five airlines. This long-term agreement, combined with the development of Twelve's first plant, underscores the demand for the company's innovative technology and SAF.

The SAF Twelve plans to produce once its plant becomes operational, is expected to be a lower-carbon alternative fuel with the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

""Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,"" said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures®. ""Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured, providing them with the flexibility to commercialize their technology and grow their operations expediently.""

""United's Sustainable Flight Fund's investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,"" said Nicholas Flanders, co-founder & CEO of Twelve. ""With AirPlant One launching imminently and strong a collaboration with United, we're not just envisioning the decarbonization of air travel—we're actively building it. Because we have the capability to deliver our E-Jet® sustainable aviation fuel at scale, Twelve is proudly creating a realistic pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational demands and climate goals.""

Twelve's advanced technology uses renewable energy to combine carbon captured from air and hydrogen obtained from water into the basic building blocks that make fuels, plastics and other materials. By using renewable electricity, captured carbon and water, the process reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, lowering lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, including the emissions associated with production of fuels and in manufacturing.

Norfolk Southern runs daily service to and from The Virginia Inland Port (VIP) — The Port of Virginia’s intermodal terminal in Front Royal.
How RailGreen works: • Norfolk Southern’s low-carbon biofuel use in locomotives generates RailGreen certificates.
• As customers purchase certificates, Norfolk Southern acquires more biofuel.
Why it matters: A company’s supply chain emissions are the hardest to track and tackle.","The Port of Virginia is collaborating with Norfolk Southern on its new RailGreen program that reduces supply chain emissions for shippers. With the first-of-its-kind emission reduction program for freight rail connecting to the East Coast’s most sustainable port, shippers now have the nation’s first “RailGreen Corridor” to conduct business.

Where is it? Norfolk Southern runs daily service to and from The Virginia Inland Port (VIP) — The Port of Virginia’s intermodal terminal in Front Royal. VIP connects to The Port of Virginia’s terminals in Norfolk Harbor. Cargo owners using Norfolk Southern’s lane can participate in RailGreen and reduce emissions.

How RailGreen works:

• Norfolk Southern’s low-carbon biofuel use in locomotives generates RailGreen certificates.

• Customers purchase certificates to apply toward their supply chain emissions.

• As customers purchase certificates, Norfolk Southern acquires more biofuel.

Why it matters: A company’s supply chain emissions are the hardest to track and tackle. RailGreen makes it possible. The partnership will contribute to a reduction in Scope 3 emissions on the East Coast.

Collaborative effort: RailGreen builds on Norfolk Southern’s sustainable initiatives like increased biofuel, solar power for rail yards, and hybrid locomotives. The Port of Virginia is the East Coast’s first port to power all terminals with 100% clean energy, and cargo moves there with the lowest emissions on the coast.

What powers RailGreen? Blockchain-backed Environmental Attribute Certificates from 123Carbon – the leading, independent book-and-claim platform – ensure each metric ton of reduced emission is tracked to avoid double counting. Third-party validation verifies carbon-reducing activities against international standards.

What they’re saying:

“Rail is already the most sustainable way to transport goods over land, and we’re not resting on that advantage. By working with The Port of Virginia , we’ve created a green-shipping solution for customers transporting goods to and from the coast.” — Ed Elkins, Norfolk Southern EVP & Chief Commercial Officer

“The goal is to provide cargo owners options. With more and more cargo owners emphasizing their interest in modern, cleaner supply chains, this effort goes right to that point.” — Stephen A.

More than three-quarters (76 percent) of the 244 readers who responded reported that their feelings have become more negative.
“The uncertainty and tariff policy of the Trump administration is causing my company to pull back resources — people and spending,” wrote one sustainability manager.
Even those working at companies that have maintained their sustainability efforts report having lost the respect, cooperation and resources they need to do their jobs.
“Corporate sustainability has been an uphill paddle ever since I started 25 years ago,” one professional wrote.","If you’re feeling discouraged, frustrated, uncertain or disheartened, you are hardly alone. Last Wednesday, the 100th day of the Trump administration, we asked the Trellis community how their feelings about working in corporate sustainability have changed over the past year. More than three-quarters (76 percent) of the 244 readers who responded reported that their feelings have become more negative.

“I’m proud and determined but angry and frustrated at how much harder and confusing things have become,” one reader replied to our invitation to explain their response. “We have important work to do, and we collectively don’t have time to slow down and be distracted by dealing with the chaos.”

For some, the changes in government policy spurred powerful emotional reactions.

“I feel like I’m 11 years old again, trying to navigate shaky waters as my parents were constantly fighting,” said a corporate social responsibility reporting manager in Arizona. “I just want to do my job and make the world a place we all deserve to live in.”

Others pointed to financial and career insecurity.

“I’m always in suspense, waiting for the next executive order to stab another knife in the work I’ve dedicated my life to,” wrote one consultant. “I feel constantly under pressure from clients asking how to deal with the new administration’s actions.”

‘More determined than ever’

Of readers who reported more positive (10 percent) or neutral (14 percent) feelings about sustainability work, many described growing resolve in the face of a hostile environment.

“I’m more determined than ever to make sustainable changes and help the movement,” said Dawna Mirante, owner of Refill Mercantile. “We need to counter what the other side is doing, and I’m up for it.” (The respondents were invited, but not required, to publish their names with their comments.)

Others reported feeling better because businesses are adopting a more realistic balance between economic and environmental goals.

“I feel like this is an opportunity to reset — to move away from the often-empty slogans and wish casting (and greenwashing) to try to identify sustainability opportunities that make actual business sense,” said Alan Scheller-Wolf, a professor of operations management at the Tepper School of Business of Carnegie Mellon University.

Many more readers, however, said they were deeply disturbed by the administration’s choice to emphasize increased fossil fuel production over mitigating climate change.

“I love working in sustainability and feeling a sense of purpose from my work, but now I feel so much anxiety that all of the progress and hard work will be undone due to short-sighted and misinformed policy choices,” said a typical comment. “I worry that we will no longer be able to prevent major climate catastrophe.”

The great unraveling

Readers also told us that many companies they work for and do business with have slowed or abandoned their efforts to reduce their climate impact, reacting to uncertain economic prospects and the broader backlash against the ESG movement as well as the administration’s change in environmental policy.

“The uncertainty and tariff policy of the Trump administration is causing my company to pull back resources — people and spending,” wrote one sustainability manager. “It feels like many things I’ve been working on are unraveling or becoming inconsequential.”

The experience of working at companies that are scaling back their sustainability efforts evoked many emotions from readers: Anger and disappointment at their leaders, as well as fear for their own job security.

“As we see the politicization of climate change, the financial outflows to sustainability, growing greenhushing and the flip-flopping of CEOs to cozy up to the president and Elon Musk, it makes me feel like my job and the entire practice is at risk,” one reader wrote.

Even those working at companies that have maintained their sustainability efforts report having lost the respect, cooperation and resources they need to do their jobs.

“Corporate sustainability has been an uphill paddle ever since I started 25 years ago,” one professional wrote. “I had been excited that we had finally built legitimacy and momentum, but now I feel like there are forces deliberately trying to sink the boat. “",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sisyphus-SS-.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 11:56:28.726778

This investment by the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund follows Twelve’s $83 million Series C funding round and project financing for its first SAF production facility, AirPlant™ One, located in Moses Lake, Washington. The facility is expected to begin production this year and plans to produce 50,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Last year, Twelve secured a SAF purchase agreement with a large European-based airline company. Under the 14-year contract, Twelve will supply 260 million gallons of SAF to support its five airlines. This long-term agreement, combined with the development of Twelve’s first plant, underscores the demand for the company’s innovative technology and SAF.

The SAF Twelve plans to produce once its plant becomes operational, is expected to be a lower-carbon alternative fuel with the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures®. “Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured, providing them with the flexibility to commercialize their technology and grow their operations expediently.”

“United’s Sustainable Flight Fund’s investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,” said Nicholas Flanders, co-founder & CEO of Twelve. “With AirPlant One launching imminently and strong a collaboration with United, we’re not just envisioning the decarbonization of air travel—we’re actively building it. Because we have the capability to deliver our E-Jet® sustainable aviation fuel at scale, Twelve is proudly creating a realistic pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational demands and climate goals.”

Twelve’s advanced technology uses renewable energy to combine carbon captured from air and hydrogen obtained from water into the basic building blocks that make fuels, plastics and other materials. By using renewable electricity, captured carbon and water, the process reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, lowering lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, including the emissions associated with production of fuels and in manufacturing.

UAV Sustainable Flight Fund

The UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM is a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to leverage support from cross-industry businesses in order to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel. The fund is comprised of more than $200 million in investment commitments from United and corporate partners including: Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Aircastle (a Marubeni & Mizuho Leasing Company), American Express Global Business Travel, Aviation Capital Group, Boeing, Boston Consulting Group, Embraer, GE Aerospace, Google, Groupe ADP, Hawaiian Airlines, HIS, Honeywell, JetBlue Ventures, Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking, Safran Corporate Ventures, and Technip Energies, among others.

Located at the Bangchak Phra Khanong Refinery in Bangkok, the new SAF Production Unit is operated by BSGF Company Limited, an affiliate of Bangchak Corporation.
In addition to SAF, the facility generates bio-LPG and bio-naphtha as by-products and is currently undergoing performance testing.
The facility arrives at a critical time, as SAF gains momentum globally for its ability to reduce aviation-related CO₂ emissions by up to 80%.
Bangchak is also preparing to implement a Book & Claim system to support carbon offsetting by passengers and airlines.","Bangchak Group has launched Thailand’s first dedicated production facility for 100% neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a major step towards low-carbon aviation in Southeast Asia. Located at the Bangchak Phra Khanong Refinery in Bangkok, the new SAF Production Unit is operated by BSGF Company Limited, an affiliate of Bangchak Corporation.

The fully integrated facility is the first in Thailand to manage the entire value chain—from feedstock procurement to product distribution—under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme. With an initial capacity of one million litres per day, the plant uses hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology to convert used cooking oil and other bio-based feedstocks into high-quality jet fuel that meets ASTM standards.

Bangchak collaborated with Desmet of Belgium, a leader in pretreatment technologies, and UOP Honeywell of the United States, known for its hydroprocessing systems, to ensure performance and quality across all production stages. In addition to SAF, the facility generates bio-LPG and bio-naphtha as by-products and is currently undergoing performance testing.

Group Chief Executive and President Chaiwat Kovavisarach said the launch reflects Bangchak’s transformation from a renewable energy leader to a pioneer of next-generation fuels. The company has been active in biofuels for more than two decades and introduced biodiesel to the Thai market as early as 2004. Through initiatives such as the “Fry to Fly” campaign, Bangchak collects used cooking oil from the public at more than 290 service stations nationwide, with plans to reach 2,000 locations by year-end.

The facility arrives at a critical time, as SAF gains momentum globally for its ability to reduce aviation-related CO₂ emissions by up to 80%. Regulatory mandates for SAF blending are already in place in the EU, UK, and Singapore, and Thailand is considering its own mandate.

ATLANTA, May 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Wheels Up Experience Inc. (NYSE: UP), a global leader in private aviation, today announced the launch of its new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative are able to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, ultimately allowing private fliers to participate regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel's lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to 'fly on SAF' has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up's program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up's charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation's carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented:

""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up's commitment to sustainable aviation.""

Charlotte Lollar, Director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, added:

""We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta's SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we're able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions - even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.""

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel's lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to 'fly on SAF' has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up's program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up's charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation's carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented:

""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up's commitment to sustainable aviation.""

Charlotte Lollar, Director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, added:

""We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta's SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we're able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions - even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.""

WASHINGTON, May 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) released a request for proposal (RFP) to increase the supply of next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), including power-to-liquids and those using advanced bio-based feedstocks. This first-of-its-kind aggregated SAF procurement is designed to deliver a much-needed boost to scalable long-term SAF production capacity. By focusing the RFP on next-gen fuels, SABA seeks to channel investment toward SAF with fewer feedstock constraints than today's commercially available fuels, enabling more effective long-term decarbonization of the aviation sector.

SABA members include over 35 companies from a broad range of sectors, including finance, technology, media and entertainment, business consulting, and others seeking to reduce their aviation emissions through investment in sustainable aviation fuel. Through this RFP, SABA will facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final investment decision (FID) for a new next-generation SAF production facility.

""The SAF market is growing rapidly but the technologies we need to fully decarbonize the aviation sector are still in their infancy,"" said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat. ""Investment needs to happen now if we want these technologies to scale post-2030 and keep the aviation sector on track to meet its long-term net zero goals.""

SAF represents the best near-term opportunity to decarbonize aviation as it is a drop-in fuel that can be used in today's aircraft fleet. Despite significant recent growth, SAF still makes up less than 1% of total aviation fuels used today with the market dominated by SAF made from traditional feedstocks, such as waste oils, that face limitations to scale beyond 2030. SAF with the greatest scalability potential, using feedstocks such as renewable hydrogen, agriculture and forestry residues, and municipal solid waste, is only a small portion of the currently available SAF. Without focused investment today, these fuels may not be available in the quantities needed to meet global decarbonization objectives.

SABA is working with its corporate partners to generate the demand signal needed to give advanced SAF producers confidence to scale production. Through a book and claim model, corporate customers will be purchasing sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) that allow them to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on. The travelers' investment allows them to make a greenhouse gas emissions reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator.

""Book and claim is the bridge between the aviation industry's sustainable fuel ambitions and scalable real-world production — and SABA is helping build it,"" said Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at SABA co-founder RMI. ""By mobilizing corporate demand and catalyzing investment in cutting-edge fuel production, we can fast-track innovation, expand high-integrity supply, and deliver the climate results the aviation sector urgently needs.""

Since SABA's launch in 2021, it has helped channel approximately $200 million total SAF investment: first through a 2021 proof of concept pilot procurement for a short-term offtake period, followed by 2023-2024's groundbreaking multi-year procurement involving 27 participants and supporting approximately 50 million gallons of SAF. Through the RFP announced today, SABA is targeting longer-term offtakes to help plants get to FID by 2026 and be operational by 2030.

""This RFP is an opportunity for corporate leaders, forward-looking airlines and next generation fuel producers to work together toward a truly net-zero aviation sector,"" said Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President at Environmental Defense Fund, a SABA co-founder. ""We must be strategic in how we grow the SAF market with environmental integrity so that we can decarbonize the aviation sector without placing new demands on limited feedstocks or land resources that may create new environmental problems.""

By participating in this next-gen procurement, SABA members will be able to meet their emission reduction targets for air travel and air freight through advanced purchases of SAFc connected to next-gen SAF meeting SABA's rigorous sustainability criteria.

SAF suppliers interested in responding to the RFP are encouraged to learn more by downloading the RFP and supporting documentation.

While the RFP announced today is focused on next generation SAF, SABA continues to support its members in purchasing high-integrity commercially available SAF.

Must-reads on ImpactAlpha

Galvanize’s Tom Steyer on why now is a good time for climate investors with cash (Q&A). As the US dismantles its leadership on climate action at least one committed climate investor smells a buying opportunity. “If there’s a big supplier of capital who has decided, ‘I’m out,’ that’s a good thing,” Tom Steyer, the billionaire turned presidential candidate turned climate tech investor at Galvanize Climate Solutions told ImpactAlpha’s David Bank in his San Francisco office. Hear him out.

How digitalization is – and isn’t – helping small businesses in emerging markets. A survey of 4,000 informal and small businesses in Delhi, Lagos, Addis Ababa, Jakarta and São Paulo suggests that “digital tools can help local low-income businesses survive climate shocks, economic disruptions and rising trade barriers,” says Edoardo Totolo of Accion’s Center for Financial Inclusion. The caveat: “Many of these platforms remain ill-suited to the realities of low-margin enterprises.” Learn more.

Hidden champions: The case for selective green hushing. Facing political headwinds in the US, leading European asset owners are embracing a strategy of “selective green-hushing” – limiting their disclosures to receptive stakeholders while continuing environmental, social and governance practices, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion strategies, explains Johannes Lenhard in VentureESG’s latest column for ImpactAlpha.

,,2025-05-06 10:40:48+00:00,Policy Circle,India's booming aviation industry masks deep structural problems | Policy Circle,Vijyapu Prasanna Kumar,,,,,https://www.policycircle.org/opinion/aviation-industry-india/,"However, despite the impressive recovery and rapid expansion, the aviation industry continues to face severe structural, financial, and operational headwinds that threaten its long-term viability.

India’s aviation industry is at a crossroads—buoyed by rising demand yet constrained by persistent inefficiencies.
With smart policymaking, infrastructure investments, and environmental responsibility, the aviation industry can become not just a domestic success story, but a global one.","The liberalisation of India’s economy in the early 1990s—characterised by policies of liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation—opened the skies to private airlines, ushering in a new era of growth in both domestic and international air travel. Today, India is the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, behind only the United States and China. The post-pandemic rebound has been robust, with India overtaking Brazil and Indonesia in passenger traffic. However, despite the impressive recovery and rapid expansion, the aviation industry continues to face severe structural, financial, and operational headwinds that threaten its long-term viability.

Indian aviation industry’s ascent began in earnest when private carriers were permitted to compete with the state-owned Air India. The entry of low-cost carriers like IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Go First democratised air travel, bringing it within reach of India’s burgeoning middle class. By the early 2000s, passenger numbers had surged, driven by rising incomes, rapid urbanisation, and airport upgrades. But this expansion came with cracks.

The 2019 collapse of Jet Airways, once India’s largest private airline, was a wake-up call. Strained by mounting debt, high fuel costs, and the global grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets, Jet’s bankruptcy revealed the fragility beneath the sector’s growth story. The COVID-19 pandemic deepened the crisis: capacity was slashed, employees furloughed, and fare caps imposed—upending revenue models across the board. Yet, recovery is now underway. IndiGo is expanding aggressively, while Air India, now under the Tata Group, is staging a long-awaited revival. But the sector’s core problems remain unresolved.

READ I India’s electronics manufacturing push needs policy stability

Bleeding cash in a high-cost industry

Aviation is among the most capital-intensive industries in the world, and Indian carriers face especially acute cost pressures.

Aviation turbine fuel constitutes 40–50% of airline operating costs. With India importing over 80% of its crude oil, global price fluctuations hit hard. To compound matters, ATF is subject to steep state taxes—up to 30%—making it among the most expensive jet fuels globally.

Most airlines operate on wafer-thin margins and rely heavily on debt to finance fleet expansion. The financial implosions of Jet Airways and Go First illustrate the perils of overleveraging. FY2024 saw collective industry losses of Rs 11,600–13,200 crore ($1.4–1.6 billion), despite a duopolistic market dominated by IndiGo and Air India.

India’s inadequate maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities force carriers to send aircraft abroad—to Singapore, the UAE, or Europe—raising costs and grounding aircraft for longer periods. High GST (18%) on MRO services and the lack of incentives discourage domestic investment, despite India’s clear potential as an MRO hub.

Regulatory and infrastructure bottlenecks

Nearly 40% of Indian airspace is under military control, leading to circuitous flight paths that increase fuel burn and operating costs.

Metro airports like Mumbai and Delhi are bursting at the seams. Mumbai, operating with a single runway, handles over 45 flights an hour—well above optimal capacity—causing delays and safety risks.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) faces criticism for inadequate enforcement and safety lapses. Operational inefficiencies—from baggage mishandling to avoidable delays—diminish consumer confidence.

The shortage of trained pilots, cabin crew, and technicians is another growing concern. With pilot training costs reaching Rs 1 crore, the talent pipeline remains constrained. Meanwhile, intense competition and stressful working conditions fuel attrition and wage inflation.

While aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, India’s rapidly growing passenger numbers threaten to push that share higher. The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is key to decarbonising the sector, but uptake remains sluggish. SAF currently costs 3–5 times more than conventional jet fuel, and India lacks large-scale domestic production. Most supply is imported.

The way ahead

Without targeted subsidies or blending mandates, there is little incentive for airlines to switch. In the absence of clear policy direction, SAF adoption remains aspirational rather than actionable. To secure the sector’s long-term future, India must tackle its challenges head-on through targeted reforms and collaborative policymaking.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Build a domestic MRO ecosystem: Reducing GST on MRO services and offering tax breaks can attract private investment. Public-private partnerships should be leveraged to establish India as a competitive MRO hub.

Rationalise fuel pricing: Bringing ATF under GST would harmonise pricing across states and reduce input costs. Airlines should also adopt fuel hedging strategies to cushion volatility.

Expand infrastructure and airspace: Accelerating the UDAN scheme will decongest metros and improve regional connectivity. Phased release of military airspace to civilian use could streamline routing and lower fuel consumption.

Drive sustainability: Scaling up SAF production—using ethanol, non-edible oils, and waste-derived feedstock—should be a policy priority. Airlines must also invest in fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo or Boeing 787 to reduce emissions.

Strengthen regulation: The DGCA needs to modernise its oversight regime through data-driven audits and AI-based monitoring systems. Enhanced enforcement will be key to restoring public trust and operational reliability.

India’s aviation industry is at a crossroads—buoyed by rising demand yet constrained by persistent inefficiencies. The resilience shown in the post-pandemic phase offers hope, but hope alone is not a strategy. Without structural reforms, the sector risks being caught in a cycle of boom and bust.

With smart policymaking, infrastructure investments, and environmental responsibility, the aviation industry can become not just a domestic success story, but a global one. The skies are promising, but only decisive action will allow this industry to truly take flight.

Delhi International Airport Limited

Videh Kumar Jaipuriar has been nominated for his exemplary leadership in managing and navigating Delhi International Airport (DEL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. He led multiple initiatives to ensure business continuity at DEL, which included passenger safety and convenience, stakeholder management, cash conservation, adoption of new technologies, and care for environment and employee safety.

He proactively engaged with the government stakeholders and supported them in safeguarding aviation through strong confidence building measures for travellers, such as developing several indigenous technology solutions like air circulation with six changes per hour and a combination of UV and plasma disinfection systems to provide safest journey experience to their passengers. Under his leadership, DEL has been forefront of implementing safety measures which was later adopted across the country.

Despite lockdown, Jaipuriar ensured that DEL was operational for rescue missions, medical evacuations, and transporting medical essentials to various parts of the country. He further led the Vande Bharat Mission flights of Government of India (a rescue mission to get Indians back to India), as well as rescue flights by other international governments. His outstanding leadership across all areas across the stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem and going beyond the call of duty in managing and navigating this crisis for a national capital airport having national importance makes him the apt choice for the Person of the Year Award.

CEO

Hajj and Umrah Airport – Jeddah – KSA

Adnan Saggaf continues to demonstrate strong leadership skills throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and brought out of the box ideas in attracting traffic and to support his team during this difficult time. With new innovative ideas in balancing cash flow, the facilities were kept maintained and the personal were kept employed.

Saggaf has protected the financial stability of his staff income, ensured valuable cost cutting management, shown excellent performance of crisis management, and exceptional negotiation skills shown with authority regarding agreement restructuring and receivable payments.

To handle the loss of Umrah traffic to the airport, Saggaf chose to attract new airlines, mainly LCCs, to use the terminal with attractive offers and more reliable services. He built a new strategy by diversifying the airport offers. He prepared the facilities by deploying new technology and working on enhancing passenger experience. Saggaf also initiated a capacity building programme for the airside team by drafting SOPS, training and coaching, as well as initiating dedicated workshops to discuss ideas and to deploy new initiatives.

Leaders show strength in difficult times, and this is exactly what Saggaf showed and why he deserves to be awarded as the Person of the year 2021.

Head of Operations, Safety and Emergency

Belo Horizonte International Airport

Robson Freitas has developed and led the BH Airport plan for the resumption of airport operations post-COVID-19, as well as being responsible for leading the group of Directors and Managers at the airport, defining the three main pillars of recovery: Health and Safety of People, Institutional and Integrated Communication and Institutional Partners. These central pillars include ensuring hygiene and health and social distances measures for passengers, users, and the airport community, in addition to participating in strategic committees involving the public sectors to comply with regulatory rules. Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Chief Strategy Development Officer

Bangalore International Airport Limited

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raghunath worked closely with all the aero concessionaires and cargo operators to minimise disruption and provide financial relief to them. The airline marketing team helped launch a historic first route to the U.S. West Coast and the cargo team at BIAL also achieved record numbers over this period, with the airport becoming India’s leading airport for the export of perishables. Despite the impact of COVID-19, Raghunath has led a digital transformation and expansion at BIAL airport, with new initiatives and the deployment of the fully biometric-based self-boarding solution for seamless passenger flow and travel experiences and a process automation and analytics platform. These initiatives amongst many others, meant that the airport won ACI World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative, which recognised BIAL airports efforts to prioritise their customers during COVID-19. Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Chief Executive Officer

Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport.

SHAH ALAM, May 6 — The organisation of multiple growth sectors under a unified platform at the Selangor International Business Summit (SIBS) 2025 allows the state to present a more holistic economic narrative and enhance its appeal to cross-sector investors.

State executive councillor for investment, trade and mobility Ng Sze Han noted that this year’s summit, to be held in October, will feature two new components — the Selangor Care Economy Summit and the rebranded Selangor Aerospace Summit (SAS).

The move is part of the state government’s strategy to strengthen key economic ecosystems.

“The inclusion of the Selangor Care Economy Summit marks the sector’s formal recognition under SIBS 2025 as a new growth area.

“At the same time, the aerospace segment has been restructured to support the industry’s full value chain through the newly named Selangor Aerospace Summit,” Ng said in a Facebook post today.

SIBS 2025 returns to a single-week format from October 8 to 11 at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, following its two-part series last year. It will be part of the Asean Summit, and targets over 700 booths, 50,000 visitors and a potential transaction value of RM10 billion.

The Selangor Care Economy Policy, introduced earlier this year, aims to support family members caring for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, while developing the caregiving workforce and infrastructure.

The policy is anchored on five strategic pillars – regulation, professional training, public-private investment partnerships, innovation, and public education — and sets the foundation for a sustainable care ecosystem.

The inaugural Selangor Care Economy Summit will gather experts in healthcare, social welfare, and community development to shape long-term strategies. It will also showcase flagship initiatives such as MamaKerja, which supports mothers returning to the workforce, and Impak, a programme that has trained over 900 informal caregivers.

Meanwhile, the SAS, formerly known as the Selangor Aviation Show, will transition to an indoor, conference-style format.

First launched in 2021, the event previously featured static aircraft displays at the open-air SkyPark Regional Aviation Centre in Subang.

The new format will focus on trade visitors and industry development, with an emphasis on general and business aviation, especially in maintenance, repair and operations. It will also feature forums on talent development and sustainability, including initiatives to support the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

Other than the Selangor Care Economy Summit and SAS, SIBS 2025 will feature four major events — the 11th Selangor International Expo (Food and Beverage), 5th Selangor Investment and Industrial Park Expo, 9th Selangor Asean Business Conference, and the 10th Selangor Smart City and Digital Economy Convention.",https://selangorjournal.my/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1000453096-e1746504526861.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 06:56:09.910774

This will represent an estimated abatement of at least one million tonnes of greenhouse gases, said both companies in a joint statement on Tuesday (May 6).

The partnership was structured to mobilise capital towards high-integrity climate solutions, enhance market transparency and strengthen trust in global carbon credit systems, it added.

Tencent and GenZero said they will prioritise projects in areas where finance is most needed, while also ensuring that the projects deliver co-benefits such as improved livelihood for the local communities near where the projects are implemented.

The carbon credits generated will be from projects that have been verified by international carbon standards developed by Verra or Gold Standard or the carbon crediting mechanism set out in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement – a global treaty seeking to keep global warming under 1.5 deg C by 2050.

This is to ensure that the carbon credits purchased ensure real, measurable, and verifiable emissions reductions and removals.

Both companies said that a core focus of this partnership is to enhance transparency and rebuild trust in international carbon markets. Criticisms over the integrity of carbon credits over the last few years have been plaguing the growth of the market.

Tencent and GenZero will try to de-risk carbon projects by conducting pre-feasibility studies, and strengthen market integrity by deploying monitoring, reporting and verification technologies..

Both parties will also continue to explore opportunities to invest in and scale climate solutions by leveraging their respective networks to identify promising investment prospects that could benefit from co-investment, read the release.

Frederick Teo, GenZero’s chief executive officer, said that its partnership with Tencent will encompass all three of its core investment areas, which are nature-based solutions, technology-based solutions and carbon ecosystem enablers.

Xu Hao, vice-president of Tencent’s sustainable social value organisation, said: “Leveraging our digital capabilities and GenZero’s expertise, we aim to enhance carbon market transparency, promote innovative climate technologies, and deploy blended finance models to accelerate global transition to net zero.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a4416368c326bd023e780cef24032687d19214116a4b9ac3ab27221d6c0a6e62?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-05-06 04:56:07.982406

The report by Brussels-based T&E on UK aviation emissions notes almost one million flights departed UK airports last year, releasing 34.1 million tonnes of CO2 – 95% of the emissions in 2019 – and it argues the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) “is failing to regulate” these.
In Europe, airlines paid an estimated £2.7 billion in ETS charges last year as emissions hit 98% of the 2019 level.
Anna Krajinska, T&E UK director, urged the government to extend the scope of the UK scheme “to ensure airlines pay the true cost of their pollution and raise badly needed revenue”.
T&E also called for non-CO2 impacts on climate to be incorporated into the UK ETS, suggesting the scheme has fallen behind the EU’s since Brexit.","CO2 emissions from UK-departing flights are forecast to exceed 2019 levels this year, making London a European emissions “hotspot”, according to a report by transport and environment group T&E.

It highlights the fact that six of the 10 “most-polluting” routes in Europe depart from London, with flights to New York topping the list and departures to Dubai and Singapore in second and third place.

Flights from London to Los Angeles, Doha and Hong Kong also appear in the top 10, with no other airport in Europe appearing more than once.

The report by Brussels-based T&E on UK aviation emissions notes almost one million flights departed UK airports last year, releasing 34.1 million tonnes of CO2 – 95% of the emissions in 2019 – and it argues the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) “is failing to regulate” these.

It suggests the government could raise “millions in revenues” by extending the ETS, which only applies to domestic flights and those to the European Economic Area, excluding 83% of emissions.

T&E calculates airlines paid £210 million under the UK ETS last year and extending the scheme would increase this to £1.2 billion, saying some of the revenue could be used “to kick-start” sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the UK.

In Europe, airlines paid an estimated £2.7 billion in ETS charges last year as emissions hit 98% of the 2019 level.

However, T&E estimates the EU ETS would have raised £6.5 billion (€7.5 billion) by eliminating allowances and extending the scheme to flights beyond Europe.

Anna Krajinska, T&E UK director, urged the government to extend the scope of the UK scheme “to ensure airlines pay the true cost of their pollution and raise badly needed revenue”.

T&E also called for non-CO2 impacts on climate to be incorporated into the UK ETS, suggesting the scheme has fallen behind the EU’s since Brexit.

It noted “the EU has begun phasing out free allowances” and an EU review of the scheme in 2026 could “expand the scope to all departing flights”, and urged the UK to “consider a similar revision”.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/077/shutterstock-aircraft-emissions.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 04:56:15.793249

Utilizing specially designed Airbus A350-1000s, the flights will accommodate 238 passengers across four classes, with a focus on premium comfort.

Qantas Airways is set to redefine long-haul air travel with the launch of its groundbreaking ""Project Sunrise"" in 2027. This ambitious initiative will introduce the world's longest non-stop commercial flights, connecting Sydney directly to London and New York. Spanning approximately 17,800 kilometers, the Sydney-London route is expected to take around 20 hours, marking a significant milestone in aviation history.

The Airbus A350-1000, which has been particularly designed to handle ultra-long-haul flights, is the foundation of Project Sunrise. 238 passengers in four classes—First, Business, Premium Economy, and Economy—will be able to travel on each aircraft. Notably, premium seating takes up more than 40% of the cabin, guaranteeing increased comfort on lengthy flights.

First-class suites will feature individual cabins with a 32-inch entertainment screen, a closet, a bed, and a recliner chair. Additional legroom and ergonomic seats will be available in Premium Economy and Economy classes, while business-class travelers may anticipate lay-flat mattresses with privacy walls. To lessen the impacts of extended air travel, a special ""Wellbeing Zone"" will be available to all passengers, offering areas for movement, stretching, and refreshment.

Combating jet lag

Recognizing the difficulties associated with long journeys, Qantas has worked with experts from the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney to create methods to reduce jet lag. These consist of specially designed lighting patterns for the cabin, tryptophan-rich meals to encourage sleep, and supervised in-flight workouts. To promote passenger mobility and circulation, the Wellbeing Zone will have stretch grips, contoured wall panels, and on-screen workout routines.

Operational considerations

To maintain daily services on these routes, Qantas requires a minimum of three Airbus A350-1000 aircraft, with deliveries expected to commence in late 2026. The airline has been facing quite a few delays due to various regulatory requirements necessitating design modifications for extended fuel capacity. However, despite these challenges, Qantas remained committed to launching Project Sunrise in early 2027.

While Project Sunrise promises unparalleled convenience, it also brings economic and environmental considerations. Operating ultra-long-haul flights is resource-intensive, with increased fuel consumption due to the weight of additional fuel required for non-stop journeys. Qantas aims to offset these factors by utilizing more fuel-efficient aircraft and exploring sustainable aviation fuel options. Ticket prices for these routes are anticipated to carry a premium, reflecting the enhanced services and operational costs involved.

Project Sunrise represents a significant leap forward in connecting distant parts of the globe, effectively shrinking travel time between continents. By eliminating stopovers, Qantas offers passengers a more streamlined and comfortable travel experience. As the airline prepares to embark on this ambitious venture, Project Sunrise stands as a testament to innovation and the evolving landscape of global air travel.

Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, on May 1 introduced legislation that aims to retroactively extend the $1-per-gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC) and the second-generation biofuel producer tax credit, which provides up to $1.01 per gallon for eligible fuels.
Both tax credits expired at the end of 2024 and have been replaced by the technology-neutral 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which came into effect this year.
It would also allow time for the Trump administration to propose and finalize regulations implementing the 45Z credit.
Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners.
So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”","Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, on May 1 introduced legislation that aims to retroactively extend the $1-per-gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC) and the second-generation biofuel producer tax credit, which provides up to $1.01 per gallon for eligible fuels.

Both tax credits expired at the end of 2024 and have been replaced by the technology-neutral 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which came into effect this year. The Treasury Department’s delay in releasing full 45Z guidance, however, is negatively impacting U.S. biofuel producers. The bill, H.R. 3079, aims to provide more certainty to biofuel producers by enacting a two-year extension of the expired tax credits. Language included in the bill would prevent taxpayers from claiming both the 45Z and legacy credits for the same gallon of fuel.

The BTC provides up to $1 per gallon for eligible biobased diesel fuels, including renewable diesel. The second-generation biofuel producer tax credit provides up to $1.01 per gallon for eligible fuels produced from cellulosic or algae-based feedstocks, including cellulosic ethanol produced from corn kernel fiber.

“Biodiesel is a homegrown resource that can support our long-term energy independence and support farmers, producers, and energy workers right here in Ohio,” Carey said. “With America’s energy dominance at stake, we’re working to strengthen our supply of biodiesel for years to come.”

“Iowa’s biofuels production fuels America and powers our economy,” Miller-Meeks said. “Iowa producers need market certainty to continue producing affordable, low-emissions forms of energy. I am thankful for Rep. Carey’s collaboration on this commonsense bill which will lower energy costs and emissions, and promote the production of biofuels to further President Trump’s America First agenda for energy dominance. I look forward to getting this bill to his desk.”

The bill has earned support from the American Trucking Associations, Clean Freight Coalition, Energy Marketers of America, Illinois Soy Association, National Association of Convenience Stores, National Energy & Fuels Institute, NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops, Renewable Fuels Association, Sustainable Advanced Biofuels Refiners, SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers, National Tank Truck Carriers, and Truckload Carriers Association.

“The expiration of the biodiesel blenders tax credit (40A) along with the lack of implementing regulations on Section 45Z have effectively shut the biodiesel industry down for all of 2025, with no end in sight,” said Joe Jobe, CEO of the SABR Coalition. “This bill to extend 40A would turn the markets back on immediately because the implementing regulations for 40A are already in place and the markets understand them.”

According to the SABR Coalition, the two-year tax credit extension proposed by the legislation would provide time for Congress to fix fundamental flaws in the 45Z credit. It would also allow time for the Trump administration to propose and finalize regulations implementing the 45Z credit.

“The biodiesel industry is in a world of hurt,” Jobe said. “It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down. Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners. And those fuel distributors can’t sell their fuel to truck-stop operators, and glycerin refiners can’t sell their refined material to numerous, wideranging industries that rely on it for their products, including sewage treatment plants that use glycerin and enzymes in their water treatment processes. So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Mike_Carey2025_1feaa47f12.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 02:56:37.307938

Today, the Portuguese sustainable finance platform in Spain and Canada has closed a new investment round of €2.9M.
From €5 to SDGs: How Goparity empowers everyday sustainable investors Goparity was founded in Lisbon in 2017 by Nuno Brito Jorge, Manuel Nery Nina, and Luis Couto.
Goparity democratises access to sustainable finance by connecting investors with projects that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This framework enables efficient micro-investment management, allowing people to start investing in sustainable projects with just €5.","Traditional financial systems often prevent everyday individuals from investing in initiatives that create a positive social and environmental impact. Sustainable investing is typically accessible only to large institutional investors or wealthy individuals, leaving most people with limited options to align their finances with their values. Goparity breaks down these barriers by enabling anyone to contribute as little as €5 (or similar small amounts in other markets). This approach allows a broader population to fund initiatives that support the United Nations’ SDGs.

Today, the Portuguese sustainable finance platform in Spain and Canada has closed a new investment round of €2.9M. The round was led by 3XP Global through its Impact Innovation Fund, with support from Mustard Seed Maze, Schneider Electric, Energy Access, Regenerative.eco, and InvestEco Capital Corp as institutional investors, whose combined contribution exceeded €2.4 million.

This marked the second time the Portuguese startup opened an investment round to its investor community through an equity crowdfunding campaign (via Crowdcube). The campaign allowed individuals to invest under the same terms as institutional investors. The campaign attracted over 800 private investors, who contributed €470,000.

Nuno Brito Jorge, CEO and co-founder of Goparity, says: “Completing a capital round for a purpose-driven company like ours in such a challenging international context, while bringing together diverse national and international reference investors with our community, is the best validation we could have. In 2024, we had our best year, and we’re likely to surpass €50 million in investments by mid-2025.”

“Impact investing is now more crucial than ever. In just six weeks, between December 2024 and January 2025, the six largest banks in America and four of the largest banks in Canada left the UN’s Net Zero Banking Alliance. We’ll keep working to direct money where it can make a difference through positive impact on people and the planet,” he added.

From €5 to SDGs: How Goparity empowers everyday sustainable investors

Goparity was founded in Lisbon in 2017 by Nuno Brito Jorge, Manuel Nery Nina, and Luis Couto. The founders merged their expertise in renewable energy, technology, finance, and marketing, united by their commitment to sustainability and ethical finance. They created Goparity after struggling to find an ethical bank for their deposits. This challenge inspired them to build a platform that helps people invest in ways that create positive social and environmental impact, avoiding industries that conflict with their values.

Goparity democratises access to sustainable finance by connecting investors with projects that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By making impact investing accessible to everyone, not just institutional or wealthy investors, Goparity promotes a more balanced, sustainable, and inclusive economic system.

Goparity’s mission is to help people and organisations use their money for good through transparent, ethical investments that offer fair returns while funding sustainable projects. The company ensures that finance serves both people and planet, helping bridge the sustainability funding gap and enabling users to shift from harmful industries to greener, fairer alternatives.

User-friendly financial interface powers micro-investment platform

Goparity distinguishes itself in the growing impact investing and crowdlending sector through its combination of technological innovation, accessibility, and commitment to sustainability. At its core, an advanced e-wallet system lets users deposit, invest, and reinvest funds effortlessly.

This framework enables efficient micro-investment management, allowing people to start investing in sustainable projects with just €5. The platform’s comprehensive ledger system ensures transparent and secure tracking of all transactions, repayments, and investments. Strong regulatory compliance and partnerships with trusted payment providers keep users’ funds safe.

Unlike many competitors, Goparity focuses exclusively on projects that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This commitment means every euro invested creates tangible social or environmental benefits. Goparity stands out through its international reach. In contrast, others focus on local or single-sector projects. Goparity supports initiatives across continents and sectors, including renewable energy, rural development, and social entrepreneurship. The company builds community by promoting financial literacy, gender diversity, and offering educational content, attracting many young and female investors.

A key innovation is Goparity’s convertible loans—debt instruments that can become equity, rare in European crowdlending. The platform offers user-friendly automation tools like auto-invest and savings plans, helping investors manage portfolios efficiently while maximising both financial and impact returns. Transparency remains central, with transparent reporting on economic performance and project impact fostering user trust.

In the competitive landscape, Goparity stands alongside firms like Fundeen, Abundance Investment, Trine, and Mintos, each specialising in areas from renewable energy to real estate and peer-to-peer lending. However, these platforms often require higher minimum investments, use less sophisticated systems, or offer broader, less impact-focused project selections. Goparity’s low entry barriers, SDG-aligned focus, advanced technology, and engaged community position it firmly in the market.",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Goparity-team.png,N,,2025-05-06 04:56:18.252838

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said the official visit to Airbus headquarters had opened the door to six key areas agreed upon for joint exploration, aimed at establishing Sarawak as a new aerospace hub in the Asia-Pacific region.

Among these areas is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Sarawak actively conducting research to produce SAF in alignment with global goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“The second focus is human capital development in the aerospace industry, with cooperation between Airbus and local institutions such as ICATS to be expanded to develop aerospace-related training programmes and curricula.

“This initiative will provide Sarawak students with opportunities for international-standard industrial training,” he said at a press conference following a working visit to the Airbus Campus and the headquarters of ATR, a leading global turboprop aircraft manufacturer, on Monday (May 5).

He added that the third area agreed upon is the development of a supporting industry ecosystem.

Abang Johari explained that Sarawak will also explore the potential for manufacturing composite materials and gas-based synthetic leather for aviation use, as well as avionics technologies and instrumentation related to AI-based smart chips.

“The fourth area is the digitalisation of travel and aviation services, with the concept of a ‘digital journey’ to be introduced.

“This is intended to integrate all travel-related services — from flight ticket booking and ART transport systems to accommodations — into one seamless digital package,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said the fifth area agreed upon is the establishment of a Sarawak-Airbus Joint Task Force to formulate a roadmap for the development of Sarawak’s aerospace industry, involving expertise from both sides.

“A team will be formed from our side, while Airbus will also establish its own team. This initiative aims to create a synergy of expertise in the industry through comprehensive cooperation and discussions among experts.

“This effort is expected to catalyse the growth of the aviation industry, opening new opportunities for the sector’s advancement at the international level,” he said.

The sixth area, according to the Premier, involves the development of an Aerotropolis to further strengthen the aviation industry in the state.

“The state government plans to develop a 100-acre site for the Aerotropolis — an integrated hub where all constructed buildings are interconnected, making it more efficient and supportive of the aviation industry ecosystem,” he said.

Earlier, Abang Johari and his delegation conducted a working visit to the ATR headquarters in France, a leading global turboprop aircraft manufacturer.

“Aviation has always been synonymous with innovation, connecting people and cultures across the globe. Today, however, the industry faces an unprecedented challenge: balancing its role as a driver of global connectivity with the need to drastically reduce its environmental impact. After over 30 years working in aviation, I’ve witnessed firsthand how sustainability is reshaping aviation, particularly in luxury private aviation—a sector often scrutinized for its carbon footprint. This commentary explores the progress made, the road ahead, and how Azzera is empowering operators to embrace a greener future.

The State of Sustainable Aviation

The aviation industry contributes approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions, with private aviation accounting for a smaller fraction— about 0.04%. Despite this relatively modest share, private aviation’s environmental impact is increasingly under the microscope due to its high per-passenger emissions. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions from private jets rose by 46%, driven by post-COVID recovery and growing demand in emerging markets. This underscores the urgency for sustainable solutions.

The reality is that business aviation has a remarkable history of innovation in fuel efficiency. Over the past 40 years, fuel efficiencies have improved by 40% (NBAA). These advancements reflect the industry’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint without compromising performance or luxury.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a cornerstone of decarbonization efforts. It can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuels (depending on the feedstock used). Driven mainly by the recent ReFuelEU compliance requirements, European operators are investing heavily in SAF to power flights, athough challenges remain regarding feedstock availability and lifecycle analysis, leading to debates about long-term supply. Despite these concerns, SAF remains the most viable solution for immediate emission reductions without requiring fleet overhauls or extensive infrastructure changes.

When SAF availability is limited for uplift at certain locations, the «Book-and-Claim» system offers an innovative solution to scale production by providing a demand signal to producers while enabling immediate emission reductions. Business aviation is uniquely positioned as a key market for this approach, given its clientele’s willingness to support innovation.

Looking further ahead, electric aircraft and hybrid propulsion systems are gaining traction, yet entry into service is not immediate. Innovations like Bye Aerospace’s eFlyer 800 and Luxaviation’s partnership with Lilium for eVTOLs demonstrate promising advancements in regional and short-haul travel. While long-haul electric aviation remains a distant goal due to technological limitations, these developments signify a significant willingness to shift toward fossil fuel independence.

Operational efficiencies also play a pivotal role in reducing emissions today. AI-driven maintenance systems in jets like Bombardier’s Global 7500 optimize fuel use, while eco-friendly interiors crafted from natural fibers balance luxury with sustainability. These measures not only reduce environmental impact but also enhance cost-effectiveness—a crucial consideration as carbon compliance costs rise.

Azzera’s Contribution: Simplifying Sustainability

When I founded Azzera in 2021, my vision was clear: make sustainability accessible and actionable for the aviation ecosystem. Many industry players were eager to reduce their carbon footprint but struggled with regulatory complexities like the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This inspired CELESTE, a cloud-native platform designed to streamline emissions management and compliance while mitigating the risks of non-compliance.

CELESTE integrates seamlessly with flight scheduling software to calculate emissions in real time, categorizing them into the appropriate compliance markets. By automating processes, it significantly reduces workload and the financial risk of noncompliance, allowing operators to focus on delivering exceptional service. For charter companies, CELESTE’s Fly Beyond feature offers clients an effortless way to incorporate SAF, as well as invest in highquality carbon credits through an automated quote system, ensuring transparency without compromising luxury standards.

Azzera’s patented Impact Score system elevates carbon credit selection by evaluating projects on technical and financial criteria. This ensures operators can purchase high-quality credits with the best price-to-quality ratio while avoiding greenwashing risks. CELESTE also supports SAF adoption with tools like Book-and-Claim systems and usage monitoring, helping operators meet ReFuelEU mandates and advance toward net-zero goals.

The Road Ahead

Sustainable aviation is not merely about meeting regulatory requirements; it’s about transforming the industry into a model of environmental stewardship. According to a recent Jetcraft study, the share of buyers under 45 has nearly doubled in the last decade to a record 29% in 2024. These owners are increasingly demanding carbon-neutral options. Another study from 2023 showed that 85% of travelers were willing to pay a premium for sustainable flight. The drive towards sustainability in aviation does not only come from external factors. The industry is attracting new talent, paving the way towards change. European initiatives like Clean Sky 2 and Horizon 2020 have been funding research into cleaner technologies, while companies like Airbus and Rolls Royce offer internships focused on sustainability. Universities such as Delft University of Technology are preparing students for careers in green aerospace engineering, reflecting a generational shift toward eco-conscious innovation",https://ultimatejet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Capture-decran-2025-05-05-a-17.10.42.png,N,,2025-05-05 20:56:40.007036

ANZ announces new 2030 emissions guidance

Air New Zealand has published its first 2030 Emissions Guidance and says it expects to reduce net “well-to-wake” greenhouse gas emissions from jet fuel by 20 to 25 per cent by 2030, from a 2019 baseline. This new approach replaces the airline’s 2030 Science Based Target which it withdrew from in 2024. The new 2030 Emissions Guidance aims to provide a regular and transparent assessment of Air New Zealand’s progress towards its 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target. The Emissions Guidance will be updated annually in August in the airline’s Climate Statement. Each update will reflect the airline’s expected net emissions by 2030 based on detailed modelling of its decarbonisation progress, external market conditions, and global and domestic policy developments.

Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer Kiri Hannifin, says Air New Zealand is acutely aware of aviation’s impact on the climate and nature, and is committed to high levels of transparency in a rapidly evolving environment. “Air New Zealand remains committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we are taking practical steps today towards achieving that ambition. Having a comprehensive and annually updated outlook of our emissions trajectory to 2030, and a clear understanding of how we can get there, is a critical stepping stone. Rather than setting an emissions target that remains static, regular emissions guidance will give our investors and customers an up-to-date and clear view of our expected emissions trajectory, including the impact from external risks and opportunities. The reality of decarbonising an industry like aviation is there is uncertainty and are many factors we have limited control over, such as the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at reasonable prices. Many of our assumptions are evolving rapidly.

In developing the 2030 Emissions Guidance, Air New Zealand has undertaken a thorough analysis of the airline’s specific circumstances, external environment, and key decarbonisation levers:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): increasing use as global mandates, supply and affordability scale.

Fleet and network optimisation: implementing the airline’s fleet and network plan, including continued fleet renewal to replace older aircraft with more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Operational efficiency improvements: improving fuel efficiency through technology and best practice.

Carbon credits: using carbon credits to meet international regulatory requirements (specifically CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), and to a lesser extent using high integrity carbon removals.

There are no anticipated decarbonisation impacts from Next Generation Aircraft in the period to 2030.

The 2030 Emissions Guidance is integrated with the airline’s long-term fleet and network plan through to 2030 and will be updated in August each year as part of its Climate Statement.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/AOUjkZHhekVLlsMOmAEmWFdlsYcPWSMEjQVQJnvrnUlyPoAqBFjJqJRhPHpDByYM-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 18:56:39.608537

Green Fuel Forward will complement our well-established and ongoing Airports of Tomorrow and First Movers Coalition activities, increasing knowledge sharing, empowering organisations to procure SAF and creating additional networking opportunities for our local partners and stakeholders.”

Asia-Pacific is a prime market for scaling SAF due to its rapidly growing aviation sector, abundant feedstock resources for green fuel production, and increasingly favourable government and industry support. Singapore, Australia and Japan are among the regional countries implementing supportive policy initiatives to encourage faster decarbonisation in the aviation sector. Examples include Singapore’s Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint. It is important to leverage this emerging regulatory environment as well as the purchasing power of private sector organisations to boost demand for SAF. This, in turn, will drive the supply of greener jet fuel while reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security.

Frederick Teo, CEO, GenZero, said: “The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals.

Speeding up the adoption of alternative fats, particularly cultivated fats, would require faster regulatory approvals as they help build consumer and investor confidence.
Synthetic biology is heralding a future where fats don’t come with a side of deforestation.","The world has a seemingly insatiable appetite for fats. Beyond food production, tallow is used as a fuel, industrial lubricant, and raw material for various industrial chemicals. Palm oil, derived from palm trees in large monoculture plantations, has applications in food, personal care, pharma, and textiles, among other sectors.

But this high demand for fats comes at a massive ecological cost. “Livestock farming for tallow and lard drives deforestation, consumes vast amounts of water and feed, and generates significant greenhouse gas emissions,” said Sonalie Figueiras, a food futurist and founder and editor-in-chief of impact media platform Green Queen. Similarly, she added, “Palm oil production has led to massive habitat destruction in Southeast Asia.”

Figuerias is also Chair of the Food and Ag Track at SynBioBeta: The Global Synthetic Biology Conference, taking place this week at the San Jose Convention Center. She created a session to address this very topic entitled “The Lipid Problem: How Synbio Can Help Make Oil & Fat Supply Chains Deforestation-Free,” in which several commentators in this article will be participating.

Now, in a bid to mitigate these impacts, companies are using synthetic biology to produce animal and plant fat alternatives with a considerably lower footprint.

Producing Fats Without Agriculture

Compared to proteins, fats are simpler molecules. For instance, fat molecules have one or no chiral centers, which makes them structurally more straightforward. This means they can be produced with simple, non-biological reactions. “We have a lot of tools for combining carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen to make all kinds of other molecules, but we don't specifically combine them on our own to make food,” said Kathleen Alexander, CEO of San Jose-based startup Savor.

For example, carbon dioxide captured from the air has been turned into fuels, alcohols, and plastic precursors using heat. Savor uses this thermosynthetic approach to make fats from scratch. Their technology takes carbon dioxide or methane and water and converts them into intermediate molecules like syngas and, eventually, long-chain synthetic hydrocarbons. “We transform those hydrocarbons into fatty acids and then fats and oils,” said Alexander.

Many microbes are oleaginous, which means they produce excess lipids. Companies like Dutch biotech NoPalm Ingredients are augmenting the fat-producing capabilities of these microbes to turn them into a sustainable fat source. “We use directed evolution to improve the performance [of oleaginous yeast strains] and do some strain optimization,” said NoPalm CEO Lars Langhout.

“We create palm oil without palm trees by fermenting food industry side streams using yeast,” said Langhout. This makes their method circular and, in combination with deploying the kind of fermenters used in breweries, keeps capital expenditures low. Langhout added that their technology reduces carbon emissions by 96% and land use by 99% while achieving cost parity with traditional palm oil production.

Cultvated fat is another approach for sustainable fat production. Just like cultivated protein is grown with muscle cells, fats can be grown by culturing adipocytes or fat cells. Precursor cells are isolated from an animal, coaxed to differentiate into adipocytes, and nourished in bioreactors.

“Startups like Hoxton Farms and Mission Barns specialize in growing fat cells, which mature much faster than muscle cells, reducing production time and costs,” said Figueiras. “Cultivated fat also allows for precise control over marbling and composition, enabling premium products like lab-grown wagyu beef.“ Unlike air-captured or fermented fats, which are being developed to replace traditional fats in different sectors, research on cultivated fats is primarily limited to dietary applications.

Sustainable Fats For Food And More

Although cultivated meat has been generally regarded as synonymous with cultivated protein, fats are also an important aspect of meat. The fat content contributes to the nutritional benefits and sensory experience of eating meat. Fat gives meat its juiciness, tenderness, and distinct flavor. Mixing cultivated fats with cultivated protein, or even vegan protein, could make meat substitutes more palatable and appealing to consumers.

However, “If you want to produce a fat that mimics animal fat, you'd need to produce a similar fatty acid profile,” said Langhout. While NoPalm doesn’t serve this niche, their fermentation platform is flexible to make fatty acids mimic animal-derived fat. The simpler chemical structure of fats means that tweaking their production is convenient, regardless of the technology.

Unlike proteins, fats also see wider use in the industry. This is both an advantage and an opportunity. “You can tap into a broad set of markets and a broad set of functional properties that people are looking at from fats and oils,” said Alexander. For instance, Savor produces milkfat, cocoa butter, and alternatives to beef tallow and palm oil. NoPalm also makes alternative fats for food and personal care use cases.

Palm oil alternatives from Savor, NoPalm, and other companies could reduce reliance on palm oil from plantations. Likewise, animal-free fats could be used in drug delivery systems or nutritional supplements. Moreover, “The biofuels sector is exploring cultivated lipids as sustainable aviation fuel. There’s also potential in biomaterials, where fat-derived polymers could replace petroleum-based plastics,” said Figueiras.

Deforestation-Free Fat Supply Chains

When it comes to public dietary perception, protein occupies a haloed space unmatched by fats or carbohydrates. This is likely part of the reason why the alternative proteins received greater interest before alternative fats, despite the latter being easier to synthesize. But this also means that the ecological impact of fat supply chains receives less interest as compared to that of raising livestock for meat.

Deforestation due to palm oil plantations and other plant and animal sources of fats has wide-ranging ecological impacts. The loss of habitat exacerbates biodiversity losses and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable fat alternatives could change that. Speeding up the adoption of alternative fats, particularly cultivated fats, would require faster regulatory approvals as they help build consumer and investor confidence. ”Cost reductions through scaling up fermentation and bioreactor technologies and off-take agreements with the big FMCG companies will also be critical,” said Figueiras.

However, such agreements, Langhout noted, represent a chicken-and-egg problem for the upcoming sustainable fat alternatives industry. “Our customers want large volumes. But the investors, to enable us to build such volumes, want to see off-take agreements,“ said Langhout. Thankfully, there have been positive developments in the space recently. NoPalm partnered with FMCG Colgate-Palmolive to create soaps out of fermentation-derived palm oil alternatives, and Savor launched its butter made from air.

As customers expect more eco-friendly alternatives and the technologies scale up, more companies will launch products made with air-captured, fermented, and cultivated fats.

World Resources Institute urges U.S. policymakers and businesses to exclude corn and soybean fuels from plans to decarbonize aviation.

Industry places both sources at the heart of expansion of sustainable aviation fuel use.

State and federal regulators will likely be the key arbiters that shape company decisions.

For business flights that can’t be avoided, there’s only one near-term mitigation option: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a lower-carbon alternative to fossil jet fuel.

Scaling SAF is the focus of the global strategy to decarbonize aviation, but researchers at the World Resources Institute (WRI) are urging a rethink of how the U.S. plans to do so. In a new report, the WRI team argues that when a more holistic approach is used to assess SAF production, two crops that are essential to scaling supply — corn and soy — are found to create more emissions than conventional fossil fuels.

The crops “are not a viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation,” said Audrey Denvir, a WRI research associate and an author of the report.

SAF advocates disputed the report’s conclusions, saying the researchers failed to distinguish between global averages and data on more sustainable biofuel crops grown in the U.S.

Scaling supply

Almost all SAF is currently produced from used cooking oil and other inedible biomass, and is broadly agreed to lead to real carbon savings when it displaces fossil jet fuel. But current production is tiny: The U.S. produces around 1 percent of the quantity needed to hit a government target of 3 billion gallons of domestic production by 2030, according to a 2024 Department of Energy report.

With limited additional waste oil available, the industry in the U.S. is relying on purpose-grown soy and corn to drive near-term growth. “Purpose-grown crops could constitute the majority of the supply within 6 to 10 years,” estimated Adam Klauber, who oversees sustainability and digital supply chains at World Energy, an SAF producer.

To qualify as SAF, fuels produced from these crops need to emit no more than 50 percent of the emissions from fossil jet fuel. Many in the industry say they do, but the\ researchers argue that assessment rests on faulty accounting.

In a report released last week on how biomass can be used to decarbonize the U.S. economy, the researchers used a metric called “carbon opportunity cost” to calculate spillover impacts of fuel crops. As global demand for food grows, dedicating land for this purpose leads to forests and other native ecosystems being converted to agriculture, releasing additional emissions in the process. The fuels “actually increase emissions once you really account for all of the land use,” said Denvir. The European Union already excludes most biofuel crops from its SAF targets for similar reasons.

‘Context is everything’

Industry figures questioned key details of the analysis. Klauber argued that relying on global averages for the impacts of biofuel crops overlooks the higher performance of crops grown in the U.S. “Context is everything,” he said. In the case of soy production, for example, Klauber said the researchers used a carbon intensity figure that was several times higher than the one other academic and environmental organizations use.

Specific farming practices are also critical, he added. For example, biofuels can be grown either alongside and simultaneously with food crops, or during the shoulder season on either side of them. “That is broadly accepted as a sustainable practice, but it’s not yet at commercial scale,” said Klauber. “We’re working to increase that, because that really will be a way to increase the productivity of land without impacting food.”

A handful of organizations hold sway in determining which argument should govern growth of SAF in the U.S. The federal government, which oversees a clean energy tax credit known as 45Z that can apply to SAF, is unlikely to back more stringent environmental rules under the current administration. Regulators such as the California Air Resources Board also control certification schemes for SAF.

“The larger problem is on the demand side where business customers and buyers’ groups might exclude specific allowable feedstocks from contracts based on the perceived-negative public perception regarding soy or corn,” noted Klauber.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shutterstock-Image-2463328421.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 17:56:30.713362

He announced a 100 per cent tariff on such movies, saying the US movie industry was dying a “very fast death” due to the incentives that other countries were offering to draw American film-makers.

“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

He also said he was authorising the relevant US government agencies such as the Department of Commerce to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100 per cent tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.

Trump added: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

In a post on X, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said: “We’re on it.”

Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on the implementation. It was not immediately clear whether the move would target production companies, foreign or American, producing films overseas.

Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40 per cent over the last decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production.

Meanwhile, governments around the world have offered more generous tax credits and cash rebates to lure productions, and capture a greater share of the US$248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.

The post by Trump comes after he has triggered a trade war with China, and imposed global tariffs which have roiled markets and led to fears of a US recession.

Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump’s foreign movies tariffs would be devastating.

“The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,” he said, adding that it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.

The warning from LATAM and Airbus is loud and clear: the Sustainable Aviation Fuel crisis could destroy affordability, demolish demand, and damage regional air travel. Without coordinated action, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel crisis may trigger a collapse in connectivity. LATAM and Airbus emphasize that the Sustainable Aviation Fuel crisis is already inflating airline costs. In Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru, that cost spike could gut middle-class travel.

Latin America’s skies may soon soar greener—but only if governments ground the cost crisis before it crashes connectivity. A powerful new study, funded by LATAM Airlines Group and Airbus, and conducted by the MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy, has sounded the alarm: Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are the future of decarbonized flight—but that future comes with a hefty price tag.

The study zeroes in on Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru—countries central to Latin America’s aviation lifeline. Together, they represent a complex landscape of potential, urgency, and risk. The MIT analysis reveals a stark truth: SAF will be the primary engine driving aviation toward net-zero, but if nations fail to act together, travel across the region may soon become unaffordable for millions.

Sustainability Takes Flight—But Costs Could Ground It

Fossil fuels currently make up 40% of airline operating expenses in Latin America. Replacing them with SAF could increase those costs significantly. And airlines can’t bear that burden alone.

“Without supportive public policies, SAF will drive up travel costs and reduce demand,” warns the study. The consequences? Fewer passengers, slashed routes, and weakened economic links between cities, countries, and communities. In regions where air travel is the only feasible connection—such as remote parts of the Andes or Amazon—this could fracture entire economies.

SAF as a Lifeline, Not a Luxury

Still, there’s hope. The study outlines how regional collaboration could flip the script. If Latin American countries unify their decarbonization strategies, they can pool production capacities, create economies of scale, and channel SAF to areas with limited output at lower costs.

This approach is more than theoretical. Brazil, with its biofuel leadership, could supply SAF at competitive prices. Meanwhile, Colombia and Ecuador, which have lower production capacity, could tap into that network. In turn, producer countries gain market scale, while others maintain their flight schedules—and their economies.

Aviation Is More Than Travel—It’s Regional Lifeblood

In Latin America, aviation is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. The lack of reliable road or rail links means planes are often the only way to move people, goods, and ideas. Tourism, business, medical access, family connections—all depend on air travel.

“Without a roadmap, we risk increasing costs and compromising development,” says Juan José Tohá, Director of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability at LATAM Airlines Group. “Regional integration is essential.”

His counterpart at Airbus, Guillaume Gressin, doubles down: “This study confirms Latin America’s SAF potential—but also the need for unity. Joint action is the only path to affordable decarbonization.”

Tourism’s Tipping Point: Will SAF Choke Travel Demand?

The tourism industry in Latin America—worth billions in annual GDP—is watching this space closely. With inbound travel bouncing back post-pandemic and regional getaways on the rise, higher airfares could kill momentum.

Consider this: a 15-25% SAF fuel premium, passed on to ticket prices, could price out budget travelers and shrink the market for short-haul routes—just as domestic and regional tourism shows signs of full recovery.

Hotel occupancy rates in cities like Lima, Bogotá, and Santiago are climbing. New resort developments along the Mexican and Ecuadorian coasts are betting on airlift expansion. If SAF costs aren’t controlled, those bets could go bust.

Public Policy: The Missing Link

Despite its promise, SAF remains in its infancy in Latin America. Infrastructure is limited. Certification pathways are slow. Investment remains sparse. This is where governments must step in.

The study recommends:

Incentives for SAF production and distribution

Cross-border agreements to enable fuel sharing

Tax relief for airlines adopting SAF

Joint research and development programs

Without these interventions, private-sector investment will stall. Airlines will hesitate. And passengers will pay the price.

The Bigger Picture: Net-Zero Is Not Optional

Globally, aviation accounts for 2-3% of carbon emissions—but in a region like Latin America, where so many depend on air travel, decarbonization is both an environmental and economic necessity.

If Latin America embraces SAF, it could become a global leader in green aviation. The region boasts vast agricultural potential for biofuel feedstocks, strong solar potential for power-to-liquid processes, and growing demand for sustainable travel options.

But time is short.

“Momentum is building,” the report urges. “But if policymakers don’t act fast, the region will miss its window—and face the fallout.”

Looking Ahead: What’s at Stake

This isn’t just about clean fuel. It’s about preserving connectivity, growing tourism, and ensuring climate responsibility don’t derail regional development. SAF is the most viable path to net-zero. But it can’t succeed in isolation.

The call is clear: Unite, collaborate, legislate—or risk losing the skies.

That's at the root of why SAF has gone largely unrecognized by the new administration despite the industry's potential for rural Americans.
""We remain confident that our project is moving forward in a way that benefits farmers, ethanol producers and rural communities.
So how bad to you want SAF, rural America?
If a long-term 45Z extension and the SAF industry are going to happen, farmers will have to openly push for both.","As time passes beyond the first 100 days of the Trump administration, dreams of a rural future with sustainable aviation fuel seem to be waning -- this despite the rural vote carrying President Donald Trump to victory again.

Though the new administration has said very little if anything about where it stands on SAF, on the surface it makes sense for Trump to get fully behind such an industry if for nothing else to help secure future economic prosperity for farmers.

Trump has on more than one occasion said, ""we love our farmers,"" yet a potential goldmine for rural America sits stuck in neutral.

To this point the administration seems disinterested.

SAF will grow into a commercially viable venture for farmers and communities that are deeply invested in ethanol production, if it has the full support of the Trump administration.

Trump says a lot about creating new jobs and it's difficult to imagine any other regions of the country in more need of economic development and growth than rural areas.

No matter where you stand on the issue, it's clear right now that SAF doesn't have the momentum farmers and ethanol producers had hoped for here in May 2025.

Trump hasn't shied away from letting the world know what he thinks about the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by the Biden administration. The IRA created the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit.

Like it or not, 45Z is viewed by the administration as being part of the so-called green new deal.

That's at the root of why SAF has gone largely unrecognized by the new administration despite the industry's potential for rural Americans.

Trump has referred to the IRA as the ""green new scam"" and has dismissed clean energy incentives in the law as wasteful and ineffective. In February 2025 Trump called the IRA ""the greatest scam in the history of the country.""

STILL A 45Z EXPANSION COULD HAPPEN

Even with the Trump rhetoric, it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility the administration could and probably should at some point change its view.

The rural vision of SAF's potential is shared by millions of farmers who voted for the president.

Perhaps at some point the Trump administration will get behind a long-term extension of 45Z that is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2027, even if it came from the previous administration.

As I wrote about a little over a year ago, ""The promise of SAF in rural America is unmistakable: Meeting a goal of producing 35 billion gallons by 2050 would demand a new feedstock market of billions of bushels of corn from Midwest farmers,"" https://www.dtnpf.com/….

Right now, farmers need markets more than anything.

Even if the current administration put its full weight of support behind SAF, it seems the future faces significant headwinds.

The easiest path for ethanol plants to be a big part of SAF is to reduce carbon scores through carbon capture and storage, so as to make the fuel more attractive to airlines that are pushing toward net-zero carbon emissions.

This is where carbon pipelines can play a significant role and it is at this intersection where SAF is seeing and will continue to see the most resistance.

SUMMIT STRUGGLES

Enter Summit Carbon Solutions -- a company with plans to connect 57 Midwest ethanol plants to a carbon pipeline to open the door to SAF production across farm country.

Prior to the end of 2024, Summit seemed to be making progress in obtaining permits and in clearing other regulatory hurdles in Iowa, North Dakota and Minnesota.

Since then, state lawmakers in Iowa and South Dakota have started to chip away at the chances that the proposed 2,500-mile pipeline will ever being built, read about that here: https://www.mprnews.org/….

Serious opposition to the use of eminent domain could derail the Summit project and right now it's taking center stage in Iowa and South Dakota.

South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law in March that essentially bans eminent domain to acquire private property to build carbon pipelines.

Two weeks ago, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission denied Summit's permit application for a second time.

That action has led Summit to explore the possibility of reducing the number of ethanol plants connecting and in changing the pipeline route.

In Iowa, state lawmakers are debating the future of eminent domain laws in response to the pipeline project.

Despite the negative publicity aimed at Summit, the vast majority of land acquired for the project does not come from eminent domain, according to company officials, https://apnews.com/….

WILL 45Z BE EXTENDED?

In Washington, D.C., the question remains wide open: Will federal lawmakers pass a new budget bill that includes room for a 45Z extension?

To invest billions of dollars in SAF infrastructure, biofuels industry representatives say 45Z needs to be in effect for many years.

In April, legislation was reintroduced in the U.S. Senate to extend the 45Z tax credit through Dec. 31, 2034. Last October, legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives to extend 45Z through 2037.

In January, Trump placed a 90-day hold on tax credits including 45Z. Although the Internal Revenue Service has put out guidance on 45Z, Trump's recently proposed budget appears to contain no 45Z extension.

It doesn't appear 45Z is even on Trump's radar.

Despite all the blowback, Summit CEO Lee Blank said in a March 14 statement that his company expects to complete the pipeline.

""In South Dakota, recent legislative changes have temporarily slowed our timeline but they have not altered our vision or our determination,"" the statement reads.

""We remain confident that our project is moving forward in a way that benefits farmers, ethanol producers and rural communities. To the farmers, ethanol producers and industry leaders who stand with us: your commitment to innovation and progress is what drives this industry forward. We share your vision for a thriving agricultural economy, and we will continue working alongside you to make that vision a reality.""

So how bad to you want SAF, rural America?

If a long-term 45Z extension and the SAF industry are going to happen, farmers will have to openly push for both.

Trump may ultimately say no to the refined fuels industry on this one, unless someone makes a good economic case.

Dreexo joins a growing roster of companies in the area, including Elecam, Rospa, Quest Global and Capgemini.","Dreexo Energy is set to establish a biofuel production facility in Cadiz, investing €27 million in its initial phase. The plant will be built within the Zona Franca, the Free Trade Zone’s fiscal area, marking a significant step toward the city’s commitment to innovation and sustainable industrial development.

The facility will specialize in producing second-generation biodiesel, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), intended primarily for the aviation sector. Plans include constructing raw material storage tanks with an initial capacity of 98,000 cubic meters, which may be expanded in the future. The expected output is 57,000 cubic meters of finished product annually, with a treatment capacity of 100,000 tons per year.

Strategically located near a dock, the site will facilitate the import of raw materials mainly from the Middle East, Europe and North Africa, with possible expansion into Asian markets. The feedstock will include non-edible fats, possibly of animal origin or used cooking oils, that comply with regulatory standards. According to company spokesperson Del Corral, the production process involves “fine chemicals” and purification steps to remove elements such as phospholipids.

Dreexo emphasizes the project's environmental sustainability. The company states that the process will generate minimal waste, with many byproducts repurposed. Rubber residues will be sold to other industries, sand used in filtration will be reused, and wastewater will be treated on-site to meet municipal standards. The solid-state raw materials also reduce the risk of spills, as the product is unloaded directly from ships without combustion or odor issues.

Construction is slated to begin in the first quarter of 2026 and is expected to create between 100 and 200 temporary jobs. The plant will be located on a 51,000-square-meter site formerly occupied by the Altadis tobacco factory. The construction will take place on the previously demolished palletizing area, where existing concrete slabs will undergo load testing. If the results are favorable, the site may not require ground reinforcement, potentially accelerating the project timeline.

Once operational, the plant will employ about 50 permanent workers, primarily engineers, technicians and vocationally trained personnel.

The Free Trade Zone highlights the project as part of its broader strategy to foster Industry 4.0 and support environmentally responsible businesses. While not categorized under the blue economy, the initiative fits within the circular economy framework. Dreexo joins a growing roster of companies in the area, including Elecam, Rospa, Quest Global and Capgemini.

About ALIGHT The ALIGHT project, funded by the European Union’s innovation program, develops sustainable aviation solutions through scientific research and practical application.","Copenhagen Airport, in collaboration with the EU-funded ALIGHT project and its partners SAS and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), has launched FuelTrack — a pioneering measurement campaign set to deliver the first-ever comprehensive dataset directly linking jet fuel properties to aircraft emissions and local air quality.

Until now, the precise properties of fuel at individual aircraft level have largely remained unknown due to complex airport fuel distribution and a lack of monitoring. Even within existing specification limits, variations in fuel composition — and resulting fuel properties — have been shown under laboratory and standardized engine test rig conditions to influence combustion processes and formation of pollutants. The FuelTrack campaign now extends this investigation into real-world daily operations at an airport environment.

“We are creating a unique scientific dataset,” says Dr. Benedict Enderle, Senior Scientist at DLR’s Institute of Combustion Technology. “By analyzing both fuel properties — like aromatics and sulphur content — and real-time aircraft emissions during taxi operations, we’re gaining unprecedented insight into how fuel properties influence combustion performance and emissions.

“Although we expect to see mostly conventional fuels during the measurement campaign, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) is expected to increase due to regulatory requirements. With this shift, fuel composition variability is likely to grow-offering opportunities for targeted emissions reductions. To fully understand and leverage this potential, we need detailed data not only from laboratory experiments but also from real-world operational settings.

The ALIGHT project aims to close this knowledge gap, with findings that will inform both the aviation industry and research community.

“The majority of the fuel burned when aircraft are on the ground at CPH is the fuel the aircraft were refueled with at the departing airport,” adds Peter Wiboe Holm, Senior Sustainability Advisor.

“In relation to the local air quality in CPH, we are therefore very interested in understanding this natural variation in the fuel composition and using the results to strengthen our knowledge in the field and thereby support our existing air quality program. Understanding how different fuel blends, including sustainable aviation fuels, impact local air quality is essential for developing cleaner fuels and reducing aviation’s environmental footprint.”

Breakthrough in Emissions Research

The FuelTrack campaign will collect and analyze:

Real-time emissions from aircraft during taxi operations

Detailed fuel samples from both aircraft and the fuel distribution system at the airport

Flight data across multiple aircraft types

Variations in fuel properties from different airports

Emissions data is collected using an array of measurement equipment strategically positioned on the apron-including a van-based, mobile high-fidelity measurement lab from DLR.

Direct Correlation and Scientific Impact

For the first time, FuelTrack will enable direct correlation between the fuel supplied to aircraft and their resulting emissions under fully operational conditions at an airport. This unprecedented dataset will support:

Optimization of future jet fuel compositions

Evaluation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends

Air quality improvements at airports

Development of targeted emission reduction strategies

Scope:

The study will collect data over a time period of two weeks, establishing a baseline for current fuel variations, mapping emissions across aircraft types, and providing critical evidence for future fuel development and sustainable aviation policy. The results of the measurement campaign are expected to be ready during the autumn.

A key mission of the Green Fuel Forward initiative is to scale up production of SAF, which the industry regards as a vital tool to cut the sector’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments globally, including Singapore’s, have set mandates that map steady increases in the percentage of SAF in planes’ fuel tanks in the coming years.

“The only way to get to net zero, or very close to net zero by the middle of the century, is very, very large amounts of SAF,” said Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s sustainability lead for the Asia-Pacific.

More efficient aircraft designs and engines can get perhaps 20 per cent of the way, and operations – such as better route planning – another 10 per cent, he told The Straits Times at the launch of the initiative during the GenZero Climate Summit 2025 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. The summit aims to showcase ways to hasten the decarbonisation of the global economy.

Boeing has been actively promoting the use of SAF and the company aims to ensure its commercial aircraft are certified to operate on 100 per cent SAF by 2030, he said.

Lack of awareness and higher costs for the greener fuel remain issues for SAF, which is two or three times as expensive as fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel. And in Asia, the world’s largest aviation market, demand is not keeping pace with planned production capacity additions in the coming years.

“The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals,” said Mr Frederick Teo, chief executive of GenZero, an investment platform owned by Temasek.

SAF is designed to be a drop-in fuel for planes, needing no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current rules allow up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

SAF can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has set a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050.

The fuel is made mostly from waste materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat, but can also be made from agricultural residues and even alcohol.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that SAF will achieve about 65 per cent of the emissions reductions needed for the industry to reach net zero by 2050. And cutting emissions has become increasingly critical, with aviation currently accounting for approximately 2.5 per cent of global CO2 emissions, and possibly doubling or even tripling from 2019 levels by 2050 unless concerted action is taken.

Green Fuel Forward is a capacity-building initiative that aims to draw in airlines, refiners, logistics firms, banks and others. A total of 16 companies and organisations have agreed to participate, including Boeing, Climate Impact X, DBS Bank, DHL, the International Energy Agency, Neste, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Temasek and UOB.

Singapore Airlines first started using SAF in 2017 on a trial basis and is hoping for greater market participation to drive up demand and push down prices, said chief sustainability officer Lee Wen Fen. The airline regards SAF as key to its decarbonisation goals.

A key focus of the initiative is to boost the take-up of SAF certificates by companies to offset their own emissions or the travel emissions of their employees, for example.

The certificates can be bought on exchanges, such as Singapore’s Climate Impact X, and each is linked to the creation of one tonne of SAF. Certificate buyers can track and claim the environmental benefits, such as emissions reductions, of using SAF without having to purchase the physical fuel.

The emissions reduction can be claimed once the tonne of SAF is burned, with the accounting process approved by ICAO. On average, each SAF credit represents a CO2 emissions reduction of 2.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes versus conventional fuel.

The initiative will organise workshops and practical guidance tools to help organisations navigate topics such as environmental integrity and reporting practices for SAF and SAF certificates.

Globally, SAF still comprises a fraction of total jet fuel use. And in the Asia-Pacific, uptake is far slower than in Europe.

In 2024, Iata said SAF production reached one million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) – or about 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production. This is double 2023’s production of 0.5 million tonnes but far below the initial projections for 2024 of 1.5 million tonnes.

Rules mandating SAF usage will drive up demand over time.

Flights departing EU airports must now use 2 per cent SAF in their fuel mix, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and 70 per cent by 2050. For Japan, SAF must account for at least 10 per cent of domestic airlines’ jet fuel consumption by 2030.

In Singapore, 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports must be sustainable, with a goal to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

Singapore Airlines and its budget arm Scoot are among those committed to reaching a goal of 5 per cent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030.

There are other challenges for the industry, including ensuring the environmental integrity of feedstocks, such as land-based feedstock, which can lead to unintended consequences for deforestation, said Temasek’s managing director for sustainability, Ms Park Kyung-ah, during a panel discussion at the launch.

In Europe and the US, governments have also expressed concerns about reports of virgin palm oil being fraudulently added to boost used cooking oil supplies to SAF refineries. The EU forbids the use of virgin palm oil as an SAF feedstock.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1811fa75f7a30753cfbcf43d7f08ea752017cb444e838fda00e1d3d9ed9152fd,N,,2025-05-05 10:56:11.511329

Reducing soot emissions via Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or low-naphthalene low-sulfur jet fuel can mitigate contrail impacts. However, uncertainties remain, especially in low-soot conditions where other emissions may contribute more to ice crystal formation.

Strategic mitigation, such as using SAF on high-impact routes or optimizing Conventional Aviation Fuel (CAF) properties, could maximize benefits in the short term. Nonetheless, the economic and environmental trade-offs, as well as safety and infrastructural challenges, should be better assessed to determine feasible solutions. A collaborative, industry-wide approach is needed to balance environmental goals with economic and technological realities.

Executive summary

Air transport’s total environmental impact results from both its CO2 and non-CO2 emissions (e.g., NOx and contrails). Non-CO2 effects have a global warming impact that has been estimated to comprise approximately half of the industry’s total climate impact, albeit with a much wider range of uncertainty in the precise quantification compared to that of CO2. Non-CO2 effects are also short-lived (i.e., hours to decades) compared to CO2 emissions which accumulate in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

SAF is one of the main decarbonization levers for the air transport industry. According to IATA’s Net Zero Roadmap, almost two-thirds of the industry’s sector-wide CO2 emission abatement will be achieved by using SAF. While technologies for producing SAF are well understood, and the HEFA pathway in particular is commercially mature, supply is likely to be limited in the near future. However, increased SAF production and adoption would not only cut CO2 net emissions, but the use of SAF can also bring non-CO2 climate and air quality co-benefits by reducing particle emissions. While the air transport industry’s priority should remain the reduction in CO2 emissions because of their long-term cumulative warming effect, and because the science is more certain in this domain, the industry should also capitalize on the non-CO2 co-benefits of SAF to achieve and maximize its environmental benefits and reduce the industry’s environmental impact further. This approach would minimize the total environmental near-term impact while allowing time for fully sustainable solutions to develop, which can address non-CO2 climate drivers such as contrails.

Numerous measurement studies have shown that jet engines burning SAF or fuels with lower aromatic and sulfur content modify aircraft engine emissions compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel (CAF). Specifically, emissions of black carbon, or “soot”, and smaller particles such as those derived from sulfur dioxide are curtailed. Based on these studies, it is widely accepted that SAF and other fuels with these properties exhibit lower soot emissions in comparison with CAF and that a large fraction of the soot emissions is from naphthalene compounds.

Contrail cirrus clouds have a significant warming effect on the climate. Most of today’s jet engines emit large amounts of soot particles, which contribute to the formation of the ice crystals that make up contrails and impact the climate. In this high-soot regime, measurement and modeling studies have shown that reducing soot emissions by using SAF with lower naphthalenes and sulfur content can have a positive contrail climate benefit.

Modern jet engines with newer technologies (e.g., TAPS combustors), or older engines burning fuel with near-zero levels of naphthalenes or sulfur, emit considerably fewer soot particles. However, the smaller particles emitted from the engine or entrained from the ambient atmosphere in this low-soot regime can also contribute to the formation of ice crystals. Ambient conditions, such as temperature and humidity, can potentially increase the radiative and climate impact of the contrail. While more measurements and research are needed to better understand the role of these smaller particles in contrail formation, recent studies indicate the importance of reducing both soot and smaller particles from engine emissions to achieve climate and air quality benefits.

The climate impact of contrails is short-lived and dependent on the geographical location, altitude, and time of day and year in which they form and persist. Studies have found that only a small number of flights are responsible for most of the contrail climate warming. Given that scaling up SAF production is slow and that supplies are limited, prioritizing SAF use on specific routes that are more prone to forming highly warming contrails could be an efficient strategy to optimize the climate co-benefits of SAF in the shorter term. However, there are significant and costly logistical and infrastructural issues and challenges that need to be addressed in determining the feasibility of such strategies.

Altering fuel composition by removing or reducing naphthalenes and sulfur from CAF to reduce particle emissions is also being considered as a strategy to help reduce air transportation’s non-CO2 impacts. While current refining technologies to optimize fuel composition for environmental benefits exist, producers and suppliers have little incentive given the associated added costs. In addition, the extra processing required will lead to increases in the life cycle emissions, resulting in a climate penalty. Modifying fuel standards may be a way to mitigate non-CO2 effects, but in-depth comprehensive assessments of the associated safety, economic, technological, and environmental trade-offs are required to determine optimal and feasible solutions, including policy incentives, before any further decisions are made.

Mitigating non-CO2 effects is complicated by complex interdependencies and trade-offs, as well as scientific uncertainties associated with some of the related processes. An industry-wide approach built on multi-stakeholder and scientific collaboration is needed to find achievable smart solutions. These solutions should also consider environmental and technological changes over the next couple of decades. Changes in the background state of the atmosphere due to reductions in surface emissions from other sectors, as well as changes in the climate, will have an influence on the effects of non-CO2 emissions. Furthermore, with fleet turnover, low soot-producing engines (e.g., LEAP, GEnx, GE9X) will eventually replace the non-CO2 benefits of fuel with lower aromatic content.",https://iata.shorthandstories.com/the-non-co2-climate-co-benefit-of-saf-and-other-fuels-with-low-aromatic-and-sulphur-content/assets/9LwdxZlv8g/frame-at-0.000s-of-gettyimages-1223578062-1280x720-1500078-social-cover.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 13:56:43.430635

<p dir=""ltr"">Let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;oil and gas are the driving forces behind the global economy, and the industry is changing fast. So, who&rsquo;s leading this shift? India is making its mark. With industry giants like Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corporation, and ONGC, India isn&rsquo;t just part of the energy market anymore; it&rsquo;s shaping its future.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">The o<strong>il and gas industry in India</strong> is evolving quickly, setting new benchmarks for sustainability, innovation, and growth. Home to some of the <a href=""../""><strong>largest oil and gas companies</strong></a>, India is at the forefront of a new era of energy, driving progress toward a diverse, efficient, and sustainable future. As these giants grow, India&rsquo;s influence on global energy production and consumption is undeniable.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into how India&rsquo;s oil and gas industry is transforming the global energy landscape.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">2. From Energy Dependent to Energy Defining: India's Bold Shift</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India's journey from a major consumer of oil to a global player in its own right is fascinating. For decades, India relied on imports to fuel its massive demand. However, <strong>strategic investments in refining</strong>, <strong>exploration</strong>, and logistics have now positioned India not only as a consumer but as a producer, refiner, and influencer in the global oil ecosystem.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Indian oil and gas companies like Reliance Industries, ONGC, and <strong>Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)</strong> have become household names, not just in India, but globally. In fact, Reliance alone accounts for about 20% of India's total oil refining capacity. These companies are leading the charge in refining, energy innovation, and resource development. Through collaborations with key international players and strong geopolitical ties, India is ensuring that its voice is heard in critical oil discussions worldwide.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">India's ability to move beyond just demand and position itself as a supply chain innovator has revolutionized its status in the global <strong>oil and gas industry</strong>.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">3. Crude Control: India's Strategic Leverage in Global Oil Products</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s role as a global refining powerhouse cannot be overstated. The country is the <strong>world's third-largest refiner</strong>, processing more crude than it consumes. In 2021, India processed 4.85 million bpd of crude oil, which is only behind the US and China. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there&mdash;India's refineries churn out surplus refined products that are exported across the globe. From <strong>jet fuel and diesel</strong> to LPG and naphtha, India plays a pivotal role in the energy market, especially in Asia, where it caters to energy-hungry nations.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">This refining dominance is more than just an economic advantage. It positions India as a strategic player with the ability to control and influence the flow of energy resources, ensuring its central role in the global oil trade. This ability also places India among the <a href=""../""><strong>top 5 oil and gas companies in India</strong></a> based on refining capacity.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">4. Refining Power + Digital Intelligence = India&rsquo;s Competitive Advantage</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">What sets India apart in the oil and gas industry isn't just its refining capacity but also its technological ingenuity. In places like Gujarat, India houses the <strong>largest refinery complex in the world</strong>: Jamnagar Refinery, which has a capacity of 1.24 million bpd. This refinery isn't just a technological marvel in terms of size; it&rsquo;s a model of digital integration.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">AI-driven systems, predictive analytics, and automated logistics ensure that Indian refineries run smoothly, minimizing risks, optimizing production, and ensuring fuel distribution is always on target. In 2023, Reliance Industries achieved a 10% reduction in operational costs through the use of digital technologies across its refineries. The synergy of traditional refining power combined with <strong>modern digital technologies</strong> gives India a competitive edge that the rest of the world is beginning to envy.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">5. Energy Diplomacy: When India Speaks, OPEC Listens</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s influence extends far beyond its borders, especially when it comes to energy diplomacy. For decades, OPEC countries held the cards, controlling the supply and <strong>pricing of crude oil</strong>. But India, with its large and growing demand, is now a force to reckon with in energy discussions. In 2020, India accounted for nearly 11% of global oil consumption, making it a critical market that OPEC countries can no longer ignore.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s partnerships with countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States have allowed it to diversify its oil imports. In 2022, India became the <strong>third-largest importer of crude oil from</strong> the US, a testament to its expanding diplomatic reach. Simultaneously, the country&rsquo;s active participation in energy forums such as the <strong>International Energy Forum (IEF)</strong> has placed it at the negotiation table, ensuring that it is no longer just at the mercy of others' decisions.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">With its strategic energy policies and growing market clout, India is in a unique position to influence <a href=""../""><strong>global oil pricing</strong></a> and trade policies.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">6. The Green Transition: Leading the Dual Energy Game</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s ambitions aren&rsquo;t just limited to traditional oil and gas; the country is also pioneering the <strong>green energy transition</strong>. While committing to net <strong>zero emissions</strong> by 2070, India is continuing to develop its fossil fuel resources responsibly.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">What&rsquo;s more impressive is how India is integrating <strong>sustainable energy solutions</strong> into its oil and gas infrastructure. The country is leading the charge in biofuels, green diesel, and renewable energy technologies, proving that you don&rsquo;t have to abandon oil to build a clean energy future. India&rsquo;s green hydrogen market is projected to reach <strong>$8 billion</strong> by 2030, signaling its commitment to building a dual energy framework.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">India's vision isn&rsquo;t about choosing one over the other; it&rsquo;s about creating a dual energy model that innovates and evolves with time.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">7. Case Study: How Reliance Is Becoming the Saudi Aramco of Asia</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s Reliance Industries is a prime example of how Indian companies are changing the global energy game. With its state-of-the-art refining infrastructure and diverse investments in renewable energy, hydrogen, and <strong>green technologies</strong>, Reliance is quickly becoming a global energy titan.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Reliance&rsquo;s massive refinery at Jamnagar is the largest in the world, and its ability to adapt to changing energy demands makes it a key player on the world stage. As Reliance pushes forward into <strong>green fuel technologies</strong>, it&rsquo;s positioning itself to challenge the dominance of companies like Saudi Aramco, especially in Asia.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Reliance&rsquo;s annual revenue for 2023 was <strong>$100 billion</strong>, with more than 20% of this coming from its oil refining and petrochemical sectors. As it accelerates its green initiatives, Reliance is on track to become a dominant force in both traditional and clean energy markets.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">8.

Conclusion: India Isn&rsquo;t Watching the Future of Oil&mdash;It&rsquo;s Building It</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">The days when India was just a passive consumer of energy are over. The country is actively reshaping the future of the global <strong>oil and gas industry</strong> through its technological prowess, energy diplomacy, and green energy initiatives. From refining to trade, from oil diplomacy to the green transition, India is setting the stage for a new energy order.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">If you&rsquo;re in the oil and gas industry, whether you&rsquo;re an investor, a producer, or an energy tech company, one thing is clear: India&rsquo;s impact on the future of oil and gas is undeniable. And those who aren&rsquo;t aligned with this shift risk being left behind.</p> <p dir=""ltr""><strong>Exporters Worlds</strong>, as a <strong>global B2B platform</strong>, is perfectly positioned to connect <a href=""../""><strong>oil and gas companies</strong></a> worldwide with opportunities to tap into the vast and dynamic market India offers. With its unmatched refining capacity, powerful industry players, and expanding energy initiatives, India is no longer just shaping the future of the oil and gas industry&mdash;it is defining it.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">The Questions That Matter Most(FAQs)</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">Question No. 1: Which is the largest oil and gas company in India?<br>Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) stands as India&rsquo;s largest oil and gas company. It holds a dominant position in refining, marketing, and distribution, with one of the highest revenues among the <strong>oil giants</strong>. In 2023, IOC's revenue was $68 billion, making it a leading player in the <strong>global oil and gas industry</strong>.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Question No. 2: How do I start in the oil and gas industry?<br>Starting in the oil and gas industry involves understanding its diverse segments: upstream (exploration and drilling), midstream (transportation and storage), and downstream (refining and distribution). The key is to gain industry-specific knowledge, whether through technical degrees, joining established firms, or exploring new niches like <strong>energy tech</strong> and clean fuels.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Question No. 3:&nbsp; What are the key challenges faced by oil and gas companies in India?</p> <p><strong>Oil and gas companies in India</strong> face challenges like <strong>crude oil price volatility</strong>, with India importing 85% of its oil. Regulatory changes and increasing environmental concerns further complicate operations. Additionally, the shift to renewable energy forces companies to innovate and adopt sustainable practices. Platforms like <strong>Exporters Worlds</strong> can offer valuable partnerships and solutions to navigate these complexities effectively.</p>",,N,,2025-05-05 16:56:33.662409

Reflecting on the collaborative efforts at the Muara Labuh PLTP, Minister Airlangga noted the continued growth of trade and investment relations between the two nations.

""In 2024, the value of Indonesia-Japan trade reached US$35 billion, and Japanese investment increased by 52 percent from 2021 to US$3.5 billion,"" Airlangga stated in a written press release on Monday, May 5, 2025.

Airlangga highlighted that Japan is currently Indonesia's sixth-largest investor, with over 12,000 strategic projects. He also expressed appreciation for Japan's support in the advancement of green energy and technological innovation.

""We deeply appreciate Japan's commitment and leadership in fostering sustainable development. This reflects the shared aspiration of both countries to cultivate mutually beneficial economic cooperation,"" he affirmed.

During the meeting, Airlangga emphasized Indonesia's pivotal role as Japan's primary partner within AZEC. He noted that 175 Memoranda of Understanding have already been signed by business entities from both countries.

Furthermore, he stated the government's commitment to accelerating the realization of these low-emission projects by addressing various challenges through cross-sector collaboration and public-private partnerships. The Golkar Party politician added that the government is also actively promoting the advancement of other AZEC projects, including the Legok Nangka waste-to-energy plant, the development of sustainable aviation fuel, the Sarulla geothermal power plant, and the Java-Sumatra transmission network.

""These projects show the seriousness of Indonesia and Japan in expediting the transition to clean energy and green economic development. The visit of former Prime Minister Kishida reinforces our commitment to continued collaboration for a low-carbon future,"" he asserted.

The meeting also included a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement between PT Supreme Energy Muara Labuh and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). Airlangga explained that this agreement marks a significant step in the development of the Muara Labuh geothermal power plant project, which is targeted for commercial operation in the first quarter of 2027.

Our members are on track to meet their current mandate and exceed 2030 targets. Despite policy and investment challenges, European fuel producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs. We urge regulatory clarity, feedstock support, and fair recognition of ongoing efforts, and underline our commitment to decarbonising aviation and achieving EU climate goals.

With surprise and concern, FuelsEurope and its members are following the public debate that recently emerged around the availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in the EU and the role of the European fuel manufacturing industry.

Recent statements from the aviation sector claim that fuel producers are failing to deliver the required quantities of SAF to the market, based on a first version of a 2025 Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report. The very same report, however, omits any reference to the European fuel and refining industry, which is already supplying SAF to the EU market and supporting the achievement of the European targets set by the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Following the public use of this study by the aviation sectors and the possible misinterpretation of its conclusions, it is to be noted that BCG has clarified that global “supplies of bio-SAF are projected to reach 9 to 12 million tons by 2030 and exceed the regulatory-driven demand (including ReFuelEU mandates of about 3 million tons in 2030)”1.

The current capacity of HEFA (today the most common bio-SAF) operated by FuelsEurope’s members in the EU is about 1.5 million tonnes per year. An additional 2,4 million tonnes per year additional firm SAF capacity set to come in operation up to 2029. In comparison, the SAF needed to cover the 2% ReFuel EU mandate in 2025 is 1 mln tn/yr (already produced). The SAF needed to cover 6% mandate in 2030 is 2,7 mln tn/yr, and is expected to be met.

The European Union’s own Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)2 comes to similar conclusions: SAF supply is expected to exceed 3.2 million tonnes annually by 2030, supported by a growing number of projects across the EU.

Moreover, according to Argus Media, the EU SAF capacity is expected to exceed demand until at least 2035:

Argus Media - Spotlight on European SAF Market - Countdown to 2025

This trajectory signals clear progress toward decarbonising the aviation sector. Despite operating in an unstable environment, with a fragmented legislative framework that does not offer a clear business case for the billion-euro investments required to transform refineries into renewable fuel production hubs, our members continue to invest—assuming significant risk—in a market with high production costs that lacks the needed support.

Currently, seven biorefineries (with another one under transformation), are already producing 100% renewable fuels for all transport modes, for a total volume of about 4 million tonnes per year supplied to the EU market. At the same time, other refineries are moving towards co-processing fuels from a mix of fossil and sustainable feedstocks. SAF is a high-priority in these conversions that are all dedicated to meeting the goals of the Fit-for-55 package.

These pioneering and innovative actions by the European refining sector have led to:

● A significant ten-times increase in SAF production within just two years (from 100Kt in 2022 to 1Mt in 2024);

● A significant and consistent decline of average SAF prices, with the premium falling from a ratio of over 4 to below 2 compared to conventional jet fuel levels within just three years3.

We share concerns over the affordability of SAF, so policy needs to enable the mobilisation of more feedstocks for SAF and provide targeted support for highly capital-intensive e-SAF projects in the forthcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan.

An adequate legislative framework and a clear business case for the transformation of our sector would give a great boost to these first steps and would accelerate the decarbonisation of all sectors that rely on - or may benefit from - the transition of our industry.

In particular, for the aviation sector, the following regulatory actions should be taken for an accelerated SAF uptake:

● Enable predictable growth: allow annual national SAF incentives to anticipate ReFuelEU targets, and define post-2030 annual mandates in the 2027 ReFuelEU revision.

● Provide feedstock certainty: clarify rules for new feedstocks like intermediate and degraded land crops, and avoid overregulation that discourages their adoption.

● Recognise co-processed RFNBO hydrogen contributions in final products: RED and ReFuelEU Aviation must acknowledge a RFNBO share when it is chemically bound or enhances the heating value of the SAF.

● Improve SAF regulatory conditions: advance clear rules for Low-Carbon Fuels and align circular carbon sourcing criteria across RED and ETS systems.

The aviation industry needs sustainable fuels. Europe’s fuel manufacturers are already delivering and are ready to accelerate.

Our industry has always supported the EU's climate goals and actively contributes to their achievement, being one of the key sectors for the successful transition to climate neutrality. However, the challenges it faces concerning competitiveness and the investment environment within the EU require collaboration and alignment among all stakeholders, fostering open and unbiased discussions with policymakers, and leveraging all strategic industrial and production sectors of the EU.

We are here—ready to contribute to the major challenges and goals ahead. We call for recognition of our strategic role in shaping a future of sustainable transport—on land, in the air, and at sea.

Air New Zealand is redefining its approach to sustainability, announcing a shift from rigid emissions reduction targets to a more flexible, guidance-based framework aimed at achieving its environmental goals. The airline’s new strategy, known as the 2030 Emissions Guidance, is a direct response to the evolving challenges faced by the aviation sector, including technological limitations, supply chain hurdles, and the increasing complexities of decarbonizing air travel.

The shift reflects a growing recognition within the aviation industry that achieving net-zero emissions by a specific date is a highly ambitious and sometimes impractical goal, especially when confronted with factors like fuel supply constraints and the pace of technological advancements. With this in mind, Air New Zealand has decided to focus on a more achievable emissions reduction range, offering the company the flexibility to adapt as new innovations and solutions emerge.

A Pragmatic Approach to Emissions Reduction

Instead of setting an exact emissions target, Air New Zealand now aims to cut jet fuel-related emissions by 20-30% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. This revised approach reflects a more pragmatic outlook on what is realistically achievable within the next decade, given the challenges the airline industry faces in scaling up cleaner technologies like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The decision to move away from hard emissions targets to a more flexible guidance framework is designed to ensure the airline remains on track with its sustainability goals while accommodating uncertainties in both technology development and regulatory requirements. By adopting this guidance-based approach, Air New Zealand can adjust its strategy as new solutions become available, while continuing to make meaningful progress toward reducing its carbon footprint.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Key to the Future of Aviation

One of the cornerstones of Air New Zealand’s emissions reduction plan is the increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and forest residues, offering a far lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel. As part of its long-term sustainability plan, Air New Zealand is targeting 10% SAF usage by 2030.

However, the global SAF market remains in its infancy, and scaling up its production presents significant challenges. SAF is currently more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, and supply is limited. To address these challenges, Air New Zealand has been working extensively to secure a stable and scalable SAF supply, including domestic sources from New Zealand’s forestry sector.

The airline’s dedication to SAF is underscored by its ongoing efforts to establish partnerships with fuel producers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to create a robust, sustainable supply chain. Air New Zealand is also exploring the use of waste products from the forestry industry, such as sawdust, to produce SAF, which would help reduce both aviation emissions and New Zealand’s overall carbon footprint.

Carbon Offsetting: Complementing SAF with Carbon Credit Purchases

While SAF is central to Air New Zealand’s decarbonization strategy, the airline recognizes that it will not be sufficient on its own to meet its emissions reduction goals. To help offset its remaining emissions, Air New Zealand will continue to purchase carbon credits through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This scheme, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), aims to offset carbon emissions from international flights, maintaining carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020.

In addition to participating in CORSIA, Air New Zealand plans to buy approximately 11,000 tonnes of carbon credits to further offset its emissions. These credits will support a variety of nature-based solutions, such as forest restoration and other carbon removal projects in New Zealand, contributing to the airline’s broader commitment to sustainable environmental practices.

A Fleet Upgrade to Support Sustainability Goals

In addition to SAF and carbon offsetting, Air New Zealand is investing in its fleet to ensure that its operations are as fuel-efficient as possible. The airline is upgrading its fleet with more modern, energy-efficient aircraft, which use less fuel and produce fewer emissions. This strategy includes the continued introduction of newer models, such as the Airbus A321neo and the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner, both of which offer superior fuel efficiency compared to older aircraft.

As of May 2024, the airline’s fleet is comprised of a diverse range of aircraft, including narrowbody, widebody, and turboprop models, with a strong emphasis on fuel-efficient designs. Some of the key aircraft in Air New Zealand’s fleet include:

17 Airbus A320 aircraft, including both classic and newer models

12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, with plans to add more in the near future

30 ATR 72-600 turboprops, used for regional routes

10 Boeing 777-300ERs for long-haul international travel

14 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for international flights

3 Boeing 787-10s, offering increased seating and improved fuel efficiency

23 Dash 8-Q300 turboprops for domestic and short-haul routes

In addition to investing in modern aircraft, Air New Zealand is also adopting advanced flight optimization systems to improve fuel efficiency during flight. These systems enable more precise routing and better management of flight speed and altitude, reducing overall fuel consumption.

Looking Ahead: Challenges and Commitments

Despite the progress made, Air New Zealand acknowledges that there is still much work to be done. The airline’s shift to a guidance-based emissions framework does not signal a retreat from its sustainability goals but rather a commitment to a more adaptive and transparent approach. The challenges of scaling SAF production, securing reliable supply chains, and implementing new technologies remain, but the airline is determined to continue its journey toward a more sustainable future.

The airline’s new emissions guidance approach represents a balance between ambition and realism, offering a roadmap that can evolve with the times while still driving meaningful progress toward the goal of reducing aviation’s environmental impact.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-05T171536019.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 10:56:50.934649

According to the report, 77% of North American airlines ranked cybersecurity among their top three IT priorities for 2025, with nearly half (45%) citing it as their single top focus. AI also stands out, with nearly half (45%) naming it their number one priority, which is a level of commitment to AI innovation significantly higher than seen globally.

“The 2024 North American IT Insights report clearly shows that airlines are not just responding to current operational challenges but are actively investing in the technologies that will scale to support seamless air travel,” said Shawn Gregor, President of the Americas at SITA. “From cybersecurity defenses to AI-driven operational efficiencies, North American airlines are setting the pace for industry-wide transformation ahead of forecasted rapid growth in passenger volume.”

Key Highlights from the Report Include:

Cybersecurity and AI Lead IT Resource Allocation: Investment is heavily concentrated in cybersecurity initiatives, with 100% of surveyed airlines implementing advanced measures such as Privileged Account Management, SSO authentication, and DDoS protection. AI applications are similarly widespread, particularly in cybersecurity, operational scaling, and predictive disruption management.

Accelerated Data and AI Maturity: 72% of North American airlines already train AI models with collected data — more than double the global average (28%). Additionally, 9% have integrated large language models (LLMs) into their operations, versus just 2% globally.

Emerging Technologies Gaining Traction: Beyond AI, airlines are investing in technologies like business intelligence (BI) software (70%), computer vision (45%), and private 5G networks (38%).

Strategic Use of Innovation Partners: Over 80% of airlines reported collaboration with external partners in AI development, far outpacing global averages.

Heightened Cybersecurity Challenges: Ensuring the security of third-party vendors emerged as the top cybersecurity challenge, with 100% of respondents flagging it as a critical concern.

The research underscores the region’s leadership in leveraging technology for strategic advantage, not just operational efficiency. While enhancing security remains paramount, airlines are also positioning themselves to drive future innovations in data analytics, AI, and passenger experience.

Additional areas of investment include biometric technologies and sustainability initiatives. More than half of North American airlines have implemented biometric-enabled passenger processes to enhance identity management and streamline travel, significantly outpacing global adoption rates. At the same time, airlines are leading in environmental responsibility, with over 80% implementing measures such as sourcing sustainable aviation fuel, retrofitting existing fleets, and investing in electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft to support industry carbon reduction goals.

Join the Conversation

To further explore these findings, SITA will host a webinar titled “IT Insights: Cybersecurity, AI and the Future of Flying” on May 6, 2025. Experts from SITA and A4A will explore the latest trends shaping airline IT investment and discuss how North American carriers are preparing for the future.

According to a LinkedIn post by Kiri Hannifin, Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer for Air New Zealand, and an airline statement, the decision to go from targets to guidance was due to the technological challenges and ""uncertainty"" in meeting the original targets. However, as Hannifin shared with the media, Air New Zealand continues to be committed to aviation sustainability .

Reviewing the latest - as of 1 May - 2030 emissions guidance shows that Air New Zealand is committed to driving emissions from jet fuel creation and combustion 20-30 percent down from 2019 levels by 2030. The airline intends to use carbon credits and, ""use 10 per cent SAF (as a percentage of total fuel) in 2030"" to achieve this goal. But as Hannifin explained on her LinkedIn post, ""We want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector.""

Air New Zealand Continues SAF Commitment

The Air New Zealand goal to reduce emissions by 20-30 percent from jet fuel consumption depends largely on increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply. However, as Simple Flying has documented , increasing SAF supply is no easy feat worldwide. For Air New Zealand, there has been a worldwide search for over a year now .

The global search for more innovation in SAF development and delivery is because, as Hannifin shared with Simple Flying on March 20, 2024, ""A stable supply of SAF is critical to our ability to reduce carbon emissions."" Additionally, SAF is in short supply, and as Hannifin shared with NewstalkZB on May 1,

""[SAF's] the main way that airlines will decarbonize. ... There's hardly any available, so the more demand there is, the more supply there'll be available - and that will help get the prices down.""

One can listen to the May 1 interview below:

SAF Is Not Air New Zealand's Only Decarbonization Solution

Air New Zealand is also relying on other solutions to decarbonize. One of which is carbon credits to offset emissions via CORSIA . CORSIA stands for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. The scheme was established by ICAO pre-pandemic and seeks to cap CO2 emissions from international flights at 85% of 2019 levels, coupled with carbon-neutral growth for operations past 2020. However, according to the guidance, Air New Zealand will also buy ""approximately 11,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)"" credits to supplement this and fund natural carbon removal efforts in New Zealand.

Additionally, there are two fleet solutions at work. The first is more efficient flying with computer aids. The second is renewing and maintaining a fleet with modern, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Below is a table of the current Air New Zealand fleet as of May 5 for reference:

Below is a 2022 YouTube about the Air New Zealand fleet plans:

Hannifin: ""Still Be A Stretch For Us""

Ultimately, one should consider what Hannifin posted in her LinkedIn that even with shifting from specific targets to guidance, and reaffirming the Air New Zealand commitment to reduce emissions, there are still challenges. Air New Zealand has to continue to increase the SAF supply, by for instance waste products from the forestry industry (aka logging) like sawdust and more. One can listen to the details below, thanks to another Hannifin interview on NewstalkZB with the magic of Spotify:

But additionally, as Hannifin posted to LinkedIn,

""For us, we want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector. ... This will still be a stretch for us.

The partnership aims to produce synthetic aviation fuel, other synthetic fuels, and chemicals across Austria, the UAE, and northern and central Europe, reports Hydrogen Central.

In a joint statement issued Wednesday, Masdar’s Chief Green Hydrogen Officer Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi said the collaboration seeks to use the combined strengths of both companies to scale up the green hydrogen value chain.

“Masdar and OMV are combining forces to produce industrial-scale green hydrogen and related products, supporting the energy transition and advancing global decarbonization goals,” he said.

OMV Executive Vice President for Fuels, Feedstock and Chemicals Martijn van Koten added, “This partnership is about turning ideas into action. By exploring opportunities in green hydrogen and synthetic fuels, we’re looking to create real business value while setting new benchmarks for sustainability in Austria and the UAE.”

Masdar, a state-owned UAE energy company, has targeted annual production of 1 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen and derivatives by 2030.

OMV, which is partially owned by the Austrian government, plans to use green hydrogen to power its refineries as part of its strategy to achieve net-zero emissions across its full value chain (Scope 1-3) by 2050. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity generated from renewable sources.

Separately on Wednesday, OMV also announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen plant, located at the Schwechat refinery in Austria. The EUR 25 million ($28.3 million) facility features a 10-megawatt polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar, and wind energy.

The plant is expected to produce 1,500 metric tons of green hydrogen annually, reducing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by up to 15,000 metric tons—equivalent to the yearly carbon footprint of about 2,000 EU citizens, according to OMV. The hydrogen will be used to decarbonize refinery operations and produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

“With this facility, we’re reinventing how everyday essentials are made—sustainably,” said van Koten. “By developing local green hydrogen production and supply chains, OMV is both advancing Europe’s climate objectives and strengthening industrial resilience.”

The facility is certified under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) to produce renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). The project received support from Austria’s Climate and Energy Fund.

In its financial report for Q1 2025, OMV posted a net profit of EUR 288 million—a 57% drop compared to Q1 2024. Net income attributable to parent company shareholders fell 70% to EUR 143 million, with earnings per share at EUR 0.44.

Sales revenue remained stable at EUR 6.22 billion, slightly down from EUR 6.26 billion year-over-year. Fuel and feedstock sales totaled EUR 3.82 billion, while energy sales stood at EUR 2.22 billion. Chemical sales rose to EUR 171 million.

OMV ended the quarter with EUR 1.34 billion in operating cash flow and EUR 317 million in free cash flow. The company reported EUR 12.68 billion in current assets, including EUR 5.68 billion in cash and equivalents, against EUR 7.74 billion in current liabilities.

Siekiame gaminti gerokai daugiau SAF kuro, nei reikės visai Baltijos šalių rinkai, tad didžiąją dalį savo pagaminto SAF ketiname eksportuoti“, – teigia jis.","„Avia Solutions Group“, didžiausia pasaulyje ACMI (orlaivių nuoma su įgula, technine priežiūra ir draudimu) paslaugas teikianti aviacijos įmonių grupė kartu su partneriais iš Latvijos LSEZ SIA „NORSAF“ pradeda vystyti ambicingą projektą – Liepojoje statys didžiausią regione tvaraus aviacinio kuro (angl. sustainable aviation fuel arba SAF) gamyklą, kurioje bus gaminamas ir sintetinis SAF. Pradėti kuro gamybą ji turėtų 2030 m. Pagamintas kuras bus ne tik siūlomas Šiaurės Europos šalims, bet ir aktyviai eksportuojamas į kitas pasaulio rinkas. Numatoma projekto investicija gali siekti 500-600 mln. Eur priklausomai nuo galutinio technologinio sprendimo, rašoma pranešime spaudai.

Šis ambicingas projektas yra pirmasis „Avia Solutions Group“ žingsnis į aviacinio kuro gamybos sritį. Kadangi projektas konkuruos tarptautinėje rinkoje, sėkmingam įgyvendinimui labai svarbu ir Europos Sąjungos, institucinių finansuotojų bei vietinės valdžios parama.

Kaip sako įmonių grupės generalinis direktorius Jonas Janukėnas, šiuo metu aviacijos įmonės aktyviai ieško sprendimų, kurie prisidėtų prie tvaraus aviacijos sektoriaus vystymosi ir atlieptų naujus tvarumo standartus, įskaitant sintetinio SAF gamybą.

Aviacijos ateitimi vadinamas SAF – tai tvarus aviacinis kuras, kuris generuoja ženkliai mažiau šiltnamio dujų emisijų. Šiuo metu jis dažniausiai gaminamas iš panaudoto aliejaus, biomasės, etilo alkoholio ir kitų organinių šaltinių. Nuo šių metų įsigaliojo Europos Sąjungos reikalavimas, kad didesniuose oro uostuose bent 2 proc. viso sunaudojamo kuro turi būti SAF tipo. Šis mandatas palaipsniui kils, 2030 m. jau sieks 6 proc., 2035 m. – 20 proc. 2050 m. jo dalis jau turėti siekti 70 proc.

„Svarbu suprasti, kad 2030 m. atsiras dar viena svarbi sąlyga – iš viso patiekiamo SAF 1,2 proc. turės būti sintetinis. Toks kuras gaminamas be biologinių komponentų – naudojant žaliąją energiją gaminamas vandenilis, kuris maišomas su anglies dvideginiu. Šis mandatas irgi palaipsniui augs, ir 2050 m. jau pusė viso SAF kuro privalės būti sintetinis. Taigi permainos aviacijos sektoriuje jau vyksta pilnu tempu“, – sako „Avia Solutions Group“ priklausančios tarptautinės antžeminių paslaugų, orlaivių degalų tiekimo ir logistikos paslaugų įmonių grupės „Baltic Ground Services“ („BGS“) vadovas ir Norsaf valdybos narys Vytautas Čekanavičius.

Dėl naujų reikalavimų, oro linijos palaipsniui turės pirkti vis daugiau SAF kuro, o 2030 m. dabartiniai gamybiniai pajėgumai jau nebegalės patenkinti augančio poreikio. Anot V. Čekanavičiaus, Liepojoje bus naudojama JAV įmonės „KBR“ vystoma gamybos technologija, kai naudojamas alkoholis, bet į procesą įtraukiamas ir vandenilis su CO2. Tai reiškia, kad bus gaminamas tiek paprastas, tiek sintetinis SAF kuras.

„Liepojos Laisvojoje ekonominėje zonoje yra ir vamzdynai, ir geležinkelio linija, čia jau vyksta ir etanolio perkrova, planuojama, kad atsiras ir žaliojo vandenilio gamykla. Kitaip tariant, egzistuoja didelė dalis mums reikalingos infrastruktūros. Šiuo metu vyksta derybos ir su viena didele kompanija, kurios išskiriamą CO2 naudotume savo sintetinio SAF gamybai“, – dėsto „BGS“ vadovas.

Kaip sako LSEZ SIA „NORSAF“ valdybos narys Janis Kisiels, naujosios SAF gamyklos projektas ypatingai reikšmingas visam regionui. Jį įgyvendinus, augs ir Baltijos šalių energetinis saugumas, gerokai sutrumpės tiekimo grandinės.

„Ši gamykla yra labai geras pavyzdys, kaip dirbdamos išvien mūsų šalių kompanijos gali įgyvendinti pačius didžiausius ir ambicingiausius projektus ir taip prisidėti prie žaliosios aviacijos transformacijos. Siekiame gaminti gerokai daugiau SAF kuro, nei reikės visai Baltijos šalių rinkai, tad didžiąją dalį savo pagaminto SAF ketiname eksportuoti“, – teigia jis.

Planuojama, kad naujoji Liepojos gamykla kasmet pagamintų 100 tūkst. tonų SAF. Palyginimui, šiuo metu visuose Baltijos šalių oro uostose sunaudojama apie 400 tūkst. tonų aviacinio kuro, o pagal dabartinį 2 proc. mandatą, rinkai dabar reikia tik apie 8 tūkst. tonų SAF.

„Dirbame su potencialiais tiekėjais, partneriais, investuotojais, ES institucijomis. Mūsų planas ir ambicija 2027 m. pradėti statybas, ir 2030 m. jau gaminti SAF kurą. Projektas milžiniškas, bet tikime, kad įdėto darbo rezultatas bus vertas pasididžiavimo ir turės įtakos aviacijos pramonės tvarumui“, – teigia V.

With support from the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), MZT has kicked off a DAC plant in Norfolk that will serve to pull down atmospheric CO2 to be used for the production of manufactured limestone by O.C.O Technology (O.C.O.).

Current estimates say that once operational at full capacity, this DAC plant will be able to remove around 250 tonnes of CO2 per year.

For partnering company O.C.O., which utilizes captured CO2 to produce sustainable construction materials, this DAC deployment will enable a reliable and sustainable on-site source of carbon dioxide, optimizing the supply and protecting against price and availability fluctuations.

Dr. Nicholas Chadwick, MZT co-founder and CEO, commented, “With the construction sector being one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions, the industry needs to rapidly rethink its carbon backbone — and creating sustainable building materials which double as carbon sinks is a great way to do just that.”

A joint effort between the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Temasek-backed, decarbonisation-focused investment company GenZero, it will educate organisations to become more familiar and competent with sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFC), promote the use of both, enable test purchases and encourage partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Frederick Teo, chief executive officer of GenZero, said: “The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals.”

He added that the initiative can provide the technical clarity and corporate commitment needed to scale sustainable aviation fuel adoption, and “by mobilising corporates and airlines, we can create the certainty needed to spur innovation, scale production and make lower-emission flights a reality”.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable sources that include biofuel, waste or synthetics.

As it can be used in existing jet engines and reduce emissions by up to 80 per cent, it is the most viable way of reducing the emissions of air travel. However, it is hampered by its high cost (three to five times more than regular jet fuel), low production and uncertain demand.

According to the International Air Transport Association, sustainable aviation fuel accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024.

SAFC will help organisations administer emissions reductions for using sustainable aviation fuel, using a framework developed by WEF’s Clean Skies For Tomorrow initiative. It will allow both airlines and corporate travel to track and claim emissions reductions from flights using sustainable aviation fuel.

Sixteen organisations are participating, including the banks DBS, Mizuho and UOB; aircraft maker Boeing; airlines Air New Zealand, Qantas Group and Singapore Airlines; sustainable aviation fuel producer Neste; and logistics company DHL.

Green Fuel Forward’s efforts will include education and training on key topics, plus hands-on exercises such as legally compliant test purchases of sustainable aviation fuel and SAFC.

According to a 2024 report, South-east Asia has the potential to supply 12 per cent of the world’s sustainable aviation fuel by 2050. The Asia-Pacific is the largest passenger aviation market in the world, and is also expected to lead sector growth in the next few years.

While modest in carbon terms, such initiatives align with the growing pressure on logistics firms to decarbonise.
DHL’s blend of speed, visibility, and brand assurance gives it an edge in markets where logistics reliability can directly impact revenue cycles.","When DHL Express announced last week the renewal of its partnership with the Mumbai Indians for a fifth consecutive year, it was more than a routine sponsorship extension. Beneath the surface of this feel-good cricket-and-commerce story lies a deeper narrative—one that offers insights into how international logistics providers are reshaping their brand relevance in one of the world’s most dynamic markets, and aligning closely with domestic connectivity goals that include, crucially, air cargo growth.

The renewed partnership keeps DHL Express as the principal sponsor for India’s most successful cricket franchise. But while the public face is fan engagement and climate-conscious campaigns, the underlying strategy speaks to DHL’s long game: expanding its reach and relevance in India’s air express and time-definite cargo segments, where competition with both international integrators and emerging domestic players is intensifying.

Beyond branding

India’s air cargo sector, valued at approximately US$2.3 billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10 percent through 2030, according to government and industry data. With the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, rapid e-commerce expansion, and rollout of multi-modal logistics hubs under Gati Shakti, demand for precision logistics services is rising sharply.

DHL Express, long a dominant player in the premium segment, is clearly aligning its cultural visibility with this growth arc. Cricket, particularly the IPL, offers unparalleled reach in India — with over 500 million viewers across platforms — but its value to air cargo professionals is not just in visibility. It is in symbolic alignment with India’s evolving needs: agility, speed, and integration.

“Sports and logistics share a common thread — both work on the qualities of precision and agility,” Sandeep Juneja, Vice President, Sales and Marketing at DHL Express India, said. “Our continued relationship [with Mumbai Indians] is a testament to our shared pursuit of success.”

In that phrasing is an implicit recognition that air cargo in India is becoming less transactional and more brand-driven, where service reliability and time performance (rather than price alone) define market share. The Mumbai Indians’ values — excellence, teamwork, speed — become brand proxies for DHL’s logistics ethos.

The ‘team behind the team’

From a cargo operations standpoint, DHL Express is already an essential player in time-definite international movements into and out of India’s key air gateways: Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Its “team behind the team” tagline may be rooted in sport, but operationally, it mirrors DHL’s role in enabling just-in-time logistics for India’s SMEs, pharma, and tech manufacturers.

For example, DHL’s reliance on the air cargo segment is evident in its operational infrastructure in India. The company operates a dedicated freighter fleet and makes extensive use of belly-hold cargo space across commercial airlines — all coordinated through its central hubs in Leipzig and Hong Kong. India’s rising exports — with FY 2024–25 merchandise exports pegged at US$447 billion — represent a strategic opportunity, especially as micro-enterprises seek faster routes to global markets.

By linking its express brand with cricketing excellence, DHL is not merely chasing eyeballs. It is embedding itself in national consciousness as a trusted operator in a country that still faces significant logistics bottlenecks, including limited cold chain integration, fragmented warehousing, and volatile ground transport.

he partnership’s ‘Six for a Cause’ campaign — wherein DHL plants six trees for every six hit by a Mumbai Indians player — adds a layer of climate consciousness to the mix. Last season, 133 sixes resulted in nearly 800 trees being planted. While modest in carbon terms, such initiatives align with the growing pressure on logistics firms to decarbonise.

India’s draft Air Cargo Policy and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) both call for “greener cargo corridors,” and DHL, like its peers, is under regulatory and reputational pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments, carbon-neutral warehousing, and route optimisation will all become material indicators in the years ahead. Campaigns like DHL’s, though PR-oriented, provide public linkage between cargo movement and climate responsibility — a necessary narrative as India pushes for net-zero aviation by 2070.

Strategic signal

The partnership also sends a signal to India’s fast-growing domestic express players — Delhivery, Ecom Express, and India Post’s revamped logistics division among them — that DHL is doubling down on local mindshare even as its physical infrastructure grows.

With India’s intra-regional air cargo expected to grow at 12–14 percent CAGR, especially from Tier 2 and 3 cities, cultural partnerships will play a role in influencing procurement decisions, particularly among MSMEs and digitally enabled retailers.

Australia’s election gives LNG, fuels sector certainty

Australia’s election gives LNG, fuels sector certainty

Sydney, 5 May (Argus) — Australia's governing Labor party's second majority term could mean that changes to the offshore permitting regime promised last year are signed into law, while east coast LNG businesses will avoid a planned reservation system proposed by the opposition. Labor's victory at the 3 May election combined with the election of fewer members from the Greens party and climate-focused independents, could mean it faces less pressure to cancel fossil fuel projects. But it will remain reliant on the Greens to pass laws through the nation's upper house — the senate — meaning Labor may need to negotiate the passage of bills with the leftist party if the Liberal-National-based coalition opposes its measures. The Greens ran on a promise to ban new coal, oil and gas projects but won fewer seats than in 2022 because of preference flows. A federal decision on the lifetime extension of the Woodside Energy-operated 14.4mn t/yr North West Shelf (NWS) LNG delayed by Labor, is now looking more positive for the firm. The firm sees approval as vital to progressing its Browse gas development offshore northwestern Australia. Voters' rejection of the opposition Coalition on the nation's east coast means its policy to reserve a further 50-100PJ (1.34bn-2.68bn m³/yr) from the Gladstone-based LNG exporters will not proceed. The result provides an opportunity for certainty and stability for the energy sector, upstream lobby Australian Energy Producers said. The group urged the government to focus on new supply as Australia's gas reserves for domestic use rapidly deplete. The government will need to specify exactly how it aims to secure supplies to ensure stable supply, once coal-fired generators retire at the end of the 2020s and into the 2030s. This is because the nation's integrated system plan is based on Labor's policy of reaching 82pc renewable energy in the power grid, backed up by about 15GW of gas-fired power. Industry will await further direction stemming from the Future Gas Strategy which canvassed solutions to Australia's declining gas supply including new pipelines, storage and seasonal LNG imports. Permitting concerns In the government's previous three-year term, a series of court-ordered requirements to consult with affected Aboriginal groups briefly disrupted multi-billion dollar LNG developments. Labor promised to specify through new laws exactly which groups must be consulted before approvals could be granted. But these were dropped from the agenda in early 2024 following opposition by the Greens. Labor's resources minister Madeleine King blamed the Greens for obstructionist manoeuvres on this legislation, but it remains unclear if and when Labor might introduce such laws. Conversely, the Coalition promised to end government support for anti-gas lobbies such as law group the Environmental Defenders Office — set to continue under Labor. In liquid fuels, Labor's victory should boost Australia's electric vehicle (EV) sales, with emissions standards laws set to remain enforced. The Coalition had said it would soften the laws because of concern over cost of living pressures. Plans to temporarily cut the fuel excise will also not progress. Australia's EV take-up has stalled, and industry has blamed this on poor investment in recharging infrastructure and other policy settings, including the removal of the fringe benefits tax exemption for plug-in hybrid car models. A re-elected Labor government is likely to further policy towards a mandate for sustainable aviation fuel or renewable diesel, given the growing share of Australia's emissions projected to come from the transport industry. It pledged A$250mn ($162mn) for low-carbon liquid fuels development in March , for low-carbon liquid fuels development in March, as part of its commitment to the nascent sector. Local market participants are optimistic that further biofuels support will be provided as urgency to meet net zero ambitions builds, including a 2030 target of 43pc lower emissions based on 2005 levels. About A$6bn/yr of feedstocks like canola, tallow and used cooking oil are exported from Australia, while existing ethanol and biodiesel producers are running underutilised plants, making about 175mn litres/yr at present, because of poorly-enforced blending mandates.

This shorter booking curve allows Virgin Atlantic Cargo to assess and capitalise on new opportunities in emerging markets more swiftly.","Five months into his role, Nick Diesel, Virgin Atlantic Cargo’s recently-appointed Managing Director, is looking to bring his experience from leading the team through post-pandemic recovery to support the carrier throughout turbulent economic conditions and global supply chain disruptions.

“I’ve been with Virgin Atlantic for about ten years, but I’ve only been in this particular role for five months, I’m still learning ,” Diesel told Air Cargo Week. “During my time at the airline, I’ve gained broad experience across a number of departments, which I think has helped me in this new role.

“When the pandemic hit, we had to pivot quickly. We were operating in what seemed like a temporary crisis, but it turned out to be something much longer-lasting and more disruptive,” Diesel shared.

“The biggest lesson I learned during that time was that you can never predict what’s around the corner and so need to focus on what you can control. You can have your best estimates, but it’s crucial to keep plans flexible and simple so we can quickly adapt.”

This adaptable mindset has proven crucial in the current environment. “In the cargo world, we’re fortunate to be a smaller operation compared to some of the larger players,” Diesel noted. “This allows us to be more agile and try out new solutions that can drive improvements. We have a fantastic team, and the pace of technological advancement is exciting for us. We’re actively looking at business automation and exploring tools that will help us move more efficiently and stay ahead of the curve.”

Prepared for unpredictability

Despite the current challenges, Diesel sees the airline’s ability to innovate, adapt, and build strong relationships with its team and customers as key factors for long-term success.

“The landscape is changing rapidly, and we’re exploring everything from automation in back-office functions to dynamic pricing strategies. There’s a lot of potential here, and I think we’ve only scratched the surface. Over the next few months, I’ll be focusing on understanding how we can use these tools effectively to better serve our customers and further improve our operations,” Diesel expressed.

“The political climate, and global supply chain disruptions are definitely a significant influence on everything we’re doing, but we’re focused on staying flexible and continuously improving,” he said. “I’m excited about where we can go from here, and I have confidence that our team will continue to rise to the occasion.”

Potential through passenger travel

With its position as a belly-hold cargo operator, Virgin Atlantic’s extensive passenger network provides significant advantages but also presents certain operational challenges.

By leveraging this network, the company can bring cargo directly into major city locations and key destinations, maximising available capacity on flights that would otherwise be empty. However, to make this work, there’s a delicate balance to strike—ensuring that both passenger demand and cargo opportunities are optimiSed without compromising profitability on either side.

“There are two main components to this,” Diesel explained. “First, how do we maximise the opportunity with the existing network? And second, how do we shape the strategic direction of Virgin Atlantic to ensure that cargo has a strong voice in decision-making?”

“We’re fortunate to have senior leaders with extensive cargo experience and so we understand the contribution cargo makes to Virgin Atlantic’s financial performance.

“We’ve also made a significant shift by framing our cargo team as the ‘fourth cabin’ at Virgin Atlantic, alongside economy, premium, and upper class,” Diesel revealed. “This shift has helped us highlight the value that cargo adds to our network, positioning it as a key part of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, alongside our holidays and loyalty programmes. This approach has given cargo a stronger, more prominent role.”

Speedier set up

The quick ramp-up time for cargo compared to passengers is another significant advantage for Virgin Atlantic Cargo. While the booking window for passenger flights can extend up to 18 months, cargo bookings tend to have a much shorter lead time—often just two weeks. This shorter booking curve allows Virgin Atlantic Cargo to assess and capitalise on new opportunities in emerging markets more swiftly.

“This makes it easier to quickly assess cargo opportunities in new markets,” Diesel explained. “We’re about to wrap up our plan, which outlines our strategy through 2025, and we’re already preparing for the next strategic plan for 2030.

“What’s been really positive is the opportunity to influence the selection of potential markets early on. We’re able to input directly into the process, suggesting markets based on customer demand, rather than having the passenger network team come to us later with potential routes.”

“We’ve also made a significant shift by framing our cargo team as the ‘fourth cabin’ at Virgin Atlantic, alongside economy, premium, and upper class,” Diesel revealed. “This shift has helped us highlight the value that cargo adds to our network, positioning it as a key part of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, alongside our holidays and loyalty programs. This approach has given cargo a stronger, more prominent role.”

A notable example of this alignment in action is Virgin Atlantic’s expansion into markets like India, where cargo has played a critical role in supporting the profitability of these routes. As geopolitical situations shift, particularly in regions like the Red Sea, the cargo division’s performance has provided a boost to the airline’s growth in new markets.

“ Cargo is able to reach maturity much quicker in new markets, playing a key role in supporting route profitability,” Diesel shared.

Internal collaboration

To capitalise on the full scale of opportunity in the industry, Virgin Atlantic Cargo is focused on optimising its operations through closer teamwork with its different departments, with Diesel having prioritised engagement with staff and customers across the network during his first months in the role.

“It’s been fantastic to meet our teams and customers. Most of the feedback has been very positive, which is always great to hear,” Diesel remarked. “We’re committed to ensuring that our people are empowered, supported, and clear on their roles, especially when facing challenges. This level of communication and support is what makes us stronger as a team.”

Drawing from his time working in finance and data , Diesel presented a unique perspective on how Virgin Atlantic Cargo can adapt to economic challenges: “My experience in financial planning and procurement has been invaluable in this role. I’m constantly learning from my colleagues, including a number of people in our senior leadership team who have vast experience in cargo. Together, we’re focused on staying on track and making the right decisions for the future.”

Serious about sustainability

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword but a core principle that influences nearly every aspect of operations, from fuel sources to fleet management, and even local facility practices.

“We were really excited about the success of our 100 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) flight, which was a huge milestone for the airline,” Diesel shared. “What’s often not mentioned is that we also carried cargo on that flight—not just people.

“We worked closely with key customers to make it happen, and the key message we wanted to convey is that if enough SAF is produced, we will fly it. That’s the point we’re driving home:the barrier is not operational it is one of price and scale”

The 100 percent SAF flight marks just one part of Virgin Atlantic’s broader strategy for sustainability. Diesel explained that there are two main areas the airline is focusing on to reduce its environmental footprint: the fleet and the fuel.

“82 percent of our aircraft are next-generation, averaging 6.9 years old, and by 2028, once all of our 16 A330neos arrive, we will be 100 percent next generation,”Diesel revealed. “While much of the conversation around sustainability focuses on future innovations, we’ve already made substantial progress in terms of fleet renewal, which has led to significant reductions in emissions.

“SAF production needs to scale, and that’s something we’re advocating for on a government level,” Diesel explained. “We’re supporting efforts to ensure that both the pricing and the supply of SAF are sustainable in the long term, so airlines have the certainty needed to plan for a future that’s both greener and more cost-effective. And the support of our Cargo customers is of vital importance, they are major purchasers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificates (SAFc) and their contribution to the SAF we buy helps to reduce their carbon footprint, support the growth of SAF, and achieve their sustainability goals”.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-13.23.05-1080x721.png,N,,2025-05-05 07:57:47.644193
