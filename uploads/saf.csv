It raises vital questions about Britain’s – and the world’s – readiness to face the security threats posed by the climate crisis, none of which can be met if leaders keep treating climate and defence as separate issues.

This summer, wildfires linked to climate change brought Europe to its knees, wreaking economic havoc, overwhelming health systems and draining military resources. All over the world, climate breakdown is fuelling instability, conflict and displacement. The EU’s failure to break free from Moscow’s pipelines is jeopardising its energy sovereignty. Too many governments treat climate and security as separate priorities, but true security will depend on how quickly we integrate climate resilience into national defence.

As world leaders increase their defence budgets, they must redefine what security means. Nato’s pledge to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP, agreed this summer, should be used to invest in innovation, something the British military has a proud history of.

The navy’s shift from burning coal to oil before the first world war was controversial, but ended up strengthening the British fleet. Today, dual-use technologies – which have both civilian and military applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuel – can similarly reduce emissions while boosting military performance.

IBA has reported that International Airlines Group (IAG) has achieved the highest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use in Europe.

The data, aggregated through IBA’s NetZero Platform and published as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative takes effect, highlights how airlines are beginning to align their fuel strategies with evolving emissions targets and regulatory incentives.

With the European Commission now publishing SAF-linked emissions allowances by operator, IBA’s analysis compares group-level SAF performance across intra-EU flights, revealing a widening gap between early adopters and slower movers.

Note: CO₂ exposure and SAF blend data from IBA NetZero Platform. Allowance figures are from the official EU list of free

ETS allowances for SAF use in 2024. (1) IAG total is aggregated across its airlines – e.g. British Airways (including Cityflyer & Euroflyer units) ~155k, Aer Lingus 60k, Iberia 7k, Iberia Express 118k, Vueling 157k allowances. (2) Air France–KLM total includes Air France 254k, KLM 90k, Transavia NL 24.6k, Transavia FR 10.9k allowances. (3) Lufthansa Group total includes Lufthansa 19.7k, Austrian 50k, Eurowings 109.8k allowances.

IAG and Air France–KLM have both established clear leads in SAF use, with average EU airport SAF blends of 3.9% and 2.5% respectively in 2024. Both groups are focusing on SAF uplift at their major EU hubs to maximise ETS benefits and help offset the higher costs associated with using sustainable fuel.

IBA’s analysis shows a two-speed SAF market emerging in Europe with SAS and Finnair demonstrating steady progress, reaching 1.1% and 0.4% SAF use respectively in 2024. Lufthansa Group remains more conservative, with 0.2% group-wide SAF use and a moderate 5% target by 2030.

Ryanair and Wizz Air currently show very limited SAF use, yet both have set ambitious 2030 targets of 12.5% and 10% respectively.

Book and claim is a chain-of-custody model, in which the administrative record flow does not necessarily connect to the physical flow of material or product throughout the supply chain (ISO 22095:2020).

By leveraging the book and claim model, the Avelia platform aims to reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) aviation emissions and enable greater participation in the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. The platform provides wider access to the GHG benefits of SAF across the aviation value chain.

This agreement supports Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy by promoting greater SAF adoption as the market evolves, helping to make it a more commercially viable solution for advancing the energy transition.

Moeve is a leading SAF supplier in Spain, manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel at its La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva from used cooking oils, advancing the circular economy and supporting aviation decarbonisation.

It is building a 2G biofuels facility in Huelva as part of a joint venture with the capacity to flexibly produce up to 500,000 tonnes of SAF and renewable diesel annually, and is targeting an overall annual SAF production capacity of 800,000 tonnes by 2030.

Avelia was launched in 2022 by Shell Aviation in collaboration with Amex Global Business Travel and Accenture, with support from the Energy Web Foundation (EWF).

As of June 30 2025, Avelia helped inject over 41 million gallons of SAF into the existing fuel network at 17 airport injection point locations around the world, helping to abate over 370,000 tCO2e. 57 corporations and airlines have made transactions through Avelia.

In July 2025, Avelia announced its evolution into a multi-supplier platform, helping users access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple SAF suppliers including Shell. The integration of Moeve into the platform means that airlines, corporations, freight forwarders and shippers will now have broader SAF supplier choice, including Moeve and Shell.

Carlos Barrasa, Moeve’s executive vice-president for commercial & clean Energies stated: “In a dynamic book and claim landscape, Avelia stands out as an initiative that has demonstrated real scale and credibility in accelerating SAF adoption. We are proud to join Avelia as its first strategic third-party SAF supplier and see this agreement as a key step in our ambition to lead aviation decarbonisation in Europe.”

The long-running independent forecast, produced by Cirium Ascend Consultancy, predicts 46,500 aircraft will be delivered globally over the next 20 years, equating to a total value of USD$3.4 trillion, as airlines continue to invest in newer, more sustainable aircraft.

However, this year’s forecast comes as the aviation industry faces continued supply chain issues, geopolitical uncertainty, and delays to certification of new programmes, tempering the pace of fleet growth. The analysis projects a 6% reduction in deliveries over the next seven years compared to last year’s edition, mainly due to single-aisle aircraft production ramping up slower than expected. Long-term demand remains strong, with a 1% increase in deliveries overall.

Other key findings include:

Asia continues to drive fleet growth, accounting for 45% of deliveries, led by demand in China and India.

Airbus and Boeing are projected to deliver 85% of aircraft and 92% by value through 2044, while COMAC is expected to capture 6% of global demand.

Single-aisle aircraft now account for 71% of the global fleet, while twin-aisle and regional jets remain below pre-pandemic levels.

Stephen Burnside, Global Head of Cirium Ascend Consultancy, said: “This year’s Cirium Fleet Forecast shows the global aviation industry is moving forward with confidence despite near-term headwinds. Long-term demand remains robust across every region, airlines continue to invest in fleet renewal, and OEMs continue to incrementally increase their R&D budgets in preparation for the next generation of aircraft families. The next chapter of aviation growth is being defined by the need for supply chain resilience, production capacity right sizing, product and service innovation, and a focus on efficiency.

Aircraft utilization continues to grow as vast majority of operators plan on flying more or the same as they did this year

LAS VEGAS, Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today published its 34th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook, which forecasts a record-setting number of new business jet deliveries over the next decade. The report provides unique insights into current industry trends and longer-cycle developments based on forecasting models and surveys of hundreds of business aviation operators across the globe.

Within the report, Honeywell predicts 8,500 new business jets with a projected value of $283 billion – the highest in the report's 34-year history – will be delivered over the next 10 years with an average annual growth rate of 3%. The strong demand for new jets continues to persist against a backdrop of increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. However, those factors have not slowed down the demand for new aircraft.

""The combination of recent economic growth, increasing demand for fractional ownership and a steady cadence of new aircraft development and technology upgrades have produced record levels of demand in business aviation,"" said Heath Patrick, president, Americas Aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. ""Operators are increasing their usage rates and in turn manufacturers are continuing to ramp up production to keep pace with growing demand. Over the next decade, we expect these record-setting levels of deliveries and usage to continue.""

Key findings in the 2025 Honeywell Global Business Aviation Outlook include:

New business jet deliveries in 2026 are expected to be 5% higher than in 2025.

New business jet deliveries are expected to grow by 3% annually on average over the next 10 years.

91% of those surveyed expect to fly more or about the same in 2026 compared to 2025.

20% of operators globally have at least one aircraft on firm order – up from 17% a year ago. The figure was higher in 2025 for the subset of Part 135 and equivalent operators (private jet charters, for example), where 28% of respondents mentioned they have an aircraft on firm order.

89% of respondents consider ""Performance"" among their top three most important criteria when purchasing an aircraft, which compares with 82% from last year's survey. ""Cost"" remains a distant second at 56%, which is down slightly from 60% last year.

Demand for fractional ownership continues to lead industry growth with Midsize and Super Midsize being the jets of choice for these customers. Among those surveyed, 12% of operators of wholly owned business aircraft say they also own fractional shares.

Fractional fleets have grown more than 65% since 2019 to roughly 1,300 aircraft now in service.

Growth from fractional operators, new economic policy contributing to higher demand

Operators surveyed indicated that the return of 100% bonus depreciation following the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) earlier this year is expected to spur additional business aircraft purchase activity. This federal tax incentive allows businesses to deduct a large portion of the cost of certain assets – including business jets – in the year they are put into use.

According to the survey findings, strong demand for fractional ownership is fueling large orders and contributing significantly to industry growth. The fractional ownership market has continued to outpace the industry in terms of growth, both in fleet sizes and flight activity. In fact, fractional fleets have grown more than 65% since 2019. Light, midsize and super midsize jets comprise 80% of these fractional fleets.

While 12% of current operators of wholly owned aircraft said they also own fractional shares, 15% more said they are considering purchasing them in the future. When asked for reasons why they are considering purchasing these shares, nearly 50% of respondents said they would increase the overall flying capacity of their operation and 30% said they would use their fractional program to optimize their current flight operations.

Flight Activity: Strong year-over-year growth in 2025

Operators are flying their aircraft noticeably more in 2025 when compared to 2024, with business jet flight hours up about 3% year over year after flight hours were virtually flat from 2023 to 2024. This growth is derived primarily from private operators and fractional ownership companies, where demand for charter flights has stabilized well above 2019 levels after fluctuating throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of regularly scheduled airline routes.

Corporate flight departments continue to lag in flight activity as they seek to optimize various cost elements of their flight operations. This is often achieved through selective use of wholly owned aircraft, charter flights, and fractional ownership.

When asked, operators expressed optimism about their outlook for future flight activity, with 28% saying they plan to fly more next year compared to this year and 64% saying they plan to fly about the same over the same time.

Regional Breakdown: Recent delivery trends continue

North America: North America is expected to receive roughly 70% of new jet deliveries over the next three years as 17% of operators have aircraft on firm order and the region comprises a massive 62% of the global fleet. There is optimistic sentiment from operators in North America driven by regulation changes in the U.S. headlined by bonus depreciation. Operators in the region follow the global trend of flight activity optimism, with just over 90% saying they plan to fly either the same or more hours over the next year.

Europe: Europe is expected to receive about 14% of new jet deliveries over the next three years, and the portion of operators with aircraft on order is higher than the global average. Europe maintains 11% of the global business aviation fleet, but 29% of these operators state that they have at least one aircraft on firm order. The flight activity sentiment mirrors the global trends with nearly 30% of operators expecting to fly more in the coming year and about 60% expecting to fly the same.

Latin America: Latin America will accept 7% of global new jet deliveries over the next three years. 15% of the global fleet is based in the region and 19% of current operators there said they have aircraft on firm order. These operators tend to be more optimistic about their flight activity growth in the coming year, with 33% of them anticipating an increase.

Remainder of the world: Asia-Pacific and the Middle East & Africa regions are forecasted to receive 5% and 3% of global deliveries, respectively. Both regions have hovered around these levels for the past few years, and the trend is expected to continue. Operators in these regions are less bullish on flight activity growth than the other regions, but still nearly 20% of the region's current operators expect to fly more, with most of the remainder still expecting to fly about the same amount in the coming year. The Middle East is poised for growth as positive regulatory changes and improvements to airport infrastructure will make it easier for business aviation entities to establish operations in and fly throughout the region.

Aircraft Purchase Priorities: Performance and cost remain king

Aircraft performance and cost continue to be the two primary purchase drivers for buyers of business aircraft, with aircraft range being the single most important specification. Other aircraft performance-related specifications such as payload, field performance and speed rank near the top of the list of purchase drivers.

Buyers surveyed who are purchasing new aircraft prioritize customer support and technology more than buyers of pre-owned aircraft. Specifically, buyers of new aircraft place higher value on good response time and technical support when compared with buyers of pre-owned aircraft.

When asked about aircraft technology, buyers of new aircraft said they consider advancements in fly-by-wire controls, connectivity and advanced safety features in their purchase decisions more than buyers of pre-owned aircraft.

Sustainability in Business Aviation: More fuel-efficient aircraft key to environmental improvements

For the fifth consecutive year, Honeywell also conducted an analysis of sustainability in business aviation and examined how operators are trying to lower their carbon footprint. Key findings in the report include:

81% of operators believe that developing new, more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines is at least moderately effective in helping to achieve sustainability goals.

61% think sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is at least moderately effective in reaching those same goals.

Among those who are taking proactive steps to improve the sustainability of their operations, 60% are acquiring more fuel-efficient aircraft, 56% are using SAF and 31% are flying at more efficient cruise speeds.

Regarding the adoption of SAF, cost and availability of the fuel continue to be the largest challenges.

Verijet’s bankruptcy highlights the continuing challenges of building large-scale charter operations around very small jets.","Florida-based charter operator Verijet has entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy, bringing a quiet end to one of the most ambitious attempts to reinvent short-haul private air travel around a single-engine jet and a promise of cleaner, more sustainable flying.

Court documents show the company listed between $1 million and $10 million in assets and up to $50 million in debts at the time of its bankruptcy filing on October 9, 2025. The filing follows months of lawsuits from customers and vendors and comes a month after the death of Verijet founder and CEO Richard Kane, who suffered a heart attack while cycling on September 13, 2025, at age 60.

Founded in 2020, Verijet bet heavily on the Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet, the single-engine personal jet typically favored by private owners rather than charter fleets. Kane’s vision was to create a “green air taxi” network linking small cities and regional airports, using the SF50’s lower fuel burn and noise footprint to deliver a cleaner, quieter alternative to conventional light-jet operations.

The company claimed that the Vision Jet’s fuel consumption — around 60 gallons per hour versus 100-plus gallons per hour for most twinjets — cut carbon emissions by about 40%, and said it would use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) wherever possible while offsetting remaining emissions to reach net-carbon-zero operations.

Verijet operated on a jet card model, selling prepaid flight hours in blocks starting at $25,000. Rates averaged about $3,000 per flight hour, with one-hour minimum per leg. The company marketed its pricing as competitive with turboprop charter options while offering faster point-to-point travel. However, unlike traditional fractional ownership or guaranteed-availability programs, Verijet’s terms stated that flights were “subject to aircraft and crew availability.” That clause became central to later disputes when customers found themselves unable to book flights or reclaim unused balances.

From its base in South Florida, Verijet expanded to Texas, California, South Carolina, the Northeast, and the Caribbean, at one point ranking as the 13th-largest charter operator in the United States by flight hours. By 2023, it appeared to be a breakout success story in the emerging light-jet charter niche.

That same year, Verijet signed a letter of intent to merge with a SPAC led by former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, which would have taken the company public and given Muilenburg a board seat. But the plan unraveled when Muilenburg’s New Vista Capital liquidated the SPAC before closing the deal.

Soon after, lawsuits mounted from customers who had purchased jet cards — prepaid flight packages that promised convenience but not guaranteed availability. Many cardholders claimed they were left with large unused balances after Verijet canceled flights and stopped operations. Vendors, lessors, and fuel suppliers also joined the creditor list as the company’s cash flow dried up.

By mid-2025, Verijet’s once-active fleet of around 20 Cirrus Vision Jets had shrunk to just a few aircraft. Flight-tracking data shows little activity in recent months, and the company appears not to have flown any flights since Kane’s passing. While Verijet’s website remains online, it has not been updated to reflect the bankruptcy filing or the current status of operations.

Verijet’s downfall underscores the difficulty of scaling air-taxi operations around very small jets. The Vision Jet’s low acquisition and operating costs made it appealing on paper, but limited payload and range meant the economics depended on consistently high utilization — something no operator has yet achieved.

Verijet’s bankruptcy highlights the continuing challenges of building large-scale charter operations around very small jets. The company’s fleet of Cirrus SF50s was less expensive to operate than traditional light jets, but limited range and payload restricted its earning potential.

Other companies have tried similar short-haul charter concepts in the past with mixed results. The Eclipse 500 “very light jet” programs of the mid-2000s, for example, also struggled to sustain utilization and profitability.

At the same time, the industry continues to pursue more efficient aircraft and lower emissions. Major manufacturers are certifying new models for 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, and smaller operators are exploring hybrid-electric propulsion.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/10/02-Verijet-3-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 04:56:43.605976
,,2025-10-14 02:32:47+00:00,Deloitte,Taking off together: Why Asia Pacific needs regional low carbon liquid fuel partnerships,Not Available,,,,,https://www.deloitte.com/nz/en/issues/climate/apec-regional-low-carbon-liquid-fuel-partnerships.html,"As APEC leaders convene, the Asia Pacific region faces twin imperatives that demand coordinated action.
Energy density requirements, weight limitations, and operational demands create an inescapable reality: these backbone industries need liquid fuel solutions to decarbonise.
Policymakers across the Asia Pacific are coming to terms with this reality and acting on it in an increasingly decisive manner.
Companies building regional low carbon liquid fuel capabilities now position themselves advantageously for the consolidation phase that inevitably follows market maturation.
The groundwork laid through APEC coordination will determine whether Asia Pacific leads global low carbon liquid fuel development or cedes first-mover advantages to regions already acting decisively on both climate and security imperatives.","As APEC leaders convene, the Asia Pacific region faces twin imperatives that demand coordinated action. Climate commitments will require deep decarbonisation across transport and industrial sectors while energy security concerns necessitate reduced dependence on volatile fossil fuel trade flows. Low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) offer a rare solution that addresses both challenges simultaneously, creating an US$800 billion market opportunity across the region.1

The scale of this challenge becomes clear when examining the hard-to-electrify backbone of regional trade. Aviation, maritime transport, heavy freight, and industrial processes form the circulatory system of the Asia Pacific's interconnected economies. These sectors move the goods and people underpinning regional prosperity yet face fundamental physical constraints that make electrification commercially unviable. Energy density requirements, weight limitations, and operational demands create an inescapable reality: these backbone industries need liquid fuel solutions to decarbonise.

These applications account for nearly half of liquid fuel consumption across major regional economies. With aviation demand growing 2.6% annually and freight at 1.9%2, the challenge compounds without coordinated intervention - this is precisely why LCLFs emerge as the critical market catalyst.

Policymakers across the Asia Pacific are coming to terms with this reality and acting on it in an increasingly decisive manner. Deloitte’s SAF Lighthouse tool provides airport-level demand forecasting, revealing where Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is likely to take off, driven by emerging mandates. This, paired with the current pipeline of SAF projects under development, and volumes of competitive feedstock available, make clear that there is a significant opportunity for the region.

However, realising this potential requires overcoming significant investment barriers. Our analysis in the Refined Ambitions report for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation identifies five interconnected risks constraining private capital: demand uncertainty without harmonised policy, price volatility in fragmented markets, feedstock supply risks, technology risks beyond proven pathways, and policy uncertainty from inconsistent standards. These barriers persist across both developed and emerging regional economies, creating a coordination problem that no single jurisdiction can solve alone.

Understanding market development phases reveals why coordinated action creates competitive advantages. Four distinct stages characterise this evolution: export-led growth, domestic demand emergence, supply diversification, and consolidation. Companies securing partnerships during earlier phases capture disproportionate value as markets mature. Critically, competition between production pathways and feedstock supply is expected to reduce abatement cost significantly, making regional coordination not just strategically smart but economically essential.

The Refined Ambitions report points toward seven specific accelerators that can unlock investment barriers through coordinated regional action:

Increase market access - harmonise sustainability standards and trade frameworks

Increase risk mitigants - develop revenue certainty mechanisms and concessional finance

Reduce transaction frictions - standardise contract terms and regulatory processes

Send credible demand signals - coordinate policy and government procurement

Reduce information asymmetry - publish market benchmarks and supply/demand forecasts

Leverage innovation - coordinate R&D investments and technology deployment

Align value chain interests - facilitate partnerships and joint ventures

As outlined in Deloitte’s recent report, Accelerating Net-Zero: Critical Opportunities in Asia Pacific’s Climate Policy, the strategic imperative for regional leaders is clear – the only way to catalyse real change, at pace, regionally, is for policy to lay the groundwork for action, matched with private sector investment and innovation. APEC provides the coordination platform, but individual C-suite decisions across aviation, shipping, heavy industry, and fuel production will ultimately determine outcomes. The window for establishing regional partnerships narrows as other markets move decisively toward integrated approaches. In Deloitte’s recent 2025 CxO Sustainability Report, almost 50% of Asia Pacific C-suite surveyed noted that they are focused on developing new sustainability related products and services and actively implementing new technology solutions. SAF provides a key opportunity for these organisations.

Companies building regional low carbon liquid fuel capabilities now position themselves advantageously for the consolidation phase that inevitably follows market maturation. Those choosing fragmented national strategies risk higher costs, supply constraints, and competitive disadvantages as integrated regional ecosystems develop economies of scale and regulatory alignment.

The groundwork laid through APEC coordination will determine whether Asia Pacific leads global low carbon liquid fuel development or cedes first-mover advantages to regions already acting decisively on both climate and security imperatives.

The choice facing regional leaders is fundamental: build these capabilities together through coordinated partnerships or explain later why fragmentation was chosen when the stakes demanded integration and the pathway to success was clear.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -Fuel suppliers are using European Union green jet fuel mandates to inflate costs for airlines through surcharges, nearly doubling prices compared with market rates, the head of airlines body IATA said in an interview, calling for policy reform.

The EU began requiring airlines to use more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) this year, with a 2% minimum blending mandate set to rise to 6% by 2030.

While fuel suppliers are responsible for providing fuel with the progressively stronger blends of SAF at airports, airlines are obliged to purchase the available fuel for their operations.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told Reuters that oil suppliers selling SAF were able to ""extract additional profit from airlines by charging these compliance surcharges,"" adding that this should prompt European regulators to eliminate the mandates.

""They have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable,"" Walsh said.

Walsh did not specify which airlines had been impacted or which fuel suppliers were involved in price hikes.

Sustainable aviation fuel costs on average three to five times more than regular jet fuel.

Industry association FuelsEurope said there had been a ""significant and consistent decline of average SAF prices,"" citing third-party pricing data from Argus Media.

Energy companies have said they are not seeing enough demand for SAF to justify ramping up production, which some executives say is weighing on prices rather than driving them up. Several have scaled back SAF refinery projects in recent years.

Walsh was speaking in an interview on a separate report by IATA setting out $11 billion in extra costs in 2025 caused by congestion in other parts of the airline supply chain.

By mid-2025, Avelia had already facilitated the use of more than 41 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel across 17 airports worldwide.
This growth is expected to enhance Europe’s supply of renewable aviation fuels and support the region’s broader energy transition objectives.
Global Push Toward Aviation Decarbonization Despite increasing commitments to reduce emissions, the global SAF market continues to face supply shortages and scalability barriers.
A Step Toward Cleaner Skies Through its participation in Avelia, Moeve adds momentum to the ongoing transition toward low-carbon aviation.","Spanish energy company Moeve has become the first external supplier of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to join Shell’s blockchain-based Avelia platform, a global initiative designed to accelerate the use of cleaner aviation fuels. The collaboration marks a major milestone in efforts to scale SAF adoption within the aviation industry, which continues to face challenges in meeting decarbonization goals.

According to reports shared after the signing of the agreement, Shell confirmed that Moeve’s participation expands the reach of Avelia by introducing a new independent producer into its ecosystem of airlines, fuel suppliers, and corporate buyers. The development is seen as a significant step toward broadening supply chain participation and promoting transparency in the SAF market.

Expanding the Blockchain Network for Clean Aviation

Launched in 2022, Shell’s Avelia platform was created in partnership with Amex Global Business Travel and Accenture to streamline SAF transactions through a blockchain-based “book and claim” model. This digital framework enables airlines and corporate travelers to purchase the environmental benefits of SAF even when physical supply is not available at their departure locations.

The system allows buyers to claim verified emission reductions while fuel suppliers record and validate the actual use of SAF at participating airports. By mid-2025, Avelia had already facilitated the use of more than 41 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel across 17 airports worldwide. The inclusion of Moeve as a new supplier is expected to strengthen this digital marketplace, improving availability and traceability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

Moeve’s Role in Sustainable Fuel Production

Moeve produces SAF from used cooking oil at its La Rábida Energy Park in Spain, contributing to circular economy practices and waste-to-fuel innovation. The company has outlined plans to significantly expand its production capabilities, targeting a capacity of 800,000 metric tons per year by 2030. This growth is expected to enhance Europe’s supply of renewable aviation fuels and support the region’s broader energy transition objectives.

The partnership with Shell positions Moeve as a key player in the emerging digital ecosystem for sustainable fuels, enabling greater coordination between producers, distributors, and corporate clients through blockchain verification. This collaboration also reinforces the role of digital transparency and traceable carbon accounting in building confidence among buyers and regulators.

Global Push Toward Aviation Decarbonization

Despite increasing commitments to reduce emissions, the global SAF market continues to face supply shortages and scalability barriers. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported in June that SAF production is projected to double in 2025, reaching approximately 2 million tons. However, even at that level, SAF would represent only 0.7% of total global airline fuel consumption, underscoring the urgent need for expansion and investment.

Industry analysts note that initiatives like Shell’s Avelia and partnerships with independent producers such as Moeve are essential to bridging the gap between demand and supply. By leveraging blockchain for verification and accountability, the aviation sector gains a trusted mechanism to measure real emissions savings and build a transparent market for sustainable fuels.

A Step Toward Cleaner Skies

Through its participation in Avelia, Moeve adds momentum to the ongoing transition toward low-carbon aviation. The collaboration highlights how technological innovation—particularly blockchain—can foster coordination among diverse stakeholders, from producers to corporate travelers, in addressing the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

As aviation continues its pursuit of net-zero emissions, partnerships combining renewable fuel production and digital transparency tools are expected to shape the future of sustainable flight, moving the sector closer to its decarbonization goals.",https://www.cointrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/moeve.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 14:57:26.900592

Unlike Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Chapter 7 begins a process of liquidation where a company’s assets are sold off and the proceeds distributed to creditors. It typically ends the bankrupt company’s existence.

In documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida late last week, Verijet said it has assets valued between $1 million and $10 million and liabilities of between $10 million and $50 million. It has between 200 and 1,000 creditors.

Verijet operated a fleet of Cirrus Vision SF50s and billed itself as a green alternative in private air travel, with plans to increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and reach total net zero for all greenhouse gas emissions.

From its base in South Florida, the company grew rapidly, adding service to Texas, California, South Carolina, the Northeast, and the Caribbean. At one point, it was the 13th-largest private jet operator in the U.S.

Verijet’s apparent success brought attention from major players in the airline industry, and in 2023 it signed a letter of intent to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. The deal would have given Muilenburg a seat on Verijet’s board and taken the combined business public, but New Vista Capital opted to liquidate the SPAC rather than move forward.

Starting around that same time, Verijet was hit with lawsuits from customers who said they purchased “jet cards” for flights that Verijet canceled, delayed, and ultimately could not complete. The company maintained that its jet cards did not guarantee availability.

In September, Verijet founder and CEO Richard Kane died at 60. According to financial news website TheStreet, the carrier has not operated flights since Kane’s death.

Closing (Call-to-Action) To conclude, let’s turn to the original question – is an AI-powered economy sustainable?
[1] Energy demand from AI – Energy and AI – Analysis – IEA [2] Bogmans C et al (2025) Power Hungry: How AI Will Drive Energy Demand, WP/25/81, IMF working papers, published 10 April 2025.","Is an AI-Powered Economy Sustainable? And more importantly – what do we need to do to make it so?

Let’s start with the numbers, because context matters.

If AI were a country, how much energy would it consume?

According to the IEA[1], AI-driven data centres used about 415 terawatt-hours of electricity globally in 2024 – that’s 1.5% of global demand. That may sound small, but here’s the catch: energy demand from AI tripled between 2023 and 2024.

The IMF[2] now projects that by 2030, AI’s electricity use could reach 1,500 terawatt-hours (TWh), surpassing global EV consumption and approaching India’s total energy demand. Judging from the speed of adoption, even this estimate may understate reality in the next five years.

Part I – The Paradox

Does that mean we are doomed? Not necessarily. AI is both part of the problem and part of the solution.

On the problem side, training large models is resource-intensive. Emissions, water use, and compute demand dominate discussions, and for good reasons.

On the solution side, AI is already cutting costs and emissions in energy, transport, manufacturing, and healthcare, creating new businesses and products that previously thought not possible.

Innovation is also reducing the resource burden. For example, Deep Seek, a Chinese model launched this year, demonstrated training methods that dramatically lower compute and water requirements.

Another trend is moving away from huge general-purpose models to smaller, specialised models[3]. In healthcare, for instance, Diabetica-7B outperformed GPT-4 on diabetes tests. Domain-specific models are emerging in law, retail, finance, education and other sectors – more efficient, precise and fit for purpose.

The message is clear: the way we deploy AI – not the technology itself – will determine whether it accelerates sustainability or undermines it.

Part II – The Business Lens

Let’s ground this in concrete examples.

In Retail: Tesco, with more than 4,000 UK stores, uses Roambee, an AI-powered supply chain platform. By optimising inventory, logistics, and deliveries, Tesco save tens to hundreds of millions annually.

In Energy management: Octopus ’s tech platform, Kraken, manages charging for nearly 180,000 EVs – about 1GW of flexible capacity, equivalent to a nuclear power plant. That’s AI balancing the grid in real time, saving £1 billion in costs and supports UK’s net zero ambitions.

This is crucial because curtailment – which means switching off renewable generation to avoid overloading the grid, costing the UK £152 million in compensation for not producing energy. AI grid optimisation can help us avoid those losses while making the energy system more resilient as we upgrade our infrastructure.

In Utilities: Southern and Anglian Water use AI radars to detect sewer blockages early. This reduces costs and prevents environmental damage, demonstrating the value of preventative maintenance.

In Pharmaceuticals: AI is transforming drug discovery and trials. 86% of AstraZeneca’s small-molecule projects predict which molecules to design next and shorten optimisation cycles. In pathology, AI image analysis cut workloads speeding up biomarker identification. In safety testing, drug failures occur due to unexpected liver toxicity. The company built a Bayesian neural network to predict drug-induced liver injury – the model predicts and quantifies risks learning from new data.

Last year, I spoke with a group of Audit Committee chairs of the largest European listed companies on AI innovation. Using AI, a company was able to establish a global patient database for rare diseases because AI could identify patterns traditional methods could not. That makes treatments more financially viable for small patient groups.

Generative AI is also used in interacting with trial subjects and patients, reminding patients of medication schedules, monitoring feedback and vital health signals, leading to better health outcomes.

Across sectors, the message is consistent: AI can deliver real savings, unlock new businesses, and accelerate sustainability and impact.

Part III – Agentic AI

Looking ahead, agentic AI represents the next paradigm. AI agents – virtual, physical, and decision-making – collaborate with humans, handling entire processes with humans supervising strategically.

The paradigm shifts from human-in-the-loop as executor to human-on-the-loop as supervisor is a trend I called out at the Public Funds Forum last September, speaking to US state pension funds and treasurers in California, who asked whether AI was overhyped or not.

Things develop fast – we did not even use the term agentic AI then – it is very much a term that came into our vocabulary this year.

Agentic AI matters for sustainability because it allows scaling without proportional costs or resources, controlling energy and compute demands. End-to-end workflow design reduces waste and redundant operations. Streamlined decision-making improves resource utilisation.

But before we celebrate agentic AI as a sustainability upgrade, let’s pause. There are blind spots too.

As agents interact, unpredictable behaviour may arise, for example, competing for compute or destabilising power grids.

Even if an agent optimises a process – logistics or R&D – the footprint of the underlying infrastructure (chips, semiconductors, cooling water) is rarely factored into the agent’s objective function. Sustainability is not “by default.” It must be designed in.

Governance agents can provide guardrails, but they are only as good as the rules we give them. If sustainability metrics are not explicitly encoded, the system might optimise for cost, speed or growth only. That could lock us into highly efficient but unsustainable systems.

My key takeaway is that Agentic AI can amplify sustainability, but only if objectives, governance and social impacts are explicitly designed into the system. When we think we have less to worry about with straight through processes, we might actually have more to do upfront. Predicting every eventuality and assessing externalities as an ongoing learning process.

You might be wondering – Christine, you haven’t talked about the elephant in the room – job displacement and workforce reskilling. And what about careers? How do we build multi-stage careers in a world where we are expected to live longer, but our job security is being reshaped by technological disruption?

These questions are critical – because AI’s sustainability challenge is not only environmental, it’s also social.

Job Displacement & Reskilling: Agentic AI will automate not just routine work but decision-making. That creates efficiency, but it also reshapes the skills that remain valuable. Without reskilling pathways, we risk widening inequality between those who can pivot and those left behind.

Health & Wellbeing: The always-on nature of digital tools, constant reskilling pressure, and algorithmic monitoring can strain mental health. Physical health may also be affected as automation displaces roles tied to active, embodied work.

Multi-stage Careers: With longevity increasing, careers will no longer follow a simple linear arc of education, work, and retirement. Disruption accelerates the need for portfolio-style careers, where people retrain, pause, and re-enter, sometimes in a field that is completely different. Yet our pension and benefits systems are still designed for stability, not dynamic shifts.

Part IV – The Path Forward

So where does this leave us?

We should not think of AI as inherently sustainable or unsustainable. It is a tool, and its impact depends on the choices we make today.

Four choices, in particular, will shape whether AI becomes an accelerator of sustainability or a source of fragility:

Build Efficiency – prioritise smaller, specialised models and smarter training methods.

Optimise Systems – use AI make grids, supply chains, infrastructure and healthcare more resilient and less wasteful.

Encode Governance – design rules and social safeguards so AI optimises for sustainability not just cost and speed.

Redefine Human Sustainability – create pathways for reskilling, support wellbeing, and reimagine career and pensions for a longer, more disrupted future.

Closing (Call-to-Action)

To conclude, let’s turn to the original question – is an AI-powered economy sustainable?

The answer is: it can be — if we make deliberate choices.

AI will not determine our sustainable future. We will. And here’s where you come in. As consultants, you are in a unique position to guide clients on:

Translating AI innovation into business strategy.

Exposing blind spots that leaders miss.

Ensuring growth today does not undermine resilience tomorrow.

If you succeed, AI won’t just power economies – it will power the transition to a net zero, human-centred, and future-ready society.

While federal policy toward some clean or renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has soured, sustainable aviation fuel has largely been spared similar treatment.
But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel.","A Dutch company planning a sustainable aviation fuel production facility southeast of the Tri-Cities has cleared an important regulatory hurdle for the project.

State Department of Ecology officials in early September determined that SkyNRG’s manufacturing facility, being pursued by its North American unit SkyNRG Americas, would not create significant environmental impacts. The agency’s determination still set requirements for the company and project, from air and water quality precautions to mitigating reduction of habitat for ferruginous hawks.

But company officials said in a statement to the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business that Ecology’s decision is a critical milestone and they will continue to work with state and local stakeholders so the project continues to move forward.

“This brings SkyNRG closer to realizing a first-of-its-kind facility in the U.S. that will deliver domestic sustainable aviation fuel while advancing innovation and economic opportunity to Eastern Washington and across Washington,” said Nick Zollman of SkyNRG Americas in a statement.

SkyNRG’s facility will convert gaseous feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using chemical processes.

Once operating, the facility will produce an estimated 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually. It already has agreements in place with those wanting to buy its fuels.

SkyNRG has not released details about construction costs for the facility. Company officials have said construction will create up to 600 jobs and the facility itself about 100 jobs once production begins in 2029.

While federal policy toward some clean or renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has soured, sustainable aviation fuel has largely been spared similar treatment.

Congress’ passage of H.R. 1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, scaled back credits for sustainable energy that were instituted a few years ago, such as those supporting the purchase of new and used electric vehicles or installing solar panels on homes.

But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit initially went through 2027 but now extends through 2029.

The Walla Walla County site provides access to transportation networks and potential synergy with other regional efforts to harness agricultural waste for energy production and other industrial purposes.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001-23.

Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

The SkyNRG project is the one the state has thrown support behind. It received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

“This project aligns with our strategic growth priorities around clean technology and innovation,” said Joe Nguyen, director of the state Department of Commerce, in the statement announcing the grant. “In addition to furthering Washington’s leadership in clean energy and sustainable aviation, it creates family-wage manufacturing jobs that strengthen the local economy and community.”

SkyNRG has had to adjust its original plan to move forward. According to state documents, the company moved the facility to a different area of the business park than originally planned. The new site, located farther from the Columbia River, will have fewer environmental impacts.

Ecology’s recent determination also requires SkyNRG to make improvements to the intersection of Boise Cascade Road and Highway 12 if current state plans to widen and realign the highway don’t proceed. That is a possibility, as state and county officials propose further breaking up the next phase of expanding and rerouting the key route between the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla.

Zollman said the company is grateful for its partners as it looks to next steps.

“Important work lies ahead as we advance a project designed specifically to meet the benchmarks set by state and local partners,” he said.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/Focus/Construction%202025/Project-Wigeon-2025-layout-v2.jpg?height=635&t=1760371759&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 12:57:00.010003

In 2024, biofuel-based SAF dominated the market due to commercially mature pathways such as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) and Alcohol-to-Jet technologies. These fuels are already certified and widely used in scheduled commercial flights. Biofuel SAF accounted for the largest share as it leverages abundant biomass, waste oils, and agricultural residues.

Hydrogen fuel is an emerging high-growth segment, positioned as a zero-emission solution for long-term aviation sustainability. While hydrogen-powered aircraft require new platforms and infrastructure, investment and R&D efforts are increasing, especially in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. as part of hydrogen economy strategies.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels, also known as synthetic or e-fuels, represent a next-generation segment that uses captured CO₂ and green hydrogen to produce drop-in jet fuel. PtL fuels are gaining attention for their ability to decarbonize long-haul flights and reduce lifecycle emissions by over 90%, though production costs remain high today.

Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) fuels are commercially established and compatible with existing aircraft, offering a transitional option with cleaner combustion. GTL SAF adoption is growing where natural gas resources and carbon capture technologies are available, particularly in regions focused on synthetic fuel pathways.

By Aircraft Type

Fixed wing aircraft accounted for the majority of SAF demand in 2024, driven by commercial airlines, cargo carriers, and military jets. Long-haul and high-fuel-consumption aircraft have the highest decarbonization urgency, making SAF pivotal for international aviation.

Rotary wing aircraft, including helicopters and air ambulances, represent a smaller but growing segment. SAF adoption in rotary platforms is supported by search-and-rescue operations, offshore services, and defense programs prioritizing low-emission missions. As rotorcraft OEMs certify SAF compatibility, usage is expected to increase steadily.

By Platform

In 2024, commercial aviation dominated the SAF market, driven by large-scale airline commitments, increasing passenger volumes, and international sustainability mandates. Commercial carriers are integrating SAF blend targets in fuel procurement strategies, supported by partnerships with fuel producers.

Military aviation is emerging as a major growth driver as defense agencies invest in SAF to improve energy security and reduce operational emissions. Military contracts often support early-stage SAF commercialization and scale-up of domestic production.

Business aviation is adopting SAF as a premium, ESG-driven solution to reduce executive travel emissions. Leading private jet operators and FBOs are offering SAF at major hubs to attract sustainability-conscious clients.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) represent a niche but high-potential segment. As long-range cargo drones and surveillance UAVs scale, SAF can serve as a low-carbon alternative for missions where battery-electric power is insufficient.

Kenya Airways flew a Boeing 787-800, which was powered by a blend of biofuel and jet fuel in May 2023, marking the maiden flight by the national carrier with reduced emissions.
This facility could meet 15 percent of Kenya’s current jet fuel demand and 10 percent of its projected demand in 2030,” the study said.
ENI biofuel is mixed with jet fuel at a 50:50 ratio, making it ready for use in aircraft.
The Italian oil firm set a target of producing 200,000 tonnes of biojet (a blend of biofuel and jet fuel) annually two years ago.","Kenya needs a minimum of Sh30.45 billion ($235 million) investment to produce biofuel (sustainable aviation fuel) for airlines and replace up to 15 percent of the current jet fuel, according to a study by the World Bank.

The study shows that the funds can be used to set up the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) facilities that can produce up to 4,000 barrels per day (BPD) of biofuel by refining vegetable oils and waste oils.

The findings come amid a growing push globally to blend jet fuel with biofuels and shift to low-emission aviation fuel, a move that has potential to cut up to 80 percent of the carbon emissions by aircraft.

The study focused on how to resolve challenges and leveraging advantages to establish sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) across Africa. It focused on Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa given their dominance in Africa’s aviation sector.

Kenya Airways flew a Boeing 787-800, which was powered by a blend of biofuel and jet fuel in May 2023, marking the maiden flight by the national carrier with reduced emissions. The aircraft flew from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

“A 4,000-BPD HEFA plant producing SAF from UCO and castor oil requires an estimated investment of $235 million. This facility could meet 15 percent of Kenya’s current jet fuel demand and 10 percent of its projected demand in 2030,” the study said.

Local consumption of jet fuel stood at 732.34 tonnes last year, meaning that the investment could meet at least 109.86 tonnes of the fuel.

“Kenya has the potential to produce HEFA–based SAF using castor oil and UCO. Its existing infrastructure, including its petroleum pipeline network and Nairobi’s role as a regional aviation hub, provides a strong foundation for SAF production,” the study further said.

The report noted that government commitment to transition to clean energy, existing high-quality petroleum infrastructure and abundance of vegetable oils like castor seeds have placed Kenya at a vantage position to shift to low-emission aviation fuels.

Italian company ENI is currently involved in the local production of castor seeds in Makueni, Kwale, and Taita Taveta counties. The seeds are processed at its hubs in Makueni and Kwale before being shipped to Italy for production of biofuel at its refineries in Venice.

ENI biofuel is mixed with jet fuel at a 50:50 ratio, making it ready for use in aircraft. The Italian oil firm set a target of producing 200,000 tonnes of biojet (a blend of biofuel and jet fuel) annually two years ago.

Airbus and Boeing –the two biggest manufacturers of commercial jets in the world— have already publicly declared their plans to scale up use of biofuel.

Airbus conducted the first ever long-range flight of its A380 Jumbo fully running on biofuel in 2022 while Boeing has an ambitious target of manufacturing jets that are fully powered by similar fuels by 2030.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation says that a significant portion of SAF production will come from developing countries and emerging markets, where biogenic feedstock is abundant and renewable energy potential is high.",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/5228408/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/18b090f30d803d49bcf0df999b8ea61d/NQ/biofuel.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 10:56:52.379717

NBAA and the industry also made meaningful progress on business aviation security, with the rollout of a new FAA plan for removing personally identifiable information from the agency’s Aircraft Registry.
Safety, security, taxes and trade – these enduring concerns for business aviation figured prominently in the Washington policy arena in 2025.","As the calendar progresses toward year’s end, it’s a good moment to consider NBAA’s advocacy work to advance business aviation’s policy agenda, and the implications for the coming year and beyond.

For example, safety, the industry’s highest priority, was in focus perhaps as never before, as a series of troubling incidents and tragic accidents galvanized government leaders and the American public around ATC modernization as a national priority.

NBAA was a founding member of the Modern Skies Coalition, a group of more than 50 aviation organizations, that secured congressional legislation providing a $12.52 billion down payment for a brand-new ATC system, with investments in new technologies, facilities and controllers. In the coming months, all stakeholders will need to remain focused on achieving our modernization aims, and preserving America’s aviation leadership.

Our nation’s foremost position in aviation and aerospace was also a central part of this year’s debate over trade and tariff policies. As the administration considered agreements with trading partners, NBAA underscored the importance of the civil aviation sector, which has a $104 billion trade surplus, and supports 1.8 million jobs.

Key to this success story is the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, which creates a fair and even trading landscape for aviation, while maintaining high safety, manufacturing and certification standards.

NBAA welcomed a return to the 1979 agreement’s “zero-for-zero” approach to tariffs on aerospace products as part of this year’s trade agreements with the UK and EU, and we will continue working to ensure it is reflected in future trade arrangements.

The year also included a welcome development on the tax front, with the passage of NBAA-supported budget legislation containing permanent reinstatement of immediate expensing, or bonus depreciation, for new and used aircraft. Economists have long cited the success of this allowance in helping American companies upgrade key competitive assets, while supporting business aircraft manufacturing jobs.

The same budget bill also extended by four years the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit incentivizing production of sustainable aviation fuel to 2031.

NBAA and the industry also made meaningful progress on business aviation security, with the rollout of a new FAA plan for removing personally identifiable information from the agency’s Aircraft Registry.

In hundreds of comments submitted to the FAA to highlight the need for the new protections, NBAA members noted that publicly available, personally identifiable aircraft information has enabled flight-stalking by anyone, with any motive. Going forward, NBAA will work with the FAA to strike a balance allowing information for legitimate uses while safeguarding sensitive personal data.

Safety, security, taxes and trade – these enduring concerns for business aviation figured prominently in the Washington policy arena in 2025.

AI and energy security are key tailwinds for cleaner power

Multi-speed transition is playing out, but the long-term trend is unchanged to deploy $150trn in green technologies

The global megatrends of electrification and energy security are persuading investors in the green transition to look past short-term headwinds when allocating capital, according to senior executives at Nomura Greentech’s Sustainable Leaders Summit in Salzburg, Austria.

About $150 trillion of capital is required by 2050 to fund the global energy transition and despite recent inflationary challenges and slower progress from countries such as the US, there is a great deal of optimism about investing into green technologies.

While the cost of capital for renewables has reset at a higher level amid inflationary forces – a 200bps rise since 2021 with most of that increase coming since the third quarter of 2022 – executives viewed this as a sign that speculative capital is making way for long-term investors who see the inevitability of transitioning to sustainable energy systems.

There are reasons for optimism in all major markets including Europe, China and the US.

EUROPE – ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

Europe is committed to eliminating its dependence on Russian gas via its REPowerEU plan, which is accelerating the region’s decarbonization ambitions. Imports of Russian gas dropped from 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 52 bcm in 2024 – with the overall share of Russian gas imports falling from 45% to 19%, according to the European Commission. This intensifying focus on energy security means that the bloc continues to roll out renewable energy more quickly, with almost half (47%) of electricity in the EU now coming from renewables. Installed wind and solar capacity has increased by 58% cumulatively between 2021 and 2024.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also caused wider tremors among neighbouring countries, prompting them to prioritise defence spending in order to become more self-reliant in the event of a wider conflict. Germany has announced plans to nearly double its defence budget to €650 billion ($764 billion) over the next five years. Companies such as Fernride have spotted a trillion-dollar opportunity to create regional champions in the sphere of automated armoured vehicles in combat zones, at ports and for freight logistics on public roads. Fernride’s AI-based human-in-the-loop technology means that one driver can operate up to 50 trucks remotely to address massive shortages of commercial drivers (400k) and trained soldiers (300k).

Europe has also made considerable progress on installing electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Take Germany, - the bloc’s biggest country - where more than 145k public charge points have been installed and a forecasted slowdown in EV car sales has not materialised.

EUROPE – REGULATORY LEADER

Europe has also used its strength in regulation to encourage the adoption of green technologies across multiple sectors as illustrated by ReFuel EU, which aims to boost the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increasing SAF and eSAF mandates over time. SAF is derived from hydrotreated esters and acids while eSAF is a synthetic fuel drives from renewable energy such as solar, hydro or wind.

The FuelEU Maritime Mandate is another example of EU regulation taking a leadership role to drive change. The rules set increasingly strict limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, aiming for an 80% reduction by 2050 for commercial vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports. The International Maritime Organization created its own net zero framework earlier this year encompassing a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions.

In stark contrast to these sectors and to emphasise the powerful impact of effective regulation, summit participants cited the petrochemicals industry where regulatory drivers and subsidies are in short supply. Entrenched interests are high, and an oversupply of conventional petrochemicals is keeping prices low, meaning alternatives that carry a green premium struggle to compete with incumbents selling cheaper, higher-emission products.

CHINA – A LOW CARBON INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION

China’s decades-long investment into photovoltaic (PV) technology has paved the way for more affordable solar power across the globe. China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%, more than double China’s share of global PV demand, according to the International Energy Agency.

As a result, the levelized cost of PV solar power – which includes the cost of building the plant – has declined by 88% over the past 15 years; removing green premiums has been key to mass adoption.

In addition, China’s rapid rollout of battery technology for EVs has accelerated adoption at home and abroad.

The chart below shows that more than half of China’s vehicles will be electric by 2030.

US – MARKET FORCES DRIVE CAPACITY UPGRADES

While the US renewables market is contending with political headwinds arising from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs on imports of PV panels, aging grid infrastructure and greater power demand from investments in AI data centers could offset these negative effects.

The OBBBA reduces Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar but preserves full credits for energy storage and clean firm technologies through 2033. Tariff escalations and geopolitical tensions have intensified supply chain challenges, but as a result, a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing and alternative sourcing has emerged, even across hard to decouple supply chains such as critical components for batteries and PV modules.

High growth in the US power market is projected over the next 15 years as demand continues to outpace supply due to significant growth in sectors requiring near-term power. Over the last two decades, improved energy efficiency for lighting, appliances and heating and cooling meant that the compound annual growth rate for energy demand was about 0.4% per year but the new era of AI, EV penetration and electrification of everything is set to substantially increase demand to 3.5% per year until 2040, according to McKinsey data.

Historically, energy has not been a constraint on computing; even as higher internet traffic increased data center workloads by nine times between 2010-2020, overall energy use stayed flat because of more and more efficient chips. But the AI era is set to turn that paradigm on its head, leading to a 17-64GW shortfall in peak power demand by 2030, which will likely require fast-built solar and battery storage to fill the gap.

Every US region is in need of energy infrastructure upgrades and replacements to minimize impacts of congestion and increase reliability. All three major components of the electric grid - generation, transmission and distribution - have an identified investment gap, which is projected to grow to a cumulative $197 billion by 2029, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in existing energy infrastructure. The US utility industry expects to see about a ~1.6x increase in capital expenditures into critical infrastructure over the period of 2026-2030 representing $1.3 trillion in capex from 2026-2030.

In short, executives increasingly see a-multi-speed transition playing out with China using its industrial scale to take the lead on renewables and EVs while Europe uses the stick of regulation and energy independence to advance the green transition. The US faces short term challenges, yet it has already laid strong foundations to build resilient systems for an electrified, digital future.

Currently, most SAF is produced from natural oils using hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO or HEFA) pathways, but the limited availability of these feedstocks means that they alone will not meet the scale that is necessary to reach the current decarbonization objectives.

Ethanol, on the other hand, is a widely available feedstock globally with a well- established production infrastructure. This makes alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) a strong alternative to the currently preferred HVO/HEFA pathways.

The ATJ pathway enables ethanol producers to take advantage of their existing infrastructure to enter the growing SAF market and maximize profits by diversifying their product portfolio.

SAF produced via the ATJ process meets international sustainability standards such as the ASTM D7566 and supports compliance with regulatory mandates like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and EU Fit for 55 initiative.

Yet, in this fervent quest, an unexpected contender has surfaced, offering even greater potential: green methanol. While hydrogen has been in the spotlight, green methanol presents a viable, immediate solution with far-reaching applications. This shift could transform industries and redefine energy strategies worldwide. As nations like Germany, Japan, and South Korea advance their hydrogen initiatives, places like Tasmania in Australia are exploring this promising alternative. The impact of this development could reshape the future of global energy consumption.

The Global Hydrogen Race

Countries around the world have been actively pursuing hydrogen as a clean energy source, with Germany, Japan, and South Korea leading the charge. These nations have established strategic partnerships to import hydrogen, signaling their commitment to a sustainable energy future. Meanwhile, regions like the Middle East, South America, and Oceania are gearing up to become major exporters. Among these, Australia stands out, particularly the state of Tasmania, known for its 100% renewable energy profile and strategic location.

Tasmania’s potential for producing green hydrogen has attracted significant interest, especially in the northern part of the state. However, previous projects have faced technical and infrastructure challenges, stalling progress. Now, a new approach is emerging that could overcome these hurdles. The company ABEL Energy is proposing a paradigm shift: transforming hydrogen into a denser, more versatile form with immediate global demand. This strategy could position Tasmania as a key player in the global energy market.

Introduction

Massachusetts is one of the few states considering policies to subsidize Sustainable Aviation Fuels, or SAFs. This IPS report reviews the flawed policy recommendations from a recent report by an ad-hoc SAF working group convened by Massport, a state agency.

The report of the Massport’s ad-hoc Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Working Group claims that SAFs “have the potential to dramatically reduce lifecycle aviation emissions to near zero by 2050.” It offers recommendations about SAF, including further research on its emission reduction potential, the prospects for the local industry, and the use of subsidies to encourage early adoption.

This IPS paper reviews the best available science to determine the feasibility, energy requirements, affordability, and timetable regarding SAF. It finds that, unfortunately, aviation growth cannot be reconciled with the Massachusetts plan that requires emission reductions, unless low-emission fuels are available now. Yet all recent discussions regarding SAF are hypothetical and notably devoid of any commitment or timetable regarding the implementation of SAF.

The findings of the IPS report indicate that hypothetical future use of SAF should not serve as a green light for expanding aviation. We find that SAF solutions provide minimal or negative greenhouse gas reductions. They will not be available on a timetable that will contribute to the 2050 Massachusetts emissions plan. And in any scenario, they would require massive public subsidies.

These critical drawbacks are explained at length in the full report. A summary follows.

Key Findings

Sustainable Aviation Fuels won’t help Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

As the Commonwealth reduces GHG emissions in many sectors, aviation emissions continue to rise. The CO2 emissions from jet fuel consumed in the Commonwealth today are 5.9 megatons per year and growing, while the City of Boston’s emissions today (all sources except aviation) are 6.0 megatons per year and falling. The technical options to address aviation emissions by 2050 are limited.

Supporting basic research aimed at improving the efficiency of SAF production is prudent. However, proposals to drive production or consumption of SAF through economic policy or subsidies do not make financial sense, as SAF currently — and for the foreseeable future — increases GHG emissions.

While subsidies can be enacted at the state level, the subsidy required to drive the wholesale conversion to SAF would be unfundable.

SAF solutions will not be available at scale on a timetable that will have any significant benefit to the 2050 Massachusetts GHG plan.

E-fuel technologies are not realistic for Massachusetts.

The huge diversion of clean energy to e-fuel production will increase GHG emissions and be prohibitively expensive.

CO2 emissions are five times lower if we direct new clean electricity to the grid to displace natural gas, instead of using it to create e-fuel SAF. Put another way, a switch by Massachusetts to e-fuel based on grid electricity would save 5.9 MT of fossil jet emissions but add 21 MT of grid emissions, for a net increase of 15.1MT of CO2 per year.

To displace current fossil jet fuel use with e-fuel in Massachusetts would require annual subsidies of $2.9 billion to $16.5 billion. This is 2 to 12 times the entire annual Massachusetts Transportation budget of $1.37 billion.

The magnitude of electrical power required to produce e-fuel to meet Massachusetts aviation requirements is much more than the Commonwealth generates today.

Until the utility grid is completely decarbonized, every kWh of clean electricity generated must be applied toward the maximum reduction in CO2, and not toward the inefficient production of e-fuel.

In general, SAF simply isn’t a feasible way to reduce emissions at scale.

The most severe and unsolved problem with SAF is that its use increases CO2 emissions.

Any of the SAF production scenarios would require massive taxpayer subsidies.

Land use for crop-based fuels would compromise food security and lead to deforestation with attending reductions in CO2 sequestration. Inexplicably, the SAF Working Group’s recommendations fail to exclude proposed subsidies for this pathway.

Technical options to reduce aviation emissions by 2050 are limited: electric aircraft will only address a fraction of short-haul flights.

Conclusion and Recommendations

The two best ways to decrease CO2 emissions from aviation today are:

Ensure that inefficient modes of aviation are avoided. The Commonwealth should implement policies and infrastructure to transition short-hop local flights using small aircraft, like Cape Air, to electric aircraft as soon as possible. The Commonwealth should also reduce the use of private luxury jets, which produce the highest CO2 emissions per passenger mile. Subsidies for these aircraft should be eliminated.

Replace short flights with high-speed rail or other electric ground transportation. A significant portion of Massachusetts’s jet fuel is used for flights to the Northeast Corridor. The Commonwealth, working with other corridor states, should prioritize the development of true high-speed rail through legislation, eminent domain, and other methods. This presents the Commonwealth’s greatest opportunity to cut aviation-related GHG emissions by 2050.

Aviation emissions can only be reduced this century by flying less — particularly eliminating wasteful or inefficient trips — and by investing in low-emission ground transportation. Relying on speculative, expensive SAF far in the distant future is a dangerous excuse to avoid confronting jet aviation’s greenhouse gas problem now.

With the first ReFuelEU mandate beginning this year, 2025 credits will be a clearer test of execution.","Europe’s leading low-fare airlines, Ryanair and Wizz Air, are making minimal operational use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), even as other European operators secure significant financial benefits under the new ReFuelEU mandate.

Data compiled by IBA‘s NetZero platform reveals a major difference between the low-fare giants and established carriers like IAG and Air France-KLM.

Ryanair’s average SAF blend at EU airports was just 0.02%, and Wizz Air’s was even lower at 0.01%. This compares dramatically with IAG’s 3.9% blend.

Despite their current low uptake, both carriers have set some of the most aggressive long-term goals in the industry, pointing to a potential rapid shift in their fuel strategy as supply constraints ease and regulatory mandates take full effect.

While their operational use of SAF is negligible today, both airlines have committed to significant targets by the end of the decade. Ryanair has set a 12.5% SAF blend target by 2030, the highest reported ambition among the major groups analyzed, with Wizz Air aiming for a 10% SAF blend by 2030.

Both carriers currently face substantial CO₂ exposure within the European Union, as measured by IBA NetZero, with Ryanair at an estimated 996,000 tonnes and Wizz Air at 242,000 tonnes.

Low SAF usage means they are currently missing out on the financial benefits offered by SAF-linked allowances under the ReFuelEU scheme, which provides a credit against costs from the Emissions Trading Scheme.

This suggests their current low operational usage is a reflection of the initial scarcity of available fuel rather than a lack of intent. Their usage is anticipated to increase significantly as SAF volumes become more widely available and as the ReFuelEU mandate, which require all EU airports to offer a minimum percentage of SAF, starting this year, are enforced.

The report warns that the risk lies in future limits on SAF availability and increasing carbon prices, which could force prices up..

“For slower adopters, the risk is that supply constraints and carbon price pressures will narrow future options, forcing later procurement at higher cost. With the first ReFuelEU mandate beginning this year, 2025 credits will be a clearer test of execution. The advantage will rest with those treating SAF not as a short-term burden but as a strategic asset,” say the authors.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAF-refueling-003.jpg-e1731596256925-1024x702.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:00:34.759130

A Kenya Airways Engineer also provided crucial Engineering Insights, giving students a technical grounding in the real-world application of sustainable designs.

The pinnacle of the masterclass was the Student Masterclass Presentations, where four teams unveiled projects designed to drive sustainability and deliver major returns on investment. The projects were: ""SAF for Kenya"" by Kevin Maina: A feasibility study focusing on local feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production, ""Waste to Rest"" by Amani Emmanuel: A novel approach to converting aviation-related waste into useful products or energy, ""SAF AI"" by Ivy Cheruiyot & Stacey Ogombe: A powerful AI model for optimizing the blending and logistics of SAF and ""Green Miles"" by Joy Wangechi: A comprehensive model demonstrating how sustainable engineering can lead to significant operational cost savings for airlines.

The projects were met with strong approval during the open interaction session, which led directly to the announcement of a groundbreaking Recognition & Awards segment.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, represented by Zeta, and Kenya Airways, represented by Bett, jointly committed to advancing the development of the students' concepts. The airlines announced that all four student projects would progress to a new development phase under the mentorship and potential financial backing of both carriers.

The collaboration marks a significant moment for the University of Nairobi, the IEEE, and the African aviation sector, positioning the university as a vital hub for engineering solutions in the global push for net-zero aviation. The successful masterclass underscores the industry's recognition of young talent as a key driver for the profound technological and strategic changes required for a sustainable future in flight.",,N,,2025-10-13 09:00:52.875501

Coming at an opportune moment when the trading week began with choppy moves, the announcement has been a small ray of sunlight to the stock of oil giant investors, which are gaining slightly in the initial London trading despite the more general jitters in the market over the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

The shares of Shell, which trade on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker SHEL, opened just slightly higher, up 0.4 per cent to trade at about PS26.50 in the mid-morning. This increase is in the face of a flat FTSE 100 index itself, in the face of the lingering fears in the aftermath of the sharp sell-off on Wall Street last week.

The joint venture with Moeve not only supports Shell in the expanding SAF market but also shows the strategic shift of the company to low-carbon solutions, which makes a significant part of the long-term expansion strategy when regulators and stakeholders increasingly pressure companies to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Dismantling the Moeve-Shell Partnership

The core of this change is the Shell Avelia platform, a digital marketplace that was introduced in 2022 in collaboration with American Express Global Business Travel and Accenture. Avelia is based on a book and claim system where the airlines, fuel manufacturers and corporate clients can exchange certificates to use SAF without the actual delivery at each airport.

This system is based on blockchain technology that handles the issue of transparency, traceability, and verifiable claims, addressing one of the largest obstacles to scaling green fuels, which will demonstrate their environmental impact.

Moeve (formerly Cepsa and the second-largest Spanish oil refiner) is a major force at the table. The company has been increasing its production of SAF at its state-of-the-art La Rabida Energy Park plant, where waste-based feeds such as used cooking oil are used to produce drop-in fuels that can be used by the existing aircraft engines.

Moeve also intends to achieve a scale of 800,000 metric tons annually in output by 2030, which is a very high target, yet it is perfectly aligned with the world aviation aim to reduce emissions by as much as 50 per cent by mid-century.

Through incorporating in Avelia, Moeve will have access to an international market network of purchasers, comprising large airlines and organisations that are keen to neutralise their carbon footprints. In the case of Shell, this will be a milestone in broadening the supplier base of the platform to the outside operations of the platform.

Since its inception, Avelia has already certified more than 41 million gallons of SAF in 17 airports around the globe, yet the introduction of external participants such as Moeve is likely to accelerate the adoption of SAF.

According to industry pundits, this would see SAF being able to increase its portion of the total aviation fuel to something significant, 5-10 per cent by the close of the decade, as opposed to the paltry 0.7 per cent it has at the moment, which has been projected to grow to 10 per cent by the close of this year alone.

The partnership is symptomatic of a wider trend in the industry, in which the use of the industry experience of oil giants in renewables is taking place. SAF is a high-margin opportunity for Shell, which has already invested billions in hydrogen, biofuels, and charging of electric vehicles.

As aviation contributes approximately two per cent of all CO2 gases globally, the certified green fuel market is booming with mandates in the EU, which mandate 6 per cent SAF by 2030 and policies in the UK, which also mandate similar requirements.

Green Transition Strategic Implications to Shell

The agreement provides Shell with a point of contention over the speed at which it is selling off fossil products. In early 2021, the company announced its plan for the Capital Markets Day with a promise of PS10-15 billion annual returns to shareholders till 2025 and devoting up to 25 per cent of capital investment to low-carbon projects. SAF can be well placed within this structure, and it provides a transition between old-fashioned oil trading and energy services of tomorrow.

In the case of Moeve, the tie-up makes it more visible in the foreign markets. Being a comparably new participant in the SAF, which rebranded in 2024, the Spanish company can leverage an established network of logistics and the credibility of Shell.

The combined capability of the two (Shell being a digital expert and Moeve a production powerhouse) might reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of the supply chain, which will make SAF more competitive compared to conventional jet fuel, which is 2-4 times cheaper in terms of gallon-per-gallon prices. There is a feeling of optimism among the environmental groups because they feel that the news is a tangible move towards dealing with the promises of the Paris Agreement.

Nevertheless, there are still hurdles to overcome, a shortage of feedstock, and expensive initial capital investments may limit growth unless the government intervenes in the form of subsidies or carbon taxation. Such innovations benefit the UK with its Jet Zero strategy, which seeks to have net-zero aviation by 2050, which would result in thousands of green jobs in refining and distribution.

Share Price Dynamics: A Sceptical Rebound

In 2025, Shell shares have fallen by approximately 5 per cent since the year-end due to declining oil prices and negative geopolitical impacts on the company. The primary measure, Brent crude, rose 1 per cent today to approximately 72 per barrel, following a fall to five-month lows on Friday due to optimism that U.S.-China rhetoric would de-escalate.

The Moeve deal was another tailwind, with traders referring to it as a boost in interest in Shell’s diversified portfolio. Shell slightly outperformed its counterparts: BP fell 0.2 per cent as TotalEnergies in Paris rose 0.1 per cent.

The resilience of a PS10,000 investment in Shell over the last five years would have increased to approximately PS14,100. The company has recently paid 1.32 million shares back to the market as a buyback, demonstrating its confidence in the valuation.

In the future, Shell will provide more hints on the performance of trading with its third-quarter update, which will be presented later this month. It is projected to have a stable LNG, which is a boon in Shell earnings, yet refining margins are tightened due to oversupply.

Shareholders will be keen on the performance of the Moeve integration into the actual revenues, and this would be able to increase tens of millions of dollars in Shell SAF’s book in the near future.

Staying on the Broader Market Turbulence

The current FTSE 100 index covers volatility. Asian markets crashed on the profit taking, the U.S futures are signalling a possible recovery after Donald Trump reversed his tariff move against China.

In the case of UK energy stocks, the industry beats 1% a week, indicating optimism in hydrogen trials and wind offshore auctions, but with Russian threats of a hybrid invasion of the European grids, there is an element of risk.

Here, the SAF push of Shell would make it a progressive thinker. When Big Oil is struggling with dwindling mega-profits (down 30% as of 2022), such renewable investments as this joint venture may insulate dividends and fuel future growth. Shell has a forward yield of 4.2 per cent. and a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.5, which makes it a defensive income-seeking stock.

With the aviation industry racing to sustainability, the alliance between Shell and Moeve may be groundbreaking. To the shareholders, it’s a disturbance of the fact that in a transition period, flexibility is not greenwashing, but good business.

It remains to be seen whether this leads to a long-lasting surge or ends up being dampened in the vagaries of oil; however, one thing is clear: the skies are turning greener and Shell is in the flight.",https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leonardo_Lightning_XL_Shells_Avelia_blockchain_platform_integr_3-min.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:05.189583

It encompasses different modes of aviation, including an air taxi network, unmanned aviation and swarm flying, where several aircraft fly in close formation.
With nlmtd, I believe we can make it happen.” This way he helped introduce various innovations to the aviation industry.
Reversing the consulting model McNabb never considered himself a consultant.","Aviation veteran Clive McNabb has joined nlmtd with a clear ambition: restore the magic in flying. Not by going back, but by finally moving the industry forward into the 21st century: “We’ve got so much engineering capability, and yet we’re still stuck on two engines under a wing.” We spoke to McNabb about his vision and how it can become a reality.

Flying used to be special. Clive McNabb remembers it well, growing up in a family with a history in aviation. “I’ve been hanging around airports since I was 12. Still today, I’m happiest under the wing of a 747. How this 400-tonne piece of metal gets into the air – that’s amazing.”

McNabb started working in the industry at 20, and 48 years later he still is. Along the way, he has worked for companies like Britannia Airways, KLM, Scarabee Aviation Group, as well as aviation consultancies including NACO, and It’s in the Air. His own passion is still the same as when he was 12, but he sees the magic of those early days is gone.

“I was standing at the gate in Las Vegas, about to get on a 777 with KLM back to the Netherlands. I looked around and nobody was engaged. They were oblivious to the ballet going on all around them: all the engineers that were checking the aircraft for safety, the maintenance, loading the aircraft, planning the most optimal route – everybody takes it for granted nowadays. We should be in absolute awe.”

From service to mass transport

It’s not that he blames the travellers. The problem, he maintains, is that “we’ve forgotten we’re a service industry.”

“Our role is connecting people and cultures worldwide. And everybody loves traveling, but it’s no fun if you’re stuck in queues and crammed in tight aeroplanes. It’s all low-fare, low-cost now. We’ve become a mass transport industry.”

“Around 750 new aircraft of various types are being developed right now, almost all electric.”

This has also stifled innovation. “Airlines are running on razor-thin margins. And their business day-in day-out is keeping a schedule and flying safe, which they do incredibly well, but it means they aren’t open to a change of business model, because it risks that model of stability and costs them a fortune.”

From magic to shame

All in all, clinging on to the old has stripped aviation of much of its former glory. Especially since the lack of innovation is also slowing down the transition to sustainable aviation. The magic of flying has been replaced by flight shame.

This doesn’t mean there hasn’t been any progress, McNabb acknowledges. “Apart from the continued move to sustainable fuel, the fuel economy is also completely different nowadays. Today’s aeroplanes are much more efficient.”

There’s a very good reason most people don’t know this though, which also points to the lack of fundamental change: aeroplanes still look basically the same as when McNabb entered the industry almost five decades ago.

“We’ve got so much engineering capability, and yet we’re still stuck on two engines under a wing,” he says. “This is the 21st century, we’ve got to do better.”

Electric aviation

This is what brought McNabb to nlmtd. As part of the Amsterdam-based innovation and management consultancy, he wants to help finally usher in a new age of aviation.

And he sees possibilities everywhere, because even though Boeing and Airbus are stuck in the past, there are countless start-ups working hard to take aviation into the future. Undoubtedly the most important step in realising this ambition is the development of electric planes.

“We’re further along than many people think,” McNabb notes. “Around 750 new aircraft of various types are being developed right now, almost all electric. And yes, some of them aren’t going to make it, but there’s so much innovation. Right here in the Netherlands, we’ve actually got the most electric aircraft movements in the world.”

While the weight and capacity of batteries still put a limit on the distance an electric aircraft can cover, McNabb emphasises this is not as big of a problem as it is made out to be.

“We can already fly 600 kilometres, but with the newest batteries, we will soon be able to fly up to 1,000 kilometres. If we look at Europe, that’s nearly 50% of all commercial flights, meaning that as battery technology improves, the range will only expand further, and we could potentially decarbonise the vast majority of flights.”

Regional air mobility

A concept that fits seamlessly into this shift towards electric aviation is regional air mobility. It’s also McNabb’s “absolute passion.”

Regional air mobility uses smaller aircraft to provide fast, flexible transport between cities and regions that are too close for traditional airline routes but too far or inconvenient for ground travel. It encompasses different modes of aviation, including an air taxi network, unmanned aviation and swarm flying, where several aircraft fly in close formation.

“These are all technologies we can use to make aviation sustainable,” McNabb explains. “The challenge now is to bring them to the market. To see which concepts work in which situation, have open and honest conversations about what’s feasible and desirable, and develop working business models around them.”

Operations guy

This is a crucial part, because the aircraft are only one piece of the puzzle. “There’s so much to work out: new revenue streams, better passenger experience, human-oriented security, new airline opportunities, new IT. This is not the old way, not just transporting people. This is something completely new and different – and very cool.”

It’s also where McNabb’s own expertise comes in. “I’m an operations guy. I’m really about the business. About how you can make an innovation work, both for the passenger experience and cargo. I get into the details – loading the aircraft, managing passenger streams, emptying toilets, and so on. I ask myself and people around me: ‘Is that going to work? Would you use this?’”

“Until now I never had the support to drive it over the line. With nlmtd, I believe we can make it happen.”

This way he helped introduce various innovations to the aviation industry. At Schiphol, for instance, he was involved in the development of new self-service systems. For TSA, he helped make the security process at US airports more user friendly. He also founded the company Res2, which offers a Departure Control System.

Reversing the consulting model

McNabb never considered himself a consultant. But when he learned about nlmtd, he saw a huge opportunity to help accelerate the transition to new modes of aviation.

“One of my friends, who’s CEO of a US airport, once said to me: ‘I want to get access to the consultants who really know the business, but I don’t like the consulting model: I have to go to proposal, the consultants turn up, promise me the world, charge a lot of money and in the end give me a report I could have written myself. Can we not reverse this model?’ Well, that’s the nlmtd model – they reversed it.”

A crucial part of this model is that nlmtd doesn’t have to wait for a client to hire them. “We’re all entrepreneurs. We can start an innovation platform. For years I’ve had this passion for electric flying and regional air mobility, but until now I never had the support to drive it over the line. With nlmtd, I believe we can make it happen.”

Bring it together

Manuel van Lijf, lead for nlmtd’s Travel & Transportation sector team, is happy to welcome McNabb aboard. “I have known Clive for almost two decades and I’m very glad our paths are crossing again,” he says. “Clive brings decades of aviation knowledge and is determined to change the industry from the inside out with his passion for e-mobility. This is exactly the sweet spot for both nlmtd as well as our travel clients worldwide.”

Having joined in September, McNabb has already started setting things in motion. “I’m activating my network, telling people that I’ve joined nlmtd and we can finally work together. I’m really excited, I want nlmtd to be the spider in the web to bring this together.”

Of course, he’s aware of the many challenges still ahead – an industry full of big companies that don’t want change, regulations that have to be changed, legacy systems, and much more – but he’s hopeful it can be done. “Big changes have happened before. And also: it’s really cool. And if it’s really cool, good for the passenger and the environment, then why don’t we do it?”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-10-13-072320494-2025-10-10-013537791-Clive_McNabb_wil_vliegen_weer_magisch_maken___door_de_luchtvaart_eindelijk_naar_een_duurzame_toekomst_te_brengen_spot.jpg?webp,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:09.514728

Ans: India does have a potentially very advantageous position when it comes to feedstock for 2G ethanol.
It’s also going to be critical to ensure that the current 2G ethanol plants that are being commissioned can scale successfully.
In terms of scaling up 1G and 2G ethanol, what steps is Novonesis taking to reduce production costs and improve efficiency?","In an exclusive interview with ChiniMandi’s editor Prakash Jha, Hans Ole Klingenberg, Vice-President for Marketing and Strategy, Household Care and Industrial Biosolutions, Novonesis, shared valuable insights into the rapidly evolving biofuels sector. Klingenberg, with extensive experience across the U.S., South American, and European markets, discussed the growing significance of second-generation (2G) ethanol, a key renewable fuel derived from non-food biomass. As India positioning itself as a major player in ethanol space, Klingenberg highlighted the country’s unique advantage in feedstock availability for 2G ethanol production. With the recent policy shifts allowing 2G ethanol exports, India is poised to enhance its biofuel capacity, contributing significantly to both its energy security and environmental sustainability goals.

Q. With your vast experience in US, South American, and European markets, what are the key differences you’ve observed in the adoption of biofuels across these regions? How does India fit into this global landscape?

Ans: India has had some very impressive growth rates for biofuel expansion. In fact, we have never seen a rollout in any part of the world move this quickly or this smoothly, thanks to a very determined and structured approach by the Indian government. We applaud the government for finding a balanced way to manage both feedstock availability, as well as the rollout of new plants. The government’s structured approach in setting targets, mandates and timelines helped to create a very clear signal to the market. This is something that has also been instrumental in Brazil and the US. In these contexts, we have seen that the role of carbon markets, and related policy support has been critical for producers to invest and grow the low carbon fuels market as well. We hope for continued support from the India government as it continues its journey to decarbonize the transport industry in India, and we see room for additional expansion here.

Q. What role do you see biofuels playing in the global transition to renewable energy, and how does this align with Novonesis’ strategy for Household Care and Industrial Biosolutions?

Ans: Liquid renewable biofuels are a critical component in decarbonizing transport. In fact, it is the cheapest and greenest way to decarbonize road transport quickly. It also presents a fantastic way to create other social benefits as it supports local farm communities and jobs. It ensures less dependence on fossil fuel imports, and it provides a means for cleaner burning engines and less air pollution in the cities. As such, we see biofuels as being an instrumental tool that can be used here and now. As the world makes transitions towards low carbon strategies, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution towards mobility. Biofuel will be key, but also one among several solutions towards cleaner and greener transitions.

Biofuels also serve as a bridge to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. Long term, it’s also possible that biofuels may be used as an alternative for aviation fuels. Investing in biofuels now also creates the potential to invest and become a leader in future solutions for not just road transport, but also for heavy transport solutions that are greener.

Q. With India recently permitting the export of 2G ethanol, how do you foresee this decision shaping the future of the country’s biofuel industry? What opportunities does this open up for scaling up production, and what steps will be crucial for overcoming potential challenges in meeting global demand?

Ans: India does have a potentially very advantageous position when it comes to feedstock for 2G ethanol. So, it will be very interesting to see how this industry scales. It opens up potential new sources of income for the biofuel industry and for India as a whole.

Some of the critical things that will be very important to pay attention to when it comes to the 2G ethanol market is the premium and the mandates that are made available to this specific fuel category, as it is more expensive than 1G ethanol. As an example, in the EU there is a premium price afforded to 2G ethanol, but right now those prices are still relatively low, and will likely need further government support to allow the industry to fully scale. It’s also going to be critical to ensure that the current 2G ethanol plants that are being commissioned can scale successfully. In the past, there have been challenges to get this process technology up and running. However, we are optimistic that the industry is becoming more mature and is getting to a stage where it is able to get to true scale and thus be able to grow this market.

Allowing exports of 2G ethanol will facilitate price discovery, thus helping to establish a clear reference point for potential investors in the advanced ethanol sector. This is currently lacking in the local market. A continued trade/ demand certainty through exports would build trust and draw investments in this space, which is essential to scale up the industry.

Q. How do you perceive India’s agricultural landscape as a resource for the biofuels industry, especially in terms of raw material availability for 1G and 2G ethanol?

Ans: I think the critical piece here is to make sure that there is a continual focus on balancing feedstock supply and feedstock demand. Here, I think India actually offers a best practice for balancing the use of raw material. There is an annual accounting for feedstock availability of broken grains / rice, corn and sugar. This enables the Indian government to determine how much feedstock availability is reasonably available for biofuel generation, and work forwards to create standards and mandates for how much feedstock may be offered towards ethanol production in a given year. This ensures that there’s always a balance in resource utilization, and it promotes growth and expansion of value for farmers by giving them several outlets for crops, be it for food, or fuel.

This also allows the government to flexibly pivot if demand is stronger from say food rather than fuel, or vice versa – thus making sure that crops are not wasted or left in excess stock thereby resulting in low output prices for farmers. India has significant biomass availability so it can play a pivotal part in developing and scaling up the 2G industry – complementing ethanol production from existing feedstock and furthering India’s energy security and sustainability ambitions.

Q. With India’s strong push towards biofuels, especially in light of the ethanol blending and export policies, do you foresee a significant increase in investment in India’s biofuel sector?

Ans: We have seen very significant investments in India’s biofuel infrastructure in the past few years, and in fact, that investment path has been so strong that it’s helped India achieve its 20% blend rate 5 years ahead of the initial timeline. With 20% blending being reached this year, it seems evident that there will be a pause in investments here in the coming year while the government works to reassess the balance of feedstock and what the future blend rate should be. From our outside perspective, it does look like India has potential to grow higher than 20% blend given the amount of feedstock available, and also with the new growth potential that could be unlocked through future agricultural productivity gains. This could potentially enable India to move closer towards the type of setup that, for example, Brazil has, where they’re planning an increase in their blending mandate from 27% to 30% ethanol, and still meeting all their goals in terms of food availability, energy independence and decarbonization.

Q. What role do you believe biofuels will play in India’s energy security strategy, and how can they help the country move towards achieving its net-zero emissions goals by 2070?

Ans: Biofuels are a critical tool here. India’s approach to biofuels have been very holistic and unique in many ways. Having already displaced 1/5 of the gasoline pool in road transport is an amazing accomplishment. The potential to add another 7% blend rate is certainly there for 1G ethanol. In addition to that comes the potential that 2G ethanol represents – which could significantly reduce emissions from the current baseline in not only transportation but potentially also in biochemical production (with ethanol being the precursor molecule). Down the road there could potentially also be a biodiesel blend that could be say 5 to 10%. Through SATAT scheme, the Government is also enabling development of biogas/ CBG ecosystem – one of the very few countries to have blending target in CNG vehicles and PNG supplies.

In this world, India has become one of the leading global forces in biofuels, and biofuel technology. As we think longer term, down the road there is also the potential for use of these biofuels in new areas such as sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel (HVO). So, as we electrify more vehicles on the road, there’s potential to pivot some of that road biofuel towards airplanes, which will not be easily decarbonized with electric systems. Here India’s focus and investments in biofuels now, can position India as a leading player in these future markets.

Q. Looking ahead, what do you think the future holds for biofuels in India’s transport and energy sectors?

Ans: As with other regions and countries, I think India should play to its strengths. And that means thinking about what mix of different technologies are going to best suit the diverse needs of India across both the transport and energy segments. This means looking at different renewable technologies, be they solar, wind, biofuel, gasification or other technologies.

India does seem to have some of the same characteristics as countries like the US or Brazil, where you have very strong natural agricultural resources. India is also a very strong technology player and has a very strong and highly skilled workforce to build strong new renewable industry sectors. For those who lead the path, there is a real opportunity to become one of the leading global players in these future energy spaces. So, we believe there is a tremendous amount of opportunity for India when it comes to future renewable energy sources. For example, with the anticipated increase in CBG capacity and the implementation of blending targets for CNG supplies, India is poised to achieve largest volume substitution of natural gas with biogas/CBG in both transport and heating sectors.

Q. As India becomes a major player in the biofuels market, what do you think are the opportunities for international collaboration in terms of R&D, technology transfer?

Ans: India has the benefit of stepping into biofuels after several decades of technology development in the Americas. That also means that India has the potential to leapfrog and start with the newest technology and then adapt it to the specific needs of the Indian market. As such, we see a lot of potential for collaboration, both when it comes to engineering technology for bioethanol plants, as well as the biology that gets put into those biorefineries. As an example of that, we are currently working to make advanced yeast technology available early on for India to take advantage of. This is technology that has been developed in the US over several years, and India in this case has an opportunity to leapfrog to the latest generation of this technology early in the buildup of this industry. From here, we imagine India can also play a very strong role in developing new technology, for example when it comes to 2G ethanol, where we see India taking a leading role in beginning to build out this type of factory based on feedstocks that are uniquely suited to the India market, but also other global markets.

Q. As a leader in biosolutions, Novonesis is known for its innovative approach. Could you share some of the cutting-edge technologies or projects Novonesis is working on that could potentially revolutionize the biofuels industry, especially in emerging markets like India?

Ans: As I mentioned before, our advanced yeast technologies are some of the most important new technologies that we’re working to bring to our valued customers in India. These new advanced yeasts are both able to produce more ethanol, and they are also more robust toward a variety of changing production conditions. These new yeasts are also able to produce some of the enzymes that are necessary to run the bioethanol process, all in one simple biosolution. Looking beyond this type of yeast, we’re also looking to innovate new solutions that can help Indian bioethanol customers diversify their revenue streams. This includes new technologies for extracting more corn oil, that can be used as a feedstock, for example for biodiesel. Additionally, our biosolutions could upgrade the value of the DDGS, the animal feed product that also comes out of an ethanol plant, such that this feed component becomes more valuable to end customers. This provides a basis for a broader and more robust income base for bioethanol refineries in the future.

Novonesis also has a portfolio to augment biogas recovery/ yield by significant margins, helping improve the economics of the plants.

Q. Given Novonesis’ international footprint, how is the company engaging with countries like India to promote biofuel adoption, and what kinds of partnerships or collaborations are you exploring in the Indian market?

Ans: We work very closely with all the players across the value chain in the India biofuels market. That includes first and foremost our very dear customers as well as our close distribution partners. We also engage directly with a number of coalitions and stakeholders that support this industry, such as the Indian Federation for Green Energy, as well as other industry groups that support and contribute towards sustainable mobility and bioenergy. As such, we are seeking to make sure that we support the industry as a whole and help advocate for a balanced and sustainable approach to biofuels.

Q. In terms of scaling up 1G and 2G ethanol, what steps is Novonesis taking to reduce production costs and improve efficiency? How do you plan to address challenges for ethanol production?

Ans: We have been investing and innovating in biofuels for many decades, and we will continue to invest and innovate in biofuels for many more years to come. It means that we’re constantly looking for ways to improve productivity and profitability for our customers, as well as to drive value through diversification of revenue streams or other benefits that may help our customers sustain better operations. Over the past 10 years, we have thus helped our global customers improve their profitability every single year, year over year, with new technologies. We anticipate that this trend is going to continue both for 1G as well as for 2G, as we still see significant potential to improve and advance technologies for biofuels. So, we are very excited about continuing to innovate and support our customers and see this industry as holding significant promise for the future.

Q. Finally, as the biofuels industry faces both opportunities and challenges, what are Novonesis’ long-term goals in this sector? How do you envision your company contributing to the global push towards a greener, more sustainable energy future?",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hans-Ole-Klingenberg.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:15.749817

This change reflects decades of global conservation efforts. Despite ongoing threats, the green turtle population has risen by nearly 28 per cent since the 1970s. The species remains vital to marine ecosystems and human cultures worldwide.

Ecological Importance of Green Sea Turtles

Green turtles are keystone species in tropical marine environments. They maintain coral reefs and seagrass meadows, which support diverse marine life. Their grazing helps keep seagrass beds healthy and prevents overgrowth. These turtles also have cultural, spiritual, and economic roles in many coastal communities.

Conservation Measures Leading to Recovery

Efforts have focused on protecting nesting females and eggs on beaches. Community-based initiatives have reduced unsustainable harvesting for food and trade. The use of Turtle Excluder Devices in fishing gear has lowered accidental capture. Successful projects in Ascension Island, Brazil, Mexico, and Hawai’i have helped some subpopulations approach pre-exploitation numbers.

Remaining Threats to Green Turtles

Despite population gains, green turtles are still far below historic levels before European colonisation. Direct harvesting, both commercial and non-subsistence, remains a major threat. Fisheries bycatch causes mortality. Coastal and marine habitat destruction from development continues to harm nesting and feeding grounds.

Impact of Climate Change

Climate change is increasingly threatening green turtle habitats. Rising temperatures affect nesting beaches and hatchling survival. The Southwest Pacific subpopulation, including Raine Island in Australia, has seen declining hatchling production over several years. This signals urgent need for climate resilience in conservation plans.

Future Conservation Priorities

Sustained global conservation is essential to maintain and build on current recovery. Protecting habitats is as important as protecting turtles themselves. Healthy oceans and coasts are critical for turtle survival and human well-being. Coordinated efforts across countries and communities remain key to long-term success.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-13-10_41_40-AdobeStock_381020782_449435_reduced.jpg-1200%C3%97630.png?fit=1144%2C617&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-13 03:56:40.773328

IP Group PLC (LSE:IPO) CEO Greg Smith talked with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about the group’s potential future royalties following Pfizer’s announcement that it is acquiring obesity drug developer Metsera.

The transaction valued the business at up to $7.3bn, including $4.9bn in upfront cash. Metsera has a portfolio of promising therapeutic candidates and combinations with four programmes in clinical development and several next-generation programmes with IND-enabling studies ongoing, aimed at addressing key unmet needs via fewer injections while achieving improved efficacy and tolerability.

Smith explained that IP Group is the licensor of the fundamental technology behind Metsera’s lead compounds. If those drugs are approved and reach the market, Smith said the company could benefit from “some quite substantial royalties.”

He added that Metsera aims to begin Phase 3 trials by the end of 2025, with analysts forecasting first sales by 2029 or 2030. Smith said the underlying technology originated from the work of Professor Stephen Bloom at Imperial College in London.

Smith also addressed how this royalty stream could shape IP Group’s long-term strategy, suggesting that ongoing revenue might support its permanent capital model.

Turning to recent developments, Smith said IP Group realised around £160 million in cash from exits in 2024, including sales to Visa and Everfox. He noted confidence in hitting over £250 million in realisations from the private portfolio by 2027.

Smith also discussed the company’s £4 million investment into OXCCU as part of a $28 million funding round, citing strong third-party interest in sustainable aviation fuel technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical solution, but its high costs and limited supply have hindered adoption. Blockchain technology is now reshaping SAF supply chains, accelerating ESG compliance and unlocking new revenue streams through transparency, tokenization, and market innovation.

Accelerating ESG Compliance: Transparency and Trust

Blockchain's

ledger technology addresses a core challenge in SAF: verifying environmental claims without double-counting. , Accenture, and Amex Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) launched Avelia, a blockchain-powered book-and-claim platform, to track SAF's environmental attributes. By mid-2025, Avelia had facilitated 33 million gallons of SAF usage, avoiding 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions, according to . The platform's distributed network ensures that airlines and corporations can share credits for emissions reductions, enabling stakeholders to report progress toward ESG goals with confidence, as covered by .

This transparency is critical for ESG compliance. For instance, Shell Aviation has committed to abating 45% of its corporate travel emissions through SAF by 2030 (as reported in Sustainability Magazine). Avelia's co-investment model allows businesses to share the premium costs of SAF, reducing financial barriers and fostering collaboration (also described in the Sustainability Magazine piece). As Eva Wan, Shell Aviation's head of aviation digital strategy, explains, blockchain creates a ""single source of truth"" for stakeholders, ensuring credibility in emissions reporting (as discussed by NRI Digital).

Unlocking Revenue Streams: Carbon Credits, Tokenization, and Market Expansion

Beyond compliance, blockchain is enabling SAF supply chains to generate revenue through innovative mechanisms.

Carbon Credit Trading: Blockchain streamlines carbon credit management by automating verification and transactions via smart contracts. A 2024 World Economic Forum study found that blockchain-enabled supply chains can reduce emissions by 10–15% through optimized logistics and transparent reporting (

). For SAF, this means verifiable carbon credits can be traded in real time, aligning with regulatory frameworks like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, as noted in the sustainability study.

Tokenized Assets: Platforms like Avelia are tokenizing SAF's environmental attributes, creating digital assets that represent ownership of emissions reductions. These tokens can be traded or used to meet corporate sustainability targets (reported in the Decripto article). Tokenization also extends to raw materials and production processes, enabling traceability from feedstock to fuel. For example, IoT sensors integrated with blockchain can cryptographically hash data on CO₂ levels and geolocation, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards (as described by NRI Digital).

Market Creation: Blockchain is fostering new markets for SAF by addressing scalability issues. Avelia's ""Bring Your Own SAF"" feature allows companies to contribute their own SAF to the platform, increasing flexibility and participation (covered in the Decripto piece). This model has attracted major players like Google, Delta Air Lines, and Bank of America, demonstrating the platform's scalability (reported in Sustainability Magazine).

Challenges and the Road Ahead

Despite its promise, blockchain-enabled SAF faces hurdles. Scalability and interoperability remain technical challenges, while energy consumption of blockchain networks raises sustainability concerns (highlighted in the sustainability study). Additionally, small-scale producers may lack access to these technologies, risking inequity in the transition to SAF.

However, the pace of innovation is accelerating. By 2025, Avelia is expanding to air freight, broadening its impact (as noted in Sustainability Magazine). Meanwhile, advancements in IoT and smart contracts are reducing costs and improving data accuracy (as reported by NRI Digital).

Conclusion: A Strategic Investment Opportunity

Blockchain is not just a compliance tool-it's a catalyst for transforming SAF supply chains into revenue-generating ecosystems. For investors, the convergence of ESG mandates, carbon markets, and technological innovation presents a compelling opportunity. As the aviation sector races to meet net-zero targets, blockchain-enabled platforms like Avelia will play a pivotal role in scaling SAF and monetizing sustainability.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2e8a97cbc002.png,N,,2025-10-13 04:56:10.789279

Thai Seaplane has commissioned the Faculty of Environment at Kasetsart University to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA.
“To mitigate impacts, our engines and propellers are mounted above the fuselage, preventing collisions with marine life,” Mr Kasinpoj explained.
Thai Seaplane has partnered with **Thalang Technical College** to provide **scholarships and mechanic training**, preparing local youth for aviation-related jobs.
“We want Phuket’s young people to build their futures here, not have to leave the island,” Mr Kasinpoj said.","Mr Rodko told The Phuket News the initiative aims to make Phuket the regional hub for seaplane travel across the Andaman Sea, offering short, direct flights between the island and key destinations such as the Similan Islands, Krabi and Koh Lipe.

“Phuket will serve as the main gateway,” Mr Kasinpoj told The Phuket News. “Passengers will be able to land here and connect directly to nearby islands. We aim to reduce travel time, strengthen tourism, and create new opportunities for the local community.”

The company is currently awaiting final operational approval from the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) and the new Phuket Governor, following advice from Vice Governor Samawit Suphanphai to allow time for review. The seaplane operator is also coordinating with the Aeronautical Radio of Thailand (Aerothai) on the testing phase.

If approved, Thai Seaplane will initially bring in five aircraft, expanding to a fleet of 30 within five years, Mr Kasinpoj said.

“Each aircraft can carry up to 10 passengers, with retractable wheels allowing them to take off and land on both land and water,” he added.

The company’s first seaplane, registered ‘HS-TSP’, is now stationed in Phuket. The chosen hub site will be off Koh Taphao Yai, off Phuket’s east coast, selected for its calm, deep water and proximity to Phuket Town.

The water-based ‘runway’ requires only 600 metres of surface and a depth of 30-50cm, which Mr Kasinpoj said makes operations “less disruptive than traditional boats or ferries”.

He highlighted the time savings compared to existing routes:

* Phuket Airport to the Deep Sea Port: 10 minutes

* Phuket to Koh Kradan: 25 minutes (instead of 5–6 hours by boat)

* Phuket to Koh Lipe: 40 minutes

* Phuket to Krabi: 15 minutes

* Phuket to Koh Phi Phi: 10 minutes, with an estimated fare of about B4,000 (US$120) per trip.

The service will initially connect Phuket and Trang under a controlled testing ‘Sandbox’ programme hoped to launch next month, allowing Aerothai to monitor environmental effects, including engine noise, oil residue, and coral impact. If results show no negative effects, commercial operations could begin by mid-2026, Mr Kasinpoj explained.

Thai Seaplane has commissioned the Faculty of Environment at Kasetsart University to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA. The study covers marine ecosystems, air and water quality, and the potential effects on coral reefs and marine mammals such as dugongs.

“To mitigate impacts, our engines and propellers are mounted above the fuselage, preventing collisions with marine life,” Mr Kasinpoj explained. “Unlike speedboats, seaplanes don’t produce underwater vortexes that damage coral reefs.”

The company also plans to transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and recycled oils in the near future to lower its carbon footprint.

All EIA results and community feedback will be made public once the report is finalised. “We’re committed to transparency and ensuring safety and sustainability,” said Mr Kasinpoj.

Beyond tourism, the company aims to strengthen Phuket’s aviation workforce. Thai Seaplane has partnered with **Thalang Technical College** to provide **scholarships and mechanic training**, preparing local youth for aviation-related jobs. Each aircraft will require about **six pilots** and a full team of mechanics and ground crew, creating long-term employment opportunities for residents.

“We want Phuket’s young people to build their futures here, not have to leave the island,” Mr Kasinpoj said. “Our goal is to grow a Thai-led aviation sector that connects communities and opens the skies to new possibilities.”

Thai Seaplane currently has five pilots, including two licensed Thai seaplane pilots ‒ the first in the country ‒ trained in Germany and the Maldives with Trans Maldivian Airways (TMA), the world’s largest seaplane operator. Future Thai captains will be trained under a mentorship model, with one foreign captain training up to five local pilots at a time.

The project, entirely privately financed, will also support emergency medical transport and strategic operations in addition to tourism.

Over the next three years, the company expects to expand routes to cover the entire southern region, with Phase 3 connecting the Andaman Coast to the Gulf of Thailand.

“This project is about more than transport,” Mr Kasinpoj said. “It’s about positioning Phuket as the leader in sustainable aviation, where air and sea meet ‒ connecting people, protecting nature, and strengthening the region’s economy.”",https://www.thephuketnews.com/photo/listing/2025/1760328092_1-org.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 01:58:34.298330

Denis menegaskan bahwa Uni Eropa melihat PalmCo sebagai contoh perusahaan sawit yang taat terhadap regulasi dan berkomitmen kuat pada keberlanjutan.

“Saya sangat terkesan dengan upaya PalmCo yang sudah selaras dengan tiga pilar utama: hilirisasi produk, pengembangan energi terbarukan, dan penguatan ketahanan petani sawit,” ujarnya.

Hilirisasi: Mendorong Nilai Tambah Sawit

Salah satu fokus utama yang diapresiasi adalah upaya hilirisasi sawit yang dilakukan PalmCo. Investasi besar dari perusahaan-perusahaan Eropa, seperti Unilever, yang memanfaatkan minyak sawit untuk menghasilkan produk asam lemak menjadi salah satu bukti sinergi yang terjalin baik. “Uni Eropa mendukung penuh langkah hilirisasi ini, yang tidak hanya meningkatkan nilai tambah tetapi juga memperkuat rantai pasok berkelanjutan,” kata Dubes Denis.

Energi Terbarukan: Langkah Menuju Transisi Hijau

Aspek kedua yang mendapat perhatian khusus adalah komitmen PTPN IV PalmCo dalam pengembangan energi terbarukan. Upaya seperti pemanfaatan Compressed Biogas dan pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dinilai sejalan dengan strategi Uni Eropa dalam mempercepat transisi energi bersih. “Kami menyambut baik inovasi dan investasi PalmCo dalam energi hijau, termasuk penggunaan hidrogen, yang menjadi bagian dari agenda energi terbarukan global,” tambahnya.

Petani Sawit: Pilar Ketahanan dan Keberlanjutan

Dubes Denis juga menekankan pentingnya memperkuat ketahanan petani sawit sebagai fondasi jangka panjang industri sawit yang berkelanjutan. Menurutnya, upaya PalmCo dalam mendampingi dan memberdayakan petani sawit rakyat sangat penting untuk memastikan kesiapan mereka memenuhi regulasi deforestasi Uni Eropa (EUDR) dan menjaga akses pasar ke Uni Eropa. “Apa yang dilakukan PalmCo sudah tepat, dan kami berharap dukungan terhadap petani sawit dapat terus ditingkatkan,” sebutnya.

Komitmen Unilever dan Sinergi dengan PalmCo

Direktur Unilever Indonesia, Nurdiana Darus, menegaskan kembali komitmen perusahaan terhadap praktik minyak sawit berkelanjutan melalui kerja sama yang telah berlangsung sejak 2015 dan diperbarui pada awal 2024.

“Kunjungan kali ini menjadi kesempatan untuk mendiskusikan tantangan dan peluang dalam memenuhi standar EUDR serta menyiapkan petani sawit rakyat agar tetap kompetitif di pasar global,” kata Nurdiana.

PTPN IV PalmCo: BUMN dengan Komitmen Tinggi terhadap Keberlanjutan

Sementara itu Jatmiko Santosa, Direktur Utama PTPN IV PalmCo, yang menerima langsung kunjungan memaparkan bahwa PalmCo mengelola lahan seluas 618.000 hektar dan berperan sebagai pelaksana Proyek Strategis Nasional di bidang hilirisasi pangan, energi terbarukan, dan peremajaan sawit rakyat. PalmCo juga telah mendapatkan berbagai sertifikasi internasional dan peringkat ESG global yang mengukuhkan posisi perusahaan sebagai pelaku industri sawit berkelanjutan.

Selain aspek lingkungan, PalmCo aktif meluruskan berbagai mitos negatif seputar sawit dengan fakta-fakta bahwa tanaman sawit memiliki efisiensi tinggi dalam penyerapan karbon dan memberikan dampak sosial-ekonomi besar bagi petani rakyat.

“Sawit adalah anugerah bagi Indonesia. Tugas kita semua untuk membangun dan menjaganya. Termasuk hingga lintas negara seperti Uni Eropa ini,” imbuh Jatmiko.

Memperkuat Kerja Sama Menuju Sawit Berkelanjutan

Kunjungan Dubes Uni Eropa ini menjadi sinyal positif atas kemajuan industri sawit Indonesia yang mampu menyesuaikan diri dengan tuntutan global. “Kerja sama dan komunikasi yang erat akan menjadi kunci agar sawit Indonesia dapat terus bersaing di pasar Uni Eropa dengan standar keberlanjutan yang semakin ketat,” tutup Dubes Denis.

Host Ed Crooks puts that question to two industry leaders who are aiming to build hydrogen businesses at scale: Pierre-Étienne Franc, CEO of HY24, and Alex Tancock, CEO of Intercontinental Energy.
The first wins can come where hydrogen already has a job to do: swapping grey molecules for green in fertilisers and refining.
And over time, hydrogen can start meeting power and industrial demand via ammonia and methanol.
Some in the low-carbon hydrogen industry used to talk about how $1/kg was the production cost that would be needed for large-scale deployment.","Low-carbon hydrogen has taken a few knocks in the headlines lately. There have been cancelled projects and fewer splashy announcements. Policy support has been jittery. Is momentum fading, or are we simply moving out of the hype phase and into the serious work of delivery? Host Ed Crooks puts that question to two industry leaders who are aiming to build hydrogen businesses at scale: Pierre-Étienne Franc, CEO of HY24, and Alex Tancock, CEO of Intercontinental Energy.

Pierre-Étienne argues the market is normalising rather than stalling. The projects that are reaching final investment decision have risen sharply in size, and production of electrolyser modules has scaled from tens of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts. One crucial change is that the centre of gravity of the industry is shifting toward Asia and the Middle East.

The first wins can come where hydrogen already has a job to do: swapping grey molecules for green in fertilisers and refining. In the steel industry, the green premium for low-emissions metal looks manageable. And over time, hydrogen can start meeting power and industrial demand via ammonia and methanol. For heavy trucks, hydrogen may have a role as a complement to battery electric vehicles, deployed where long charge times and grid bottlenecks make them impractical.

Alex explains his production model. His 26-gigawatt Australian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara would decarbonise roughly 4% of the region’s iron-ore output. It’s designed as repeatable “LEGO blocks”: the project can be build out with dozens of near-identical phases that drive down cost with each addition.

Some in the low-carbon hydrogen industry used to talk about how $1/kg was the production cost that would be needed for large-scale deployment. Alex says that benchmark is no longer relevant. What matters now is capex, the supply chain, and the cost of capital, he says, and China’s ultra-automated factories are slashing equipment costs.

However, Europe still needs clearer rules to unlock demand. For sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, durable policy will be essential while costs remain high.

Ohne staatliche Anreize und eine faire Wettbewerbsgrundlage sei die Mammutaufgabe der Transformation, die von der IATA bis 2050 angestrebt wird, kaum zu bewältigen.","Der Luftfahrtsektor sieht sich mit den weitreichenden Zielen zur Reduktion seiner Kohlenstoffdioxid-Emissionen konfrontiert, doch die Machbarkeit des vom internationalen Airline-Verband IATA für 2050 ausgerufenen Ziels der CO2-Neutralität wird zunehmend infrage gestellt. Carsten Spohr, Vorstandsvorsitzender der Lufthansa, äußerte in einem aktuellen Interview mit dem Deutschlandfunk deutliche Skepsis hinsichtlich der Erreichbarkeit dieser Vorgabe, zu der sich die IATA-Mitgliedsunternehmen 2021 verpflichtet hatten.

Spohr verweist auf eine stockende technologische Entwicklung bei Flugzeugherstellern und massive Probleme bei der Verfügbarkeit und den Kosten alternativer Treibstoffe. Er betont, dass ohne weitreichende staatliche Unterstützung die finanziellen Belastungen für europäische Airlines zu einem schwerwiegenden Wettbewerbsnachteil führen. Die Aussagen des Chefs einer der größten europäischen Luftfahrtgruppen beleuchten die zentralen Herausforderungen, mit denen die gesamte Branche auf ihrem Weg zur Emissionsreduktion ringt.

Die stockende Flugzeugentwicklung

Ein Hauptgrund für Spohrs Zweifel liegt in der aus seiner Sicht unzureichenden Geschwindigkeit der technologischen Weiterentwicklung bei den großen Flugzeugherstellern. Weder bei Airbus in Toulouse noch bei Boeing in Seattle seien derzeit Flugzeuge in Produktion oder in der konkreten Planung, die einen großen, revolutionären technologischen Sprung im Sinne einer signifikanten Reduktion des CO2-Ausstoßes darstellen würden. Die aktuellen Modelle konzentrieren sich hauptsächlich auf die Erneuerung der Flotten mit marginal verbesserten, aber im Kern konventionellen Triebwerkstechnologien.

Die Luftfahrtindustrie sieht sich dabei mit einzigartigen technischen Hürden konfrontiert. Während die Automobilindustrie beispielsweise auf die E-Mobilität umgestellt hat, sind Batterien für Großraumflugzeuge aufgrund ihres Gewichts und des geringen Leistungsvermögens derzeit keine praktikable Option. Alternative Antriebe, wie wasserstoffbasierte Systeme, werden zwar von Herstellern wie Airbus erforscht. Experten gehen jedoch davon aus, dass selbst bei einer erfolgreichen technischen Lösung noch Jahrzehnte vergehen werden, bis Wasserstoffjets für Passagierflugzeuge in größerer Serie zur Verfügung stehen – wahrscheinlich zu spät, um die 2050-Ziele allein auf dieser Basis zu erreichen. Die Branche muss daher auf absehbare Zeit mit der bestehenden und sich langsam entwickelnden Großflugzeugtechnologie operieren.

Engpässe und Kosten bei alternativen Kraftstoffen

Die zweite Säule der Reduktionsstrategie, der Einsatz von nachhaltigen Flugkraftstoffen (sustainable aviation fuel, SAF), stellt nach Spohrs Darstellung ein ebenfalls massives Problem dar. Er bemängelt, dass die Produktion von SAF auf Biobasis deutlich langsamer ansteige, als ursprünglich erhofft. Dies führt zu erheblichen Zweifeln an der Verfügbarkeit der benötigten Mengen in den kommenden Jahren.

Die Faktenlage stützt diese Bedenken. Im Rahmen der europäischen Verordnung „ReFuelEU Aviation“ sind Fluggesellschaften ab 2025 zu einer schrittweisen Beimischung von SAF verpflichtet, beginnend mit zwei Prozent. Bis 2050 soll dieser Anteil auf 70 Prozent steigen, wovon ein beachtlicher Teil synthetisch erzeugt werden muss. Die EU-Produktionskapazität für SAF lag 2023 jedoch nur bei einem Bruchteil des gesamten europäischen Kerosinverbrauchs, was einen deutlichen Engpass markiert.

Neben der geringen Verfügbarkeit stellt der Preis ein erhebliches Hindernis dar. SAF ist aktuell deutlich teurer als herkömmliches Kerosin. Die Herstellung von synthetischen, theoretisch unbegrenzt verfügbaren Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Kraftstoffen steckt sogar noch weitgehend in den Kinderschuhen und findet größtenteils im Labormaßstab statt, was deren Kosten auf dem Weg zur industriellen Skalierung vorerst unkalkulierbar hoch hält.

Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch regionale Auflagen

Die europäische Gesetzgebung, insbesondere die Beimischungsquoten für SAF, erzeugt nach Ansicht der Lufthansa massive Wettbewerbsnachteile für in der EU ansässige Fluggesellschaften. Spohr betont, dass eine einseitige Verpflichtung zum teureren Tanken von alternativen Kraftstoffen für europäische Airlines ein großes wirtschaftliches Problem darstelle, da ihre internationale Konkurrenz außerhalb Europas von diesen Auflagen nicht betroffen sei.

Fluggesellschaften aus Nicht-EU-Ländern, deren Drehkreuze beispielsweise in Istanbul, Dubai oder Doha liegen, müssten die teuren Kraftstoffe nur für den kurzen Zubringerflug aus der EU tanken, während sie an ihren Heimatflughäfen keine vergleichbaren Quoten erfüllen müssen. Dies erlaubt es ihnen, Langstreckenflüge zu günstigeren Preisen anzubieten.

Die Lufthansa argumentiert seit längerem, dass diese ungleichen Bedingungen eine Wettbewerbsverzerrung verursachen, die zu einer Verlagerung von Passagierströmen an Drehkreuze außerhalb Europas führen kann – ein Phänomen, das in der Branche als „Carbon Leakage“ bezeichnet wird. Studien der Branche deuten darauf hin, dass die einseitigen Kostensteigerungen durch die EU-Regulierung (wie Emissionshandel und SAF-Quoten) die Ticketpreise an EU-Drehkreuzen signifikant erhöhen könnten, was eine Abwanderung von Passagieren und damit eine Verlagerung des Geschäfts ins außereuropäische Ausland zur Folge hätte.

Forderung nach staatlicher Unterstützung

Angesichts dieser komplexen technologischen und wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen, sowie der drohenden Wettbewerbsnachteile, sieht der Lufthansa-Chef die Notwendigkeit einer umfassenden staatlichen Unterstützung. Die Kosten für die notwendigen Forschungsinvestitionen, die Hochskalierung der SAF-Produktion und die Abfederung der Preisdifferenz zu herkömmlichem Kerosin sind immens.

Die Luftfahrtbranche fordert daher eine globale, oder zumindest kontinentübergreifende, Gleichbehandlung aller Akteure bei den Auflagen. Ohne staatliche Anreize und eine faire Wettbewerbsgrundlage sei die Mammutaufgabe der Transformation, die von der IATA bis 2050 angestrebt wird, kaum zu bewältigen. Die Debatte verdeutlicht den massiven Handlungsdruck, der auf Politik, Herstellern und Airlines lastet, um die ambitionierten Ziele mit realisierbaren technischen und wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen in Einklang zu bringen.",https://i0.wp.com/aviation.direct/wp-content/uploads/co2-4767453_1920.jpg?fit=1200%2C794&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-13 00:57:02.098443

The strategy forms part of the government’s Made in WA Plan, aligning with its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. It aims to help the State leverage its natural advantages and attract investment in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel — both crucial to the freight and logistics sectors.

WA is uniquely positioned for this transition, with ample supplies of oat, wheat, and barley stubble, as well as canola and woody biomass from mallees and blue gums, ready to feed a new generation of energy production.

Churchill Capital Consulting Pty Ltd (trading as SIA) will deliver the strategy, supported by GHD Pty Ltd, which will provide economic analysis of local feedstocks, supply chains and technology options. Stakeholder consultations are set to begin soon, ensuring regional industries and transport operators have input in shaping the plan.

“Advanced biofuels are vital additions to the clean energy mix, which have the potential to supply industry across our vast State with a sustainable alternative in the race to decarbonise,” Agriculture and Food Minister Jackie Jarvis says.

This breakthrough demonstrates that renewable liquid fuels represent a realistic pathway to cutting CO2 emissions in transport, highlighting the need to reconsider the ban on combustion engines by 2035.

Nexa 95 Gasoline of 100% renewable origin – Repsol’s highest-quality 95-octane product - is already on sale in the Madrid and Catalonia regions and will be available at 30 service stations in Spain before the end of the year.

The new fuel can be used in any gasoline-powered vehicle without the need to modify the car or the refueling infrastructure. Its use reduces net CO2 emissions by more than 70% compared to conventional gasoline.

To reach the climate targets set by Spain and the European Union, it is essential to recognize the contribution of 100% renewable fuels to the decarbonization of road transport, set long-term targets, and provide a favorable tax regime.

Repsol has achieved a new technological milestone by producing gasoline from 100% renewable sources on an industrial scale. This milestone, achieved at its Tarragona complex, positions Spain and the company at the forefront of the energy transition.

This new product, made entirely from renewable sources, is fully compatible with gasoline vehicles without the need for any modifications. Its use reduces net CO2 emissions by more than 70% compared to conventional gasoline. Nexa 95 Gasoline of 100% renewable origin - Repsol’s highest-quality 95-octane product - is already available at 20 service stations in Spain, in the Madrid and Catalonia regions. The company expects to reach 30 stations by the end of this year, in other Spanish cities such as Tarragona, Valencia, Zaragoza, and Bilbao.

With this new fuel, Repsol expands its range of renewable fuels, adding it to the already available Nexa Diesel of 100% renewable origin. This demonstrates that decarbonizing transport with renewable liquid fuels is a viable solution for combustion engine vehicles, whether gasoline, diesel, or hybrid. These vehicles today represent 97% of the Spanish and European vehicle fleet, and 87% of sales in Spain so far this year.

To meet the climate targets set by Spain and the European Union, it is essential to recognize the role of 100% renewable fuels and, consequently, to reconsider the EU regulation on CO2 emission standards, which proposes a ban on combustion engines by 2035. The uncertainty caused by this measure has led to considerable aging of Spain’s vehicle fleet, with an average age of 14.5 years and 8.5 million vehicles - nearly one-third of the total fleet - over 20 years old.

To accelerate the development of renewable fuels, it is essential to establish long-term targets - similar to those already in place for the aviation and maritime sectors - and introduce a favorable tax framework. These measures would provide the certainty needed to drive investment in more efficient engine technologies within the automotive sector.

Renewable fuels

To decarbonize mobility, Repsol is committed to a model that combines all solutions that reduce CO2 emissions, such as renewable fuels, electrification, LPG, and renewable hydrogen, which the company is developing. The company's vision is that all energy options - including conventional fuels used in combination with ultra-efficient engines - must be considered to guarantee supply, meet the needs of each customer, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible.

At its industrial complex in Cartagena in Spain, Repsol already operates the first plant on the Iberian Peninsula dedicated exclusively to producing 100% renewable fuels on a large scale, specifically sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. In 2026, it will add a second plant at its Puertollano complex, with the annual capacity to produce around 200,000 tons of 100% renewable fuel for road and maritime transport.

The innovative process for manufacturing renewable gasoline on an industrial scale carried out by Repsol in Tarragona is the result of more than 20 years of research and production of renewable fuels in their various forms. The technology was developed by the company’s scientists in collaboration with Honeywell. The exclusive formulation of Nexa 95 Gasoline of 100% renewable origin was custom-developed at the company’s technology center, the Repsol Technology Lab on the outskirts of Madrid, to maximize engine performance and keep it in optimal condition.

Repsol has established supply agreements for renewable fuels with leading heavy-duty road transport companies in Spain and Portugal, such as Scania, Grupo Sesé, XPO, Serveto, Havi, Joanca, Carreras, Rhenus, and Luis Simoes, whose end customers include Coca Cola, Freixenet, and Seat. The company also partners with Spanish passenger transport operators, such as Alsa and Avanza, and with maritime operators, such as Royal Caribbean. To promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel, Repsol has signed major agreements with commercial airlines like Iberia, Ryanair, Vueling, and Air Europa. The effectiveness of these fuels was also demonstrated by the Spanish Air Force’s Patrulla Águila aerobatic team during Spain’s National Day parade in October 2022.

• CAO is a way to gain exposure to China's growing aviation sector. With more Chinese travelling abroad and a growing middle class, long-term jet fuel demand is expected to rise.

• On top of that, China’s visa-free policy, now covering 74 countries, is driving a robust rebound in inbound tourism, directly benefiting the aviation sector.

In 2024, over 20 million foreign tourists entered China without a visa, more than double the previous year and nearly one-third of all arrivals.

• Another big thing for CAO is its expansion into a fast-growing niche, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

• As if that's not enough, CAO continued to grow its cashpile, reaching US$515.3 million by end-1H2025, up from US$500.3 million at end-2024 and after paying US$24.4 million in dividends.

• The cash amounts to ~60% of its current market value of S$1.13 billion.• For more, read what CGS says below ...

Excerpts from CGS report

Analyst: Tan Jie Hui & Lim Siew Khee

Expecting robust aviation volume in 2H25F amid festive holidays …

We believe China Aviation Oil (CAO) would have benefited from the summer holidays (midJul to late-Aug 2025) and the Golden Week festivities (29 Sep-10 Oct 2025), in terms of:

1) increasing jet fuel supply volumes across major Chinese airports, and

2) greater contributions from its 33%-owned associate Shanghai Pudong International Airport Aviation Fuel Supply Company (SPIA).

According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), international air passenger volume grew c.16% yoy in Jul-Aug 2025, averaging c.7.3m passengers per month.

International passenger traffic during the Super Golden Week is projected to have increased c.10% (vs. last year’s festive period) to 6.0m, based on scheduled seat capacity data from Cirium Aviation Analytics.

Shanghai Pudong International Airport served as the main international hub during the Super Golden Week holidays, handling c.800,000 international travelers, which should benefit CAO, we believe

… but partially offset by geopolitical tensions and weaker oil prices

Ongoing US government restrictions on Chinese carriers and persistent trade tensions may continue to suppress CAO’s long-haul jet fuel demand, in our view.

The recovery of US-China air travel remains limited, with capacity in 3Q25 reaching only c.25% of prepandemic 2019 levels, according to VariFlight.

Meanwhile, Brent crude prices remained subdued at c.US$69/bbl in 3Q25 (-14% yoy).

This may result in limited opportunities for favourable arbitrage trades, lowering margins.

Lower oil prices may also dampen associate contributions, particularly from SPIA, due to mark-to-market revaluations of oil inventories.

For 2H25F, we expect CAO’s gross margin to improve from 0.22% in 2H24 to 0.27%, driven by increased SAF trading, supported by the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, but to decline from 0.35% in 1H25 on fewer arbitrage opportunities.

We forecast associate contributions to rise 13% yoy to c.US$26m, led by stronger regional flight volumes (e.g. China-Japan and China-Vietnam), though slightly lower hoh (-6%) on fewer long-haul USChina flights.

* As at 31 December 2024

Stock is undemanding at 9x FY26F P/E; Add, with a higher TP

Reiterate Add on CAO, supported by its solid earnings outlook and decent 3-3.5% dividend yields for FY25–27F.

We roll forward our TP to FY27F with a higher TP of S$1.52, still based on 10x P/E (10-year historical mean).

Key catalysts: stronger rebound in outbound China air traffic, GM expansion, higher-than-expected oil prices, stronger associate contributions.

Downside risks: potential deregulation of China’s jet fuel market and rising competition in less established markets, such as the US and Europe.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 13 (Yonhap) -- Airbility Inc., a South Korean venture specializing in green mobility technology, plans to begin mass production of its homegrown drones next year to expand its presence in the unmanned aerial vehicle industry currently dominated by China, its co-founder has said.

Ahn Min-young, co-founder of the South Korean startup established in 2023, made the remark during an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Sunday at the Expand North Star exhibition held in Dubai.

""Unmanned vehicles are expanding their roles not only in everyday life but also in warfare amid growing drone threats,"" Ahn said.

""Drones play key roles in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and disaster response, along with emergency cargo delivery,"" he said, noting it is significant that his company seeks to mass-produce drones for the first time as a South Korean startup.

Ahn said the company plans to start production of the AB-U60, a 60-kilogram unmanned drone boasting a maximum speed of 200 kph, outperforming Chinese rivals' models that typically reach about 100 kph.

""Among others, the AB-U60 adopts a low-emission hybrid electric propulsion system for long-range flight using sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen fuel cells,"" Ahn said.

The model is capable of taking off vertically and can fly up to 100 kilometers on a single charge.

Airbility was launched with a combined investment of 4 billion won (US$2.78 million) from venture capital firms while securing another 4 billion won through government-funded projects.

""With each AB-U60 priced at around 300 million won, we expect to generate revenue once mass production begins,"" Ahn said, adding the company targets an initial output of at least 100 units in South Korea.

The co-founder said the company has drawn attention from Middle Eastern countries, without providing details, and is eyeing expansion into the North American and Southeast Asian markets.

""Based on technologies developed in South Korea, we aim to pursue local drone production meeting clients' needs,"" he said.

Going further, Airbility plans to produce an urban air mobility drone, the AB-M1300, starting in 2028, although the model remains at the concept design stage.

""We believe that the AB-U60 will serve as the basis for the AB-M1300, which will be capable of flying at a speed of 400 kph with two passengers,"" Ahn said.

""I think there have been three stages of development in the aviation industry, namely the birth of aviation, the boom of passenger aircraft and now the era of commercializing individual flight experiences,"" Ahn said.

Each offers unique advantages and challenges in the race to reduce emissions, cut costs, and maintain operational efficiency across commercial fleets. With air travel projected to double by 2050, finding scalable solutions is no longer an aspirational goal; it’s a necessity for meeting global climate targets and preserving the industry’s long-term viability.

While hydrogen and electric propulsion represent bold leaps toward zero-emission flight, SAF provides an immediate, drop-in solution compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. Yet the road to widespread adoption of these technologies is far from straightforward. Infrastructure limitations, energy efficiency, lifecycle emissions, and economic feasibility all shape the trajectory of innovation. This article explores how hydrogen, electric, and SAF technologies are reshaping aviation’s future, and which may ultimately take the lead in decarbonizing commercial flight.

Hydrogen: The Bold Promise Of Zero-Emission Flight

Hydrogen is one of the most promising long-term solutions for decarbonizing aviation. The Airbus ZEROe program targets hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by the mid-2030s, using modified turbines or fuel cells. Unlike jet fuel, hydrogen emits only water vapor, offering a pathway to zero-carbon flight when produced from renewable sources. Boeing also highlights hydrogen’s high energy-to-weight ratio and versatile propulsion potential, making it a cornerstone of the industry’s net-zero goals.

Significant challenges remain. Hydrogen’s low volumetric energy density requires large, cryogenic storage tanks, which in turn affect aircraft design and payload. Airports would require new infrastructure for production, storage, and refueling, along with stringent safety protocols. Current global hydrogen supply chains, particularly for green hydrogen, are not yet sufficient to support large-scale aviation.

As a result, Airbus has tempered its timelines, focusing partly on hybrid and SAF-compatible designs while continuing hydrogen R&D. Despite these hurdles, hydrogen remains central to aviation’s long-term decarbonization strategy, with success dependent on advances in energy production, storage technology, and infrastructure development.

Hydrogen Infrastructure: From Production To Airport Integration

Electric propulsion represents the most direct route to absolute zero-emission flight, offering quiet operation, reduced maintenance costs, and the potential for localized energy sourcing through renewable sources. Airbus has invested heavily in hybrid-electric demonstrators such as the E-Fan X and the CityAirbus NextGen, exploring configurations that combine batteries with turbine-based generators to extend range. Electric aircraft promise significant efficiency gains, with electric motors converting over 90% of input energy into thrust, far higher than conventional jet engines. Smaller all-electric aircraft are already proving viable for short regional routes, positioning this technology as a transformative solution for regional or even general aviation flying.

Yet, battery technology remains the defining limitation. Current lithium-ion batteries deliver only a fraction of jet fuel’s energy density, meaning that the weight of batteries quickly outweighs the benefits for medium- and long-haul flights. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), even with optimistic advances in energy storage, fully electric commercial aircraft will likely be restricted to short-range and commuter operations for at least the next two decades. The infrastructure for charging and maintaining electric fleets also poses logistical and cost challenges for airports and airlines alike.

For now, hybrid-electric systems offer the most practical bridge, reducing fuel burn and emissions while allowing conventional range and safety. As battery chemistry evolves and lightweight materials improve, electric propulsion may eventually power larger aircraft. Until then, its greatest impact will be reshaping regional and urban mobility, quietly, efficiently, and sustainably.

Technological Hurdles And Safety Considerations For Hydrogen Aircraft

Hydrogen-powered aircraft face significant engineering challenges that extend beyond fuel storage. Aircraft must accommodate large cryogenic tanks while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency and payload capacity. Fuel cell systems, which convert hydrogen into electricity, are still relatively heavy and require advanced cooling and insulation. Designers must balance weight, range, and safety while ensuring that aircraft performance remains competitive with conventional models.

Safety considerations are paramount. Hydrogen is highly flammable and diffuses quickly, meaning any leaks can pose serious risks. Engineers are developing multiple redundant safety systems, including advanced sensors, pressure relief systems, and fire suppression protocols. Airlines and regulators must also consider operational factors such as ground handling, refuelling procedures, and emergency response training. Lessons from liquid hydrogen use in other industries, such as spaceflight, are being adapted for aviation.

Despite these hurdles, research is progressing rapidly. Airbus, Boeing, and other manufacturers are running demonstrators and prototypes to validate new fuel storage solutions, hybrid propulsion concepts, and safety systems. While commercial hydrogen flight may still be decades away, these programs are critical for building confidence among regulators, airlines, and the public, laying the groundwork for a future where hydrogen can safely power large-scale commercial aviation.

Electric Propulsion: Quiet, Clean, But Range-Limited

Electric propulsion promises significant efficiency gains and near-zero emissions. Electric motors convert over 90% of input energy into thrust, far more than conventional jet engines, and their operation is nearly silent. Airbus and other manufacturers are exploring hybrid-electric and fully electric configurations for short-range flights, urban air mobility, and regional routes.

The main limitation of electric aircraft is energy storage. Lithium-ion batteries have much lower energy density than jet fuel, meaning aircraft weight increases rapidly with larger batteries. This constrains payload, range, and scalability for medium and long haul flights. According to ICCT studies, even with significant advances in battery technology, commercial aircraft are likely to remain short-range for the next two decades. Airport charging infrastructure and maintenance requirements further complicate widespread adoption.

Hybrid-electric aircraft offer a bridge solution, combining batteries with conventional turbines or generators. This approach reduces fuel burn and emissions while extending operational range. While pure electric flight is currently limited to regional applications, ongoing improvements in battery chemistry, lightweight materials, and power management systems could gradually expand the role of electric propulsion in commercial aviation, particularly for short-haul and urban operations.

Hybrid-Electric Solutions: Bridging Today’s Technology With Tomorrow’s Potential

Hybrid-electric aircraft blend conventional propulsion with electric motors, offering a practical pathway to reduced emissions today. By supplementing jet engines with battery-powered motors, these aircraft can lower fuel consumption during critical phases such as takeoff and climb. Airbus’ hybrid demonstrators, like the E-Fan X program, are actively testing these concepts to identify performance gains and operational feasibility. Hybrid systems can also act as a transitional technology while battery energy density and hydrogen infrastructure mature.

These systems provide flexibility in design and operation. Airlines can reduce fuel use and emissions without sacrificing range or payload, making hybrid-electric aircraft attractive for short- to medium-haul routes. Additionally, hybrid configurations can help manufacturers meet regulatory emissions targets and reduce operational costs through lower fuel consumption and reduced engine wear. Early adoption of hybrid-electric aircraft could accelerate the industry’s broader decarbonization goals.

Challenges remain, including integrating complex power management systems, cooling batteries during high-demand phases, and ensuring safety and reliability under hybrid operation. Nevertheless, hybrid-electric aircraft represent a critical bridge between today’s fossil-fuel fleets and a future dominated by zero-emission propulsion. By combining proven technologies with emerging innovations, hybrid-electric solutions allow airlines and manufacturers to experiment, adapt, and prepare for the next generation of low-emission aviation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels: The Scalable Pathway To Net-Zero Now

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) offer the most immediate route to decarbonization. Produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and captured CO₂, SAF can be blended directly with conventional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft without modification. This drop-in capability allows airlines to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, depending on feedstock and production methods, making SAF a scalable and practical tool for meeting near-term climate targets.

The main barrier is supply. Global SAF production currently meets less than 1% of aviation fuel demand, constrained by high production costs and limited infrastructure. Expanding supply will require significant investment in production facilities, policy incentives, and long-term contracts to guarantee demand. Airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and governments are beginning to collaborate on SAF programs to build confidence in supply chains and close the price gap with conventional fuels.

Despite these challenges, SAF remains central to the aviation industry’s strategy for immediate emission reductions. While hydrogen and electric propulsion offer long-term solutions, SAF enables existing aircraft to operate more sustainably today. Its drop-in nature, scalability, and regulatory support make SAF the most practical near-term pathway toward net-zero aviation, bridging the gap until emerging technologies can achieve wider adoption.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/flying.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-12 16:56:19.146717

This format risks obscuring the greater logic of the city’s climate and sustainability trajectory.

Yet if one steps back from the detail, a picture emerges of Hong Kong gradually repositioning itself as a hub for clean energy, environmental technology, and green finance. The challenge is not one of substance but of coherence: The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government must package its many commitments into integrated strategies that can be clearly promoted at home and abroad.

Hong Kong’s energy future is already outlined in the Climate Action Plan 2050, which commits the city to importing much more nuclear power from the Chinese mainland in the 2030s. That will make the city’s electricity supply far cleaner, providing the foundation for emissions cuts across every sector. But cleaner power will likely be more expensive. That makes energy efficiency in buildings and industry essential, both for climate reasons and to preserve the city’s economic competitiveness.

The government has pledged in this year’s Policy Address to accelerate carbon reduction in existing buildings, which account for roughly half of the city’s carbon emissions. Officials are beginning to explore new financing models, such as performance-based contracting, that could underpin a genuine retrofit strategy in the coming year.

Electrification is also moving forward. Electric vehicle sales are rising, and the government will launch a HK$300 million ($38.55 million) fast charger incentive program to deliver 3,000 new fast chargers by 2028. It is also supporting the development of battery-swapping technology for larger EVs, which could prove particularly efficient in a dense urban economy. Bus operators will be required to open their charging facilities to other vehicles, further broadening access.

Battery swapping should also be considered for electrifying harbor vessels — another policy area the government can explore in the coming year.

Concerning the city’s subway, the Policy Address refers to a “green, smart mass transit system”, with new rail lines to be built. The city’s rail operator already performs well, but new technology and artificial intelligence-enabled predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, and dynamic scheduling could drive further efficiency gains.

Hong Kong should package its commitments into integrated strategies — such as an energy and transport strategy, a buildings retrofit strategy, a circular economy strategy, and a green finance and technology strategy — each with a clear road map, measurable targets, and international messaging

The Policy Address points Hong Kong toward the next generation of transport fuels. A sustainable aviation fuel target will be set this year, with a local supply chain to follow. For shipping, Hong Kong aims to become a green bunkering hub, starting with methanol and expanding to hydrogen and ammonia, while cooperating with other ports to establish green shipping corridors.

There is a glaring omission: the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. Cruise tourism is expanding, more cruise ships are equipped to plug in, and the terminal was built to install onshore power. Closing this gap by enabling the private sector to be invited into this piece of infrastructure and mandating cruise ships to plug in would reduce emissions and air pollution, while aligning Hong Kong with international best practices.

The Policy Address highlights AI as an economic growth sector but fails to connect it explicitly to climate and sustainability. This is a missed opportunity. AI can serve as the nervous system of Hong Kong’s green transition, optimizing building energy use, coordinating charging infrastructure, managing port logistics, enabling predictive control in mass transit, and reducing waste through more innovative material flows. Framing AI as a tool for resource efficiency would show that Hong Kong is serious about integrating digital intelligence with climate action.

On waste, the Policy Address reaffirms Hong Kong’s commitment to the zero landfill goal. The latest government data show progress: In 2023, municipal solid waste disposal fell by 2.2 percent, averaging 10,884 metric tons per day (down from 11,131 in 2022). Per-capita disposal dropped from 1.51 kilograms per day to 1.44 kg per day. Domestic waste fell by 1 percent, plastics by more than 10 percent, and food waste by 3.4 percent, while the overall recovery rate rose from 32 percent to 33 percent.

Infrastructure is scaling to support this trend. By late 2024, there were over 500 public recycling collection points, covering around 80 percent of the population, up from around 300 previously. Smart food-waste bins in public housing estates experienced rapid growth, with daily usage increasing nearly 70 percent from May through October 2024.

These improvements are positive, even though the waste-charging plan remains shelved for now. The omission weakens incentives, but the downward trajectory shows encouraging momentum.

The financial sector is intended as another pillar. The Policy Address calls for the expansion of the HKEX Core Climate platform, linkage with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area carbon markets, and the introduction of new voluntary carbon standards.

Yet the reality is underwhelming. Since its 2022 launch, the voluntary Core Climate platform has hosted only a handful of trades and remains small in scale. Earlier reports from the Financial Services Development Council outlined principles for Hong Kong to become a carbon-trading hub. But these ideas have not been translated into clear policy.

Beyond talk and studies, little has been done. In this area — unlike in energy, transport, or waste — progress remains stuck at the discussion stage.

That said, the push to develop carbon audit services noted in the Policy Address has potential. If properly implemented, it could become an exportable expertise, strengthening Hong Kong’s credibility in international green finance.

On the commercial side, the B&R Green Development Cooperation Platform, with a planned training center for 2026, indicates that Hong Kong is at least positioning itself to export green standards and tools. But here too, credibility will depend on rigorous standards and delivery, not just branding. Cooperation between government departments and professional bodies is essential to get it right.

The 2025 Policy Address, viewed holistically, provides the raw material for a strategy, such as retrofits of existing buildings; transport electrification, battery swapping, and hydrogen; green fuels for aviation and shipping, including onshore power and green corridors for shipping; zero landfill; AI as the backbone of resource efficiency; and green finance and carbon audit services to reinforce credibility. Taken together, these elements could be transformative. But as long as they are presented as isolated sectoral commitments, their narrative power is lost.

Hong Kong should package its commitments into integrated strategies — such as an energy and transport strategy, a buildings retrofit strategy, a circular economy strategy, and a green finance and technology strategy — each with a clear road map, measurable targets, and international messaging.

The 2025 Policy Address provides the pieces. The challenge is coherence. If the government can connect the dots into a unified vision, Hong Kong could legitimately brand itself as a hub for the climate-tech-finance economy.

When the global business aviation community lands in Las Vegas for NBAA-BACE 2025 this October, it will be stepping into a show that has been purposefully reshaped.

The world’s largest business aviation gathering returns with more than 770 exhibitors, a streamlined new static display, and a reinvigorated focus on safety, sustainability, and technology.

Amid supply-chain pressures and environmental targets, manufacturers are coming to prove that business aviation is not only resilient but ready to redefine itself.

“Business aviation finds itself at a crossroads,” one industry executive told AGN. “It’s no longer just about speed and luxury; it’s about resilience, technology, and sustainability.”

NBAA-BACE 2025 aircraft: New jets and special-mission conversions

The newly renamed Aircraft Connection static display will be condensed to just a day and a half, running from the afternoon of 14 October through 15 October at Henderson Executive Airport, with no static display on the final day.

In a major shift, chalets have been eliminated to reduce exhibitor costs and focus attention squarely on the aircraft. NBAA President Ed Bolen said the change aims to make participation more efficient while creating a more accessible, aircraft-centred experience for attendees.

Gulfstream marks a highly anticipated return to NBAA-BACE after a two-year absence, bringing a full complement of aircraft—G400, G600, G700, and G800—alongside a mock-up of the forthcoming “G300”, which is expected to replace the G280 at the entry level of the family.

Bombardier will showcase its Global 7500, Global 6500, and Challenger 3500, while Textron Aviation will make the public debut of its Citation Ascend, expected to be certified by the end of this year.

A new “Tribute to Flight Pavilion” will also appear within the static area, pairing icons such as the DC-3, de Havilland Mosquito, and Learjet 23 with today’s advanced business jets; a visual narrative of the industry’s evolution.

Elsewhere, attention will turn to Dassault’s Falcon 10X, now in advanced flight testing, and to the growing number of special-mission conversions that blur the line between corporate jet and defence platform.

Business aviation safety and maintenance in focus

Safety will dominate the agenda more than at any NBAA-BACE in recent memory. The show hosts three dedicated safety events: the Single-Pilot Safety Standdown, Small Operator Symposium, and National Safety Forum. These are supported by dozens of panels on operational risk, pilot wellbeing, and aircraft reliability.

NBAA is also pressing the FAA for a “safety-first” approach to upcoming drone integration rules, reinforcing the association’s wider advocacy role.

In the maintenance halls, exhibitors and MRO specialists will highlight advances in predictive diagnostics, digital twins, and data-driven maintenance planning. For the first time, NBAA-BACE will offer Inspection Authorisation renewal credit, recognising the event’s growing educational value for engineers and technicians.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and alternative propulsion at NBAA-BACE 2025

Sustainability remains a defining theme, but this year it’s more operational than aspirational.

SAF will be available at both Henderson Executive Airport and North Las Vegas, with book-and-claim credit options allowing exhibitors and operators to log verifiable emissions reductions even if the fuel isn’t physically uplifted. Several manufacturers have confirmed that aircraft flying to the show will do so using SAF blends or credits.

The Business Aviation Sustainability Summit will expand on this foundation, featuring panels on SAF scalability, hybrid-electric and hydrogen propulsion, and infrastructure readiness. For operators, the discussion is shifting from policy to practice—how to source, verify, and integrate greener fuels across their fleets.

AI, digital flight decks, and the connected cockpit

Digitalisation is set to be a defining feature of NBAA-BACE 2025. Expect to see AI-driven cockpit assistants, augmented-reality training tools, and paperless flight-operations software that link maintenance, scheduling, and compliance in real time.

According to NBAA, AI promises to “boost business-aviation efficiency and productivity”, helping operators cut downtime and make faster, data-backed decisions. The sector is positioning itself as a testbed for innovations that will eventually migrate into commercial and defence aviation.

Business aviation workforce and skills shortages

Workforce and skills shortages continue to shape the business aviation conversation.

NBAA’s YoPro (Young Professionals) programme will take on growing importance this year, focusing on recruitment, retention, and leadership development.

With technicians and pilots in short supply, the industry knows that digitalisation alone won’t solve its human-capital crisis.

Outlook: What NBAA-BACE 2025 means for business aviation

Between its reimagined format, sharpened focus on safety, and tangible sustainability measures, NBAA-BACE 2025 is shaping up as a turning point for the industry.

Whether through greener fuels, AI-enabled cockpits, or smarter maintenance practices, this year’s show is about proving that business aviation remains both dynamic and essential—ready to meet the challenges of the next decade head-on.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NBAA-BACE-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 08:56:12.125009

Menurutnya, program ini tidak hanya memperkuat ketahanan energi, tetapi juga membuka lapangan kerja baru di sektor energi hijau serta mendukung target Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060.

“Ini adalah perjalanan transformasi Pertamina untuk mendukung agenda nasional mengenai bahan bakar nabati. Langkah ini menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia mampu menjadi pelopor energi bersih di kawasan Asia Tenggara,” ucapnya.",https://images.bisnis.com/posts/2025/10/12/1919572/bioavtur_pertamina_1755680600.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 07:57:16.640148

Major Airport Developments

At the heart of the government’s aviation modernisation programme are large-scale investments in airport infrastructure. The Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare has been comprehensively upgraded, and the Victoria Falls International Airport has been expanded to handle greater international traffic.

“These investments are already paying dividends,” said Hon. Sacco. “We see increasing traffic into Victoria Falls because it is one of the Seven Wonders of the World and a major tourism magnet. The improved airport capacity has made direct international access possible.”

Looking ahead, Zimbabwe plans to construct an entirely new airport in Mutare, in the country’s Eastern Highlands. The project will be undertaken by the same Chinese company responsible for the upgrades at Harare and Victoria Falls airports.

Additionally, the government intends to elevate Charles Prince Airport—north of Harare—to international status. In September, the Zimbabwe Airports Company noted that the project aims to transform Charles Prince into a hub capable of accommodating large-bodied aircraft and high passenger traffic. This forms part of a broader plan to support the development of a new city north of the capital, anchored by the recently completed Parliament building. “With the new city taking shape, a second international airport is essential to support its growth and decongest Harare,” the Deputy Minister explained.

Expanding Regional and Domestic Connectivity

Beyond the main gateways, the Ministry is pursuing upgrades at several regional airports, including Buffalo Range near Chiredzi, Masvingo in central Zimbabwe, and Hwange National Park. The latter will allow tourists to fly directly into the park, supporting the country’s thriving tourism economy.

Hon. Sacco noted the importance of re-establishing regular domestic flights: “Flying should not be reserved for those of means, it must be a convenient form of transport for all Zimbabweans. Reviving our domestic network is critical to achieving that.”

National Airline Recovery and Private Sector Growth

Air Zimbabwe remains a key focus under the government’s transport revitalisation framework. The airline, like many others globally, was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It now falls under the Mutapa Investment Fund, formally the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which also manages the restructuring of other state-owned enterprises such as the National Railways of Zimbabwe.

“The Fund is exploring leasing and aircraft acquisition opportunities for Air Zimbabwe,” Hon. Sacco confirmed. “We want to see the airline resume its traditional long-haul services to destinations such as London and China.”

At the same time, private carriers such as Airlink and Fastjet have strengthened their presence in Zimbabwe. Fastjet, a Zimbabwe-registered operator, has expanded its route network to include Victoria Falls, Bulawayo, and Lusaka, enhancing regional integration and connectivity.

Technology, Safety and Open Skies

Zimbabwe is aligning itself with international best practice through active engagement with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The government has adopted an Open Skies policy, encouraging more airlines to enter Zimbabwean airspace and securing fifth-freedom traffic rights to facilitate regional routes.

“Our radar systems have also been upgraded to enhance air safety,” Hon. Sacco noted. “We are ensuring that Zimbabwe’s skies remain a safer place to fly.”

Pioneering Sustainable Aviation Fuels

One of Zimbabwe’s most forward-looking initiatives is its collaboration with ICAO and the UK government to develop a local sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. The country already produces ethanol for blending and uses sugarcane as a feedstock, and aims to extend this capability to produce ethanol-derived Jet A-1 fuel.

“Zimbabwe is well positioned to become a regional hub for SAF production,” said Hon. Sacco. “We have abundant land, water bodies, and suitable non-food crops, meaning we can develop feedstock without competing with food production.”

A feasibility study, funded by ICAO and supported by the UK government, has already been completed. The next stage, a business plan also supported by ICAO and the UK government, to outline viable production models and financing structures, is nearing completion. Once it’s done, the next steps will be to move towards implementation and investor engagement, hopefully by the end of this year.

Hon. Sacco emphasised that local communities would play a key role: “We want to empower smallholder farmers living near water bodies to cultivate feedstock crops under irrigation. This will create a sustainable supply chain, from the farm to the refinery.”

A New Chapter for Zimbabwean Aviation

With its focus on infrastructure, technology, and sustainability, Zimbabwe’s aviation sector is positioning itself for a dynamic new era. For Hon. Sacco, aviation development is inseparable from national growth: “Aviation is vital not only for tourism but also for business. It opens our country to the world.”",https://africanpilot.africa/wp-content/uploads/DSC03587.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 11:56:49.991108

It will be Eni's second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site, according to Eni.
The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.
Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.
""Eni has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for Environmental Impact Assessment"", Eni said in a press release September 23.","Eni SpA said Thursday it had launched the authorization process for an Environmental Impact Assessment to build a biorefinery and a chemical recycling plant in Sicily, after receiving approval from Italy's Environment and Energy Security Ministry.

Designed to produce up to 500,000 metric tons per annum (MMtpa) of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the Priolo project will rise on the site of an Eni ethylene plant set to be decommissioned, the state-backed energy major said in a press release.

It will be Eni's second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site, according to Eni.

The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.

Besides the Ecofining™ plant, the project will include a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit and a hydrogen production plant, it said.

Meanwhile the project's chemical recycling unit will have a processing capacity of 40,000 MMtpa and produce around 32,000 MMtpa of pyrolysis oil, Eni said.

The recycling plant will use the proprietary Hoop technology of Eni's chemicals business Versalis SpA, based on the pyrolysis of mixed plastic packaging waste.

The Priolo project will be the first deployment of the technology at a commercial scale, after the decommissioning of a demonstration plant at the Versalis plant in Mantua in June, Eni said.

""This technology, which complements mechanical recycling, transforms mixed plastic waste into raw material for the production of new plastic products suitable for all applications, including food contact and pharmaceutical packaging"", Eni said.

Developed from a joint project with Italian engineering company Servizi di Ricerche e Sviluppo SRL, the technology has high material recovery yields and feedstock flexibility, according to Eni.

Last month Eni said it had received approval from the ministry to convert several units at the Sannazzaro de' Burgondi refinery in Pavia into a biorefinery.

The refinery will continue traditional operations alongside a new processing capacity of 550,000 MMtpa for biofuel feedstock, mainly waste and residues. Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.

""Eni has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for Environmental Impact Assessment"", Eni said in a press release September 23.

""The project involves converting the existing Hydrocracker unit using Ecofining™ technology and constructing a pre-treatment unit for waste and residues, which are the main biogenic feedstocks Enilive uses to produce HVO biofuels"", Eni added. Enilive is Eni's biofuels arm.

""The new Sannazzaro biorefinery will strengthen the site’s strategic role in supplying traditional jet fuel and SAF to north-west Italian airports, via both the pipeline connection to Milan Malpensa airport and depots connected to the refinery near other airports"", it said.

""Through Enilive, Eni is already the second-largest producer of HVO biofuels in Europe, including both diesel and biojet (SAF)"", the company said.

Eni has set goals to grow its biorefining capacity from the current 1.65 million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) to over three million by 2028 and more than five MMtpa by 2030, with the potential to produce up to two MMtpa of SAF by 2030.

Eni's current biofuels production come from two Italian plants in Venice and Gela and a United States plant in Louisiana, operated under its 50 percent-owned joint venture St Bernard Renewables LLC, according to the company.

""A third Italian biorefinery is due to come on stream in Livorno in 2026, followed by two plants currently under construction in Malaysia and South Korea; a further biorefinery in Italy has been announced for Priolo, Sicily"", Eni said.

The Cape Winelands Airport is moving closer to take-off, with developers confirming plans for construction to begin in the new year, pending environmental approval.

Environmental Authorisation to clear new airport lift-off

The final stages of the airport's Environmental Authorisation process were submitted earlier this year, in June. It weighs the project’s economic benefits, including job creation and improved regional connectivity, against environmental impacts, such as farmland loss and biodiversity degradation.

Developers have proposed extensive plans to counter the impact. Plans include operating largely off-grid, utilising renewable power and water reuse systems to achieve conservation offsets, as well as local road upgrades.

What passengers can look forward to at the Cape Winelands International Airport

Additionally, the first phase of the R7–10 billion development is expected to complement Cape Town International, rather than compete with it.

Private operators of the airport RSA.Aero aims to transform the airport into a full-scale international hub, featuring a 3.5-kilometre runway capable of handling wide-body aircraft, a boutique passenger terminal, new cargo facilities, and a heliport.

A hotel, retail spaces, conference facilities, and even sustainable aviation fuel storage are all part of the vision.

The site, formerly known as Fisantekraal Airfield, is not yet a commercial or passenger airport. Still, with its four runways (two active), it serves as a base for pilot training schools and general aviation services near Cape Town.

Long-Term Tourism Impact for the Cape

The team behind Cape Winelands Airport says it’s building more than just a runway - it’s creating an economic engine for the region.

Positioned at the crossroads of tourism, agribusiness, and logistics, the new airport aims to spark job creation, boostsupply chains, and open up new tourism opportunities across the Cape.

In a bid to put the project on the global map, the airport team recently attended Routes World 2025 in Hong Kong, where they met with airlines and investors to generate international interest. It’s all part of a broader push to connect the Winelands directly with global travel routes — and turn the area into a powerful gateway for growth.

If all timelines and approvals are met, passenger operations could start by 2028, relieving pressure on Cape Town International Airport and opening a new gateway for visitors heading directly into the Winelands.

Tragic LPG Cooking Gas Incidents The case adds to a long list of cooking gas incidents in Thailand, where LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is widely used in homes and small businesses.","PATHUM THANI — A quiet Saturday turned tragic when a cooking gas explosion tore through a townhouse in Mueang district, killing a 64-year-old woman and injuring seven people. The blast sparked a fierce fire that spread to nearby homes, underscoring the ongoing risks linked to LPG gas in everyday use.

Police, firefighters, and rescue teams moved fast to contain the blaze and help the injured, while investigators began work on what appears to be a preventable incident. The explosion occurred at about 7.15 a.m.

Early findings suggest a leak from a kitchen cylinder in the two-storey townhouse. Cooking Gas is thought to have seeped out overnight and built up in the enclosed space until a spark, possibly from an appliance or pilot light, set it off. The pressure wave blew out walls and flung debris more than 30 metres.

The homeowner, identified as Mrs Somchai (surname withheld), was discovered unresponsive and badly burned in the wreckage. She was pronounced dead at the scene and later taken to Pathum Thani Hospital for a post-mortem. Relatives said she had been preparing breakfast when the blast struck, and described a boom that shook the ground.

Seven others, including neighbours and people passing by, suffered burns, shrapnel wounds, and blast injuries. Five victims, aged 25 to 52, were taken to Pathum Thani Hospital in critical condition.

Chaos After Explosion

Two underwent emergency surgery for second and third-degree burns affecting up to 40 percent of their bodies. A couple from the house next door at first refused to leave, distressed by the damage to their home, but rescue workers persuaded them to go after checks showed risks from smoke inhalation.

Witness accounts described chaos. A 52-year-old barber, Mr Somkhuan Chatwong, whose home and small salon share a wall with the affected house, said he was drinking coffee when the shockwave hit.

His ceiling collapsed, flames burst from windows, and glass and metal fragments shot across the room, slicing his arm. His property and an empty unit nearby suffered heavy structural damage, with broken facades and crushed roofs. Cars on the street were battered, windscreens blown out, and frames bent.

Fire crews from Mueang station arrived within minutes and deployed three engines. It took more than 30 minutes to subdue the flames. The fire chief, Lt Col Anan Phromma, said the blaze spread fast due to gas vapours and wooden furniture.

Crews used foam to choke the fire and reduce the risk of further explosions from any remaining cooking gas cylinders. By 8 a.m., the fire was under control, though thick smoke lingered, and nearby residents were moved out as a precaution.

Police from Mueang Pathum Thani station sealed off the site. Deputy Inspector Pol Capt Decha Chanthachart said forensic specialists are examining the cooking gas cylinder valve and hose for defects. Early signs point to a failed seal that allowed gas to escape.

Investigators are also looking at storage and handling. Rescue teams, wearing protective gear, worked through the rubble to remove hazards. They recovered a second intact cooking gas cylinder that could have made the situation worse.

More than 40 responders and volunteers from local tambon administrative organisations supported the operation with water and reassurance for affected families.

Tragic LPG Cooking Gas Incidents

The case adds to a long list of cooking gas incidents in Thailand, where LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is widely used in homes and small businesses. Past tragedies show repeated gaps in safety practices and oversight.

One of the worst was the 1990 explosion on New Phetchaburi Road in Bangkok, when an overturned LPG tanker triggered a chain of blasts that destroyed 51 shophouses, killed 88 people, injured 121, and burned dozens of vehicles. The fire burned for a full day, fed by about 30 tonnes of LPG. It prompted changes in transport safety, while weaknesses at the household level persisted.

In 2015, a restaurant blast in Lam Luk Ka, Pathum Thani, injured six diners and staff. Investigators traced the cause to a corroded regulator on a stove line, echoing warnings from the Thai Industrial Standards Institute about regular checks.

In 2016, a truck carrying 40 cylinders overturned on Hathairat Road, sparking explosions that scorched four vehicles and injured the driver. Police noted that the load had not been secured.

In 2020, a garage fire in Pathum Thani destroyed 10 cars after stored cylinders exploded, and in 2023, a truck hauling cooking gas burst into flames on Rama 3 Road in Bangkok, injuring two and shutting traffic for hours as cylinders kept popping.

The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation records dozens of deaths nationwide each year linked to gas incidents. Fire safety experts, including Dr Nattapong Rattanavarin of Kasetsart University, point to poor ventilation in row houses, substandard or imported cylinders, and weak awareness of leak detection.

He has warned that many households skip basic checks. Odorants in LPG are meant to raise alarms, yet some people treat the smell as normal.

After the blast, Pathum Thani Governor Mrs Suphattra Thianthong visited patients and pledged 50,000 baht in support per family, along with free counselling. The Energy Regulatory Commission announced spot checks on local distributors. Civil society groups are pushing for auto shut-off valves to be mandatory on domestic systems.

As evening fell over the damaged street, neighbours paid respects to Mrs Somchai and spoke of staying alert. Mr Chatwong said luck had spared their community before, but that it could not be relied on. The smoke and silence left a stark lesson for homes across Thailand that rely on LPG each day.

Hal itu disampaikan oleh Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina, Oki Muraza.

Menurut Oki, sejumlah inovasi energi hijau yang telah diluncurkan perusahaan, di antaranya Pertamax Green, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), dan Renewable Diesel (RD).

“Pertamina tidak hanya berfokus pada ketahanan energi nasional, tetapi juga berperan aktif menurunkan emisi dan menciptakan ekosistem energi yang lebih hijau,” ujar Oki, dikutip dari KabarBUMN, Minggu (12/10/2025).

Oki menjelaskan, inovasi pertama yakni Pertamax Green 95 yang kini telah beredar secara nasional. Bahan bakar ini memiliki RON 95 dengan kandungan sulfur di bawah 50 ppm (Euro IV).

Menggunakan bioetanol sebagai bahan campuran, Pertamax Green 95 tidak hanya membantu menekan ketergantungan terhadap impor bensin, tetapi juga menggerakkan ekonomi lokal berbasis energi terbarukan.

“Pertamina mencatat, penggunaan bioetanol dalam negeri dapat mensubstitusi bensin impor sehingga mampu mengurangi defisit neraca perdagangan impor bensin yang saat ini setara USD 12,4 miliar (Rp200 triliun), menurunkan emisi karbon sektor transportasi, serta menggerakkan ekonomi untuk para petani,” terang Oki.

Inovasi berikutnya adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), bahan bakar pesawat ramah lingkungan berbasis minyak jelantah. Pertamina sukses memproduksi SAF yang telah digunakan dalam penerbangan Pelita Air rute Jakarta–Bali pada 20 Agustus 2025.

Pencapaian ini menempatkan Pertamina sebagai satu-satunya produsen SAF co-processing di ASEAN, dengan rantai pasok terintegrasi mulai dari pengumpulan minyak jelantah hingga pemanfaatan oleh maskapai nasional.

Produk SAF tersebut juga telah memperoleh sertifikasi International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) dan terbukti mampu menurunkan emisi karbon penerbangan hingga 84%.

“Teknologi SAF ini sepenuhnya dikembangkan oleh insinyur dalam negeri, membuktikan kapasitas Indonesia sebagai regional champion energi hijau,” tegas Oki.

Di sektor bahan bakar diesel, Pertamina juga terus memimpin inovasi melalui penerapan B40, yakni program biodiesel dengan campuran 40% bahan nabati, yang saat ini merupakan tingkat tertinggi di dunia.

“Program Biodiesel B40 Indonesia merupakan yang tertinggi di dunia, sehingga Indonesia dapat sepenuhnya mandiri dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan solar domestik,” tambah Oki.

Selain itu, Pertamina turut mengembangkan Renewable Diesel (RD), bahan bakar nabati hasil hidrogenasi minyak sawit. Produk ini memiliki sejumlah keunggulan dibandingkan biodiesel konvensional, seperti stabilitas oksidasi yang lebih baik, tidak mudah menyerap air, serta efisiensi pembakaran yang lebih optimal.

Dengan berbagai inovasi tersebut, Pertamina menegaskan posisinya sebagai motor penggerak transisi energi nasional, sekaligus membuktikan peran penting BUMN energi dalam menciptakan masa depan yang lebih hijau dan berkelanjutan.

«La Universidad es clave, tiene un papel preponderante en adelantarse a aquello que se va a hacer en 20 años», resumió el representante de Airbus.","La segunda sesión del ciclo de Transición Ecológica organizado por el diario LA RAZÓN se centró en específico en la revolución energética que se está llevando a cabo a nivel mundial . Esta transformación puede llevar a Andalucía a cotas de liderazgo como exportadora de energía gracias a las innovaciones en materias de combustibles sostenibles como el Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) o el hidrógeno verde, además de la producción eléctrica proveniente de renovables como la energía solar y eólica.

Para abordar todas estas cuestiones, este segundo encuentro contó con la participación de representantes del mundo de la aviación comercial, con la presencia de Ricardo Rojas, presidente de Aviones Comerciales de Airbus en España. En el plano de las energías y combustibles renovables, destacó la presencia de Carlos Ayuso, director de Proyectos y procesos de innovación de Moeve. Germán López, por parte del Corporación Tecnológica de Andalucía (CTA), aportó la visión del conglomerado empresarial andaluz; además de Javier Hidalgo, director de desarrollo de Inerco, empresa especializada en gestión y tecnologías para el desarrollo industrial sostenible. Por último, la cita tuvo representación institucional de la mano de Antonio Posadas Chinchilla secretario general de Investigación e Innovación de la Consejería de Universidad, Investigación e Innovación de la Junta de Andalucía.

Fue especialmente revelador conocer de primera mano los innovadores avances del mundo de la aviación comercial personificados en los nuevos modelos de avión de Airbus, los «Extra Long Range» o XLR que, como su propio nombre indica, son capaces de cubrir distancias largas y tienen un consumo medio de combustible por asiento un 30% menor con respecto a los aviones de la generación anterior. Iberia fue la aerolínea de lanzamiento de este avión, que ya es una realidad desde el pasado año. Además, tal y como explicó Ricardo Rojas, la compañía ya trabaja en modelos con motores nuevos que permitan un aprovechamiento más eficiente de la energía de las turbinas en las partes electrificadas de la aeronave. «Una de las prioridades es la renovación de la flota con aviones de nueva generación, que son un 25 por ciento más eficientes que los de la anterior. Ahora mismo un 65 por ciento de los aviones en servicio son de fabricación más antigua y la idea es reemplazarlos gradualmente y que los combustibles sostenibles vayan adquiriendo un mayor protagonismo», explicó el presidente de Airbus, quien añadió que toda la flota Airbus está acondicionada para volar desde ya con un 50% de combustible SAF y para 2030 se espera haber alcanzado el 100 por cien. El uso de hidrógeno verde es todavía prematuro, pero es uno de los pilares futuros en materia de sostenibilidad para Airbus, que contempla otras prioridades como la mejora del control del tráfico aéreo como otra variante para cumplir con los objetivos de reducción de emisiones.

Para Moeve, en palabras de Carlos Ayuso, las prioridades están claras: ser una empresa que lidere el apoyo a la transición energética, para lo cual se está trabajando en proyectos «mil millonarios» como el Valle de Hidrógeno y la planta de combustibles bio, ambos en Andalucía. «La gente no tiene interiorizado el gran esfuerzo que hay que hacer, tenemos un sistema que gira en torno a combustibles fósiles; para cambiar eso vamos a necesitar mucha colaboración, también pública», advirtió sobre la transición ecológica que está en marcha.

Precisamente ahí entra en juego la Administración y su apuesta por la innovación tecnológica, algo que en el caso andaluz es una realidad tal y como defendió el secretario Posadas: «Fue un acierto del presidente Moreno incluir innovación en la Consejería junto a la Universidad. Nos creemos la innovación de cabo a rabo, somos profesores universitarios y la tenemos interiorizada», aseveró, al tiempo que hizo alusión a los diversos proyectos que la Junta de Andalucía está liderando en materia de innovación para iniciativas rurales, en el sector aeroespacial con la implementación de un cluster específico o en el trabajo con pequeñas y medianas empresas para que éstas tengan también acceso a las últimas novedades técnicas.

«No somos conscientes de la revolución que la descarbonización supone, el cambio es una absoluta revolución, para los que trabajamos en esto resulta apasionante, pero el ecosistema tiene tantas piezas que tenemos un riesgo, tenemos por delante un puzle gigantesco y hay que ir adecuando las piezas progresivamente», apuntó por su parte el representante de Inerco, quien coincidió en que el impulso a la innovación por parte de la Junta de Andalucía esta siendo «clave».

Por su parte, Germán López advirtió de los pasos que hay que dar en materia de descarbonización pero desde CTA avisan: «Los números tienen que dar, tiene que ser algo progresivo, la transformación verde no puede significar el perjuicio económico, hay que intentar que las empresas hagan innovaciones que lleguen en el lapso de tiempo más breve posible al mercado». En esto coincidió con Rojas, quien defiende que la cuarta revolución en que está inmerso el mundo de la aviación, la de la sostenibilidad, habrá de serlo a nivel de emisiones y económica.

Según Carlos Ayuso, en el objetivo europeo para conseguir la independencia energética gracias a energías limpias, jugarán un papel fundamental la movilidad sostenible, ahí será importantísima la consolidación del SAF y el uso de hidrógeno verde, pero también la circularidad: «Generamos una cantidad enorme de residuos, más del 50 por ciento acaba en vertederos, queremos ser capaces de aprovechar ese potencial reutilizando el desperdicio», aseveró. En esa línea, desde Moeve están promoviendo el trabajo innovativo de pequeñas y medianas empresas mediante proyectos como «Moeve Light Up», una iniciativa a través de la cual han sido seleccionadas diez startups locales que presentaron proyectos pensados para colaborar con la descarbonización y otros ámbitos del cuidado medioambiental: «Vamos a dotarles de una inyección económica, proyectos que se alargarán hasta 18 meses en algunos casos y les hemos abierto nuestros centros de innovación así como puesto en contacto con nuestras áreas comerciales para que conozcan mejor las demandas del mercado», explicó el director de proyectos de la compañía.

Otro actor principal en este juego es la Universidad andaluza, que ahora parece estar resurgiendo de sus cenizas como ave fénix: «La Universidad ha tenido un periodo complicado, desde 2010 no ha propuesto nuevos títulos adaptadas a nuestro tiempo. El año pasado conseguimos poner de acuerdo a todos los rectores para sacar un catálogo de 188 titulaciones, más del 50 por ciento en el ámbito de la tecnología y la ciencia», reveló el secretario de Innovación quien añadió que ahora sí, las universidades de la comunidad están preparadas para las demandas que exigen las compañías andaluzas, más aún con la reciente reforma universitaria anunciada por el Gobierno de Juanma Moreno. «La Universidad es clave, tiene un papel preponderante en adelantarse a aquello que se va a hacer en 20 años», resumió el representante de Airbus.","https://fotografias-2.larazon.es/clipping/cmsimages02/2025/10/11/D600FE7B-0510-4FE9-8C5F-EF06CDD05536/segunda-mesa-ciclo-transicion-ecologica-organizado-razon_69.jpg?crop=4530,2548,x0,y0&width=1280&height=720&optimize=low&format=jpg",N,,2025-10-12 00:56:10.053118

Agung menekankan bahwa pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan tidak hanya menjadi kisah sukses ekonomi, tetapi juga perjalanan ekologi yang bermakna.

“Ini bukan hanya perjalanan sukses dalam hal ekonomi karena menciptakan penghematan devisa yang signifikan bagi negara, tetapi juga sebagai perjalanan ekologi. Menempatkan prinsip Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) sebagai inti adalah sesuatu yang sangat berarti,” ujar Agung.

Ia menjelaskan, keberhasilan penerapan program biodiesel sejak B20 hingga B40 telah memberikan dampak besar terhadap kemandirian energi nasional. “Sejak penerapan B20 dan kini B40, Indonesia telah mampu memenuhi kebutuhan energi dalam negeri dengan sumber daya yang lebih berkelanjutan,” lanjutnya.

Lebih jauh, Agung menyoroti inovasi Pertamina dalam mengembangkan SAF dari minyak jelantah. Bahan bakar ini mampu menurunkan emisi karbon hingga 84 persen dan mendorong terciptanya ekonomi sirkular.

“Kami telah menggunakan SAF itu dari minyak goreng masyarakat untuk terbang. Jadi ini bukan hanya tentang mengurangi emisi karbon, tetapi juga bagian dari ekonomi sirkular karena masyarakat dapat menukar minyak jelantah menjadi rupiah, yang kemudian diolah menjadi bahan bakar berkelanjutan dan efisien,” jelasnya.

Menurut Agung, keberhasilan pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan merupakan bagian penting dari transformasi energi nasional. Program ini memperkuat ketahanan energi, membuka lapangan kerja baru di sektor energi hijau, serta mendukung target Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060. “Ini adalah perjalanan transformasi Pertamina untuk mendukung agenda nasional mengenai bahan bakar nabati. Langkah ini menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia mampu menjadi pelopor energi bersih di kawasan Asia Tenggara,” tegasnya.

Sebagai perusahaan energi nasional, Pertamina terus berkomitmen mendukung pencapaian target NZE 2060 dengan mendorong program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Sementara itu, transformasi Pertamina dijalankan melalui dual growth strategy atau strategi pertumbuhan ganda.","JAKARTA, investor.id – PT Pertamina (Persero) membeberkan kunci transformasi menuju energi bersih. Pihaknya memandang, kuncinya terletak pada pembentukan ekosistem terintegrasi yang menghubungkan inovasi, kolaborasi, dan keberlanjutan untuk mempercepat peralihan menuju energi rendah karbon di Indonesia.

Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis PT Pertamina (Persero) Agung Wicaksono mencontohkan penerapan pendekatan tersebut dalam pengembangan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (sustainable aviation fuel/ SAF) yang dihasilkan melalui kolaborasi antara Pertamina Patra Niaga, Kilang Pertamina Internasional, dan Pelita Air Service.

“Ke depan, bagaimana memastikan transformasi ini benar-benar terjadi? Kuncinya adalah dengan pendekatan ekosistem,” papar Agung dalam panel diskusi di Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (IISF), Jakarta, Sabtu (11/10/2025).

Dalam pengembangan SAF, Pertamina Patra Niaga bertugas mengumpulkan minyak jelantah dari masyarakat. Kilang Pertamina Internasional kemudian memprosesnya di kilang hijau (green refinery) menjadi SAF, sedangkan Pelita Air Service menggunakannya sebagai bahan bakar untuk penerbangan dari Jakarta ke Denpasar.

Agung mengatakan inisiatif itu tidak hanya menekan emisi karbon hingga 84%, tetapi juga mendorong ekonomi sirkular. Sebab, masyarakat dapat menukarkan minyak jelantah dengan insentif ekonomi yang bernilai.

Ia juga menilai keberhasilan pengembangan SAF perlu didukung kebijakan pemerintah, mengingat potensi bahan bakar berkelanjutan ini tidak hanya untuk Indonesia, tetapi juga kawasan regional.

Selain SAF, Pertamina juga mengembangkan sumber energi rendah karbon lain seperti hidrogen hijau, melalui proyek percontohan di Ulubelu, Lampung.

Fasilitas tersebut akan menjadi yang pertama yang mengintegrasikan teknologi elektrolisis membran modern (anion exchange membrane/ AEM) dengan energi panas bumi sebagai sumber listrik bersih. “Kami menargetkan fasilitas ini beroperasi tahun depan. Dan kami juga bekerja sama dengan Toyota (dalam proyek pengembangan hidrogen hijau ini),” bebernya.

Di samping itu, Pertamina turut memperkuat dekarbonisasi di sektor hulu (upstream) yang memiliki potensi terbesar dalam pengurangan emisi karbon.

Agung menjelaskan, perusahaan tengah menyiapkan sejumlah proyek percontohan carbon capture and storage (CCS) serta carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) di wilayah Cekungan Sunda Asri, Gundih, dan Sukowati. Teknologi ini tidak hanya menekan emisi, tetapi juga dapat dimanfaatkan untuk meningkatkan produksi minyak melalui enhanced oil recovery.

Sementara itu, transformasi Pertamina dijalankan melalui dual growth strategy atau strategi pertumbuhan ganda. Di satu sisi, perusahaan tetap mengoptimalkan bisnis existing di sektor minyak dan gas serta pengolahan kilang untuk menjaga profitabilitas.

“Transformasi tidak akan terjadi jika hanya berfokus pada bisnis existing. Karena itu, mesin kedua dalam strategi pertumbuhan ganda kami adalah pengembangan bisnis rendah karbon,” kata dia.

Melalui pendekatan ekosistem dan strategi ganda tersebut, Pertamina pun berupaya menyeimbangkan pertumbuhan ekonomi dengan agenda dekarbonisasi untuk mempercepat transisi menuju masa depan energi yang lebih bersih dan berkelanjutan.",https://img2.beritasatu.com/cache/investor/960x620-w/2025/10/1760184194-800x533.webp,N,,2025-10-11 22:57:03.756040

General Electric's Large Aero Engine Competitor In competition with the Trent XWB is the world's other enormous and highly efficient aero engine: General Electric's GE9X.","There are countless reasons that the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB is the ideal engine for the A350. Rolls-Royce describes it as: ""extremely efficient, impressively versatile, ultra-reliable, unbelievably popular."" The manufacturer believes that its many years exclusively powering the A350 are proof of these characteristics.

As such, there is no single reason that Airbus selected the engine to power the A350, beyond the simple fact that they have reached an exclusivity agreement with the manufacturer. Discover more below about the host of advancements offered by the Trent XWB, and how it continues to develop based on lessons from over a decade of operation. Then learn how General Electric and Boeing aim to compete with the GE9X and the 777X, the world's largest aircraft engine.

Trent XWB Facilitates Leading Widebody Efficiency

Airbus claims that the Trent XWB is the most efficient large aero engine in the skies. Compared to the first Trent engine, it has a 15% lower fuel consumption, helping A350s achieve a 25% lower total fuel burn compared to aircraft of the previous generation. This yields a reduction in operating costs of $2.9 million per year, primarily due to fuel savings, helping airlines using the A350 achieve greater profits, which is essential in an industry with such narrow margins.

The greater efficiency also allows the engine to operate more quietly. That means less noise pollution for those on the ground and a quieter cabin for those onboard.

Rolls-Royce attributes the leading efficiency of its jets to lessons learned over 30 years of developing the Trent engine family. During this time, they have begun to use better and lighter materials and build jets with higher bypass ratios.

Superb Versatility

Rolls-Royce claims that the Trent XWB powers 700 routes and has operated from 127 cities. This isn't just a broad selection of routes, as there is also real quality here. For example, since November 2020, Trent XWB engines have powered the world's longest active commercial flight: Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24. Using an Airbus A350-900ULR, this route covers 8,288 nautical miles in 18 hours and 40 minutes.

Simultaneously, Trent XWB engines are also used for exceptionally short routes. For example, A350s fly the short hop from Kilimanjaro Airport to Zanzibar, taking around 90 minutes.

The table below includes the key specifications for the Trent XWB's smaller -84 variant. It uses EASA data:

The jet's versatility is further aided by its record-breaking ETOPS capabilities. In 2014, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the jet for 370 minutes of ETOPS operations. Beyond helping the A350 to be a safer jet, the ETOPS capabilities also allow the plane to reach its destination faster. That is because it can plot a straighter course for lengthy transoceanic flights, as emergency diversions can be over six hours of flight time away.

The Trent XWB Fended Off General Electric Competition

Rolls-Royce's exclusive partnership with Airbus on the A350 was not always guaranteed. General Electric has been trying to force its way into powering the aircraft family since May 2009, when they suggested offering the 787's GEnx for the A350 (-800 and -900). The manufacturer has also stated that it could develop a product that outperforms the Trent XWB. This is likely just bluster, as it has said it won't develop such an engine, as it would be in direct competition with GE90-115B-powered 777 variants. Any deals to power Airbus widebody jets would put its relationship with Boeing at risk.

Such suggestions from General Electric have now been rendered meaningless, as Reuters has reported that Rolls-Royce has extended its exclusive deal until 2030. The deal came at the perfect time in 2021, as Rolls-Royce had just disclosed a record $5.6 billion 2020 loss.

​​​​​Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Warren East told reporters why the deal was so important for the firm: ""We're already exclusive on the A350-1000, and extending our position on the -900 variant, that accounts for the bulk of the A350 fleet, out to 2030 is in line with the development timeline for our next generation UltraFan engine programme.""

The Trent XWB Continues To Develop

Another reason that Trent XWB engines have continued to be popular is the constant improvement sought by Rolls-Royce. In April 2025, Airbus' Newsroom reported that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had certified the A350-900 with the new Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 Enhanced Performance (EP) engine. This engine came with a host of improvements based on a decade of Trent XWB operations. These included a better fan and compressor, alongside developed turbine aerodynamics and turbine blade cooling. Combined, the developments yielded a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. That sounds small, but it adds up to a sizable development in the context of A350 flights that can be longer than ten hours. It could also push the A350's range further still, allowing airlines to serve new city pairs. Further environmental improvements stem from the fact that this engine can be operated with 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and is a step towards 100% SAF use.

Julien Puyou, Airbus’ Head of Widebody Programme, said: ""Together with our partner Rolls-Royce, this latest evolution underscores our joint commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. The Trent XWB-84 is already among the most efficient widebody engines on the market and this enhanced version will deliver even greater performance and efficiency for our airline customers.”

Pete Young, Chief Engineer, shared similar sentiments regarding the Trent XWB-84 EP: ""What excites me most is that we’ve continued to innovate and make it even better in every way with this new standard. Certification is a defining moment for our team, its testament to their expertise and dedication, and the culmination of hard work.""

General Electric's Large Aero Engine Competitor

In competition with the Trent XWB is the world's other enormous and highly efficient aero engine: General Electric's GE9X. This engine is the largest aircraft engine ever built. The engine will power the 777X when it is eventually delivered. At first glance, with its gigantic size and unmatched power, the GE9X appears to be about brute force and generating as much thrust as possible. However, it matches Rolls-Royce's use of advanced composite materials and an extremely high bypass ratio to be a surprisingly light and efficient engine. These attributes help the GE9X to achieve a 10% greater fuel efficiency than the GE90.

The table below includes critical specifications for the GE9X based on Federal Aviation Administration data:

Rolls-Royce's engine benefits from over a decade of commercial operations. During this time, countless customers have shown that the engine performs well and is reliable. The same cannot be said for the GE9X due to the delays that continue to plague the 777X. As such, it is currently impossible to make a true judgment about how the GE9X will stack up against either Trent XWB variant. This space is well worth watching when the 777X comes into service in 2027.

The Trent XWB For The A350F Is Coming

Airbus names its A350F the only true new freighter that meets the latest ICAO CO2 emissions standards and is set for release in the second half of 2027, later than the initially planned 2026. Part of the expected strong emissions' performance is down to the fact that Rolls-Royce is further optimizing the XWB engine for freighter use. The A350F will utilize the XWB-97, which will contribute to a freighter with superior range and payload compared to its competitors. The manufacturer writes: ""Based on the A350 programme, the A350F delivers more payload, more range and more volume compared to the 777F, all comforting its position as the only future-proof choice for operators today.""

The XWB-97 features a range of improvements over the XWB-84 that will make it ideal for the A350F. Its fan runs 6% faster than the -84. To deal with the extra air flow, the -97's combustion chamber has been strengthened and made able to withstand higher temperatures. The result is improved thrust. The XWB-97 also uses compressor blisk technology that yields 15% module weight savings.

You may have already flown on an aircraft powered by the XWB-97, as it is used on the A350-1000. This engine has made a mark for its impressive versatility, capable of operating efficiently for flights ranging from 45 minutes to 16 hours. The engine is also behind Qantas' Project Sunrise flights from Australia to New York and London, which could take 20 hours.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/the-real-reason-why-rolls-royce-owns-the-airbus-a350-engine-slot.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-11 17:56:48.907431

Not long after, Budget 2026 revealed that the government intends to support the establishment of flights between Dublin Airport and Derry City Airport.

The Dublin Airport Authority said it welcomed remarks from Darragh O’Brien that long-term planning should accommodate a Dublin Airport capable of serving up to 60 million passengers per year.

In thirty years, Irish aviation emissions have grown 500%.

A key reason for this is the massive subsidies the sector receives while inflicting increasing pollution and climate damage.

As minister for transport, Darragh O’Brien is representing the needs of the aviation sector to expand and the demands of businesses to maintain growth. But he also has a responsibility to address a climate that is spiralling out of control along with ecosystem collapse.

Forgetting about climate

What has Minister O’Brien done to meet those obligations since he was appointed as minister for climate and environment in January 2025?

Emissions savings from improved fuel efficiency have been wiped out by the explosion of the aviation sector, with no real path outlined towards major emissions reductions other than a vague gesture towards sustainable aviation fuels that currently meet less than 1% of the global demand for aviation fuel and is nearly three times as expensive as its fossil fuel equivalent.

The prevailing attitude that Dublin Airport’s connectivity is an essential prerequisite to economic resilience denies the reality of its escalating contribution to climate change – a factor that Minister for Climate Darragh O’Brien seems to have been able to put to one side.

We the consumers are willing participants in the denial as we continue to pack our bags and avail of cheap flights to the hotspots of Europe at every opportunity.

The climate may be spiralling out of control, but the vast majority of us block our ears to that whispering message in our brain – telling us as we book our flights that we are part of the problem.

In ‘The Lie of the Land,’ environmental activist John Gibbons suggests that if you are looking for signs of meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency, the one place you won’t find it is aviation:

“Jet kerosene for commercial aviation is exempt from both excise and carbon taxes in the EU. On top of these lavish subsidies, the Irish state pours significant resources into aviation including €35.6 million in regional airport funding in Budget 2023. What’s more, airline tickets are VAT exempt in the EU as is aircraft leasing – providing further hidden subsidies to the sector.”

Aviation fuel tax and carbon tax

Gibbons suggests that to bring aviation in line with the urgent need to cut carbon emissions, transport fuels should be taxed globally as with any other transport fuel. Added to that hefty carbon taxes should be applied to reflect the true cost of flying.

Additionally, Gibbons suggests a solution to the gross overuse of aviation by a small minority would be to introduce a system of flight rationing. The system he proposes would see each individual allocated a certain distance annually, say 1,750km (equivalent to a return flight from Dublin to Paris) that would be tied to your PPS or passport number.

If you took another flight, your next 1,750 km would come with a €250 climate levy, with the levy doubling with each additional round trip: €500, €1,000, €2,000 and so on.

“Eventually the cost will deter even the wealthy,” Gibbons concludes. “Properly managed it would be hugely effective in clipping the wings of frequent flyers.”

Not something that Minister for Climate Darragh O’Brien seems to keen on.

In terms of public transport, Director of Friends of the Environment Tony Lowes recently highlighted a “funding gap” for Public Services Obligations (PSO) of €250 million.

The PSO requires Government to ensure funding for essential routes, that are not commercially successful, especially in rural areas including Bus Connects and the “connecting Ireland rural mobility plan”, the Young Adult Card and the 90 minute fare free child fares.

The Department of Transport proposals to fund these projects include an increase in public transport fares, cutting public transport services or taking €250 million away from National Development Plan infrastructure projects.

Lowes suggests that an alternative would be to “reinstate the €10 tax on airline tickets imposed by minister for transport, Noel Dempsey in 2009 but cancelled by this successor Leo Varadkar in 2014.”

Lowes highlights how Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe who do not impose an airline tax. Even the United States imposes a passenger facility charge of about €37 that increases according to distance.

The UK imposes a €15 tax on passengers for short haul flights, which is due to increase in April 2026. The increase will include a 50 per cent increase on private jets – from €673 to €1,141.

“Restoring the air travel tax could meet the funding gap required to maintain our Government’s commitment to public transport,” suggests Lowes, “and would be a step towards climate justice.”

I wonder what the minister for climate, the environment and transport thinks of that suggestion.

A sign that the government is going in the opposite direction is that commencement of a new “Dublin-Derry airlink” in 2026 was among the budgetary measures announced by the Government on Tuesday in Budget 2026.

Were the impacts of aviation-induced greenhouse gas emissions considered in weighing up the decision to move ahead with air travel between the two cities?

Balancing priorities

An EAT-Lancet Commission report released earlier this month acknowledged that the relationship between food systems and emissions is very challenging, but that there is a get-out-of-jail card if we are prepared to take it on.

As ever, the answer lies in where we see our priorities – short term economic protectories or long term economic, and ecosystem sustainability.

Food systems are the single biggest contributor to the transgression of planetary boundaries that place our carefully balanced ecosystems at risk of collapse.

In Ireland, agrifood is the source of almost 38% of total national greenhouse gas emissions – by far our largest single contributor and the sector most resistant to doing its fair share on emissions reductions, an industry that employs 6.4% of our workforce and accounts for just 6.7% of the gross national income and 9% of exports.

The good news is that concerted global efforts to transform food systems could bring us back within planetary boundaries and slice annual greenhouse gas emissions from food systems by more than half.

Johan Rockström, Commission Co-Chair and Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research outlines how the report sets out the clearest guidance yet for feeding a growing population without breaching the safe operating space on Earth set by planetary boundaries.

“By uniting the latest science, it shows that what we put on our plates can save millions of lives, cut billions of tonnes of emissions, halt the loss of biodiversity, and create a fairer food system.

“The evidence is undeniable: transforming food systems is not only possible, it’s essential to securing a safe, just and sustainable future for all.”

Has Darragh O’Brien reflected on the recommendations of the EAT Lancet report or has he allowed it to pass by? Has he read the report, or even the executive summary?

A minister with responsibilities for both climate and transport must be factoring in the former when making decisions about the latter. If this minister isn’t prepared to strike that balance, then perhaps he should hand the portfolio to someone who is.

Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis PT Pertamina (Persero) Agung Wicaksono mencontohkan penerapan pendekatan tersebut dalam pengembangan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (sustainable aviation fuel/SAF) yang dihasilkan melalui kolaborasi antara Pertamina Patra Niaga, Kilang Pertamina Internasional, dan Pelita Air Service.

“Ke depan, bagaimana memastikan transformasi ini benar-benar terjadi? Kuncinya adalah dengan pendekatan ekosistem,” kata Agung dalam panel diskusi di Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (IISF), Jakarta, Sabtu (11/10/2025).

Dalam pengembangan SAF, Pertamina Patra Niaga bertugas mengumpulkan minyak jelantah dari masyarakat. Kilang Pertamina Internasional kemudian memprosesnya di kilang hijau (green refinery) menjadi SAF, sedangkan Pelita Air Service menggunakannya sebagai bahan bakar untuk penerbangan dari Jakarta ke Denpasar. Agung mengatakan inisiatif itu tidak hanya menekan emisi karbon hingga 84 persen, tetapi juga mendorong ekonomi sirkular, karena masyarakat dapat menukarkan minyak jelantah dengan insentif ekonomi yang bernilai.

Ia juga menilai bahwa keberhasilan pengembangan SAF perlu didukung kebijakan pemerintah, mengingat potensi bahan bakar berkelanjutan ini tidak hanya untuk Indonesia, tetapi juga kawasan regional. Selain SAF, Pertamina juga mengembangkan sumber energi rendah karbon lain seperti hidrogen hijau, melalui proyek percontohan di Ulubelu, Lampung.

Fasilitas tersebut akan menjadi yang pertama yang mengintegrasikan teknologi elektrolisis membran modern (anion exchange membrane/AEM) dengan energi panas bumi sebagai sumber listrik bersih.

“Kami menargetkan fasilitas ini beroperasi tahun depan. Kami juga bekerja sama dengan Toyota (dalam proyek pengembangan hidrogen hijau ini),” kata Agung.

Pertamina turut memperkuat dekarbonisasi di sektor hulu (upstream), yang memiliki potensi terbesar dalam pengurangan emisi karbon.

Saat ini, perusahaan tengah menyiapkan sejumlah proyek percontohan carbon capture and storage (CCS) serta carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) di wilayah Cekungan Sunda Asri, Gundih, dan Sukowati. Teknologi tersebut tidak hanya menekan emisi, tetapi juga dapat dimanfaatkan untuk meningkatkan produksi minyak melalui enhanced oil recovery.

Agung mengungkapkan bahwa transformasi Pertamina dijalankan melalui dual growth strategy atau strategi pertumbuhan ganda. Di satu sisi, perusahaan tetap mengoptimalkan bisnis existing di sektor minyak dan gas serta pengolahan kilang untuk menjaga profitabilitas.

“Transformasi tidak akan terjadi jika hanya berfokus pada bisnis existing. Karena itu, mesin kedua dalam strategi pertumbuhan ganda kami adalah pengembangan bisnis rendah karbon,” katanya.

Melalui pendekatan ekosistem dan strategi ganda tersebut, Pertamina pun berupaya menyeimbangkan pertumbuhan ekonomi dengan agenda dekarbonisasi untuk mempercepat transisi menuju masa depan energi yang lebih bersih dan berkelanjutan.",https://static.republika.co.id/uploads/images/inpicture_slide/_250822094900-991.png,N,,2025-10-11 15:57:04.471474

After years of blindness caused by cataracts, the pair have had both their sight and lives restored, thanks to a 15-minute cataract surgery aboard the Africa Mercy, the hospital ship operated by international charity Mercy Ships.

At 80 years old, Marie Jeanne had endured immense loss. Seven of her eight children had passed away, and her last solace came from weaving raffia mats and hats—a comfort that was taken from her when blindness struck three years ago. Soon after, her daughter Germaine began losing her vision as well, leaving her unable to farm or care for her children.

“If I had a weak faith, I might have given up,” Germaine shared.

Their journey to healing began when a relative heard about Mercy Ships’ free cataract surgeries on the radio. Hope rekindled, the two travelled from their remote village to Toamasina, where they were welcomed aboard the Africa Mercy. On the same day, both underwent the simple yet transformative procedure.

Their surgeon, Dr Guy Chevalley, recalled, “Their cataracts were so advanced that their pupils were no longer black, but completely white.”

Ella Hawthorne, Ophthalmic Programme Manager with Mercy Ships, added, “They could only see movement, just a hand waving in front of them. That was it.”

The morning after surgery, with eye patches removed, mother and daughter looked at each other clearly for the first time in years. Tears of joy followed.

“We no longer live in darkness,” said Marie Jeanne. “Our eyes can see, and our hearts are full of happiness!”

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 2.2 billion peopleglobally have vision impairment or blindness, with at least 1 billion cases preventable or yet to be addressed. Cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where access to affordable eye care and trained specialists is limited.

Reflecting on the moment, Hawthorne said, “It was very emotional to see their happiness when the patches came off at the same time. What a blessing it is to help this family. To see someone truly, to spend time with them and having that taken away and then restored is incredibly special.”

With her sight restored, Marie Jeanne has returned to weaving raffia mats and hats with renewed joy. Germaine is back to farming, actively participating in her church, and caring for her children.

Their restored vision symbolises more than medical recovery—it represents renewed dignity, independence, and hope for the future.",https://newstrends.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blind-Mother-and-Daughter-Look-into-Each-Others-Eyes-for-the-First-Time-in-Years.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 15:57:10.972137

India is exporting trust through its digital public infrastructure like UPI and its emerging biofuel diplomacy. This initiative aims to promote clean energy and global cooperation. Following the success of fintech, India is now focusing on farmtech and green energy solutions. The Global Biofuels Alliance is a key part of this strategy.

In the same week that the Global Fintech Festival (GFF) wrapped up in Mumbai, headlines still echoed with India’s digital confidence. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharing the stage with the UK’s Prime Minister to foreign delegates applauding UPI’s reach across continents, India’s digital public infrastructure has turned into a new kind of diplomacy, an export of trust.

What began as a platform for seamless payments has become a global public good. UPI is now accepted in Singapore, UAE, Mauritius, France, Sri Lanka and even at European airports. It’s India’s cleanest export — an idea that travels faster than capital, carrying the credibility of a nation that solved financial inclusion at scale.

Now, India stands on the cusp of exporting another form of trust, not digital this time, but green. It’s called biofuel diplomacy, and if UPI helped the world transact cleanly, biofuels will help it breathe cleanly.

From fintech to farmtech: India’s new soft power

At GFF 2025, Prime Minister Modi spoke about bridging divides between urban and rural, rich, and poor, developed and developing. The same philosophy applies to India’s biofuel story. What began as a domestic policy to reduce oil imports has evolved into a platform for global cooperation, inclusion, and sustainability.

Live Events

Just as UPI turned every phone into a payment terminal, India’s ethanol program is turning every field into a clean energy source. Farmers who once waited for cane dues now see their produce powering mobility. Distilleries that once produced spirits now produce strategic energy.

And just like UPI’s open architecture became a blueprint for the world, India’s Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), launched during its G20 Presidency, is becoming the framework for sustainable fuel cooperation among 24 nations.

What UPI did for money, biofuel can do for energy

UPI Diplomacy

Biofuel DiplomacyExported payment technology to 10+ countriesExporting ethanol expertise and green energy ecosystemsEnabled transparent, cashless economyEnables carbon-neutral, import-light economyEmpowered small merchantsEmpowers small farmersBuilt global DPI standards at G20Built Global Biofuels Alliance at G20Reduced leakages and black moneyReduces crude imports and emissionsIndia became a trusted tech provider

India becomes a trusted clean-energy partner

In both cases, India isn’t selling a product; it’s offering a platform. A platform for cooperation, inclusion, and shared prosperity.

The numbers tell their own story

India’s ethanol blending program is one of the world’s fastest and most impactful clean energy transitions. In 2014, blending stood at just 1.5%. By 2025, it touched 20% (E20) five years ahead of schedule.

That single policy leap has saved Rs 24,300 crore in foreign exchange, substituted over 509 crore litres of petrol, and reduced 10.8 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022–23 alone.

Imagine this impact in everyday terms: what if 5.68 million cars were removed from the streets of Delhi for an entire year! That’s the carbon impact of India’s ethanol blending program in just one year (2022–23).

Or, think of it as trees: imagine planting 439 million trees covering nearly 2,925 square kilometres, almost twice the size of Delhi (197% of its area). That’s the equivalent carbon absorption of one year of India’s ethanol program.

Numbers like these turn climate diplomacy from theory into arithmetic. Simple, relatable, and measurable.

The diplomatic dimension: From sugarcane to statecraft

Biofuel diplomacy is the strategic use of clean fuel production, trade, and policy to build international relationships and achieve shared climate goals.

Brazil did it first, exporting ethanol technology across Latin America and Africa. The United States now exports nearly two billion gallons of ethanol annually to 80 countries. India, the newest entrant, is shaping its own model, rooted in inclusion and cooperation rather than competition.

When India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) at the 2023 G20 Summit, it sent a clear signal: green energy is not a race; it’s a relay. The baton must be passed, not hoarded.

With surplus ethanol capacity and innovations in second-generation (2G) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies, India can now help decarbonise not just its own roads, but also the world’s skies.

SEIC 2026: The GFF of bioenergy

If GFF 2025 showcased India’s fintech diplomacy, SEIC 2026 (Sugar, Ethanol & Bioenergy India Conference) to be held on February 5–6 at Yashobhoomi, New Delhi, will do the same for biofuel diplomacy.

The conference will convene ministers, ambassadors, global investors, and technology leaders from over 15 countries. Its dedicated ‘Ethanol and Bioenergy Track’ will explore how international energy cooperation can translate into trade, technology transfer, and climate finance, aligning closely with India’s Net Zero 2070 vision, the national commitment announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2070.

Participants include global institutions such as the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), IFGE, NSI, VSI, and ICT, alongside embassies from Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, Germany, France, the UAE, and Denmark. Discussions will range from ethanol blending to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and from flex-fuel engines to carbon-credit markets; building the bridge between policy ambition and business execution.

If GFF proved India can lead the world in digital inclusion, SEIC 2026 aims to demonstrate that it can lead in decarbonisation inclusion; ensuring every nation, rich or poor, has access to cleaner energy pathways.

In many ways, the race for green-energy supremacy is unlike any other. Here, anyone coming out on top only makes the world a better place. The country that finishes second is not a loser, but a trailing champion; inspiring the next wave of emerging nations to follow. It is perhaps the only net-positive game in modern economic history where all major economies can win together.

A harmonisation is crucial for the success of the green energy revolution. Just as a QR code works anywhere, tomorrow a litre of certified green ethanol or SAF should power any engine, anywhere. Just as UPI connected nations through clean code; biofuel diplomacy will unite them through clean energy.

PT Pertamina (Persero) memperkuat komitmennya dalam mendukung transisi energi berkelanjutan melalui pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan. Upaya ini ditunjukkan melalui evolusi produk bahan bakar dari B20, B30, B40, hingga kini mencapai tahap Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berbasis Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah.

Komitmen tersebut disampaikan Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis Pertamina, Agung Wicaksono, dalam ajang Indonesia International Sustainable Forum (IISF) 2025 yang digelar di Jakarta Convention Center (JCC), Senayan, Sabtu (11/10).

Ia menjelaskan bahwa pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan oleh Pertamina bukan hanya memberikan manfaat ekonomi, tetapi juga membawa nilai ekologi yang kuat.

""Ini bukan hanya perjalanan sukses dalam hal ekonomi karena menciptakan penghematan devisa yang signifikan bagi negara, tetapi juga sebagai perjalanan ekologi. Menempatkan prinsip Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) sebagai inti adalah sesuatu yang sangat berarti,"" ujarnya dalam keterangan tertulis, Sabtu (11/10).

Agung menambahkan, program biodiesel Pertamina sejak B20 hingga B40 telah memberikan kontribusi nyata terhadap kemandirian energi nasional. Melalui pemanfaatan sumber daya yang lebih berkelanjutan, Indonesia kini dinilai mampu memenuhi kebutuhan energi dalam negeri secara mandiri.

Pertamina juga terus mengembangkan SAF yang berasal dari minyak jelantah masyarakat. Menurutnya, inovasi ini dapat menurunkan emisi karbon hingga 84 persen sekaligus mendukung terbentuknya ekonomi sirkular di masyarakat.

Masyarakat dapat menukar minyak goreng bekas mereka dengan nilai finansial, yang kemudian diproses oleh Pertamina menjadi bahan bakar berkelanjutan. Model ini menciptakan manfaat berlapis, dari mengurangi limbah, memberdayakan masyarakat, dan menyediakan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan untuk penerbangan.

Agung menambahkan bahwa keberhasilan pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan oleh Pertamina menjadi bagian penting dari transformasi energi nasional. Program ini tidak hanya memperkuat ketahanan energi, tetapi juga membuka lapangan kerja baru di sektor energi hijau serta mendukung target Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060.

""Ini adalah perjalanan transformasi Pertamina untuk mendukung agenda nasional mengenai bahan bakar nabati. Langkah ini menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia mampu menjadi pelopor energi bersih di kawasan Asia Tenggara,"" pungkas dia.

In today's aircraft, laminar flow is only partially achieved on the wings and fuselage, as the flow of air still comes across plenty of obstacles that disturb it, often resulting in turbulence and high drag.
The Phantom 3500, as far as I can get, is meant to be a lot more laminar flow-friendly than existing designs.
The focus, it seems, shifted to the Phantom 3500, which is supposed to begin flying operationally in 2030.
Remember how I said earlier that for the sake of laminar flow this thing has no windows?","The same goes for a Texas-based company called Otto Aerospace (or Otto Aviation). Established in 2008, this crew set out to revolutionize the business jet segment with something called laminar flow, an engineering solution that should be at the core of an aircraft known as the Phantom 3500.

What is laminar flow, you ask? The rigid, scientific definition tells us it's the orderly motion of fluids (air is a fluid) in parallel layers, undisturbed by each other or outside parties. In today's aircraft, laminar flow is only partially achieved on the wings and fuselage, as the flow of air still comes across plenty of obstacles that disturb it, often resulting in turbulence and high drag.

The Phantom 3500, as far as I can get, is meant to be a lot more laminar flow-friendly than existing designs. That's because it has no external interruptions (that means no rivets, panel gaps, and not even windows), it will be ultra-smooth on the exterior, and air flow should be effectively separated and maintained.

All of the above should reduce ""aerodynamic drag to levels never achieved in commercial aviation,"" and result in a significant decrease in fuel consumption and harmful emissions. Now, tell me who wouldn't want that?

Back in 2017, Otto started a three-year flight test program using a plane called the Celera 500 as a demonstrator. Powered by a RED A03 diesel piston engine capable of delivering 550 hp, it featured all the above-mentioned designed ideas on a body that looked more like a blue whale with wings than an actual aircraft – just like the Phantom 3500 will look like.

Over a period of three years, the Celera piloted aircraft flew over 50 times and stayed in the air for a combined 100 hours, trying to demonstrate full laminar flow aerodynamics characteristics. If we are to judge by what Otto is saying, that goal was achieved.

There are some numbers to back up that claim, and they say the Celera achieved 59 percent lower drag than other aircraft of the same size (it had a six-passenger capacity), and achieved near-jet speeds while burning only a fraction of the fuel, and that translated into 80 percent less operating costs.

Although it was initially designed for production in the mid-2020s, the Celera 500 has been retired, and Otto now claims the plane ""was never meant to be a production aircraft."" The focus, it seems, shifted to the Phantom 3500, which is supposed to begin flying operationally in 2030.

Not much is known about the plane at the time of writing, but the bits and pieces of info we were able to gather about it paint a pretty interesting picture. Supposedly, two Williams turbofan engines capable of producing 3,600 pounds of thrust each will be tasked with powering the plane, allowing it to reach a cruise speed of some 460 mph (740 kph).

The plane will be able to fly at maximum altitudes of 51,000 feet (15,544 meters), which is well above the usual height commercial aircraft reach during their flights. This, says Otto, should not only allow the Phantom to avoid traffic, weather, and turbulence, but it will also allow it to eat far less fuel. As an interesting side effect, flying so high also eliminates contrails from the equation.

The laminar flow plane should be capable of traveling for distances of up to 4,000 miles (6,500 km), which is enough to get you from New York to Berlin in one go.

During a single trip, compared to similarly sized aircraft is use today, the Phantom should experience a 35 percent reduction in drag, which in turn would translate into 60 percent less fuel burn. That leads to operating costs being cut in half. As a bonus, when Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is used, CO2 emissions should nosedive by 92 percent.

All of the above sounds interesting and all, but there is one other exciting aspect of this design. Remember how I said earlier that for the sake of laminar flow this thing has no windows? Well, their place will be taken by something called the SuperNatural Vision.

That would be a series of high-definition digital displays stretching the length of the plane on its sides, but also on the roof, apparently. The screens are used to show real-time external views, but aside from giving the cabin a shape unlike any other and the people inside incredible vistas, they also ""eliminate the structural and aerodynamic compromises of conventional windows.""",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/contrail-free-phantom-3500-laminar-flow-aircraft-looks-more-like-a-bullet-than-a-plane-258901_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:57:38.947691

One of the most climate-conscious travel operators is axing carbon offsets as part of a new climate action plan worth €1.13 million a year.

Intrepid Travel, which has been carbon neutral since 2010 and is a certified B Corp, says it has failed to meet ""unreachable"" emission targets due to a lack of government action on renewable energy and sustainable aviation fuels.

In a joint statement, co-founder Darrel Wade and CEO James Thornton announced the company is now retiring its carbon offset program and Climate Active certification to focus on decarbonisation investment instead.

The duo say that while offsets once ""served an important purpose"", they no longer reflect the ""scale or immediacy of the challenge.""

Intrepid's climate action plan

Intrepid will now invest $2 million AUD (around €1.13 million) each year into immediate emissions reductions.

""This will include things like switching our owned and leased vehicles to EVs; investing in renewable energy in our hotels and offices; and sourcing lower-carbon fuel alternatives for transportation,"" the company says.

The tour operator will also work with more than 10,000 suppliers to decarbonise through renewable energy investments and electric vehicles (EVs).

It will also provide loans to suppliers in countries such as Nepal and India so they can purchase their own EVs and install solar panels in tourist accommodations such as homestays.

Other initiatives include investing in more ""domestic and short-haul products"", meaning fewer long-haul flights, as well as offering more flight-free itineraries.

Its progress will be verified by independent auditors in its annual report.

""We've always had the ambition to ensure that exploring the world could also help sustain it – but Intrepid, and frankly the entire travel industry, is not on track to achieve a 1.5C future, and more urgent action is required if we are to get even close,"" Wade and Thornton add.

So, what is carbon offsetting?

When you’re booking a flight online, you’ll often be presented with the option to offset the carbon footprint of your journey.

You’ll be asked if you want to add a small surcharge - sometimes even under €5 - to the cost of your booking to compensate for a proportion of the emissions of your flight.

However, carbon credit schemes have repeatedly been called out by scientists and climate activists as ineffective and even harmful.

So should you be choosing to offset your flight emissions or are there other options to make your journey greener?

How does carbon offsetting for flights work?

When you take a flight, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere can be calculated.

A one-way trip from London Heathrow to Paris Charles De Gaulle emits around 0.32 tonnes of CO2, for example.

When you choose the option to buy carbon credits, the idea is you offset the emissions by funding a scheme that will remove or store the equivalent amount of carbon elsewhere, often by planting trees.

The illusion of carbon offsetting schemes

For many climate scientists, the problem with carbon credits is that they do little to reduce flying - and perhaps even encourage it if travellers think they can make the trip eco-friendly and avoid the dreaded flygskam or ‘flight shame.’

Carbon offsetting at most cancels out emissions already released into the atmosphere, but does not reduce them as travellers sometimes mistakenly believe.

What’s more, many offsetting schemes have been labelled ineffective by scientists, while others can even have a negative impact.

Tree planting and forest protection schemes in particular are questionable yet Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) projects hold about a quarter of credits on the voluntary carbon market.

A 2023 study by researchers from Berkeley University concluded that “current REDD+ methodologies likely generate credits that represent a small fraction of their claimed climate benefit.”

Other investigations have even found that these schemes can have adverse impacts on Indigenous peoples and local communities who are forcibly removed from areas of land.

Legitimate carbon offsetting schemes should be verifiable and long-term - with a strategy in place for the care and maintenance of planted trees - and prove that they are additional projects i.e. the actions wouldn’t have been taken otherwise.

What are alternatives to carbon offsetting your flight?

Not flying at all is the best way to make a journey more planet-friendly.

Taking a train instead of a short-haul flight in Europe can reduce your emissions by over 85 per cent.

Thanks to Europe’s rail renaissance, long-distance train journeys are quicker, more comfortable and cheaper than they’ve ever been. Use websites like Omio and Trainline to find routes and prices and book tickets.

Train journeys can often be as quick as taking a flight because you don’t have to arrive at a train station hours before like you do with a flight. There are also very rarely limits on luggage reducing stress when packing.

On top of all this, it’s healthier to be able to move around a train, rather than being confined to a small seat on a plane. Trains also have perks like child-friendly carriages and, on long journeys, comfortable beds so you can arrive at your destination refreshed and save on the cost of a night’s accommodation.

But if you have to fly, you can choose to do so with airlines that use sustainable aviation fuel and choose an economy seat - business class passengers take up more space so account for more emissions.
