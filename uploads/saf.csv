Minyak sawit menjadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF.","Jakarta, SAWIT INDONESIA – Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tetapi juga berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional. Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

PASPI Monitor (2025) dalam jurnal berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau mengatakan bahwa Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tetapi juga berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Salah satunya adalah kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit. Minyak sawit menjadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil. Asam laurat pada minyak inti sawit dapat diubah menjadi undekana atau bioavtur (PASPI Monitor, 2020; 2025a). Dengan menggunakan teknologi hydro-processed esters and fatty acid (HEFA), asam lemak pada minyak inti sawit dapat diolah menjadi SAF.

Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP) melalui program Grant Riset Sawit (GRS) telah memfasilitasi riset inovasi pengembangan bioavtur berbasis minyak sawit (PASPI Monitor, 2025a). Salah satunya riset Reksowardojo et.al. (2022) yang menghasilkan bioavtur sawit dengan blending rate sebesar 2,4 persen (J2.4) yang dapat digunakan untuk bahan bakar pesawat. Program GRS juga melahirkan inovasi teknologi Katalis Merah Putih untuk memproduksi biofuel termasuk untuk avtur (Subagjo et.al., 2021; 2022).

Hasil riset inovasi GRS tersebut kemudian dikembangkan lebih lanjut dengan skala yang lebih besar. Pada tahun 2021, Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) Cilacap berhasil memproduksi bioavtur dengan menggunakan feedstock minyak inti sawit atau refined bleached deodorized palm kernel oil (RBDPKO) dengan teknologi co-processing dan menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih (KPI, 2025). Tingkat pencampuran (blending rate) antara bioavtur tersebut dengan avtur fosil sebesar 2,4 persen atau J2.4.",https://sawitindonesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pabrik-kelapa-sawit.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 23:56:15.870696

Australia’s domestic hydrogen market sits at 500,000 tonnes annually, valued at around $5 billion

Innovators are advancing tech to cut electricity use, removing one of the key barriers for green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel alternatives

Green hydrogen plays have dropped off investors’ ‘what’s hot’ lists this year, but the global demand for hydrogen still holds tonne-loads of potential. A market worth more than US$200 billion exists in heavy but hard to abate industries – and Australian innovators are finding new ways to make the numbers work.

Under the radar of many investors is an existing hydrogen market worth at least US$200 (A$306) billion globally. Most of the demand for the ~100 million tonnes consumed annually comes from essential but infamously hard to abate industries.

Australia has a 500,000-tonne-a-year hydrogen market - worth up to approximately $5 billion - which fuels the key sectors of steelmaking, fertiliser and chemical production, and refining.

While a lot of people think of all hydrogen as clean and green, the vast majority used by industry is grey or black – produced from gas or coal – and those varieties release millions of tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year.

Replacing fossil-fuel hydrogen with zero-emissions green hydrogen - produced using wind or solar power - could deliver some of the most immediate and bankable emissions cuts for corporations and governments scrambling to reach emissions targets.

Bankable market

For investors, the real hydrogen play is not just about futuristic cars or headline-grabbing export projects, it’s the massive and stable market for clean industrial feedstock.

More than 60 governments worldwide have adopted hydrogen strategies, and the focus, especially in Europe and Asia, is on low-emissions hydrogen. Billions of euros, yen and Korean won are being invested in R&D, subsidy programs and demonstration plants.

The climate solution green hydrogen offers may be clear, but its cost has been a major challenge. That’s because producing green hydrogen via the standard electrolysis method still requires substantial amounts of clean electricity.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that low-emissions hydrogen currently plays only a marginal role, with production of less than 1 million tonnes per annum - or one per cent of the global market. But, unlocking more cost-effective green hydrogen would lead to an exponential increase in its use.

Australian innovation can shift balance

Eyeing the huge opportunities for game-changing technology, Australian innovators are advancing projects across key sectors including alumina refining and steel production; shipping, aviation and other fuels; and fertiliser production via green ammonia.

Made by combining green hydrogen with nitrogen, green ammonia offers an immediate and high-impact opportunity to decarbonise the fertiliser industry. Additionally, green ammonia can be used as a zero-carbon fuel in the shipping industry - with potential uses as an export fuel.

The green ammonia market is projected to grow from US$407 million in 2024 to US$44,299 million by 2032, an eye-popping compound average growth rate of almost 80 per cent. Australia’s neighbours and close trading partners in Asia and the Pacific dominate the global market with a share of almost 66 per cent, according to Fortune Business Insights.

Green hydrogen projects in Australia are targeting our key sectors including fertiliser production for agriculture, plus steel and fuel.

One company that’s a frontrunner in cracking this industrial-scale market is Hadean Energy, a start-up spun out of CSIRO research. Its tubular Solid Oxide Electrolyser (tSOE) technology uses up to 30 per cent less electricity than conventional proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.

This efficiency edge, combined with the use of industrial waste heat and avoidance of rare and expensive metals, means Hadean’s system can produce hydrogen – and syngas for e-fuels – at significantly lower costs than incumbent green hydrogen technologies.

Additionally, amid the well-publicised gas price rises, grey hydrogen is becoming more expensive, shifting the viability dial towards the green alternative.

Adding to the benefits of its transformative tech, Hadean’s modular units can be made ready for easy integration at industrial sites.

The company has already successfully completed a 1,000-hour industrial trial at BlueScope Steel’s Port Kembla plant, demonstrating it can take the heat of real-world applications.

It’s also earned a spot as a Shell-backed New Energy Challenge 2025 finalist, which puts it on the radar of major energy players.

Another boost for Hadean is its support from advisory firm RFC Ambrian, which has previously helped guide Chrysos (ASX:C79) and FPR Energy from R&D projects to commercialisation.

Looking to leverage overseas interest, Hadean is collaborating with startup NGV Earth on a pilot-scale plant advancing technology to deliver sustainable aviation fuel that doesn't have the environmental baggage of what’s used today.

Further positioning Hadean’s technology for domestic and international impact, the company will soon deploy a multi-kilowatt demonstration unit as part of the Australia-UK Renewable Hydrogen Innovation Partnerships program.

This program, with high-level government support in both countries, is sharply focused on the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries.

It’s these existing high-emissions yet essential for modern life industries - not the cool cars and shiny new projects - that will propel us towards a decarbonised future.

By growing in these proven and large-scale markets the green hydrogen sector can set itself up for broader adoption and unlock the capital set to flow into one of the energy transition’s key growth opportunities.

Gadkari was speaking at the tenth anniversary of Naam Foundation, an organisation started by actors Makarand Anaspure and Nana Patekar for watershed management and drought mitigation. At the event, he said, ""It will be tough for the farmers to survive only by cultivating pulses or grains. The sugar industry could survive because of ethanol. Now, an alternative to diesel called isobutanol will be produced. We are also planning to develop sustainable aviation fuel using biogas."" The minister also said that sugar is in surplus in the country. Nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced liquidation had there been no ethanol, he said. The production cost of sugar in Brazil is around Rs27 per kg, while the same in Maharashtra is around Rs32-33. Brazil introduces sugar at around Rs30 per kg in the international market, making it more difficult for us to sell our stock, incurring a loss of Rs2-3 per kg. ""So, farmers will have to ensure that they become producers of not only food but also fuel, electricity, aviation, bitumen, and hydrogen. That will make villages rich,"" said Gadkari. Use of corn for ethanol production, according to him, has helped give a better price to corn — up from Rs1,200 per quintal to Rs2,800 per quintal. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra have benefited from the increased production, said the minister, adding that production has also gone up by three times. This yield is taken thrice a year. Commenting on other issues, Gadkari said, better water supply management is needed in the country to improve the agricultural sector and lives of farmers. ""Politics over usage of river water and river water distribution has created complications. There were around 23 disputes between states about river water distribution. The majority have been resolved,"" he assured. Gadkari also said that if Maharashtra's milk production goes up and irrigation increases by 65%, many agricultural issues will be resolved. In another programme on the same day, Gadkari was awarded by the Geeta Dharma Mandal organisation. While speaking here, he said new-age methods like videos or reels should be used to spread the message of life given by the Bhagavad Geeta. ""It will help youngsters define the real meaning of life as well as politics and its purpose. We need to redefine politics. Instead of the politics of power, it should be more centred around social reforms. The issue in today's political circles is not the difference of opinions, but the lack of opinions,"" he said.

,,2025-09-14 20:46:19+00:00,CBC,'We've taken a huge hit': Alberta canola farmers face uncertainty due to Chinese tariffs - CBC,"Amir Said, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/we-ve-taken-a-huge-hit-alberta-canola-farmers-face-uncertainty-due-to-chinese-tariffs-1.7633728,"Canola producers are entering harvest season with significant uncertainty in the wake of China's latest tariff on Canadian canola.
Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.
Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.
""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said.
The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.","Canola producers are entering harvest season with significant uncertainty in the wake of China's latest tariff on Canadian canola.

China, which slapped a 75.8 per cent duty on Canadian canola seed last month, is Canada's largest canola seed importer, with seed exports making up the vast majority — $4 billion — of Canada's $4.9 billion in canola product exports to China in 2024.

This tariff on canola seed, coupled with 100 per cent tariffs on Canadian canola oil and canola meal imposed by China in March, is the cause of much concern among producers across Western Canada.

According to the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, the province is home to 14,000 canola farmers who grow the oilseed crop over 6.6 million acres of farmland, creating a lucrative industry that employs over 40,000 Albertans.

Canola market 'spiraling down'

Alberta Canola director and farmer Christine McKee said she's feeling ""a little bit of panic"" and ""a lot of frustration"" due to the new tariff.

""Just so much uncertainty,"" said McKee. ""Exporting to China is essential to the canola industry in Canada.""

""There isn't a lot farmers can do. Plans are usually set by now for what we're doing next year. We grow our crops on a rotation basis, and it's not easy to make changes.""

Part of the problem is that uncertainty around the trade situation with China has left producers worried about what they are going to grow for next year, and who they are going to sell it to.

""We need a verbal commitment of financial support in response to these politically-based tariffs,"" McKee said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.

""We're not in a good situation right now,"" he said. ""We've taken a huge hit already, but we don't know how big that hit is going to be.""

Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.

""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said. ""We have a good crop coming, but at the same time … we do depend on these export sales, for places to move it to.""

With approximately 40,000 canola farms nationwide, canola is a major driver of the Canadian economy. The industry contributes an average of $43.7 billion to the national economy annually, and supports over 200,000 jobs across the country, according to the Canola Council of Canada.

The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.

""We have a significant amount of canola supply chain, value chain activity that happens in the Lethbridge region,"" said Trevor Lewington, CEO of Economic Development Lethbridge. ""Those tariffs are likely to slow down access to [the Chinese] market and will force us to think about either new markets, who else can we sell to, or what else can we do.""

Diversifying the market

One possible solution could be to look to the sky to diversify, said Lewington.

""There's growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said. ""And so that's something that might not have been considered before, because of course, the focus should be growing food and supplying food to a hungry world.""

""But if that market is no longer interested in our product for food, then perhaps we can shift it to other uses, like aviation.""

As research continues into the use of canola to fuel planes, Lewington said diversification can also come in the form of increasing trade with other markets.

""China certainly is a big market. It's not the only market. We're not entirely dependent on that,"" said Lewington. ""So there is an opportunity, I think, for the canola commissions to do more marketing, to extend the reach into other markets or grow our share in the existing markets that we have.""

In 2024, Canada's total canola exports were valued at $14.5 billion. The United States is the largest customer of canola as a whole, with exports valued at $7.7 billion, followed by China, which is the largest buyer of raw canola seed.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7633730.1757878423!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fea-canola-20250718.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-14 17:56:09.965274

“Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe”. Voici le titre d’un texte du scientifique David Ho et l’économiste Gernot Wagner que nous traduisons ici avec leur accord.

Ce texte permet de voir le changement climatique sous un autre angle, une autre perspective.

Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe.

Les événements ponctuels comme Deepwater Horizon laissent une impression durable, mais la combustion normale des énergies fossiles a un impact encore plus grave.

La marée noire provoquée par la plateforme Deepwater Horizon dans le golfe du Mexique il y a une douzaine d’années a été une tragédie humaine et environnementale. Elle a coûté la vie à 11 personnes, déversé des millions de barils de pétrole dans le golfe et coûté à BP Plc plus de 65 milliards de dollars en frais de nettoyage et en indemnités.

Mais si tout ce pétrole avait été vendu et utilisé, il aurait été encore plus mortel et dévastateur pour l’environnement.

C’est ce qu’a récemment affirmé le co-auteur de la newsletter d’aujourd’hui, le climatologue David Ho, dans un tweet qui a été largement partagé :

Parfois, je pense au fait que Deepwater Horizon a été une catastrophe environnementale majeure qui a coûté la vie à 11 personnes et plus de 65 milliards de dollars à BP, mais si ce pétrole avait été récupéré, vendu et utilisé, cela aurait été pire pour l’environnement, aurait tué plus de personnes et BP aurait gagné de l’argent.

— David Ho (@david_ho) 28 janvier 2022

Au début, j’étais sceptique (Gernot). Mais le calcul de base est correct, et c’est même probablement sous-estimé.

La marée noire a provoqué le déversement d’environ 200 millions de gallons de pétrole dans le golfe du Mexique. Brûler autant de gallons de pétrole et de diesel dans des moteurs à combustion aurait émis plus de 1,4 million de tonnes de CO₂, sans compter, par exemple, les émissions liées au raffinage et au transport du pétrole. Traduit en nombre moyen de vies perdues en raison du changement climatique qui en résulte, cela implique environ 325 décès au cours du siècle, liés uniquement à la hausse des températures. Cela n’inclut pas les décès dus aux particules fines générées par la combustion de ce carburant, qui pourraient représenter 350 décès prématurés supplémentaires par an.

Twitter étant Twitter, les réponses ont nécessité une réponse de David : « Je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. » Nous ne devrions pas. Il existe de nombreux autres coûts environnementaux qui ne sont pas pris en compte dans les 11 décès et les 65 milliards de dollars. L’impact dévastateur sur la faune sauvage ne peut être que partiellement reflété dans les chiffres des dommages financiers. Une partie du pétrole déversé a brûlé de manière incontrôlable, libérant à nouveau du CO₂. Le pétrole qui n’est pas brûlé mais qui finit par s’évaporer cause également de nombreux dommages environnementaux.

Hélas, il existe une grande différence entre un calcul statistique basé sur des estimations globales des dégâts et la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès, comme dans le cas de la plate-forme pétrolière Deepwater Horizon. Onze décès constituent une tragédie, tandis que 325 décès estimés statistiquement ne sont que cela, une statistique.

Il existe une autre différence, ce que l’on appelle en termes juridiques la “cause immédiate”. Cary Coglianese, professeur de droit et de sciences politiques à la Carey Law School de l’université de Pennsylvanie, décrit cela comme « une version juridique de la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès ». Tout tribunal raisonnable conviendrait que les 11 décès survenus sur Deepwater Horizon étaient directement liés à l’explosion et à l’incendie de la plate-forme.

Grâce aux progrès rapides réalisés dans le nouveau domaine de la science de l’attribution, les décès liés au climat et autres dommages peuvent désormais être liés plus directement aux tonnes de CO₂ émises. En effet, un nombre croissant de poursuites judiciaires visent à établir un lien de causalité direct entre les dommages climatiques et les décès, mais aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients.

Il existe une autre raison, trop humaine, pour laquelle 11 décès lors d’un événement ponctuel pèsent plus lourd que 325 décès futurs. M. Coglianese, de l’université de Pennsylvanie, compare la différence entre le changement climatique et la marée noire de BP à celle entre la pandémie de Covid-19 et les attentats terroristes du 11 septembre 2001 : « Le 11 septembre a tué environ 3 000 personnes », dit-il. « Nous avons eu environ autant de décès liés au Covid rien qu’hier aux États-Unis. » Plus de 900 000 Américains sont morts du Covid au cours des deux dernières années, et bien plus de 5,5 millions dans le monde, et ce ne sont là que les décès directement attribués à la maladie. « Nous semblons devenir insensibles à cette catastrophe quotidienne », ajoute M. Coglianese.

Nous ne devons bien sûr pas devenir insensibles aux milliers de décès quotidiens liés au Covid, ni aux centaines de décès liés, selon des estimations prudentes, à la quantité de pétrole brûlée, équivalente à celle déversée lors de la marée noire de BP. Les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité.

Compléments d’informations

Vous pourriez être surpris en lisant ce texte. Vous dire “attendez, il dit qu’une marée noire c’est moins pire qu’autre chose ?”. David Ho a été attaqué sur les réseaux sociaux après avoir publié ce texte, et a tout de suite précisé le fond de sa pensée :

“je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. Je souligne simplement l’ironie du fait que la combustion des énergies fossiles nuit beaucoup plus à l’environnement et tue beaucoup plus de personnes, mais comme il s’agit d’émissions de scope 3, les entreprises comme BP ne sont pas tenues responsables et engrangent au contraire des milliards de dollars.”

Il est prévisible que certaines personnes répondent que les énergies fossiles sont géniales. Vous savez ce qui est génial aussi ? Une planète habitable.”

Le coeur du texte est bien dans le titre : il y a des morts quotidiennes du changement climatique dans le monde sans que cela choque outre mesure. C’est un fait : les morts du changement climatique sont des morts silencieuses. Même s’il peut y en avoir 100 fois plus de morts à cause du changement climatique, cela n’aura jamais l’impact médiatique d’un crash d’avion ou d’une marée noire. Dernier exemple en date, la canicule de juin 2025 a fait environ 500 morts en France selon Santé Publique France. Avez-vous vu un seul responsable politique en parler ? Un journaliste interroger un membre du gouvernement ?

Cet article appelle à juste titre à changer d’angle, à aller plus loin dans la réflexion sur le changement climatique. The Onion (une sorte de Gorafi américain) a parfaitement compris l’ironie de la situation avec ce titre : “des millions de barils de pétrole arrivent à bon port malgré une catastrophe environnementale majeure“.

“Ouf”, on a évité la marée noire, qui aurait été une catastrophe. La réalité, c’est qu’on aurait évité une catastrophe si le pétrole avait été remis sous terre, là où il devrait rester.

Autre point important, les progrès réalisés dans le domaine de la science de l’attribution, dont nous avons dédié un article entier sur Bon Pote. Si “aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients”, cela pourrait bientôt ne plus être le cas.

La science a permis de clarifier le lien sans équivoque entre les activités humaines et le réchauffement climatique et c’est désormais un argument clef dans les procès. La Cour Internationale de Justice a par ailleurs récemment publié un avis notamment basé sur le dernier rapport du GIEC. Grâce à cet avis, il est à prévoir que les procès vont se multiplier contre les Etats et les entreprises qui savent que leurs activités tuent et ne font rien ou pas assez pour arrêter ce phénomène.

Comme le rappelle David Ho, “les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité“.",https://bonpote.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deepwater_Horizon_offshore_drilling_unit_on_fire_2010.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:56:53.887164

Shubhangi Mathur New Delhi

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India’s largest oil refiner, is working on an expansion plan in line with the country’s growing fuel requirements. In an exclusive interaction with Shubhangi Mathur, Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney talks of the company’s growth plan and also sets the record straight on the E20 controversy. Edited excerpts.

How do you look at the controversy over ethanol-blended petrol? Do you plan to offer consumers the choice of buying non-blended petrol too? And is E20 (20 per cent ethanol blending) as efficient as petrol?

As of now, we do not have any plans to offer non-blended petrol. We will see how it pans out and take a call accordingly. There is no controversy on E20 petrol. All the equipment manufacturers, labs, and agencies have certified that there is no problem with E20. We have a good example of Brazil, where petrol with 27-32 per cent ethanol blending is being sold. The efficiency of E20 is more or less on a par with that of petrol.

India aims to become a refining hub. How would IOC contribute to that?

Given the need for India’s increasing demand for fuel, IOC started expanding brownfield refineries three-four years ago. These projects are set to increase the group’s refining capacity from 80.4 million tonnes to 98 million tonnes per annum. They are scheduled to be commissioned next year. The increased capacity will take care of a large part of the increased demand for petroleum products. In the same timeframe, other refinery projects will also come up, including the expansion of the Rajasthan and Numaligarh (Assam) refineries.

The Indian market is expanding at a moderate pace, with diesel consumption growing at 2–3% and petrol at 5–7%. The industry will also actively pursue exporting surplus petroleum products once production begins following the completion of planned refinery expansions.

Which markets do you plan to target for export?

Petroleum products will go primarily to the African subcontinent and South American continent. Certain refineries are closing in the European Union. They will need products that meet Euro VI standards. Our products meet those quality standards. So, Europe is another geography. For IOC, export accounts for 5-8 per cent of its volumes. This is going to increase.

What are the timelines involved in these expansion projects?

We are aiming to complete the expansion of the Panipat refinery by March. Those in Gujarat and Bihar (Barauni) too will see completion by next year. Much of our refinery expansion will be commissioned by 2026.

Are you planning to set up greenfield refineries?

Not at present. We are focused on executing brownfield expansion while addressing the energy transition. With the rise of electric vehicles, green hydrogen, ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and other alternative fuels, the growth of petroleum products will be moderate. However, as the country’s leading energy provider, we may consider setting up a greenfield refinery, depending on the evolving demand-supply scenario.

Indian Oil has an upcoming greenfield refinery with Chennai Petroleum in Tamil Nadu.

We are working out the configuration, which will be more suitable for petrochemicals and less for refineries. We want to convert it into a petrochemical-oriented project. The detailed feasibility report is being prepared for the project.

Saudi Arabia is looking to increase its share in the global oil market. Are you in talks with the people there?

We are not in any kind of talks. We know some newer (Indian) refineries are in talks but we are keeping our crude oil portfolio in an open manner because we want to process as many type of crude oil as possible. We have flexibility of 10 refineries which can process almost all kinds of crude oil. That is our strength.

On IOC’s green-hydrogen plant in Panipat?

We are putting up India’s largest green hydrogen plant at Panipat, with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum. It will be commissioned by December 2027 and will be utilised for mobility purposes if enough hydrogen-fuelled buses, trucks or cars are available in the market. Otherwise, we will use it in our refineries and replace the conventional grey hydrogen with green hydrogen. The cost of production will be less than $4 per kg.

IOC is also foraying into new energy such as nuclear and critical minerals.

Nuclear energy, critical minerals, and ship building are on our drawing board. It is premature to talk about these things.

What is your outlook on crude oil prices?

Prices now are $66-67 a barrel in spite of all the disturbances happening across the world. My assessment is that if these disturbances ease then prices will further come down by $5-10, reaching $55-60.

At RepAir, he leads business development, international partnerships, and commercial scaling of its electrochemical carbon capture technology.

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions – nearly a gigaton annually – and is growing faster than rail, road or shipping. This sector represents one of the most challenging to decarbonise.

As the International Energy Agency notes, reaching net-zero will require “revolutionary” designs, including alternative propulsion technologies such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft.

However, battery electric propulsion is currently limited to very small aircraft and short ranges. Using hydrogen poses significant challenges: innovative fuel storage and delivery methods, low-cost lightweight cryogenic tanks, and redesigned airframes to accommodate them. Questions about hydrogen’s impact on contrails remain unanswered, with dedicated studies still underway.

This technological reality makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) critical to decarbonising aviation now. Yet here too, there’s a fundamental constraint that needs to be addressed – and urgently.

SAF from biogenic feedstocks has fundamental limits

While the EU has set ambitious SAF blending targets – 2% this year, rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 with a synthetic fuel sub-mandate of 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 – the industry’s current approach relies heavily on biogenic CO2 from crops, agricultural waste and other biological sources. And biogenic feedstocks have inherent limitations that make these targets mathematically impossible.

The EU’s RefuelEU regulation excludes SAFs produced from food and feed crops due to sustainability concerns. While biojet kerosene from animal fat and waste oil feedstocks are included, their growth potential is limited by supply.

More abundant feedstocks could come from agricultural residues, dedicated energy crops and municipal solid waste – but even these face constraints.

First, cultivating crops for fuel creates direct land use competition with food production or requires land conversion. Second, and more critically, biogenic sources are finite.

Meeting the EU’s 2050 SAF targets through biogenic sources alone would require between 7% and 18% of today’s EU agricultural land, depending on the feedstock. It’s both impractical and impossible at the scale needed.

Even if we maximised every available biogenic source globally, we’d fall short of the gigatons of CO2 needed for aviation fuel production by 2050.

This is where atmospheric CO2 becomes essential.

Direct Air Capture: Sustainable aviation fuel from the sky

Direct Air Capture (DAC) allows us to capture CO2 needed to produce e-SAF – synthetic fuels made by combining atmospheric CO2 with green hydrogen produced by electrolysers run on low-emissions electricity through processes like Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-jet conversion.

The key advantage is unlimited feedstock: the atmosphere contains all the CO2 we need. We’re not talking about offsetting here – this is about recycling; creating a circular carbon economy where aviation’s emissions become tomorrow’s fuel.

RefuelEU Aviation regulation already recognises this distinction, segregating between biogenic SAF and e-SAF from direct air capture. This is an acknowledgement that atmospheric carbon represents a fundamentally different resource with fundamentally different potential.

What makes this pathway particularly promising is also infrastructure compatibility. Airports in Rome and Paris are already preparing for e-fuel supply chains. Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives that would require complete infrastructure overhauls, e-SAF uses existing fuel systems.

That’s a massive advantage for an industry that needs solutions now, not in ten years.

Cutting the cost of carbon capture through electrochemical innovation

The cost challenge is real but not insurmountable. Traditional DAC technologies have struggled with high energy requirements – often consuming 2,500 kWh or more per tonne of CO2 captured.

But innovation is rapidly changing this equation. New electrochemical approaches can achieve up to 70% lower energy consumption compared to conventional thermal-based systems.

By eliminating the need for high-temperature processes and chemical solvents, these technologies can reduce both operational costs and capital requirements. When you factor in mass manufacturing potential using standard materials rather than exotic components, the path to cost-competitive atmospheric CO2 becomes clear.

The same innovation curve that brought battery costs down by 90% over the past decade is beginning to transform DAC.

But we need to be honest about the challenge: the entire e-SAF value chain – from DAC to hydrogen production to fuel synthesis – requires substantial energy inputs. Current e-SAF costs five to six times more than conventional jet fuel.

Building a SAF production plant takes 10 to 20 years to reach full operational scale. This is why it’s a day-one challenge. The plants we need operational in 2040 must break ground today.

Aviation’s sustainable future must include atmospheric carbon

The truth is that from a pure energy efficiency standpoint, the numbers might favour simply capturing CO2 and storing it underground.

But Europe – and other countries such as the UK, Brazil and Japan – have chosen a different path, for better or for worse: pushing the industry to innovate beyond the World War II-era Fischer-Tropsch process, to find new pathways that make recycled carbon economically viable.

For this to happen, I believe three critical developments must happen:

First: Reinforce supply-side and demand-side policies to scale up e-SAF production and offtake

Second: Tax aviation fuels according to their climate impact, acknowledging that only a minority of the world flies

Third: Position aviation as a lead market to bring nascent decarbonisation options to commercial scale. Actions from leading airlines and airports that serve as key international and domestic hubs can generate the market pull needed to catalyse the adoption of efficient operations and best-in-class technologies

E-SAF from atmospheric CO2 doesn’t compete with biogenic SAF – we need every sustainable fuel source available, but only atmospheric carbon offers the unlimited scale required for aviation’s future.

It’s time we acknowledge that aviation’s sustainable future depends on turning the sky itself into our fuel source.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jean-Philippe-Hiegel-RepAir-Carbon-opinion-piece.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:14.083662

katakabar.com - Penerapan Bioavtur atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) di Indonesia, selain digunakan sektor penerbangan juga untuk ekspansi atau pengembangan industri SAF nasional.

Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan SAF atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF, seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

Jurnal PASPI Monitor (2025) berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau menyebutkan, Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan atau menerapkan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tapi berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Di antarsnya, yakni kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit: Minyak sawit jadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil. Asam laurat pada minyak inti sawit dapat diubah menjadi undekana atau bioavtur (PASPI Monitor, 2020; 2025a). Dengan menggunakan teknologi hydro-processed esters and fatty acid (HEFA), asam lemak pada minyak inti sawit dapat diolah menjadi SAF.

Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan atau BPDP lewat program Grant Riset Sawit atau GRS telah fasilitasi riset inovasi pengembangan bioavtur berbasis minyak sawit (PASPI Monitor, 2025a). Di antaranya riset Reksowardojo et.al. (2022) yang menghasilkan bioavtur sawit dengan blending rate sebesar 2,4 persen (J2.4) yang dapat digunakan untuk bahan bakar pesawat. Program GRS juga melahirkan inovasi teknologi Katalis Merah Putih untuk memproduksi biofuel termasuk untuk avtur (Subagjo et.al., 2021; 2022).

Hasil riset inovasi GRS tersebut kemudian dikembangkan lebih lanjut dengan skala yang lebih besar. Pada tahun 2021, Kilang Pertamina Internasional atau KPI Cilacap berhasil memproduksi bioavtur dengan menggunakan feedstock minyak inti sawit atau refined bleached deodorized palm kernel oil atau RBDPKO dengan teknologi co-processing dan menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih (KPI, 2025). Tingkat pencampuran (blending rate) antara bioavtur tersebut dengan avtur fosil sebesar 2,4 persen atau J2.4.

Terus dilakukan uji penerbangan bioavtur J2.4 dengan menggunakan pesawat CN-235 milik PT Dirgantara Indonesia pada Oktober 2021 dan Garuda Indonesia dengan rute penerbangan Jakarta-Solo pada Oktober 2023. Hasil uji terbang tersebut menunjukkan kinerja mesin stabil tanpa perbedaan signifikan dibandingkan avtur konvensional.

Keberhasilan itu otomatis picu optimistik dalam pengembangan bioavtur/SAF di Indonesia. Pengembangan bioavtur/SAF berbasis minyak inti sawit (J2.4) di Indonesia siap untuk masuk ke tahap komersialisasi. Faktor yang mendukung kesiapan tersebut adalah ketersediaan bahan baku dan teknologi HEFA serta kapabilitas eksisting kilang produksi coprocessing milik KPI sebesar 347 juta kiloliter per tahun (KPI, 2025). Produksi bioavtur/SAF J2.4 juga telah memenuhi sertifikasi teknis untuk aplikasi pada pesawat komersial dan telah lulus uji terbang.

Minyak Jelantah dan PFAD: Selain minyak sawit, terdapat produk olahan sawit yang berpotensi menjadi bahan baku SAF di Indonesia yakni minyak jelantah (used cooking oil/UCO) dan palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). Minyak jelantah dianggap sebagai limbah dari penggunaan minyak goreng sawit, sedangkan PFAD dianggap sebagai by-product. Dengan status tersebut, pengurangan emisi siklus hidup dari SAF berbasis minyak jelantah atau PFAD lebih signifikan dibandingkan avtur fosil sehingga menjadikan kedua feedstock tersebut termasuk dalam positive list sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel dan mendapatkan sertifikasi keberlanjutan.

Sebagai bahan bakar pesawat yang berkelanjutan, SAF harus memenuhi kriteria berkelanjutan CORSIA sehingga dapat tergolong sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel (ICOA, 2025a; DGCA, 2025). Dalam publikasi ICAO (2025b), feedstock yang memenuhi kriteria sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel jika nilai life cycle assessment (default core LCA value) rendah dan tidak terkait secara langsung dengan konversi lahan (indirect land use change/ILUC) setelah 1 Januari 2008.

Penggunaan limbah seperti minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF memberikan keuntungan karena nilai default ILUC dianggap nol sehingga dapat mengurangi emisi lebih besar dibandingkan produk primer seperti minyak nabati atau lemak hewani (IATA, 2025).

Tidak cuma itu, SAF yang diproduksi dari minyak jelantah akan menghasilkan penghematan emisi karbon (carbon intensity) yang paling rendah dibandingkan SAF berbasis feedstock lain. Kemampuan reduksi emisi karbon dari penggunaan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah relatif tinggi yakni sekitar 84 persen dibandingkan avtur fosil (ICAO, 2021; Kemenko Marves, 2024).

Pemanfaatan limbah minyak jelantah ini dukung ekonomi sirkuler sehingga nilai keberlanjutannya semakin tinggi. Hal tersebut yang melatarbelakangi upaya pemerintah untuk mengembangkan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah (UCO) di Indonesia.

Dengan potensi minyak jelantah yang berhasil dikumpulkan sebanyak tiga juta kiloliter (TNP2K, 2020; Prasetiawan, 2022) atau sekitar 3,9 juta ton per tahun pada tahun 2023 (Kemenko Marves, 2024) diharapkan mampu mendukung pengembangan SAF yang memenuhi kriteria berkelanjutan CORSIA.

Keunggulan lainnya adalah penggunaan teknologi jalur HEFA untuk mengolah minyak jelantah (maupun RBDPKO) menjadi SAF tergolong sebagai teknologi yang relatif matang, aman, dan sudah dikembangkan di Indonesia.

Selain minyak inti sawit, PFAD, dan minyak jelantah, produk sampingan (joint product) dari tanaman sawit juga masih menyimpan potensi sebagai alternatif feedstock SAF. Produk yang dimaksud adalah POME dan TKKS.

Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) dan Tandan Kosong Kelapa Sawit (TKKS): Kedua feedstock tersebut tergolong sebagai kelompok limbah yang berpotensi memenuhi kriteria CORSIA eligible fuel dan mendapatkan sertifikasi keberlanjutan. Dengan menggunakan teknologi jalur HEFA, limbah POME yang kaya senyawa organik dan fraksi lipid berpotensi untuk diolah menjadi SAF.

Dengan menggunakan jalur teknologi fischer tropsch atau alcohol-to-jet, biomassa TKKS yang mengandung selulosa, hemiselulosa, dan lignin potensial untuk dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan baku SAF pada masa mendatang (PASPI, 2025).

With the evolution of tomorrow’s aircraft gathering pace, paired with alternative fuel sources and new powerplant types, several companies are seeking to take full advantage of the opportunities that may arise.

One such company is the European start-up MAEVE, which is busy designing its 80-seat regional jet, to be called the Maeve Jet MJ500. Maeve’s vision is to make aviation sustainable for millions of travellers and to reduce more than 50 metric tons of carbon dioxide from commercial airline routes by 2040.

Maeve’s strategy is to “develop a globally competitive aircraft family compatible with existing infrastructure, setting new standards in energy efficiency and economics.”

With its hybrid electric engines and sleek design, MAEVE’s latest Maeve Jet aircraft is being lined up to revolutionise the regional airline industry. But who exactly is MAEVE Aerospace, and what role will its aircraft have in the future of regional passenger aviation?

The MAEVE Aerospace story so far

MAEVE Aerospace is a European start-up in the development of sustainable and economic aircraft designs. With offices in Delft, The Netherlands, and Munich, Germany, the company was founded in 2021 to revolutionise the regional aircraft industry.

MAEVE is supported by private investors, the Government of the Netherlands, and the European Investment Council (EIC)

The company initially began designing a 44 to 52-seat regional aircraft in 2023. Called the Maeve 01, the early design was a high-wing monoplane with all-electric propulsion, including eight electric motors placed on the leading edge of the wings.

Initially expected to enter service in 2029, the model was initially marketed as offering a range of 288 miles (or 460km) on a single charge.

MAEVE Aerospace was positioning the Maeve01 as a zero-emissions aircraft to replace older ATR42s and DHC-8s and promised that it would be possible to fully recharge the aircraft in just 35 minutes.

Then, in late 2023, with the further development of hybrid electric propulsion systems, the company revealed its plans had morphed into developing an 80-seat hybrid-electric regional aircraft.

MAEVE said its new ‘M80’ aircraft had the potential to replace both turboprops and regional jets in the short-haul commercial airline arena. Images portrayed the M80 as a high-wing aircraft with a pair of wing-mounted hybrid turboprop engines and featuring a T-tail style design.

With the switch to hybrid-electric technology with the M80, the company said that the move would push the expected entry into service of its flagship aircraft back by two years to 2031.

But in return, the new aircraft would offer almost double the capacity of its predecessor, the Maeve01, and would also offer additional capability by increasing the range of the aircraft to around 800 nautical miles (1,482 km).

According to MAEVE’s website about the M80 model, “the M80 offers the performance of a jet and the efficiency of a turboprop, a game-changing combination.

“The M80 is a clean-sheet design with a newly integrated hybrid propulsion system, resulting in a significant reduction of mission energy and fuel consumption. This makes the Maeve Jet the perfect replacement for both the regional jets and turboprops.”

“To my knowledge, there are currently no alternatives in development that are equally sustainable, cost-effective, and match the operational needs of airlines and airports,” adds Martin Nuesseler, Chief Technology Officer at Maeve Aerospace in 2023.

“If there are, I would applaud them, because we need more of these realistic solutions to become sustainable”.

The M80 transforms into the Maeve Jet MJ500

In June 2025, MAEVE issued a new statement revealing that, following advice and guidance from its partners, it had completely resigned the M80, which had now become the Maeve Jet MJ500.

The aircraft was by this stage had now become a low-wing aircraft with two aft-mounted open-rotor/stator engines with a two-propeller style design.

According to the company, the new design of the Maeve Jet features reduced cabin noise, achieved by mounting small-diameter propulsors at the rear fuselage and a low wing to compensate for weight distribution.

While hybrid designs are not entirely emission-free, MAEVE claims that its Maeve Jet will consume 40% less energy than a traditional airliner of a similar size, such as the Bombardier CRJ900.

The company added that the Maeve Jet’s clean-sheet design and engine thermal optimization when operating at high altitude are also expected to contribute towards its overall energy efficiency.

Specifications for the Maeve Jet hybrid-electric regional aircraft

According to the company’s own published figures, the Maeve Jet has a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 34,000 kg (74,956 lbs) and offers a maximum payload of 9,700 kg (21,385 lbs)

Operators of the Maeve Jet will have the capability of flying sectors up to 1,450 nautical miles (2,685 km) with a load of 76 passengers in a three-class configuration, which decreases to 950 nautical miles (1,759 km) operating with 90 passengers in a two-class layout.

The Maeve Jet is being designed to cruise at a maximum speed of 0.78 Mach, although normal operations will see the aircraft travel at 0.75 Mach. The Maximum Operating Altitude of the Maeve Jet will be 37,000 ft (11,277m).

In terms of runway performance, a Maeve Jet at MTOW will have a take-off run distance of 4,921 ft (1,500 meters) and a landing field length of 1,759 km (1,400meters).

While the aircraft is marketed as an 80-seater in a mixed configuration, the aircraft can accommodate up to 100 passengers in a single-class configuration.

More details about the hybrid-electric engines

At the Farnborough Air Show in July 2024, Maeve announced a major tie-up with RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada to collaborate on the design of the powerplants for Maeve Jet’s predecessor, the M80.

“As a clean sheet design, the performance and efficiency of the M80 will be a game changer for the regional aviation market, combining advanced aerodynamics and a disruptive propulsion technology,” said Martin Nuesseler in July 2024.

“Working together with Pratt & Whitney Canada at this stage of the programme will enable us to validate and optimise the design of the aircraft and hybrid-electric propulsion system, tapping into the full potential of this promising new technology.”

“Reaching the ambitious goals of reducing emissions and making aviation more sustainable will depend on combined efforts to accelerate technology innovation and drive collaboration across our industry,” responded Anthony Rossi, vice president, global sales and marketing, Pratt & Whitney Canada.

“It’s in this spirit that we will collaborate with Maeve, leveraging our growing expertise in sustainable propulsion technologies, as well as our unrivalled experience powering the regional aviation market for four decades.”

MAEVE states in its own publicity that the newly-launched Maeve Jet will feature two hybrid-electric powerplants with ’rotor swirl recovery vanes’ and continues to develop these engines in conjunction with Pratt & Whitney Canada.

Recent developments for MAEVE Aerospace

Following the announcement with Pratt & Whitney Canada on powerplant development, MAEVE revealed in November 2024 that it had entered into an agreement with Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Regional Jet Aviation Group (MHIRJ), where the companies agreed to cooperate with respect to the development of the Maeve Jet.

Under the agreement, MHIRJ will provide collaborative guidance in engineering and advisory services from MHIRJ’s team of regional aviation specialists.

More recently still, in June 2025, Japan Airlines (JAL) became the first major airline to come on board with the Maeve Jet project. With MAEVE, JAL Engineering signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the development of the Maeve Jet.

The partnership aims to “play a key role in optimising the aircraft’s specification and ensuring that it meets the economic and operational requirements essential for supporting the Japanese regional network,” said a MAEVE statement.

JAL is expected to contribute its expertise in areas such as aircraft design, operations, and the establishment of a customer support framework for the Maeve Jet program.

JAL is also to collaborate in developing a new aircraft design system focused on maintaining and enhancing the airworthiness and reliability of the Maeve Jet.

The long-term view is that the Maeve Jet, with its lower emissions, could play a key role in making regional airline operations throughout Japan cleaner and quieter.

“This partnership aligns with the JAL Group’s continuous commitment to revitalizing local communities while maintaining and expanding its network,” said a JAL statement.

“We are honoured to be working with Japan Airlines on this project, with whom we share the vision to develop solutions that can generate an early impact without relying only on decarbonised fuels and further investments in new infrastructure,” added MAEVE’s Martin Nuesseler.

Future aviation growth opens up potential for the Maeve Jet

The regional aircraft market is forecasted to grow well into the next two decades. This growth, according to MAEVE, will be driven by the need for larger aircraft passenger capacities in the 70-90 seat range, where incumbent aircraft are aging and there has not been a new aircraft in this range for many years.

Meanwhile, increasing globalisation, industrial growth, and rising volumes of air traffic are continuing to drive record levels of carbon dioxide and non-carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.

Along with its green credentials and lower operating costs than a conventional jet, MAEVE’s strategy is to access this market with a clean sheet aircraft design “that sets new standards in sustainability and economics.”

MAEVE is targeting the Maeve Jet’s first flight for late 2029, followed by an entry-into-service for late 2032 or early 2033. This will follow an integrated product development plan based on the company’s experience and certification process.

“At MAEVE, we believe efficiency is the most powerful lever for sustainable aviation. Our next-generation aircraft reduces fuel consumption and emissions by 40% using conventional fuel, and by up to 95% when operating with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).”

“The energy efficiency not only cuts environmental impact but also lowers operating costs, making SAF-powered operations economically viable for airlines and accessible for passengers,” concludes the company.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MV2-32.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:26.722737

Sustainable Flight

A New Era in Aviation

At Otto Aerospace, we’re not just building an aircraft — we’re redefining the physics of flight. Our revolutionary laminar flow design isn’t an incremental improvement; it’s a complete rethinking of aerodynamic efficiency. By minimizing drag at a level never before achieved in commercial aviation, Otto’s aircraft represents an entirely new category — one engineered for the future of sustainable air travel.

The Sustainability Revolution in Aviation

Laminar Flow

Aerospace has long been constrained by the inefficiencies of traditional aircraft design. Our full laminar flow technology is a game-changer, drastically reducing fuel burn while maintaining high performance. This isn’t just about making aviation more efficient — it’s about transforming it into a cleaner, more innovative industry.

Slashing Carbon Emissions at the Source

Reducing fuel consumption is the most effective way to reduce carbon emissions in aviation. Our aerodynamic breakthroughs deliver an unprecedented 35% reduction in drag, slashing fuel requirements by up to 60%. When combined with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Otto aircraft reduces carbon emissions by more than 90%. That means significantly lower CO₂ output per passenger-mile, setting a new benchmark for clean aviation.

The Phantom flies at 500 mph on laminar flow airfoils with similar carbon emissions to EVs at 50 mph on wheels.

Reducing Contrails for a Clearer Sky

Contrails are a byproduct of jet engines and contribute significantly to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. By enabling more efficient cruising at optimized altitudes with lower fuel burn, our laminar flow aircraft eliminates contrail formation, helping to further mitigate aviation’s environmental impact.",https://ottoaerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Otto-Aerospace-Web-Thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 14:56:09.254968

T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability.
During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency.
Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.
The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III.","Aircraft designs serve specific purposes, and the C-17 Globemaster is no different. Let's examine its tail, for example. Basically, to make room for its rear loading operations, McDonnell Douglas built the C-17 Globemaster with a T-tail. This allowed it to transport large loads of equipment at airfields quickly with ease thanks to the clearance. Another benefit of the horizontal stabilizer positioned high on the vertical fin and the airflow is stability during mid-air drops when the open cargo doors disrupt the air stream. Keeping the elevator away from engine exhaust and turbulent airflow, it also ensures a cleaner flow over the tail surfaces, which makes it easier to fly.

T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability. Its simplified design reduces considerations for aerodynamic interferences and offers greater short-field performance. The iconic jet was ground-breaking when it was announced in the 1980s. Its reliability, flexibility, and performance were game changers.

Multi-Mission By Design

The C-17’s exceptional capacity for both military and humanitarian missions transformed strategic airlift not only for the US Air Force but allied powers as well. Despite a handful of early design flaws and a challenging manufacturing spool up, the aircraft first went into service in 1993. The T-tail and high wing offer greater clearance at the rear for cargo loading, unloading, and airdrops.

The C-17's speed and payload for supporting forward operations, even on improvised and short fields, solidified its role as a powerful tool for projecting global power. The C-17's primary features are its high speed, ability to land on austere runways, its global range (with aerial refueling), and high reliability. Its versatility has proven highly valuable in carrying out missions beyond airlift, like humanitarian relief, aeromedical evacuation, and special operations.

Steady, predictable handling during complex flight maneuvers and expeditiously performing ground operations are crucial to the C-17’s missions. The high-wing configuration is also beneficial to the same two ends, as is the robust landing gear. McDonnell Douglas' earlier experimental aircraft, the YC-15, is the origin of the T-tail on the C-17. The prototype demonstrated short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities for operating in austere environments, becoming the model for the C-17.

The Best Handling At Any Altitude

The T-tail design of the C-17 offers benefits like improved stall condition management, maneuverability, and consistent elevator response under all conditions. Pitch and roll stability is optimized by the C-17 Globemaster's anhedral (downward sloping) high-wing design, especially when carrying a heavy payload. The wing aspect ratio and configuration aid in lowering lift-induced drag during flight, and performs well going “low and slow” at high angles of attack.

During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency. The aerodynamics of the wing minimize the effect of wingtip vortices to reduce drag and improve the big jet’s performance. Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.

Global Airlift Without Limits

Because the elevator’s airflow is less affected in the event of a stall, recovery is considerably easier to handle. A versatile and effective military transport aircraft, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster excels at handling large, heavy cargo and ensuring a steady elevator response.

Optimized For Short Fields

The C-17 can take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet (1,064 meters) and only 90 feet wide (27.4 meters). The plane can make a 180-degree star turn within 80 feet while on the ground, according to Air Force Technology. It is also capable of backing itself up with reverse thrust when on the ground. The directed flow thrust reversers can be used to go up a 2% gradient slope with a fully loaded aircraft.

The T-tail is designed to perform well both at low altitude during expeditionary missions and at cruise when the C-17 is transiting between air bases. Four 40,440-lb thrust Pratt & Whitney PW2040 turbofan engines, with engine thrust reversers and speed brakes, power the big jet. Its cruise speed is between Mach 0.74 and 0.77, and the range without in-flight refuelling is 2,400 nautical miles.

Aerial refuelling provides an intercontinental non-stop range that is virtually unlimited. The Globemaster III is capable of carrying payloads up to 77 tons. The aircraft has the capacity to carry 134 passengers, 102 paratroopers, six high-dependency medical patients or 36 stretcher patients, one CH-47F Chinook helicopter, or 18 military pallets.

Inside The Globemaster III

A variety of vehicles, palletized cargo, paratroopers, airdrop loads, and aeromedical evacuees can all be transported by the C-17 thanks to its cargo compartment. Three Black Hawk helicopters, four Bushmaster vehicles, and an Abrams tank are among the items that can be loaded into the cargo bay.

The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III. Four Honeywell multifunction cathode-ray tube displays, two full-capability HUDs, and cargo systems are all part of the digital avionics system.

There is also a mechanically operated backup system for the electronic flight control system, which is quadruple redundant. The Northrop Grumman large aircraft infra-red countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is equipped with 56 USAF C-17 aircraft, with 25 upgraded aircraft entering service in 2007.

Over Three Decades Of Service

Boeing was a part of the program from the beginning of the C-17 aircraft's development and manufacturing in 2006. McDonnell Douglas eventually merged with Boeing in 1997, which saw the program fall under its widened umbrella. Currently, there are 275 aircraft in the global C-17 fleet serving the USAF and allied nations, including the UK, Canada, Australia, India, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and the 12-nation Strategic Airlift Capability.

Despite Boeing's announcement that C-17 production would end in 2009 once existing orders were completed, the USAF was authorized to purchase 15 more aircraft in 2008. In July 2008, Qatar ordered two C-17s, and in February 2009, the UAE declared that it would purchase four C-17s in January 2010. Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense awarded a follow-on contract worth up to $2.26 billion to Boeing for the sustainment of the C-17 fleet.

The Indian Ministry of Defence signed a $4.1bn agreement with Boeing in June 2011 to acquire ten more C-1s. The C-17 met all the IAF's requirements during rigorous field evaluation trials held in India in June 2010. Kuwait purchased two C-17s in 2014, along with equipment and training support. The final Globemaster III left the company’s production facility in Long Beach, California, in November 2015, marking the end of the production after more than two decades.

Boeing, in partnership with Mahindra Defence Systems, opened a C-17 training centre in 2016 to serve the Indian Air Force (IAF), and signed an $8m contract to train C-17 aircrews at its international training centre (ITC) in the UK under the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) programme. It also trains Emirati C-17 students. Royal Air Force (RAF) C-17 engineers and aircrew are trained by Boeing at the C-17 International Training Centre (ITC) in Farnborough, United Kingdom.

The C-17 Goes Green

In 2021, Boeing told its defense customers that its military aircraft can run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) up to a 50% blend with conventional fuel. There are no technical problems with Boeing defense aircraft using synthetic aviation turbine fuels. All defense aircraft manufactured by Boeing and their derivatives were covered by the study as well. So on top of the smooth, steady, efficient flying that its T-tail and high wing deliver, it can run on eco-friendly fuel too.

When compared to conventional jet fuel, unblended, or ""neat"" SAF, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 84%. It also presents the industry's biggest opportunity to cut carbon over the next 30 years across all aviation segments. At the moment, a 50/50 blend with traditional fossil fuels is the highest amount of SAF that can be used in the C-17 and other Boeing military aircraft.

Brigadier General Darren Cole, Air Mobility Command (AMC) director of Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection, commented on the SAF program:

As these initiatives continue to unfold, they are expected to further bolster the demand for business travel in the region.
The Bleisure Trend: Business Meets Leisure A notable trend in MENA’s business travel market is the rise of “bleisure” — a blend of business and leisure travel.
Sustainable Growth and Innovation As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised.
This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.","Business travel is expanding significantly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which is already well on its way to becoming a global centre for corporate mobility. MENA is establishing itself as a top corporate travel destination as companies continue to turn their attention to emerging markets. The industry is growing faster than the global average, which is paving the way for a significant shift in the travel industry in the area.

Steady Growth and Investment Surge

In 2024, the MENA corporate travel sector was expected to reach a value of $18.1 billion, with a projected 6.1% year-on-year growth in 2025. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are increasingly aware of the region’s immense potential, pouring capital into its rapidly developing infrastructure. In fact, MENA’s business travel bookings saw a significant 40% surge in early 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024, with the months of April and May marking peak travel periods post-Ramadan.

As global business increasingly turns its attention to the Middle East, projections suggest that the broader market will reach $270.8 billion by 2030. This growth will be propelled by continued infrastructure development, digital innovation, and strengthened economic ties with Europe and Asia, creating a fertile environment for both business and leisure travel.

Key Drivers of Growth

A major contributor to MENA’s expanding business travel market is the economic momentum seen in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. These economies are projected to grow by 4.2% in 2025-2026, compared to around 1.5% in Europe. A significant portion of this growth is being driven by diversification and expansion beyond oil and gas, particularly in sectors like technology, finance, and tourism.

One of the key drivers of the corporate travel boom is the massive infrastructure projects taking place in Saudi Arabia. Projects like Neom, Qiddiya, and the Red Sea development are attracting global talent, particularly consultants, engineers, and project managers. As these initiatives continue to unfold, they are expected to further bolster the demand for business travel in the region.

The Bleisure Trend: Business Meets Leisure

A notable trend in MENA’s business travel market is the rise of “bleisure” — a blend of business and leisure travel. In fact, 25% of business travellers are now extending their trips to incorporate leisure activities, particularly younger generations who prioritise work-life balance. This shift has prompted airlines such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad, and Saudia to enhance their in-flight and ground services, offering more flexible and comfortable travel options to cater to this growing segment.

In response to the increased demand for bleisure travel, regional airlines have introduced new features such as lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible dining and entertainment options. This has made it easier for business travellers to balance work commitments with relaxation and exploration during their trips.

Sustainable Growth and Innovation

As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised. The region is increasingly balancing expansion with environmental responsibility, incorporating carbon dioxide (CO₂) tracking and AI-powered cost optimisation tools into corporate travel operations. Platforms like Tumodo are now offering businesses the ability to forecast spending, track emissions, and ensure eco-friendly travel routes. This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.

In line with regional goals to achieve net-zero emissions, several countries within MENA — including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar — have set ambitious sustainability targets. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel, along with the use of green-certified hotels and infrastructure, is becoming a key part of corporate travel strategies in these countries.

Tech and Infrastructure: Key to Success

Alongside sustainability efforts, the role of technology in enhancing business travel experiences cannot be overstated. MENA is seeing a rise in digital platforms that support business mobility, such as travel booking services and logistics management systems, which help streamline corporate travel operations. The region’s investment in technology is paving the way for greater efficiency, transparency, and convenience in business travel.

Simultaneously, the physical infrastructure required to meet growing demand for corporate travel is being developed at a rapid pace. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is investing heavily in airport expansions, new rail projects, and hotel developments. This has created a robust pipeline of infrastructure projects, attracting both local and international investors.

Challenges and Investment Opportunities

While MENA’s business travel sector presents significant investment opportunities, investors are being cautioned to assess potential risks carefully. The massive scale of ongoing mega-projects presents a risk of market imbalance, especially if demand growth fails to keep up with infrastructure development. Furthermore, potential regulatory shifts related to visas, taxation, and ownership laws could affect the returns on investment.

For businesses seeking to capitalise on the region’s growth, there is a clear opportunity to invest in both physical infrastructure — including hotels, event spaces, and transportation hubs — as well as digital solutions that support business travel operations. However, investors must also consider the possibility of overcapacity in one area and shortages in another if infrastructure development does not keep pace with demand.

Future Outlook: A Global Leader in Business Travel

With its combination of economic diversification, cutting-edge technology, and sustainability initiatives, MENA is solidifying its position as a global leader in the business travel industry as it continues to expand. Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to spearhead this change with its Vision 2030 initiative and a strong emphasis on logistics, infrastructure, and tourism.

How well the area can serve the needs of both business and leisure travellers in the years to come will depend on its capacity to strike a balance between rapid growth, environmental responsibility, and technological innovation. As of right now, MENA continues to be a vibrant and alluring travel, business, and investment destination.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MENA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:11.747259

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel Air passengers anticipating long-distance trips will appreciate the service entry of the Airbus A350F for more than just its technological marvels.","Long-haul fliers wanting flights that are more economical and environmentally friendly might be interested in the latest innovation now being tested in Toulouse, France, home to the latest development of Airbus. The aerospace-friendly city in France is currently constructing the new Airbus A350F freighter, the first of its kind in the new generation of freighter aircraft. Designed and built with a focus on sustainability and operational efficiency, Toulouse officials state it might have a major impact on both cargo and passenger travel in the next decade.

Toulouse has currently become the central hub of aircraft construction in France. The A350F, a derivation of the passenger A350-1000 model, is modified to satisfy the increasing requirement for sustainable aircraft. Major sections of the fuselage from construction plants all over France and Germany are now being assembled in Toulouse. Their architectural design, set out by the government’s aviation authorities, is built around emissions and fuel efficiency on a global scale.

Sustainable Aviation in the Center of Aviation

According to company officials, the A350F is likely the only choice an airline is likely to make when upgrading its fleet. This is due to its compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 2027 CO2 emission. It is, however, designed with cutting-edge features that let it remain far more efficient than its predecessors. Beyond the Rolls-Royce Trent, the A350F offers 2a 0% reduction in consumption, while the other freighters remain unchanged. More than that, with these planes in service, it offers passengers way more options.

In addition, government reports claim that the reduction in cost due to the A350F will indirectly cater to the needs of the consumers. Citizens, especially those living close to the airports, will benefit more than those boarding the flights. The quieter features of the aircraft can reduce pollution levels. Consumers newly introduced to airplanes, who have been disturbed by loud airplanes, will appreciate this feature. It is a huge step in improving aviation.

Elevating Passenger and Cargo Experiences

Even though the A350F is designed for the features that enhance the cargo operations, the design also aids in the passenger logistics by making air freight faster and more dependable. The aircraft is equipped with the class’s largest main deck cargo doors, which afford the airline the ability to carry goods along with passenger services. Transport analysts opine that smoother cargo operations could translate to essential goods such as e-commerce parcels and time-sensitive items being delivered faster to travelers, thus assisting the travelers indirectly.

The Aircraft can carry 111 tonnes and travel 4,700 nautical miles, which is suitable for long-haul to destinations such as Tokyo, Singapore, and Europe. The more recent governmental transport reports indicate that the development and incorporation of innovative flights into the airline fleets results in more accurate schedules and fewer delays overall. This enhances the overall passenger travel experience.

More Environmentally Friendly Routes and Worldwide Communique

With the support of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program, the A350F is certified to use up to 50% of SAF and plans to reach 100% use by 2030. Aviation authorities believe this is vital for cutting the carbon footprint of aviation. Passengers of long-haul flights may enjoy some positive environmental impacts of this aircraft, especially on transcontinental flights between Europe, Asia, and North America.

The government says Toulouse’s aerospace center has become a hub for cutting-edge innovation, with projects like the A350F and other aircraft technologies helping boost the country’s green transport objectives. Officials believe the A350F’s cockpit and cabin could provide seamless improvements to the environmental and operational aspects of the flights and services offered for the served cities.

Reducing Workload and Improving Well-Being for Users

Airbus has partnered with some cargo and airlines operating the A350F to ensure the aircraft is designed for operational efficiency and versatility. These include optimal fuselage volume, floor reinforcements for heavy loads, and variable configuration loading systems that improve indirect passenger travel by flight. These examples of sustainable infrastructure, in addition to making airline travel easier, also contribute to the center of travel systems that encourage new mindsets and systems.

Based on reports from authorities, the A350 passenger family has already logged millions of flight hours and the cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and maintenance practices lessens the cost of training for the airline and streamlines the service offered to the users of the airlines. The airline’s ability to stick to the timetable offers passengers on routes served by the A350F improved reliability and comfort, with airlines better able to maintain timetables and minimize disruptions.

Impact on Travel and Logistics in the World

Airbus A350F is a construction milestone for the airline’s modernization because of the ability to combine flexible freighter and eco-sustainability. The more advanced the fleet, the better equipped the airline will be to provide its passengers with global connectivity through safe, reliable, and eco-friendly travel in response to the global trade and e-commerce boom, coupled with heightened environmental policies.

While airlines are adopting such freighters to respond to the growing global trade, e-commerce boom, and stricter environmental policies, travelers can expect comfort alongside lesser emissions as the assembled A350F, with test flights scheduled for 2026, will be ready, thanks to airlines. The airline’s industry in Toulouse regards the A350F as an indication of the aviation streamline of the future, merging the technological advancements in travel with the benefits brought to its passengers. Authorities point out the project’s features for aviation, showing that the growing aviation demands can still be positive for the planet.

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel

Air passengers anticipating long-distance trips will appreciate the service entry of the Airbus A350F for more than just its technological marvels.

The Normandy refinery: TotalEnergies has begun coprocessing SAF at its Normandy platform. Coprocessing involves the treatment of both fossil jet fuel and biomass in a standard refining unit. The site’s annual production capacity is 160,000 tons.

The Antwerp refinery in Belgium: An initial project to co-process 50,000 tons a year of SAF was launched this year. Annual production capacity will subsequently be increased to 80,000 tons a year.

The Leuna refinery in Germany: A coprocessing project for 50,000 tons a year is planned for 2026.

Total Energies, supplying SAF to customers in the air industry

TotalEnergies supplies aviation fuels including SAF, in line with blending mandates and the needs of its customers. Those customers include several airlines:Air France-KLM, with whom the Company has signed a major deal to deliver up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over ten years. This is one of the Group’s largest SAF supply contracts.

Volotea, which has also signed to buy SAF from TotalEnergies until 2029, in order to reduce the emissions of its flights out of several French airports

TotalEnergies also supplies SAF-blended aviation fuel to several French airports, including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Nazaire.

TotalEnergies, a partner committed to SAF research

TotalEnergies is also forging partnerships with aerospace groups to accelerate the sector’s decarbonization. Those partnerships are playing a critical role in understanding the impact of sustainable aviation fuel composition on aircraft, especially for blends of over 50%. They include:

A partnership with Airbus, signed in 2024, to supply over half the company’s needs in Europe, and conduct a shared R&D program to develop fully sustainable fuels.

A partnership with Safran, begun in 2021, that led to the formulation of a SAF that was completely compatible with current aircraft and was used to power a flight by a military helicopter in February 2023.

TotalEnergies is also stepping up its R&D effort, especially in feedstock, which remains one of the challenges to increasing SAF production. The Solaize research center in Lyon has specialist teams coordinating this work.",,N,,2025-09-14 10:56:10.268541

En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave.
La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar.","Queridos lectores de LT9, hoy con Marcelo Kusznierz los invitamos a conocer un grupo de cultivos que en los últimos años se están abriendo camino en nuestros campos y también en las discusiones sobre el futuro de la agricultura. Se trata de la colza (Brassica napus var. oleifera), la carinata (Brassica carinata) y la camelina (Camelina sativa). Tres especies oleaginosas que, aunque emparentadas en algunos casos y con historias distintas, comparten un denominador común: su capacidad de diversificar las rotaciones, aportar sustentabilidad y generar productos de alto valor, desde aceites alimenticios hasta biocombustibles de última generación.

La colza tiene un largo recorrido en Europa y Canadá. Allí se la conoce más por su versión mejorada: la canola, que fue seleccionada en los años 70 para reducir el ácido erúcico y los glucosinolatos, lo que permitió su uso masivo en alimentación humana.

En los últimos 10 años las materias primas más utilizadas en la producción de biodiésel fueron los aceites vegetales, entre los cuales se destacan el de palma, el de soja y el de canola. Los países que producen biodiésel principalmente a partir de aceite de soja son Estados Unidos, Argentina, Brasil y algunos de la UE.

El aceite de canola, como insumo para su elaboración, se encuentra muy difundido en la UE, mientras que el de palma es muy utilizado en Colombia, Indonesia y el resto del sudeste asiático.

En la actualidad aproximadamente el 20% de la producción mundial de aceite de canola, así como el 19 % del de aceite de soja y el 18% del de aceite de palma se destinó a la producción de biodiésel, marcando la importancia de la plantación de colza a nivel global para los biocombustibles.

En Argentina, la colza comenzó a sembrarse tímidamente en los años 90 y tuvo un fuerte impulso en la última década, especialmente en la región pampeana, como alternativa de invierno frente al trigo.

La carinata, por su parte, es menos conocida. Se trata de una especie originaria de Etiopía, emparentada con la colza pero adaptada a climas más cálidos y secos. En nuestro país se la está probando en varias provincias con muy buenos resultados, sobre todo porque presenta tolerancia a altas temperaturas y genera un aceite ideal para la producción de biocombustibles de aviación (SAF: Sustainable Aviation Fuel), un sector con gran potencial de crecimiento.

Los combustibles sostenibles para aviación se definen como combustibles derivados de materias primas biológicas o no fósiles, que pueden sustituir o complementar a los combustibles para aviación derivados del petróleo, reduciendo las emisiones de GEI a lo largo del ciclo de vida del producto.

Según la AIE (Agencia Internacional de la Energía), mezclar biocombustibles sostenibles para la aviación de bajo contenido de carbono con combustible fósil para aviones será esencial para alcanzar el objetivo de descarbonización. Esto se refleja en su Escenario de Desarrollo Sostenible, donde se prevé que en 2030 los biocombustibles suplirán alrededor del 10 % de la demanda de combustible de aviación y, en 2040, cerca del 20 %. Asimismo, la IRENA (2020), en su “Transforming Energy Scenario”, estima que en 2050 el consumo de biojet llegará a los 100.000.000 m3, siendo los biocombustibles la única opción disponible para reducir significativamente las emisiones de dicho sector.

La camelina, finalmente, es una vieja conocida de la agricultura europea. Hay registros de su cultivo desde hace más de 3.000 años en zonas como Escandinavia y el Mediterráneo. Durante mucho tiempo quedó relegada, pero en la última década resurgió por sus notables ventajas: ciclo corto, rusticidad, bajo requerimiento de insumos y un aceite rico en ácidos grasos omega-3. Al igual que carinata tiene como destino principal el biocombustible.

Tanto la camelina como la carinata son materias primas utilizables para la producción de SAF, de acuerdo al proceso productivo de este combustible podemos detallar su correspondiente porcentaje de mezcla, procesos tecnológicos aprobados a través de la norma ASTM para la fabricación, su año de aprobación, las posibles materias primas por utilizar y el volumen máximo de mezcla con combustibles fósiles.

Aspectos agronómicos

Colza

Ciclo: 120 a 150 días.

Siembra: otoño, compitiendo directamente con trigo.

Requerimientos: necesita suelos bien drenados y buena fertilización nitrogenada y sulfatada.

Ventajas: excelente antecesor para soja de segunda, alta producción de biomasa que mejora la estructura del suelo.

Rindes: en Argentina varían entre 1.5 y 3 toneladas por hectárea, con picos superiores en condiciones óptimas.

Carinata

Ciclo: similar a la colza, aunque con mayor rusticidad.

Siembra: otoño-invierno, con adaptabilidad a ambientes más marginales.

Requerimientos: menos exigente que la colza en agua y fertilidad.

Ventajas: tolera altas temperaturas y sequía, genera un aceite con gran estabilidad oxidativa.

Rindes: entre 1 y 2.5 toneladas por hectárea en experiencias locales.

Camelina

Ciclo: muy corto, 85 a 100 días.

Siembra: puede implantarse a fines de invierno o principios de primavera.

Requerimientos: se adapta a suelos pobres y ambientes semiáridos.

Ventajas: bajo costo de implantación, rusticidad, posibilidad de entrar en nichos de rotación poco aprovechados.

Rindes: de 800 a 1.800 kg/ha, aunque con gran variabilidad.

Más allá de los mercados, estos cultivos aportan beneficios en el sistema que me parecen indispensables para una agricultura que piensa en un todo:

Diversifican las rotaciones y reducen la presión de malezas resistentes.

Son aliados frente a la huella de carbono: fijan CO₂ y, al destinarse a biocombustibles, reducen las emisiones netas del transporte.

Generan un uso más eficiente de la tierra, al ocupar ventanas de barbecho invernal.

En países como Canadá y Alemania, la colza ya forma parte estable del esquema agrícola. En Argentina, aunque todavía son cultivos de nicho, representan una oportunidad para productores que buscan diversificación y nuevas fuentes de ingreso.

Uno de los grandes retos para que colza, carinata y camelina despeguen en Argentina es la articulación de la cadena de valor. Se necesitan más acopios que reciban estas oleaginosas, más industrias dispuestas a procesarlas y, sobre todo, reglas claras de fomento a los biocombustibles avanzados.

En este sentido las Cámaras de Biocombustibles de Argentina están haciendo enormes esfuerzos para lograr un nuevo marco normativo, una nueva ley que potencie la producción de “combustibles del futuro” como pudo lograr nuestro principal socio comercial del Mercosur, Brasil, con potencialidades muy similares a las locales.

En la provincia de Santa Fe, por ejemplo, existen proyectos piloto con estos tres cultivos vinculados a universidades y empresas que trabajan en bioenergía. Estos ensayos muestran que hay potencial, pero que sin políticas activas y mercados garantizados es difícil que el productor se arriesgue a cambiar parte de su esquema productivo.

La agricultura global se enfrenta a un doble desafío: producir más alimentos y energía, y hacerlo con menos impacto ambiental. En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave. No reemplazarán a la soja ni al maíz, pero sí pueden ser complementos estratégicos.

En un mundo que avanza hacia la descarbonización, la demanda de biocombustibles de aviación crecerá de manera exponencial, y allí Argentina tiene la chance de posicionarse. Lo mismo con la camelina, cuyo aceite puede conquistar mercados premium de alimentos y cosmética.

Queridos lectores, la agricultura es movimiento constante, y quienes estamos en el sector sabemos que el futuro se construye sumando alternativas. La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar. Son cultivos con historia, con presente y, sobre todo, con un futuro prometedor si logramos integrarlos en nuestros sistemas productivos.

La pregunta que queda abierta es: ¿seremos capaces, como país, de darles el espacio y el impulso que necesitan?",https://www.lt9.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/camelina_corza_carinata.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 20:56:26.841238

The model, built in an industry-leading manner from unique composite materials, is capable of delivering a combination of range and capacity simply unmatched by any other model on the market today.

It is with these factors in mind that most major international carriers have worked the Airbus A350 into their long-term fleet development plans. Even long-time holdouts, such as Chicago-based United Airlines, have eventually shifted their mindset towards operating the twin-engine aircraft. American Airlines, however, has been a noteworthy exception.

We analyze the principal factors driving American's decision not to operate the Airbus A350, stemming primarily from the fact that other aircraft meet the jet's needs better. American Airlines had an Airbus A350 order in the past, but an interesting set of factors pushed the carrier to cancel this commitment. There are currently no plans to acquire A350 jets in the future, and the airline views its future exclusively in the hands of the manufacturer, Boeing, when it comes to widebody fleet development.

A Brief Overview Of The A350's Role In The Market

We view the Airbus A350 as the long-haul workhorse of choice for most major airlines, as it pairs an impressive range with lower trip and per-seat costs. An aircraft largely built from carbon-fiber composites and powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, the aircraft burns significantly less fuel than most previous-generation widebody jets, helping carriers hit their margin targets while also lowering emissions output with a relatively large aircraft.

The Airbus A350-900 serves long-and-thin routes while the larger Airbus A350-1000 targets large trunk markets in need of additional seats. This gives airlines a capable two-sized aircraft family that offers shared training and maintenance capabilities. We also see the aircraft's elevated level of passenger comfort through providing cabin pressurization and humidity improvement, as a key catalyst supporting the aircraft's generation of premium yields. From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A350 slots between the Boeing 787 and the larger Boeing 777/777X family, allowing airlines to find a right-sized aircraft that suits their capacity needs at a particular moment in time.

The aircraft also has an ultra-long range variant, one which is currently used exclusively by Singapore Airlines, that helps airlines link far-flung destinations which would have otherwise required stopovers. This helps support network differentiation and premium schedule capacity growth. The upcoming Airbus A350F extends the platform into the cargo market, helping replace older-generation freighters facing environmental restrictions. With sustainable aviation fuel compatibility and continued tweaks to its performance capabilities in the works, we see the A350 as a credible long-haul backbone that can be used by carriers to balance the needs of hub-to-hub and point-to-point missions. Lessors see the aircraft as an incredibly valuable asset for roughly the same reasons.

An A350 Order Inherited From US Airways

US Airways first committed to purchasing the Airbus A350 in 2005, penning an order for 20 aircraft in order to support an anticipated long-haul network expansion that would begin following its emergence from a restructuring process. Airbus redesigned the A350 program as the clean-sheet Airbus A350XWB, and US Airways actually elected to expand the deal to 22 Airbus A350 XWBs between 2007 and 2008. This included a Trent XWB engine selection with Rolls-Royce. In 2013, American Airlines merged with US Airways, transferring the order to the newly united carrier, according to reports from Reuters.

Initially, American Airlines planned the first deliveries of its A350 models between 2017 and 2018, with management electing twice to defer the schedule in order to manage capital spending and better preserve network flexibility with an international demand picture increasingly softening. In July 2016, American Airlines pushed the Airbus A350 stream to late 2018 through 2022, with deferrals averaging 26 months. The airline was looking for capital expense relief of around $500 million in 2017, which grew to $700 million in 2018.

Starting in April 2017, American Airlines began to move its first deliveries even further back to 2020, effectively turning this year-old commitment into essentially a perpetually unactivated option that the airline continued to avoid actually exercising. During this period, American Airlines was introducing Boeing 787s into its fleet, as well as refreshing its legacy widebody jets. The Airbus A350 was still a credible pathway for the airline's long-term fleet development, but it was becoming increasingly deprioritized.

Pulling The Plug In 2018

On April 6, 2018, American Airlines elected to terminate its order for 22 Airbus A350-900 jets, instead placing a new order for 47 Boeing 787s, including 22 787-8s, which arrived starting in 2020 and 25 787–9 models, which began arriving in 2023, according to Boeing. An additional 28 options were also secured by the carrier. We see this move as a calculated play taken by American Airlines to simplify its overall fleet strategy, including the shrinkage of the number of widebody types that American would be operating. The carrier quickly moved to retire the Boeing 767-300, the Airbus A330-300, and the aging Boeing 777-200ER, all in an attempt to simplify the carrier's fleet and reduce operating costs.

The American Airlines management team highlighted the Boeing 787's fuel-burning and maintenance advantages over the aircraft it was replacing, and that the aircraft's range was an ideal fit for American's network. We see another factor as a crucial element of American's decision-making process here. Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet. From a financial perspective, this decision was already locked in as a replacement order, which helped the airline limit capital expenses, after several rounds of Airbus A350 deferrals shifted cash towards where it was needed most.

American Airlines publicly thanked both manufacturers for aggressively marketing its jets, including the Airbus A330neo. However, the management team ultimately settled on the Dreamliner as the model that optimized operational and economic benefits while also establishing a growing Boeing 787 subfleet. This fleet standardization choice was, in our eyes, no technical indictment of the Airbus A350 as a model but rather a move that helped the airline better align its strategic and financial priorities.

What Is The Longer-Term Picture?

While we see American's decision in 2018 to cancel its original purchase of the Airbus A350 as driven by the need to reprioritize medium-term cash flows, we do believe that there were multiple long-term reasons why the decision was beneficial for the airline. For starters, the simplification of the airline's fleet offered a number of benefits which management was keen to realize. Specifically, operating fewer widebody jets allowed the airline to train employees on fewer different types of jets, keep fewer spare parts in store, and easily swap jets in its network. Expanding the airline's Boeing 787 fleet also delivered a number of scale-based benefits, with a small A350 subfleet mostly being a large cost burden on the airline.

A second factor we see as important in this decision is not just short-term cash flow reallocation but also long-term balance sheet discipline. The 2016–2017 deferrals of these orders demonstrated the airline's interest in lowering capital expenses, but in doing so, it also preserved the airline's long-term financial flexibility. The decision to focus on just one manufacturer and retire older, expensive aircraft helped the airline rebalance its assets and liabilities.

Beyond this, we do see the Boeing 787 as the ideal fit for American's transpacific and transatlantic networks, where the vast majority of long-haul revenue is generated. The aircraft is liked by customers, and it provides the optimal combination of range and risk that American Airlines was looking for. Through this introduction, the carrier also avoided the risks associated with introducing a new type of aircraft to its increasingly complex fleet.

Could This Have Been A Mistake?

While we do believe that the Airbus A350 would have been a weaker choice for American's broader network expansion plans, we see some benefits which could have eventually been realized had American Airlines elected to push forward with A350 fleet development. The aircraft is the most efficient large widebody in service today, with the Boeing 777X still sitting at least a year away.

The A350's exceptional reputation for passenger comfort could have been very useful for American today. The carrier is broadly lagging behind United and Delta in terms of premium network capacity and reputation for passenger comfort.

The jet itself is also exceptionally suited to certain kinds of high-density ultra-long-haul routes, which would be more effectively served by an A350 than the Boeing 787. The airline still lags its competitors in many ultra-long-haul markets.

Could American Order The A350 In The Future?

Just because American Airlines canceled its A350 orders in the past does not mean it could not order the jet again in the future. However, this seems relatively unlikely.

For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet. The carrier also has a strong relationship with manufacturer Boeing, which it clearly is not thinking about changing.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bpeing-787-at-mia.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-13 16:56:13.164989

The sector is expanding faster than the global average — reaching $18.1 billion in 2024 and projected to grow 6.1 percent year on year in 2025, according to a report by UAE-based travel platform Tumodo. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are already taking note of the region’s transformative potential.

MENA’s business travel bookings surged 40 percent in early 2025 compared with late 2024, with April and May marking the busiest months post-Ramadan.

The broader market is expected to hit $270.8 billion by 2030, fueled by infrastructure development, digital innovation, and deepening economic ties with Europe and Asia.

“The impressive 50 percent year-on-year growth we’ve seen this year signals a shift from recovery to reinvention,” said Stan Klyuy, chief commercial officer of Tumodo, in the report, noting that average airfares are down by 12 percent and hotel bookings up by 2 percent.

Rita Raad, senior principal of strategy and transformation of the public sector at FTI Consulting, explained in an interview with Arab News: “The 40 percent surge in business travel bookings to MENA in the first half of 2025 reflects a powerful mix of regional momentum and shifting global priorities.”

She added: “Much of this growth is driven by the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), where the economy is projected to grow 4.2 percent in 2025-26 compared to about 1.5 percent in Europe, fueled by 3.7 percent non-oil sector expansion and diversification efforts.”

Oil and gas, technology, and finance remain the biggest corporate travel drivers, according to Raad, while Saudi Arabia’s giga-projects continue to draw waves of consultants, engineers, and operators.

Hassan Malik, tourism and sport consulting leader and partner at Deloitte Middle East, told Arab News that the region is indeed “witnessing a remarkable rebound and reinvention in corporate travel.”

A key catalyst of business travel growth, according to Malik, is “the influx of mega-projects and infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, like Qiddiya, Neom, and the Red Sea project, drawing global business and investment interest.”

Meshal Al-Faras, head of Middle East, Africa and Central Asia at Janus Henderson, told Arab News: “We are seeing a sustained shift in how international companies and investors view this region, and Saudi Arabia is a clear driver of that momentum.”

He added: “The objectives of Vision 2030 are being implemented at scale across infrastructure, logistics, finance and tourism. That level of clarity and execution attracts interest from global organizations that want to grow in a stable and high-potential market.”

Travel trends

According to Tumodo’s report, Saudi Arabia led as the top destination for users of the platform, accounting for 20 percent of all travel, followed by the UK at 15 percent, and France and India each at 10 percent.

Regional airlines Emirates, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways dominated preferences, while India emerged as the most affordable route and the UK as the premium choice.

Regarding the trend for bleisure — trips that blend business with leisure — Raad noted: “The concept of bleisure continues to shape corporate mobility in MENA, with 25 percent of business travelers now extending their stays for leisure, especially among younger generations prioritizing work-life balance.”

She mentioned that airlines such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates, and Saudia were responding by enhancing their in-flight and ground services to cater to bleisure travelers.

These upgrades included features such as fully lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible entertainment and dining options, enabling passengers to work comfortably and relax during flights and transit.

Malik said that bleisure has now become mainstream, with many travelers extending work trips for personal time or combining them with relaxation. He noted that business travelers are increasingly staying longer to explore local destinations.

“Airlines are responding by introducing premium economy offerings, enhanced Wi-Fi, and flexible stopover packages, and Emirates and Etihad also now routinely promote wellness and sightseeing add-ons,” added Malik.

Al-Faras commented that the idea of business travel being limited to boardrooms no longer reflects how people operate, adding that executives want both flexibility and quality when they travel.

He added: “In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, we are seeing that expectation being met with strong investment in premium hospitality, high service standards, and facilities that allow people to work and relax in the same setting.”

Sustainability and tech

On sustainability efforts, Raad explained that MENA’s business travel sector is increasingly balancing growth with sustainability by embedding CO2 tracking and AI-driven cost optimization into corporate travel operations.

“Platforms like Tumodo now let companies forecast spending, measure emissions, and enforce eco-friendly routing — optimizing for shorter flights, sustainable hotels, and consolidated itineraries — and delivering emissions reductions of up to 20 percent,” she added.

Malik added that sustainability is becoming central to corporate travel strategy in MENA, noting that national targets in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar all aim for net-zero emissions in the coming decades through Vision 2030 and national energy strategies. He emphasized that “sustainability is increasingly core to corporate travel strategy in MENA.”

Malik noted that businesses are aligning procurement, travel, and logistics with green standards, prioritizing local suppliers and offset schemes via platforms like MENA’s Global Carbon Council, the region’s first voluntary carbon offsetting program.

Investor takeaways

Looking at investment opportunities, Al-Faras stated: “I believe the $270 billion projection is realistic as this growth is supported by what we are seeing across the GCC.”

He added that there is strong demand for physical infrastructure — ranging from airports and rail to hotels and event spaces — as well as for digital platforms that support business travel and mobility. Al-Faras noted that Saudi Arabia has developed a pipeline of projects in these areas and has shown “a clear willingness to partner with private capital.”

Raad cautioned that investors needed to carefully assess risks, as the massive scale of ongoing mega-developments could disrupt market balance if demand growth slowed.

She also highlighted potential regulatory shifts in visas, ownership, and taxation that might impact investment returns, along with increasing environmental, social, and governance pressures.

Companies are increasingly demanding low-carbon travel, which would require the timely adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and green-certified infrastructure.

Malik concluded: “Risks are very real, too. The biggest challenge will be timing and coordination. If infrastructure growth — number of flights, hotel rooms, venue capacity — doesn’t align across the board, there’s a risk of overcapacity in one area and bottlenecks in another.”

He added: “Regulatory complexity across countries and cities may slow seamless integration. Delivering not just on time, but to international quality standards, will be crucial to sustaining momentum.”

As MENA’s business travel sector surges, the region’s blend of innovation, sustainability, and economic diversification cements its status as a global leader — with no signs of slowing down.",,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:12.200137

“Proyek ini menjadi bagian penting dari upaya PGE membangun ekosistem green hydrogen secara end-to-end, mulai dari produksi, distribusi, hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung transisi menuju industri rendah karbon,"" jelas Julfi.

""Fasilitas ini tidak hanya sebagai pusat inovasi, tetapi juga model yang bisa direplikasi di wilayah kerja panas bumi lainnya, sekaligus membuka peluang percepatan off-grid solution untuk transportasi dan industri rendah karbon. Ke depan, peta jalan pengembangan PGE juga mencakup hilirisasi green ammonia dan green methanol sebagai solusi energi masa depan,” tambahnya.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi di Indonesia, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seluruh komitmen tersebut dinyatakan sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.

Pertamina Catat Produksi Migas Tembus 1 Juta BOEPD, Pendapatan Tembus Rp672 Triliun

PT Pertamina (Persero) berhasil menjaga kinerja operasional dan mencatat performa keuangan positif sepanjang semester pertama 2025 atau Januari hingga Juli tahun ini.

Langkah strategis Pertamina ini, dinilai sejalan dengan target pemerintah melalui Asta Cita untuk mewujudkan swasembada energi dan mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional.

Direktur Utama Pertamina, Simon Aloysius Mantiri mengungkapkan capaian tersebut dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) bersama Komisi VI DPR RI di Jakarta, Kamis 11 September 2025.

“Pertamina mencatat beberapa capaian, di antaranya temuan cadangan migas baru sebesar 724 juta barrel setara minyak (MMBOE) di wilayah kerja Rokan,” ujarnya dalam rilis resmi yang dikutip, Jumat 12 September 2025.

Produksi Migas Stabil, Temuan Cadangan Baru

Lebih lanjut, Pertamina hingga Juli 2025, mengungkapkan bahwa pihaknya mampu menjaga produksi migas (minyak dan gas) tetap di atas 1 juta barrel setara minyak per hari (BOEPD). Selain itu, penemuan cadangan migas baru ini bakal memperkuat ketahanan energi jangka panjang di dalam negeri.

Simon mengatakan, paruh pertama tahun ini menjadi momentum penting karena Pertamina berhasil menjalankan sejumlah program strategis, mulai dari produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pertama di Asia Tenggara dengan kapasitas 9.000 barrel per hari, hingga pengoperasian PLTP (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi) Lumut Balai berkapasitas 800 GWh (Gigawatt-hour) dan revitalisasi tangki Arun berkapasitas 127.200 meter kubik yang ditargetkan rampung pada akhir 2025.

“Pertamina SAF merupakan bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan yang dihasilkan melalui teknologi co-processing antara Kerosene (minyak tanah) dan Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah. Ekosistem bisnis UCO SAF bukan hanya mendukung swasembada energi nasional namun juga mampu mendorong perekonomian mikro dan ekonomi sirkuler,” terang Simon.

ID - Transisi energi yang merupakan mandat dari Presiden Prabowo Subianto, memperkuat komitmen dalam mendukung transisi energi nasional, PT Pertamina (Persero) khususnya di sektor transportasi. Sejumlah inisiatif strategis dilakukan, mulai dari pengembangan biofuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hingga hidrogen hijau yang diharapkan mampu mengurangi emisi karbon sekaligus menjaga ketahanan energi Indonesia.

“Transisi energi harus dijalankan secara serius agar Indonesia tetap tangguh menghadapi perubahan global. Pertamina fokus tidak hanya pada energi ramah lingkungan, tetapi juga andal dan terjangkau,” ungkap Pjs. SVP Sustainability Pertamina, Indira Pratyaksa.

Salah satu bukti konkret adalah penerbangan uji coba Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang dilakukan oleh Pelita Air Service pada 20 Agustus 2025. Pesawat berhasil terbang pulang-pergi Jakarta–Bali dengan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan produksi Pertamina.

“Ini bukti nyata komitmen Pertamina mendukung transportasi hijau. SAF yang kami kembangkan sudah melalui uji coba bersama mitra internasional dan terbukti mampu menurunkan emisi hingga 85% dibandingkan bahan bakar konvensional,” jelas Indira.

PT Pertamina (Persero) menegaskan peran strategisnya dalam mendorong transisi energi di sektor transportasi melalui pengembangan biofuel, bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF), hingga hidrogen.

Sementara Direktur Proyek dan Operasi PT Pertamina New Renewable Energy (PNRE) Norman Ginting menambahkan bahwa sektor transportasi menjadi penyumbang 36% konsumsi energi nasional dan sekitar 73% dari total konsumsi BBM nasional. Karena itu, transformasi energi bersih di sektor ini menjadi sangat penting.

“Indonesia masih bergantung pada impor minyak sejak 2003. Untuk mengurangi ketergantungan tersebut sekaligus menekan emisi karbon, Pertamina berkomitmen mempercepat diversifikasi energi di sektor transportasi,” ujar Norman.

Untuk Biodiesel, program B40 resmi berjalan pada 2025, dengan dukungan kilang hijau (green refinery) yang dapat memproduksi Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) untuk melampaui kebutuhan pencampuran biodiesel. Sementara Bioavtur (SAF), uji coba SAF berbasis minyak jelantah yang telah dilakukan Pelita Air menjadi wujud nyata transisi energi di sektor transportasi melalui pemanfaatan sumber daya lokal yang ramah lingkungan.

Terkait kendaraan Listrik dan Baterai, melalui Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC), Pertamina membangun ekosistem EV dan BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) dengan ambisi menjadi produsen terbesar di ASEAN. Adapun untuk Hidrogen dan e-Fuel, Pertamina tengah menyiapkan dua Stasiun Pengisian Hidrogen (HRS) di Daan Mogot (2026) dan Jawa Barat (2028), dengan kapasitas awal 200–500 kg/hari.

Headline Takeaway:

(CTAS) faces a mixed outlook as weak technicals suggest caution, but strong fundamentals and positive money flows offer a counterbalance.

News Highlights

May 29, 2025: A new report on the fuel ethanol market highlights opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel technology, potentially benefiting sectors with green innovation ties. While not directly related to Cintas, it underscores broader industry tailwinds in sustainability.

May 31, 2025: A series of reports on aid looting in Gaza and geopolitical tensions in the region raise concerns over global supply chains and humanitarian efforts. These developments may indirectly impact logistics and supply-demand dynamics across industries, including Cintas' service areas.

May 28, 2025: A new Pentagon policy tightens oversight on the procurement of non-commercial products. This could influence procurement decisions in industries with strong government ties. While Cintas is not a defense contractor, its corporate services may see ripple effects in the logistics and safety sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The recent analyst activity for Cintas is limited but tells a story. The simple average rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating (adjusted for performance history) stands at 4.30. This suggests a slightly more optimistic outlook when accounting for the track record of the analysts involved. The lone analyst, Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital, has an 80% historical winning rate but has rated the stock as Neutral recently.

However, the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), which is at odds with the generally optimistic weighted analyst expectations. This divergence could signal market uncertainty or underperformance in the near term.

Looking at the fundamentals, Cintas scores well in several key areas:

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 16.13%, with a model score of 7.54 (internal diagnostic score). This is a strong indicator of profitability.

Basic earnings per share (YoY growth rate): 19.35%, scoring 7.54.

ROA (Return on Assets): 4.79%, with a score of 7.54.

ROE (Return on Equity): 10.45%, scoring 7.54.

These fundamentals suggest a company that is growing and efficiently using its assets, even if the stock price is currently falling.

Money-Flow Trends

Despite the weak technical outlook, money-flow patterns show positive momentum. The overall inflow ratio is 55.90%, indicating substantial institutional and large-cap investor interest. The Extra-large inflow ratio is 62.30%, which is a strong signal from big-money players. This suggests that while the retail sentiment might be cautious, institutional investors are showing confidence.

The fund flow score is 7.91 (internal diagnostic score), labeled as good, and the overall trend is positive, even as the Small and Medium trends are negative. This points to a mixed retail investor sentiment, while the larger market participants are leaning bullish.

Key Technical Signals

The technical analysis for Cintas is bearish. The stock has 0 bullish indicators and 2 bearish indicators, with 1 neutral indicator. The overall technical score is 3.94 (internal diagnostic score), and the trend is summarized as weak, with a suggestion to avoid the stock.

Key technical indicators:

WR Oversold: Score of 3.73 (internal diagnostic score), indicating a neutral to slightly bullish signal historically, but not strong enough to override the bearish trend.

Bearish Engulfing: Score of 1.47 (internal diagnostic score), a strong bearish signal with a historical average return of -0.23% and a win rate of 36.36%.

RSI Oversold: Score of 6.62 (internal diagnostic score), suggesting moderate potential for a rebound, but not enough to tilt the overall trend.

Recent chart patterns show that WR Oversold was active on multiple dates (September 10, 9, 5, 8), and Bearish Engulfing appeared on September 5. This indicates a recent bearish consolidation phase. The key insight from the technicals is that the direction is unclear and bearish signals are dominant.

Conclusion

Cintas presents a mixed outlook. While the fundamentals are strong and money flows remain positive, the technical indicators are bearish, with no clear reversal signals. Given the internal diagnostic score of 3.94 (technical) and 7.54 (fundamental), the stock is a candidate for cautious observers but not for immediate buyers.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd30b25e4bc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:37.982358

Petrobras produz combustível de aviação com óleo vegetal

Ainda nesta semana, a Petrobras havia anunciado que, pela primeira vez em sua história, produziu combustível de aviação com óleo vegetal, também conhecido como SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ou combustível sustentável de aviação).

Durante o teste na refinaria Henrique Lage (Revap), em São José dos Campos (SP), foi realizada a mistura a partir do processo tradicional de produção do querosene de aviação (QAV).

O SAF pode substituir diretamente o querosene convencional sem necessidade de alterações nas aeronaves ou na infraestrutura de abastecimento, uma medida prática para reduzir as emissões do setor aéreo.

O teor de óleo vegetal no produto atingiu o patamar de até 1,2%, um marco fundamental na produção de combustíveis mais sustentáveis para a aviação.

Além da Revap, a refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, obteve a autorização da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF.

Veralto (VLTO) has seen a recent price rise of 2.67%, but analysts and technical indicators suggest a period of mixed signals and technical neutrality. The stock is currently caught in a tug-of-war between modest optimism and caution.

News Highlights

Recent news has largely stayed away from

, but global developments in the fuel ethanol industry and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have kept the broader market on edge. Here are two key developments:

New Ethanol-to-SAF Technology: A May 29 report from ResearchAndMarkets highlighted advancements in ethanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology. This could eventually benefit energy and biofuel firms, though Veralto itself isn’t directly mentioned.

Gaza Humanitarian Crisis: Reports of looted medical supplies in Gaza (May 31) have heightened global tensions, potentially affecting commodity and energy markets. While Veralto isn’t directly involved, such instability can indirectly impact investor sentiment.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Veralto has only one active analyst on the scene: Bobby Zolper of Raymond James, who has issued a ""Neutral"" rating in the past 20 days. This single voice doesn't provide a broad consensus, but it does highlight that expectations remain balanced for now.

Average rating: 3.00 (simple mean)

Weighted rating: 2.08 (performance-weighted)

Rating consistency: Analyst views are limited and show no strong dispersion, but the single rating is not bullish or bearish.

Price trend vs. ratings: The stock has risen 2.67%, but analyst expectations remain neutral. This suggests a mismatch between the current price action and broader expectations.

Key Fundamentals

The internal diagnostic scores (0-10) help highlight key financial metrics:

ROE (Return on Equity): 8.34 % → Score: 7.0 (moderate performance)

ROA (Return on Assets): 3.10 % → Score: 6.2 (room for improvement)

Net Profit Margin (Net income / Revenue): 41.42 % → Score: 4.1 (solid but not exceptional)

Total Profit Growth (YoY): 10.38 % → Score: 9.4 (strong positive momentum)

Net Profit Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders Growth (YoY): 15.50 % → Score: 7.5 (positive but less explosive)

Basic EPS Growth (YoY): 14.65 % → Score: 3.4 (modest gain with weak weighting in the model)

Veralto’s overall fundamental score is 7.04, suggesting a generally sound company, but with mixed signals in growth and profitability categories.

Money-Flow Trends

The big-money picture for Veralto is negative. All major inflow categories (Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large) show negative trends, with the overall inflow ratio at 47.38%. This means that capital is generally moving out of the stock, especially among institutional and larger retail players.

Small retail inflow ratio: 49.66%

Large institutional inflow ratio: 49.62%

Block inflow ratio: 46.96%

This suggests that while retail investors are still cautiously optimistic, larger players are scaling back or exiting the stock.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Veralto remains in a state of neutrality with no strong bullish or bearish signals. Here are the key insights:

Williams %R Overbought Signal: Internal score: 6.57 (suggesting limited strength)

Williams %R Oversold Signal: Internal score: 6.03 (mild bearish but not dominant)

Bearish Engulfing Signal: Internal score: 6.28 (cautionary signal, but not overpowering)

Recent Chart Patterns

Marubozu White (2025-09-11) – a strong bullish candle

WR Oversold (2025-09-03, 2025-09-02, 2025-08-29) – multiple bearish signals

WR Overbought & Bearish Engulfing (2025-08-28) – mixed signals

These patterns indicate a volatile and indecisive market — with long and short positions in a relatively balanced state. Traders are advised to watch closely for a breakout, as the current technical neutrality is unlikely to last forever.

Conclusion

With a technical score of 6.29 and a fundamental score of 7.04, Veralto is in a moderately watchful position.

She outlined five strategies: fleet renewal, advanced technology, renewable energy and sustainable fuels, operational efficiency, and market-based measures. Boeing’s latest models—including the 787 Dreamliner, 777X, and 737 MAX—deliver 20% to 30% greater fuel efficiency than the aircraft they replace, she said.

Sargin described sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as “the most effective solution over the next 30 years,” capable of cutting life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel.

Boeing is also investing in future technologies such as green hydrogen and electric flight.

Wisk, Boeing’s joint venture, has conducted over 1,750 test flights with a fully autonomous, all-electric air taxi since 2010. Boeing is also collaborating with NASA and GE Aerospace on a 1-megawatt hybrid-electric flight system.

Türkiye’s role in sustainable aviation

Sargin welcomed the sustainable aviation fuel mandate introduced by Türkiye’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

“For our country, this decision is an important step toward reducing emissions and aligns with global net-zero targets,” she said.

She emphasized Türkiye’s strategic position, noting its world-class airline and one of the world’s largest airports, and said Boeing is analyzing feedstock potential through the Türkiye Sustainable Aviation Platform (TSAA).

“We are evaluating the domestic biomass potential that can be derived from Türkiye’s agricultural sector,” she said.

Marking Boeing’s 80th anniversary in Türkiye, Sargin recalled that ties began in 1945 with the delivery of the first DC-3 aircraft.

“Today, Türkiye is not only a valued customer but also a critical part of our global supply chain, a hub of advanced engineering, and an important partner in shaping the future of sustainable aviation,” she said.

“From expanding our supplier network to investing in young talent, and from joint work on sustainable fuel platforms to next-generation technologies, we believe Türkiye will play an important role not only regionally but also globally in shaping the future of aviation.”",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2025/9/13/boeing-marks-80-years-in-turkiye-with-2b-in-procurement-focus-on-sustainability-3206848.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 06:56:24.059489

Durante o teste na Revap, foi misturado óleo vegetal ao processo tradicional de produção do querosene de aviação (QAV). O teor de óleo vegetal no produto atingiu o patamar de até 1,2%, um marco fundamental na produção de combustíveis mais sustentáveis para a aviação.

A Petrobras prevê que a produção comercial de SAF deve ter início “nos próximos meses”.

De acordo com o gerente geral da Revap, Alexandre Coelho Cavalcanti, a operação na Revap é “uma abordagem de menor investimento para a produção de combustíveis com conteúdo renovável, pois utiliza os ativos existentes”, avalia.

A consolidação da rota tecnológica de produção de SAF por coprocessamento é especialmente relevante para o mercado, considerando as futuras exigências do setor.

A partir de 2027, as companhias aéreas no Brasil deverão começar a usar, obrigatoriamente, esse tipo de combustível, com base na Lei do Combustível do Futuro e da fase obrigatória do CORSIA, que é o programa da Organização da Aviação Civil Internacional (OACI) para redução e compensação de emissões de CO2 provenientes dos voos internacionais.

Transição energética justa

Segundo o diretor de Processos Industriais e Produtos da Petrobras, William França, o avanço representa um marco tecnológico para a Petrobras e um passo importante para o Brasil no cenário global de combate às mudanças climáticas.

“A iniciativa demonstra o compromisso da Petrobras com a inovação e a sustentabilidade, preparando-se para atender às demandas futuras de um setor aéreo mais sustentável”, disse o diretor.

Recentemente, a Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, obteve a autorização da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF. A previsão é que, a partir dos próximos meses, a refinaria inicie a produção para comercializar.

Port Lotniczy Katowice w Pyrzowicach przechodzi prawdziwą transformację. Trwa największy w historii portu program rozwoju infrastruktury, którego realizacja zaplanowana jest aż do 2032 roku. Inwestycja ta umocni pozycję Katowice Airport jako ważnego węzła logistycznego w Europie, co przełoży się na rozwój gospodarczy regionu i kraju.

Co to jest multimodalny węzeł przeładunkowy i dlaczego jest tak ważny?

Sercem programu rozwojowego jest budowa multimodalnego węzła przeładunkowego towarów i paliw, który powstaje w oparciu o infrastrukturę kolejową. Nowy terminal cargo i zaplecze paliwowe budowane są w południowo-wschodniej części lotniska, na terenie dawnej bazy paliwowej, która została zrekultywowana w 2019 roku.

Kluczowym elementem inwestycji jest bocznica kolejowa, która połączy teren portu z linią kolejową nr 182 (Zawiercie–Tarnowskie Góry), aktualnie rewitalizowaną przez PKP PLK. Powstanie również specjalne torowisko przeładunkowe, składające się z trzech torów odstawczych o długości około 300 metrów każdy.

Dzięki temu możliwy będzie przeładunek towarów i paliw bezpośrednio między pociągami, cysternami a infrastrukturą lotniskową, co znacząco zwiększy efektywność transportową i logistyczną portu.

Nowoczesna stacja paliwowa – serce multimodalnego węzła w Pyrzowicach

Integralną częścią projektu jest budowa nowej stacji paliwowej, wyposażonej w trzy do czterech zbiorników o pojemności 1000 m³ każdy. Zbiorniki te będą mogły obsługiwać zarówno tradycyjne paliwa lotnicze, jak i nowoczesne paliwa alternatywne typu SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Paliwo dostarczane koleją będzie przeładowywane do autocystern, które z kolei będą rozwozić je do stanowisk tankowania samolotów znajdujących się w strefie operacyjnej lotniska.

Inwestycja o strategicznym znaczeniu militarnym dla NATO i UE

Realizacja inwestycji ma charakter nie tylko cywilny, ale także wojskowy – węzeł zaprojektowano zgodnie z wymogami interoperacyjności NATO i UE, umożliwiając sprawne wsparcie mobilności wojskowej. To szczególnie istotne w kontekście geopolitycznym.

Po rosyjskiej inwazji na Ukrainę w 2022 roku, katowickie lotnisko pełniło kluczową rolę w dostarczaniu pomocy humanitarnej i materiałowej. Nowa infrastruktura pozwoli w przyszłości jeszcze skuteczniej wspierać działania z zakresu mobilności wojskowej w ramach Unii Europejskiej.

India is creating a plan through 2050 in response to the tightening of international regulations on aviation emissions, primarily through the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). For international flights, this plan calls for blending targets of 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030.

India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy. It aims to become a global supplier of green aviation fuels, in addition to meeting domestic blending targets, by leveraging its extensive bio-energy capacity and alliances with companies such as ISMA, Deloitte, and TERI. High manufacturing costs, classification difficulties, and feedstock sustainability remain significant challenges that require resolution.

Why Does India Need a National SAF Policy?

One of the industries contributing to greenhouse gas emissions at the quickest rate of growth is aviation. India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy, and it has become essential as India’s aviation sector grows. In addition to adhering to international regulations, this program aims to improve energy security and establish India as a player in the global green fuels market.

Global Compliance: SAF blending is crucial as India must adhere to CORSIA regulations after 2027.

Net-Zero Goal: India’s aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 is supported by a SAF policy, as aviation is a significant source of emissions.

Energy Independence: National energy security is strengthened by lowering dependency on imported jet fuel.

Export Potential: India can be positioned as a future center for SAF exports with a well-designed policy.

Industry Alignment: Coordinates efforts across several ministries, including Finance, Renewable Energy, Civil Aviation, and Petroleum.

What Are the Challenges in Scaling SAF Production?

India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy, and its adoption is hampered by infrastructure, legislative deficiencies, and expense, despite its potential. Scaling is challenging due to high costs and classification obstacles, and securing a sustainable supply of feedstock is another urgent concern. India will require more research funding, improved incentives, and robust policy assistance to fulfill future demand.

High Costs: Synthetic SAF can cost up to seven times as much as regular jet fuel, and SAF is three times more expensive.

Classification Problems: Because SAF is still classified as a fossil fuel, it is not eligible for bioenergy subsidies such as the Gobardhan plan.

Feedstock Dependency: Diversification is necessary to prevent conflicts between food and fuel due to the current reliance on sugarcane, molasses, and bagasse.

Infrastructure Readiness: Networks for distribution, mixing, and storage must be upgraded quickly.

Global Competition: India is still establishing standards for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), while countries such as the US and Brazil already have them.

Côte d’Ivoire, one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies (projected 6.5 percent GDP growth in 2025), stands to benefit from enhanced exports

The A330neo offers a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions and is certified to operate with 50 percent SAF, aligning with EU environmental regulations and global decarbonisation goals.

Coincides with AfCFTA and SAATM initiatives, emphasising the need for infrastructure upgrades, customs modernisation, and regulatory harmonisation to unlock West Africa’s air cargo potential.

West Africa’s ambitions to emerge as a global trade and logistics hub took a decisive step forward this week with the delivery of Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first Airbus A330-900neo. The widebody aircraft, the first of two on order, was officially handed over in Toulouse on 4 September 2025, marking the Ivorian flag carrier’s entry into long-haul operations. For a region long dependent on foreign carriers and transshipment hubs, the addition of this next-generation aircraft signals a calculated strategy to strengthen direct trade links between Abidjan and major markets in Europe, the Middle East, and eventually North America.

The development comes at a pivotal moment for Africa’s aviation sector, which has defied broader global cargo headwinds. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), African airlines recorded a 10.8 percent year-on-year increase in cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs) in the first half of 2025, significantly outpacing the global average of 4.6 percent. Côte d’Ivoire’s own economic trajectory, with GDP growth projected at 6.5 percent in 2025 by the World Bank, makes this investment more than a fleet upgrade; it represents a long-term bet on West Africa’s capacity to compete in global logistics.

From regional carrier to global competitor

Air Côte d’Ivoire has operated primarily as a regional airline, serving 22 destinations across West and Central Africa. Until now, the carrier relied on narrowbody aircraft, limiting its ability to directly serve high-value export markets. The addition of the A330neo changes this equation, providing up to 20 tonnes of bellyhold cargo capacity per flight.

This expansion is strategically significant for the region’s exporters. Côte d’Ivoire remains the world’s largest cocoa producer, and agriculture continues to dominate trade flows, with cocoa, cashews, and coffee forming a significant share of airfreight volumes. Access to widebody capacity enables faster transit times for perishables, pharmaceuticals, and electronics, reducing dependency on European or Middle Eastern hubs that often add costs and delays to shipments.

For many African carriers, this kind of fleet renewal is more than a prestige move; it is about asserting control over trade corridors. By deploying widebodies from Abidjan, Air Côte d’Ivoire can position itself as a hub carrier, competing with regional giants like Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways.

Soft power and ESG strategy

The delivery flight carried five tonnes of humanitarian aid, including school supplies and health materials, to Abidjan. Coordinated by the Airbus Foundation and supported by Aviation Sans Frontières, this mission underlines Air Côte d’Ivoire’s emphasis on corporate social responsibility. Goods were distributed through NGOs LifeShine and La Bienfaisance to support education and health initiatives in Côte d’Ivoire’s capital.

While symbolic, these actions contribute to the airline’s ESG (environmental, social, and governance) narrative. As global shippers increasingly evaluate partners on sustainability and social responsibility, African carriers adopting ESG-focused strategies can strengthen international partnerships and attract cargo volumes from multinational clients seeking ethically aligned service providers.

A new trade and cargo hub for West Africa

The Gulf of Guinea region is emerging as a focal point for trade flows between Africa, Europe, and Asia. Abidjan’s geographical positioning offers natural advantages, enabling shorter flight times to Europe compared with southern African hubs and providing access to underserved markets in West and Central Africa.

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s A330neo deliveries come as part of a broader strategy to integrate the country more deeply into global supply chains. Côte d’Ivoire already accounts for nearly 40percent of global cocoa production, with annual cocoa exports exceeding $5 billion, according to the International Cocoa Organization. Diversification into high-value exports—pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, and electronics—requires the type of reliable cold-chain and time-sensitive logistics capacity that widebody aircraft can provide.

Data from WorldACD shows that African air cargo volumes surpassed 2.4 million tonnes in 2024, with growth concentrated on Africa–Europe lanes. Yet over 70percent of this freight was uplifted by non-African carriers. By building capacity and a hub model in Abidjan, Air Côte d’Ivoire could capture a greater share of these volumes, reducing reliance on foreign operators and increasing regional value retention.

Aircraft efficiency and regulatory compliance

The A330neo represents a leap in efficiency, offering a 25percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. It is certified to operate with up to 50percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligning with Airbus’ ambition to achieve 100percent SAF compatibility across its fleet by 2030.

Such investments are increasingly critical for African carriers. Europe’s environmental policies, including the EU’s Fit for 55 package and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), place growing pressure on operators to demonstrate emissions reductions. For carriers like Air Côte d’Ivoire, fleet renewal is not only a competitive decision but also a regulatory one, ensuring continued access to lucrative European markets.

Ground infrastructure: A bottleneck to watch

While aircraft investments attract headlines, the success of this strategy will depend heavily on airport and logistics infrastructure. Félix Houphouët-Boigny International Airport, Abidjan’s main gateway, is undergoing phased modernisation, but industry insiders highlight the need for accelerated investment in cold-chain facilities, customs automation, and bonded warehousing to fully capitalise on new widebody capacity.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), now operational, aims to boost intra-African trade by 52percent by 2030, according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa. Yet achieving this potential requires regulatory harmonisation, improved airport cargo-handling standards, and full implementation of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM). Without these policy measures, even the most modern aircraft could be underutilised.

West Africa’s strategic positioning

The decision to expand internationally mirrors strategies seen in East Africa, where Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways have built globally competitive networks. However, West Africa remains relatively underdeveloped in terms of hub infrastructure. Abidjan’s rise could rebalance Africa’s air cargo map, creating new routing options for global shippers and reducing overreliance on Gulf and European transshipment points.

Africa’s economic growth trajectory supports this vision. According to the African Development Bank, West Africa is expected to post 4.1percent GDP growth in 2025, driven by agriculture, mining, and energy exports. Airlines that can bridge the gap between regional production centres and global markets will play a pivotal role in shaping trade patterns over the next decade.

Policy takeaways for stakeholders

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s A330neo delivery carries several strategic implications for industry and policymakers:

Diversification of Cargo Hubs: Building Abidjan as a hub can decongest overutilised gateways like Addis Ababa and Nairobi, spreading regional traffic more evenly.

Sustainability as Market Access: Fleet modernisation and SAF adoption will increasingly determine African carriers’ access to international markets, especially in the EU.

Infrastructure Development as a Priority: Aircraft orders must be matched with investments in airport cargo terminals, cold-chain systems, and customs digitalisation.

AfCFTA and SAATM Synergies: Greater regulatory coordination could unlock the full potential of regional air connectivity, encouraging intra-African trade growth.

From ambition to execution

The delivery of Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first A330neo is a landmark moment for Côte d’Ivoire’s aviation strategy, symbolising both ambition and opportunity. Yet its success will depend on coordinated policy action, infrastructure development, and strategic partnerships. If fully realised, Abidjan’s evolution into a competitive cargo hub could provide exporters with direct access to high-value markets, strengthen regional trade resilience, and enhance Africa’s bargaining power in the global logistics sector.

For air cargo professionals, this signals a broader shift; African carriers are no longer passive participants in international trade corridors but are positioning themselves as architects of new supply chain networks. The coming years will reveal whether this delivery marks the beginning of a transformative decade for West African aviation—or a missed opportunity in the face of persistent structural challenges.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Air-Cote-dIvoires-A330neo-image-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 06:56:42.997229

Kentrell Gaulden (NBA YoungBoy): Pardoned the rapper, who pleaded guilty in December 2024 to being a felon in possession of a firearm.

In May 2025, Donald Trump made a deal allowing 17 relatives of a Sinaloa Cartel leader to enter the United States. These family members are the relatives of Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán.

January 6 defendants

On his first day in office, Trump issued a mass pardon for approximately 1,500 people connected to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Notable recipients included:

Oath Keepers and Proud Boys leaders: Commuted sentences for extremist group leaders like Stewart Rhodes, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, and other key figures involved in the riot.

Violent rioters: Pardoned dozens of individuals with records of violent offenses on January 6, including assault with a dangerous weapon against law enforcement.

Individuals with prior felonies: Some recipients of the January 6 pardons had prior serious convictions, including drug trafficking and manslaughter.

""You would think that our president would at least make an attempt to bring us together. But he didn’t. President Obama did. President Biden did. Presidents Bush and Clinton did.

Esto significa que su producción está oficialmente habilitada para el suministro de biocombustibles en este sector estratégico.

La certificación representa un paso decisivo en el camino hacia la descarbonización de la aviación, ya que el biocombustible producido a partir de aceite de palma constituye una alternativa renovable frente a los combustibles fósiles tradicionales.

Según explicó Óscar Cifuentes, gerente general de Gremca, esta norma “permite, a través del incremento en la productividad, contar con materia prima certificada. En Colombia somos los primeros en lograrlo y, a nivel mundial, somos pioneros como empresa palmicultora. Este logro nos ubica en una posición de liderazgo, articulándonos con la Federación y con diversas entidades del sector para que la cadena productiva siga este ejemplo y avance hacia la certificación”.

Cifuentes también resaltó que el proceso no se limita únicamente al cultivo. “Es necesario certificar el aceite, el proceso de refinación y la producción de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). De este modo garantizamos, en primer lugar, la seguridad alimentaria, ya que una parte significativa del aceite de palma continúa destinada a la industria alimentaria. Sin embargo, una fracción que cumple con la normatividad puede redirigirse al biocombustible de aviación”, señaló.

La norma Corsia, impulsada por la Organización de Aviación Civil Internacional (OACI), establece directrices para reducir las emisiones de dióxido de carbono en el transporte aéreo a escala global.

Su implementación responde a la necesidad de avanzar en la sostenibilidad del sector aéreo y reducir la huella de carbono que genera el tráfico aéreo internacional.

En este contexto, la certificación de Gremca se convierte en un referente no solo para Colombia, sino también para la región, al demostrar que es posible vincular el sector agrícola con los estándares internacionales de sostenibilidad en la aviación.

La empresa ha dejado claro que este resultado no se alcanzó de manera aislada. Fue producto de un trabajo conjunto con la Federación Nacional de Cultivadores de Palma de Aceite (Fedepalma) y otras entidades aliadas, con el fin de motivar a más compañías a sumarse a este tipo de procesos de certificación.

El objetivo compartido es consolidar un ecosistema en el que la palma de aceite no solo tenga un papel en la industria alimentaria, sino que también sea un insumo estratégico en la transición hacia energías limpias.

¿Cómo es el proceso para convertir el aceite de palma en biocombustible?

Respecto al proceso de transformación del aceite de palma en biocombustible, Cifuentes explicó que todo inicia en las plantaciones, donde se cosecha la fruta de palma. Esta se traslada a una planta extractora, en la cual se obtiene el aceite crudo de palma. A partir de allí, una cantidad específica del aceite certificado se destina a la producción de SAF. Posteriormente, el aceite es enviado a una refinería, donde se somete a procesos de blanqueo y desodorización para dejarlo en condiciones adecuadas para la siguiente etapa. Finalmente, en la planta productora de SAF, el aceite pasa por un tratamiento con catalizadores que transforman su estructura molecular, convirtiéndolo en un combustible apto para motores de aviación.

Este proceso, aunque técnico y complejo, responde a estándares de calidad internacional que buscan garantizar la seguridad, la eficiencia y la sostenibilidad del combustible resultante.",https://www.valoraanalitik.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gremca.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 11:56:17.894082

Abstract

The most viable way to decarbonize aviation in the near term is through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), most of which is currently produced via the deoxygenation of fats, oils, and greases (FOG) followed by a separate isomerization step. Multifunctional zeolite-supported catalysts offer several advantages over existing formulations, such as enabling the use of waste FOG streams, performing their deoxygenation via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx), and effecting the synthesis of SAF in one-pot. Previous work has shown that while supported Ni-Cu catalysts can afford excellent results in the conversion of waste FOG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via deCOx, zeolitic materials represent promising supports in formulations employed for the synthesis of SAF. In this contribution, catalysts involving different zeolitic supports and the same Ni-Cu active phase were prepared, characterized, and tested in the conversion of brown grease to SAF to identify the carrier affording the best results. A Ni-Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the highest conversion and yield of SAF-like hydrocarbons relative to formulations supported on ZSM-22, SAPO-11, or SAPO-34 (these catalysts being referred to herein as NCZSM-5, NCZSM-22, NCSAPO-11, and NCSAPO-34).

Graphical Abstract

1. Introduction

The demand for aviation fuel is expected to more than double by 2050 and triple by 2070 [1], which is of concern since aviation already accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions [2]. Given that the electrification of aircraft is in its infancy, the most promising way to decarbonize aviation in the near to medium term is through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can be produced from several feedstocks via different technologies [3]. However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported that >80% of SAF is produced via the hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA) [4]. Processes utilizing fats, oils, and greases (FOG) as feedstocks—such as HEFA—are expected to remain the primary way to produce SAF for the foreseeable future given the maturity and widespread use of this technology [5].

Current HEFA processes are mostly based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction, which displays several shortcomings. Indeed, HDO-based HEFA requires large amounts and high pressures of hydrogen, which are typically only available at centralized facilities where this gas is produced from natural gas via steam reforming. In addition, HDO-based HEFA typically employs sulfided catalysts, which risk contaminating the product with sulfur [6,7], deactivate in the presence of water (a product of HDO) [7,8], are not regenerated online [9], and require FOG feedstocks low in impurities like phosphorus, metals, and free fatty acids (FFAs) [10]. Finally, SAF production via HDO-based HEFA involves separate deoxygenation and isomerization steps that result mainly in normal and branched alkanes but not in other SAF components, namely, cycloalkanes and aromatics. (Jet fuel—a mixture of C8–C16 hydrocarbons—comprises ~20 vol.% n-alkanes, ~33 vol.% iso-alkanes, ~27 vol.% cycloalkanes, and ~20 vol.% aromatics. These hydrocarbon families, respectively, confer jet fuel a high energy density, good cold flow properties, low freezing point, and seal-swelling properties [11]). This leads to SAF production facilities having separate units to (1) pre-treat the feedstock to remove impurities; (2) hydroprocess the pre-treated feedstock to yield n-alkanes; (3) isomerize the n-alkanes to iso-alkanes; and (4) separate the SAF from other fuel fractions via distillation, all of which adds complexity and cost.

Converting FOG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarbonylation/decarboxylation (deCOx) can avoid the drawbacks of HDO-based HEFA since deCOx reactions require smaller amounts and lower pressures of hydrogen and deCOx catalysts are typically supported metals that can be simple (non-sulfided), inexpensive (non-precious), and robust (resistant to deactivation). Moreover, these formulations can be regenerated online and upgrade waste FOG streams rich in impurities and/or composed mainly of FFAs such as brown grease (BG) [12]—i.e., FOG collected from wastewater streams—all of which is currently incinerated or landfilled [13,14]. Another advantage of deCOx formulations is that they can involve zeolitic materials as the support of multifunctional catalysts capable of performing deoxygenation and isomerization (but also cyclization and aromatization) reactions in “one-pot” [15]. Therefore, deCOx-based technology has the potential to convert currently unutilized waste FOG streams to a product mixture containing all families of hydrocarbons comprising aviation fuel and to do so in less steps or units, which can reduce both complexity and cost.

Previous work has shown that supported metal catalysts comprising Ni and Cu in a 4:1 proportion (by weight), can afford excellent results in the conversion of BG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via deCOx [12,16]. In addition, several zeolitic materials have been studied as supports for Ni-based catalysts used in the synthesis of SAF from oleaginous biomass, promising results being obtained using SAPO-11 [17], SAPO-34 [18], ZSM-5 [19,20], and ZSM-22 [21]. However, the literature lacks systematic studies in which the nature of the active phase and the reaction conditions employed are fixed and the zeolitic support is varied to identify the carrier(s) leading to the best results in the conversion of FOG to SAF. A notable exception is the work of Wang et al., who upgraded vegetable oil over Ni-based catalysts supported on SAPO-11, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, or β-zeolites and observed quantitative conversion, high isomerization activity, and decreased cracking over 8 wt.% Ni/SAPO-11, which was found to be the most promising among all catalysts studied [17]. The present contribution aimed to further address the aforementioned gap in the literature by supporting Ni and Cu in a 4:1 proportion (by weight) on several zeolitic materials and testing the resulting catalysts in the conversion of BG to SAF-like hydrocarbons via deCOx. The characterization of both fresh and spent catalysts was also undertaken to rationalize trends and elucidate structure–activity relationships.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Catalyst Synthesis and Fresh Catalyst Characterization

A series of catalysts involving 12 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Cu as the supported metals and different zeolitic materials—namely, SAPO-11, SAPO-34, ZSM-5, and ZSM-22—as the carrier were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation employing the materials and methods described in Section 3.1. The synthesized catalysts were analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to experimentally determine their metal loadings. The results of these tests, which are summarized in Table A1 within Appendix A, show that the experimental loadings obtained are close to the nominal loadings targeted.

The textural properties of the bare supports employed and of the catalysts synthesized were determined by means of N2-physisorption, the results of these measurements being included in Table 1. The data in Table 1 clearly show that the textural properties of the bare zeolitic supports vary widely. For instance, surface area, which follows the trend ZSM-22 < SAPO-11 < ZSM-5 < SAPO-34, ranges from 59.6 to 525.7 m2/g. Unsurprisingly, the surface area of the supported metal catalysts is lower than that of the bare supports, since metal deposition causes some degree of pore filling.

The X-ray diffractograms of the catalysts synthesized are included in Figure A1 within Appendix A. The diffraction peaks so denoted are attributed to NiO, peaks at 37.3°, 43.3°, and 62.9°, respectively, representing its (111), (200), and (220) planes [22]. The fact that no peaks associated with Cu species were observed can be attributed to the lower Cu loading and/or to Cu species being highly dispersed, which is in agreement with previous reports on NCSAPO-11 [15]. The Scherrer equation was applied to the diffraction peak at 43.3° to determine the average NiO particle size, which afforded the values included in Table 1. The average NiO particle size ranges from 21.9 to 28.4 nm and it follows the trend NCZSM-22 < NCSAPO-11 ≈ NCSZM-5 < NCSAPO-34. Notably, the latter trend is the same as that observed for the surface area of the bare supports, which is at odds with the fact that carriers with a higher surface area would be expected to stabilize supported metals in the form of smaller particles and suggests the presence of amorphous and/or sub-nanometric Ni species not detected by means of XRD. Additional information regarding metal dispersion was acquired through H2 pulse chemisorption measurements, which resulted in the data included in Table 2. The trend observed for H2 uptake and metal-specific surface area—namely, NCSAPO-34 < NCSAPO-11 < NCSZM-5 < NCZSM-22—is also indicative of the metal dispersion trend followed by these catalysts.

More detailed information regarding the elemental composition and chemical environment of the surface of the catalysts surveyed was acquired via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, which were performed after reducing the catalysts using the conditions and approach described in Section 3.2. Table 3 summarizes the results of these analyses in terms of the surface concentration and oxidation state of the supported metals, while Table A2 and Table A3 in Appendix A provide more detailed information vis-à-vis the elemental surface composition and the supported metal species of the catalysts as determined via XPS. Full scans as well as Ni and Cu 2p regions of X-ray photoelectron spectra are included in Figure A2, Figure A3 and Figure A4 within Appendix A. The XPS analysis of NCSAPO-11 and NCZSM-5 clearly showed that the entirety of Ni is present in the metallic state in these two catalysts. Similarly, the low intensity of the Ni 2p3/2 satellite peak in the spectra of NCSAPO-34 and NCZSM-22 suggests that Ni is mostly reduced in these two formulations. However, the inhomogeneous character of these two samples precludes the neutralization of charging effects, which cause peak broadening and the appearance of a supplemental peak in the spectra of NCZSM-22 and NCSAPO-34, respectively, and make it impossible to accurately determine Ni0 concentration.

The most salient feature of the data in Table 3 is the surface concentration of the metals, which follows the trend NCSAPO-34 > NCZSM-22 >> NCSAPO-11 > NCZSM-5. However, the surface concentration of Cu0 shows a slightly different trend—namely, NCZSM-22 > NCSAPO-34 > NCZSM-5 > NCSAPO-11—which confirms that the reducibility of the surface metals varies across these catalysts. Indeed, the trend observed vis-à-vis the fraction that Cu0 represents of the total surface metal is NCSZM-5 > NCSZM-22 > NCSAPO-34 > NCSAPO-11. Admittedly, it is difficult to relate particle size information estimated from XRD, metal-specific surface area results from H2 pulse chemisorption, and surface concentration data on the supported metals derived from XPS. This can be attributed to the heterogeneity of Ni and Cu species expected to result from the deposition of these metals via impregnation on the zeolitic materials employed, since Ni and Cu can be expected to be present not only as nanoparticles but also as amorphous clusters and/or sub-nanometric species at different locations of the carriers. For instance, the fact that the Cu2O signal is observed at much higher binding energy than usual—see Table A3 and Figure A4 in Appendix A—may suggest an ionic Cu species exchanged on zeolitic Brønsted acid sites. Nevertheless, the results above provide valuable insights regarding the size of metal nanoparticles, metal-specific surface area, as well as the surface concentration and oxidation state of the supported metals.

The acidity of the catalysts used in this study was assessed by means of ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) given the importance of surface acidity to several reactions and phenomena of interest, including isomerization and cracking as well as coke-induced deactivation. In terms of total acidity, the catalysts followed the trend NCSAPO-34 > NCSAPO-11 > NCZSM-5 > NCZSM-22 (see Table 2), which is in overall agreement with previously reported acidity trends for the bare supports [23,24]. In contrast with previous reports focused on the bare supports, most acidity was found to be associated with weakly acidic sites (from which ammonia desorbs below 250 °C) albeit a smaller number of sites of medium acidity (from which ammonia desorbs between 250 and 400 °C) were also found to be present (see Figure 1). The fact that strongly acidic sites (displaying higher NH3 desorption temperatures) were not observed can be attributed to the fact that these sites would represent the main adsorption and anchor sites for metal precursors and particles, respectively. Thus, any strongly acidic sites—along with most sites of medium acidity—would be occupied during catalyst synthesis, leaving only weakly acidic sites and the relatively small number of sites of medium acidity observed.

2.2. BG Conversion to SAF

The BG sample used in this study was analyzed via gas chromatography (GC) and found to be composed entirely of C18 and C16 FFAs as shown in Table A4 in Appendix B. This feed was upgraded over the catalysts synthesized using the equipment and methods described in Section 3.3, the experimental approach employed used for the GC analysis of both the feed and the reaction products being described in Section 3.4. The results of these upgrading experiments and analyses are summarized in Table 4. Saliently, both BG conversion and the fraction of aviation fuel-range alkanes (C8–C16 hydrocarbons) in the reaction products follow the trend NCSAPO-11 < NCSAPO-34 < NCZSM-5 ≈ NCZSM-22, which suggests that 12 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Cu catalysts supported on the socony mobil zeolites tested afford better results that the corresponding formulations involving the silicoaluminophospate zeotypes essayed. Parenthetically, the inferior conversion of NCSAPO-11 is likely not due to its relatively low concentration of surface Ni0 and Cu0 (see Table 3), which represent the active sites for the deCOx reactions. Indeed, NCZSM-5 affords quantitative conversion despite displaying a slightly lower concentration of Ni0 than NCSAPO-11 and the second lowest concentration of Cu0 of all catalysts tested. Similarly, differences in conversion cannot be assigned to the surface Ni0/Cu0 concentrations of these catalysts, since the ratios for NCSAPO-11 and NCZSM-5 are 10.5 and 3.0, respectively. Instead, differences in conversion can be attributed—at least in part—to the propensity of these formulations towards fouling and coking (see Section 2.3). ZSM-supported catalysts also afford better results than SAPO-supported formulations in terms of the selectivity to the hydrocarbon families comprising aviation fuel, since the catalyst supported on SAPO-11 and SAPO-34 displayed almost identical selectivity of ~88.5% n-alkanes, ~7.5% iso-alkanes, ~2.5% cycloalkanes, and ~1.5% aromatics. In contrast, the catalysts supported on ZSM-5 and ZSM-22 showed lower selectivity to n-alkanes and higher selectivity to the other hydrocarbon families comprising aviation fuel. Among these, NCZSM-5 afforded the highest selectivity to iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes, as well as a yield of aromatics within the 8–25% specified for aviation fuel [25].

To elucidate the fate of the oxygen atoms in the BG feed, the gas stream produced during the upgrading of BG over NCZSM-5 was analyzed with a refinery gas analyzer (RGA) and found to contain 0.45% CO and 0.26% CO2 as the only oxygen-bearing compounds, which is unsurprising since deoxygenation proceeds via deCOx. The other compounds detected by the RGA were hydrogen (the reaction atmosphere) and C1–C6 hydrocarbons resulting from COx methanation and/or the cracking of alkyl chains, which is consistent with previous reports [26].

Figure 2 shows the carbon number distribution of the product mixtures resulting from upgrading experiments. Irrespective of the catalyst support employed, most hydrocarbon products were found to be within the C8–C16 range characteristic of aviation fuel (with the remainder being ≥C17 hydrocarbons). However, SAPO-supported catalysts show noticeable differences in terms of the carbon number of the reaction products relative to those obtained over ZSM-supported formulations. Indeed, NCSAPO-11 and NCSAPO-34 yield a considerable and comparable amount of C15 and C11 hydrocarbons, these two carbon numbers representing the most abundant among the products obtained over these catalysts. In contrast, NCZSM-5 and NCZSM-22 afford much lower amounts of C15, since lighter (≤C13) hydrocarbons are favored among which C10 hydrocarbons are the most abundant.

These results cannot be readily explained by the relative acidity of the supports favoring cracking reactions—since ZSM-supported catalysts have a total acidity that is either slightly (NCZSM-5) or much lower (NCZSM-22) than SAPO-supported formulations—albeit this can be attributed to the fact that most of the acid sites in these supports are either weakly or moderately acidic (see Figure 1) with a relatively low activity towards C-C cleavage [27,28]. Instead, these results can be rationalized by invoking the metal-specific surface area of ZSM-supported catalysts, which is much higher than that of their SAPO-supported counterparts (see Table 2). Indeed, it can be argued that a higher concentration of surface metal sites would increase the metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds, which in turn would favor the formation of lighter—at the expense of heavier—hydrocarbons. The relatively low concentration of surface Ni0 within NCSAPO-11 can only partially explain the lower cracking activity of this catalyst, since NCZSM-5 displays a slightly lower concentration of surface Ni0 (see Table 4). In addition to the aforementioned heterogeneity of Ni and Cu species, the lack of a consistent trend in this regard can also be attributed to the relative distribution of these metals on the catalyst surface, since C–C hydrogenolysis reactions require contiguous Ni atoms to be catalyzed [29] and Cu can disrupt Ni adjacency [30], curbing cracking reactions through both geometric and electronic effects [12,30,31,32]. However, the ability of Cu to disrupt Ni adjacency and cracking reactions appears to be limited in these catalysts, since NCSAPO-11 displays a lower cracking activity than NCZSM-5 despite having a much higher surface Ni0/Cu0 concentration ratio (10.5 vs. 3.0).

Given that the results in Table 4 preclude the identification of NCSZM-5 or NCZSM-22 as the most active catalyst (since both formulations afforded quantitative conversion), upgrading experiments were performed in which the amount of BG employed was doubled relative to that specified in Section 3.3. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table A5 in Appendix B. Surprisingly, both catalysts displayed quantitative BG conversion and practically identical selectivity to C8–C16 hydrocarbons under these conditions. An additional effort was made to identify the most active formulation between NCSZM-5 or NCZSM-22 by halving the amount of catalyst relative to the amount used in the experiments that afforded the data in Table A5. However, conversion remained quantitative, which suggests that testing these catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor, which would allow for additional variables (such as space velocity and time on stream) to be investigated—represents a better approach to enable this comparison. Previous reports on the upgrading of BG over supported Ni-Cu catalysts indicate that fixed-bed reactor experiments are also the best was to study catalyst stability and recyclability [12]; however, those experiments fall outside of the scope of this work and will be the focus of a future contribution.

2.3. Spent Catalyst Characterization

In an effort to rationalize the results of BG upgrading to SAF, the spent catalysts were analyzed by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Indeed, TGA offers a way to determine the amount of type of the carbonaceous deposits that accumulate on the catalyst surface in the course of the reaction, which can in turn serve as a gauge for the catalyst deactivation caused by fouling and coking. Parenthetically, coking and fouling represent the main deactivation mechanism for supported Ni-Cu catalysts used for the conversion of oleaginous biomass to fuel-like hydrocarbons, since metal loss due to leaching or even the formation of volatile carbonyls has been found to be negligible [12,15]. The results of these TGA measurements are summarized in Figure 3. Saliently, the spent NCSAPO-11 catalyst displayed the most significant weight loss (~18%), which suggests that fouling and coking could explain (at least in part) the fact that it shows the lowest BG conversion among all catalysts tested. NCSAPO-11 is unique in the sense that it represents the only spent formulation displaying considerable weight losses below 400 °C—which can be assigned to the removal of residual solvent, reactants, products as well as soft coke—as well as weight losses above the same temperature that can be attributed to the combustion of hard coke or graphitic carbon [33]. Indeed, spent NCSAPO-34 displays the vast majority of its weight loss below 400 °C, whereas spent NCZSM-5 and NCZSM-22 undergo most of their weight loss above this temperature.

In short, it can be argued that coking and fouling can only be invoked to explain catalytic activity when the catalyst displays both a relatively low surface area and a high propensity for coking as is the case for NCSAPO-11. All other formulations display a moderate degree of coking (like NCZSM-22), a relatively high surface area (like NCSAPO-34), or both (as is the case for NCZSM-5). The analysis by means of TGA of the catalysts spent in the experiments resulting in the data within Table A5 seems to corroborate this conclusion, since the weight loss spent NCZSM-22 and NCZSM-5 displayed, respectively, remained unchanged and increased only slightly (see Figure A5 in Appendix B) with no impact on conversion. Lastly, it should be noted that the TGA results can only be partially explained invoking acidity. Indeed, the least acidic catalysts—namely, NCZSM-22—displays the lowest degree of fouling and coking as would be expected. However, the extent of coking and fouling observed for the other catalysts does not show a linear relationship with acidity, which suggests that other variables (like the concentration and relative distribution of Ni and Cu on the catalyst surface) are at play.

2.4. Catalyst Recycling Studies

The recyclability of the catalyst that afforded the most promising results—i.e., NCZSM-5 (see Section 2.2)—was assessed by testing this catalyst in five sequential BG upgrading reactions. Between reactions, the spent catalyst was regenerated through a procedure comprising a calcination step under static air (to remove carbonaceous deposits from the spent catalyst surface) and a reduction step identical to the one used before the first upgrading reaction (to re-reduce the supported metals oxidized during the calcination step). The results of these experiments are summarized in Figure 4.

Notably, BG conversion remained quantitative across all reaction cycles. Interestingly, the selectivity to C8–C16 hydrocarbons was 100% in cycles 1 and 2, dropped to 86.5 and 82.7% in cycles 3–4 (due to the formation of oxygenates and C19 hydrocarbons) and increased to 98% in cycle 5 (since much less oxygenates and no C19 hydrocarbons were produced in this last cycle). Parenthetically, the oxygenates detected in some products mixtures were aldehydes, alcohols, ethers, and ketones, which are produced in small amounts via the incomplete deoxygenation of FFAs in BG and through condensation reactions involving oxygenated intermediates. Finally, Figure 4 also shows how the selectivity to the different hydrocarbon families comprising jet fuel (n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cyclo-alkanes, and aromatics) varied significantly across cycles.

To rationalize these results, the post-mortem of the NCZSM-5 catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments was performed focusing on Ni-specific metal active sites and on surface acid sites associated with the zeolitic support. H2 pulse chemisorption results showed that the metal-specific surface area of the catalyst dropped from 1.414 m2/g in the fresh catalyst to 0.004 m2/g in the catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments, which clearly indicates a loss of metal sites likely due to metal sintering and coking. Similarly, NH3-TPD measurements indicate that the total acidity of the catalyst dropped from 1.44 mmol NH3/g on the fresh catalyst to 0.59 mmol NH3/g on the catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments, which is indicative of a loss of acid sites attributable to the accumulation of recalcitrant coke deposits.

The results of recycling studies and of the post-mortem catalyst characterization suggests that metal sites within NCZSM-5 have a very high intrinsic activity, since conversion remained quantitative despite the loss of most metal sites. Moreover, changes in the amount of metal active sites and surface acid sites are in line with the changes in selectivity observed during the recycling studies, since structural changes are bound to affect the performance of the catalyst in cracking, isomerization, cyclization, and aromatization reactions. In short, although these studies show the recycling stability of the catalyst in terms of conversion, the results also show variance in terms of selectivity, clearly indicating the direction of future work. However, the latter falls outside of the scope of the present contribution and will be the focus of future studies.

3. Materials and Methods

3.1. Catalyst Synthesis

Catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation—using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as metal precursors and SAPO-11 (6% SiO2, 48% Al2O3; ACS MATERIAL, Pasadena, CA, USA), SAPO-34 (~0.5 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; ACS MATERIAL), ZSM-5 (30 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; Zeolyst, Kansas City, KS, USA), or ZSM-22 (65–80 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; ACS MATERIAL) as the support—targeting a Ni loading of 12 wt.% and a Cu loading of 3.0 wt.%. After drying under vacuum overnight at 60 °C, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in static air.

3.2. Fresh Catalyst Characterization

The fresh catalysts prepared were characterized using previously described equipment and methods for ICP [34], N2 physisorption [35], XRD [32], NH3 TPD [36], H2 pulse chemisorption [36], and XPS [15,32,37]. Briefly, ICP was performed using a Varian 720-ES analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), while XRD was carried out on a Phillips X’Pert diffractometer (Philips Analytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation at 0.02° step size. NH3 TPD and H2 pulse chemisorption experiments were performed on an Autochem II analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) outfitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Thermostar mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer, Aßlar, Germany). For each experiment, 250 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-tube quartz reactor connected to the instrument and heated by a clamshell oven. Prior to analysis, the catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 1 h under 10% H2/Ar. For NH3 TPD, after cooling the reduced catalyst to 30 °C, the sample was exposed to a flow (100 sccm) of 1% NH3/N2 for an hour before purging with a flow (100 sccm) of Ar for another hour to remove physisorbed NH3. The sample was then heated to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min while NH3 desorption was monitored using the mass spectrometer signal at m/z = 16. For H2 pulse chemisorption, after reduction the reactor was purged with Ar at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to 45 °C. Pulses of 0.025mL (STP) H2 were then introduced to the reactor in 3 min intervals using Ar (50 sccm) as carrier gas, the TCD being employed to monitor H2 breakthrough. Pulses were continued until the amount of breakthrough H2 detected via TCD became constant. For XPS analyses, catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2 at 350 °C for 3 h in a pre-treatment chamber connected to the instrument and allowing the transfer of pre-treated samples into the XPS analysis chamber without exposure to air. XPS was performed using a PHI 5000 Versaprobe—Physical Electronics (Chanhassen, MN, USA)–apparatus using a monochromatic Al Kα1 X-Ray source with energy of 1486.6 eV, accelerating voltage of 15 kV, power of 50 W, and spot size diameter of 200 μm. Spectra were processed using the CasaXPS software package (version 2.3.25PR1.0).

3.3. Catalyst Testing for BG Conversion to SAF

Catalyst testing was conducted in a 100 mL stainless steel reactor—Autoclave Engineers (Erie, PA, USA)—operated in semi-batch mode. After placing 0.5 g of the formulation to be tested in the reactor, closing the latter, and purging the system with Argon, the catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 3 h under 100 psi and a flow (60 sscm) of 10% H2 in N2. Subsequently, the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature and the system was purged with Argon. Then, a solution comprising 1.8 g of BG—which was produced by “Greasezilla™” a product of Downey Ridge Environmental Company (Lansing, WV, USA) and has the composition in Table A4 within Appendix B—dissolved in 22.75 g of dodecane (99+% Sigma Aldrich) was introduced to the reactor through a port in the reactor head using a needle connected to a syringe containing the feed. After sealing the reactor, Argon was replaced with H2, which was used to pressurize the system to 580 psi and establish a flow of 60 sccm using a backpressure regulator and a mass flow controller, respectively. The reaction mixture was then heated to 375 °C and kept at said temperature for 3 h under constant mechanical stirring (1000 rpm). All experiments were performed in duplicate to ascertain both reproducibility and the statistical significance of the results.

3.4. Analysis of BG and Its Catalytic Upgrading Products

The identity and quantity of all compounds comprising the BG feed employed and the liquid products stemming from its catalytic upgrading were determined via dual detection GC using instrumentation and methods described in detail in a previous contribution [38]. Briefly, analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with both MS and flame ionization detectors. The inlet was operated in split mode (split ratio 25:1; split flow 50 mL/min) using an initial temperature of 100 °C. The inlet temperature was increased immediately upon injection (at a rate of 8 °C/min) to a final temperature of 320 °C, which was maintained for the duration of the analysis. The initial oven temperature (45 °C) was increased upon injection first to 325 °C (at a rate of 4 °C/min) and then to 400 °C (at a rate of 10 °C/min). This temperature was then maintained for 12.5 min, making the total run time 90 min. An Agilent J&W DB-5HT column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.1 μm) rated to 450 °C was employed along with a constant He flow of 2 mL/min. Quantification was performed using cyclohexanone as internal standard. Agilent Chemstation and Separation Systems Inc. (Gulf Breeze, FL, USA). SimDis Expert 9 software were used to perform chromatographic programming and to process the chromatographic data acquired. Solvents (i.e., chloroform and dodecane) were quenched and subtracted prior to data processing. A representative chromatogram—corresponding to the liquid products stemming from the upgrading of BG over NCZSM-5—is provided in Appendix C as Figure A6. In addition, a table including the retention time (RT) of each peak in this chromatogram along with its corresponding compound name, compound carbon number (CN), and percent area under the curve (% AUC) is provided in the same appendix as Table A6.

3.5. Spent Catalyst Characterization

Spent catalysts were subjected to TGA using a Discovery Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer—TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA)—after being dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight to remove water. Dried spent catalysts held in a platinum TGA pan were heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under a flow (50 sccm) of air.

3.6. Catalyst Recycling Studies

Recycling studies were performed using NCZSM-5, the most promising formulation identified in catalyst testing runs. After each upgrading reaction, the spent catalyst was recovered via filtration, rinsed with chloroform, dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven, and calcined under static air at 450 °C for 5 h using a muffle furnace to remove carbonaceous deposits (see Figure 3). The calcined catalyst was then subjected to the same catalyst testing procedure described in Section 3.3, adjusting the amount of feed employed to keep the catalyst–feed ratio constant for five reaction cycles.

4. Conclusions

In this study, catalysts comprising Ni and Cu supported on various zeolitic carriers were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for the conversion of BG to SAF. Among the tested formulations, a 12.8% Ni-3.2% Cu/ZSM-5 (NCZSM-5) catalyst exhibited the highest BG conversion and selectivity to SAF-like hydrocarbons. Specifically, the NCZSM-5 catalyst achieved a BG conversion of 99.9% and a jet fuel yield of 87.3%. Moreover, NCZSM-5 afforded SAF-range products containing n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics, all integral components of aviation fuel. The results obtained compare favorably to those recently reported by Ritmun. Indeed, this author also found that a 12.5% Ni-2.5% Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the best results among a series of Ni-Cu formulations supported on various zeolites—including SAPO-11 and ZSM-5—in the conversion of palm oil to SAF [39]. A notable difference is that while palm oil is an edible feedstock composed almost entirely of triglycerides, BG is a waste stream that is typically incinerated or landfilled and is 100% FFAs. The latter is significant, as current HEFA technology typically avoids feedstocks with FFA levels exceeding 25% [40]. This highlights the potential of BG as a viable and underutilized resource for SAF production.

Additionally, this study addressed a gap in the literature by systematically varying the zeolitic support while using the same active phase and reaction conditions in the conversion of BG to SAF. The findings demonstrate that ZSM-5 offers superior performance relative to other supports tested, including SAPO-11, SAPO-34, and ZSM-22. This contrasts with the results of Wang et al., who found that SAPO-11 led to the best results when they upgraded vegetable oil over Ni-based catalysts supported on SAPO-11, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, or β-zeolites [17].

Overall, the results presented herein provide valuable insights into catalyst design for SAF production from FOG. Particularly, they underscore the role of zeolitic supports in optimizing performance and suggest that the latter may be dependent on the nature of the active phase and/or the feedstock employed.

While passenger demand rebounded swiftly in 2022 and 2023, structural challenges—ranging from decarbonization mandates to shifting consumer expectations—have created a complex landscape for profitability. As airlines grapple with these headwinds, the role of organizations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in shaping recovery strategies has become critical. This analysis explores the interplay between these structural challenges and the industry's path to sustainable profitability.

Structural Challenges: A New Era of Constraints

The most pressing structural challenge facing airlines is decarbonization. The aviation sector accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, and regulatory pressures to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are intensifyingIATA - Airlines[ 1 ]. To meet this goal, airlines must invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric propulsion technologies, and operational efficiencies. However, these transitions come at a cost. SAF, for instance, remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel, creating a financial burden for carriers already strained by high debt levels from pandemic-era losses.

Evolving passenger expectations further complicate the equation. Post-pandemic travelers now prioritize health and safety protocols, digital convenience, and personalized services. Airlines must modernize IT systems, enhance contactless experiences, and invest in staff training to meet these demands—all while managing razor-thin profit margins. Additionally, the rise of low-cost carriers and ancillary revenue models has forced traditional airlines to rethink pricing strategies, often at the expense of long-term profitability.

Recovery Dynamics: IATA's Role in Shaping the Path Forward

Amid these challenges, IATA has emerged as a pivotal actor in guiding the industry. The organization's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, for example, provides a standardized framework for tracking and certifying SAF usage, enabling global compliance with environmental regulationsIATA - Airlines[ 1 ]. By streamlining this process, IATA aims to reduce administrative costs for airlines and accelerate the adoption of greener fuels.

Similarly, the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) program has reinforced operational resilience. Enhanced safety protocols not only rebuild passenger confidence but also mitigate the risk of costly disruptions—a critical factor in an industry where delays and cancellations can erode profitability. IATA's advocacy for harmonized global standards has also reduced fragmentation in regulatory requirements, allowing airlines to allocate resources more efficiently.

However, the road to recovery remains uneven. While major carriers in North America and Europe have shown stronger financial resilience due to robust domestic markets, airlines in Asia and Africa continue to lag. Currency fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, and underdeveloped infrastructure in emerging markets further strain their ability to compete.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the airline sector presents a paradox: long-term growth potential is tempered by near-term volatility. The push for decarbonization, while essential, requires capital-intensive investments that could weigh on short-term earnings. Conversely, airlines that successfully integrate sustainability into their business models—such as those leveraging IATA's frameworks—may gain a competitive edge.

A key risk lies in the misalignment between regulatory timelines and technological readiness. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set ambitious carbon offset targets, but the scalability of current SAF production remains uncertain. Airlines that overcommit to unproven technologies risk stranded assets.

On the flip side, opportunities exist in ancillary revenue streams and digital transformation. Airlines that innovate in areas like dynamic pricing, loyalty programs, and in-flight connectivity could unlock new profit centers. The integration of artificial intelligence for demand forecasting and route optimization also offers a pathway to cost efficiency.

David Valaer, Founder and CEO of Green Taxi Aerospace, said, “This collaboration is about taking action today to show meaningful progress in aviation sustainability with technology that makes operations cleaner and more efficient.”

The Zero Engine Taxi™ benefits include the potential of saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel as a result of more efficient taxing processes that, in turn, contribute to cost savings.

“Our Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what we can control today while we innovate future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” said Sangita Sharma, director of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab.

Delta is committed to a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, and with around 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, the global airline is focusing its efforts under three pillars: ‘What we Fly, How we Fly, and The Fuel We Use.’

Notes:

This partnership is a first in the US. We had a clue this was coming back in August after meeting David Valaer at the Pris show. We followed up with him for a conversation.

Airlines, being the competitive bunch they are, will not allow any competitor to have even a smidgen of advantage. Expect others to follow Delta’s lead.

This etaxi solution will likely find traction among regional jets first, so the Big Three are likely to be the first movers. Or the two others following Delta’s first move.

Regional jets spend a lot more time on a taxiway than bigger aircraft. They are likely to show the highest benefit.

Success among the US regionals is also likely to be copied elsewhere.

One last point: US regional airlines are desperate for a solution to their operational costs. They can’t get new fuel-efficient aircraft because of the myopic Scope Clause. But they can tweak their current fleets to extract better economics. Green Taxi is a step in that direction.

The Deputy Minister will participate in the Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting and the Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable Fuels on Monday, 15 September, to place South Africa at the centre of high-level global discussions on implementing and collaborating on hydrogen policies.

According to the department, Gina will engage with Japanese officials on international collaboration, demand stimulation, and supply chain development between South Africa and Japan.

The Ministerial Meetings will be held in collaboration with Expo 2025 Osaka, an event that brings together people and innovations from around the world to address global issues and showcase Japan's technological capabilities in achieving a hydrogen-powered society.

“The engagements will serve as a bedrock to create institutional foundations for market-based hydrogen trading and price discovery, an essential step towards legitimising hydrogen as a tradable energy asset,” the statement read.

Japan is committed to ensuring that its supply chains are secure, transparent and interconnected on a global scale.

The department said Japan also aims to establish global markets that will substantiate its investments in hydrogen production, transportation and utilisation technologies.

In advancing the sustainable fuels agenda, Japan's primary objective is to ensure the widespread implementation of sustainable fuels, particularly in industries that are challenging to regulate, such as aviation and shipping.

“The country has expressed commitment to expediting the global adoption of biofuels, e-fuels, and e-methane as part of its Initiative for Sustainable Fuels and Mobility with Brazil. In addition, Japan aims to diversify the global energy supply ahead of COP30.”

From 16 to 18 September, the Deputy Minister will engage in discussions with representatives from the Japanese government, academic institutions, and commercial entities, including Toyota, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, as well as the universities of Kyoto and Osaka.

The discussions will focus on science, technology and innovation-related matters, such as nanotechnology, carbon recycling, astronomy and space science technologies.

Green industrialisation

Speaking ahead of the mission, Gina said the Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable Fuels holds considerable significance for South Africa, as the government aims to expedite the diversification of its energy portfolio to foster sustainable and inclusive growth.

“For example, to reduce the carbon intensity within the aviation sector, South Africa aims to learn from Japan's advancements in sustainable aviation fuel. Accordingly, strengthening cooperation with Japanese research institutions and enterprises specialising in sustainable aviation fuels and renewable energy sources will be essential,” said the Deputy Minister.

Gina stated that the insights gained from the mission will be instrumental in developing a robust infrastructure for renewable hydrogen and sustainable fuels in South Africa, with the potential to transform key sectors of the economy.

These include the transformation of the energy and mining sector to decarbonisation operations and power generation.

Advancing the transportation and aviation sectors through the promotion of environmentally sustainable fuels and hydrogen-powered mobility will accelerate South Africa's transition to cleaner fuels, thereby reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.

In addition, South Africa's manufacturing sector supports the expansion of new industries in hydrogen storage, fuel cells and electrolysers, while the agricultural sector supports the production of low-carbon fertilisers and strengthens the food supply chain.

""These initiatives have the potential to promote green industrialisation, create jobs in energy-intensive industries, and enhance the resilience of transport and logistics networks, thereby supporting South Africa's broader social and economic development objectives,” said Gina.

The department said Japan remains a strategic ally for South Africa in scientific research, development and innovation since formalising a scientific and technological cooperation agreement in 2003.

“In future, the country aims to leverage Japan's expertise in vehicle manufacturing, electronics and the commercialisation of research to enhance collaborative initiatives in industrial development and technological innovation,” said the department. – SAnews.gov.za",https://www.sanews.gov.za/sites/default/files/2012/images/news_story_template/202509/gina5.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:56:32.311077

Decarbonization of maritime vessels presents unique challenges.
In adding marine vessels to the RFS, which already covers land-based vehicles and aviation, the bill would seek to put marine fuel applications on an equal footing with other fuel uses.
Moreover, Ms. Metcalf testified on Wednesday, the industry is also actively supporting international regulations on maritime shipping.","The global maritime sector underpins international trade, transporting over 80 percent of the world’s goods. Marine shipping is highly efficient, but the sector is still responsible for 3 percent of all global GHG emissions and ships burn approximately 300 million tons of fossil fuels every year. Although the energy intensity of shipping has fallen in the last two decades, the volume of shipping has increased by a greater amount, so energy use for shipping has increased by five percent since 2008.

The most used fuels in maritime shipping today are marine gas oil and heavy fuel oil – a fuel that results in significant particulate matter and smog in port communities. LNG is a small but rapidly growing fuel for shipping; biofuels account for less than one percent of fuel used for shipping.

Decarbonization of maritime vessels presents unique challenges. Vessels need access to fuels at ports, with resulting infrastructure requirements for the fuel supply, and fuels must have sufficient energy intensity to carry the vessels great distances. That energy intensity can also create safety challenges during storage. While vessels that are used in fixed trade patterns can be designed to use the fuels available at the specific ports at which they trade, chartered vessels must be able to refuel at any port.

Marine engines are also typically designed for a specific fuel type. The vessel size and tonnage requirements affect the engine choices and power needs, which dictate the fuels and propulsion system options. These needs, and therefore fuel options, vary widely across vessel types, from containerships, to tankers, to dry bulk carriers, to passenger vessels, to tug/barge units.

RFS for Ocean Going Vessels

On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee explored this issue of maritime shipping during a legislative hearing in which the committee examined S. 881, the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act, among other Clean Air Act legislation. S. 881 has been introduced by Senator Pete Ricketts, (R-NE) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The Committee called two witnesses to speak on this piece of legislation:

Kathy Metcalf, President Emeritus of the Chamber of Shipping of America

Nikita Pavlenko, Program Director, Fuels and Aviation, The International Council on Clean Transportation

The Renewable Fuel Standards program currently excludes ocean-going vessels; this bill would allow renewable fuels used in ocean-going vessels to generate and retain renewable identification numbers (RINs). RINs create revenues for vessel operators and help to narrow the price gap between renewable fuels and conventional fuels. In adding marine vessels to the RFS, which already covers land-based vehicles and aviation, the bill would seek to put marine fuel applications on an equal footing with other fuel uses.

However, as Mr. Pavlenko pointed out in his testimony, as an opt-in provision that doesn’t fully reduce the price gap between biofuels and conventional fuels, it is unlikely that the bill would materially expand the use of biofuels in marine shipping. A similar provision in 2014 amended the RFS to include jet fuel but has not materially affected sustainable aviation fuel production; a decade later, SAF blending in the aviation sector remains below 1%.

Moreover, the expansion of the RFS could have deleterious consequences if it resulted in the EPA proposed higher volume targets for the RFS, which could result in land use changes as a result of the increased demand for soybean and palm oil cropland. Particularly when land is being converted to biofuel production cropland is currently functioning as a major carbon sick, e.g. when rainforests and forest land are converted to cropland, this can result in significant net increases in carbon emissions despite the lower direct emissions profile of the biofuel.

The maritime industry is actively engaged in efforts to develop alternatives to diesel fuel, with research and development ongoing for a variety of fuels including ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, LNG, LPG, biofuels, and battery-electric hybrid. Moreover, Ms. Metcalf testified on Wednesday, the industry is also actively supporting international regulations on maritime shipping. While the Chamber of Shipping of America testified support for Mr. Ricketts’ bill, they “support that bill as only one piece of an overall strategy to address decarbonization of marine transportation”. Much more important than any potential U.S. regulation is the international framework that has been set forth by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

IMO Standards

The U.S. is one of 108 members in the IMO, and vessels engaged in international trade must comply with international requirements, regardless of whether the U.S. decides to adopt them. In April of this year, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved a Net Zero Framework that includes a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions. If approved by the full IMO, the standards will go into effect in 2027 and become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage.

The framework seeks to achieve net zero maritime GHG emissions by the year 2050 through prices on emissions above set tiers that become more stringent over time. While non-compliance with those tiers will result in penalties, shipowners will be able to purchase credits from over-complying vessels, creating a revenue stream to support low-emission vessels.

Shippers are largely supportive of the proposal. For instance Maersk, which operates in almost 130 countries, has urged the IMO to adopt them, calling the proposals ambitious, proportional, and enforceable measures.

On the other hand, the U.S. is actively opposing the adoption of the IMO standards. On August 12, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy jointly released a statement that described the IMO proposal as “Global Carbon Tax”. In the statement they threatened countries for supporting the regulations, saying “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.” According to Reuters, the State Department is now actively approaching countries and threatening retaliation for support. For instance, the Netherlands was told it could face tariffs or other consequences if it supported the framework, according to a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.

Adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework will require approval by a two-thirds majority of parties at their next meeting in October. There is also a 16-month period after approval in which one-third or more of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or parties representing not less than 50% of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant fleet, can bring an objection. (Currently, the top five flag states are Liberia, Panama, Marshall Islands, Hong Kong, and Singapore – together they represent more than 50% of the world’s gross tonnage.) In April, 80% of voters approved the measure in the Subcommittee, with “no” votes primarily coming from oil-producing nations. It is unclear whether the pressure campaign from the U.S. will change the positions of the countries that previously supported and imperil adoption of the framework.

Biofuels and Soybean Markets

Unlike the Net Zero Framework from the IMO, Senator Ricketts’ RFS expansion bill is not primarily about addressing climate change. Underlying the pressure to expand the use of biofuels is the nation’s changed trading relationship with China under President Trump, and the implications that has for soybeans. By this point in last year’s soybean growing season, the U.S. had booked approximately 13 billion tons of soybean exports to China, whereas this year Chinese importers have yet to buy any soybean crops. China’s 23% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports have added approximately $2 per bushel to the cost of American soybeans, which has resulted in Brazilian soybeans being cheaper even during America’s peak growing season.

Soybean growers hope to expand the market for soybeans by expanding their use in fuel, in order to make up for the reduction in demand for American soybeans from China. However expanding the global market for soybeans could have profoundly negative consequences for global GHG emissions. Currently, the global supply of soybeans is expanding most in locations at high risk for deforestation, including Brazil, which has expanded production of soybeans by 35 percent over the past five years.",https://enotrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Maritime-Fuel-1030x579.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:56:36.559184

THE Federal government has revealed plans to commence the decarbonisation of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.

The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo said the challenges posed by climate change demanded decisive, concerted action by stakeholders to embrace decarbonisation. He suggested exploring group electrification of aprons and terminals, sustainable aviation fuel, SAF, corridors and waste-to-energy projects to reduce emission in airport operations.

The minister, who disclosed this at a stakeholders engagement on carbon emissions management at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, NAIA, in Abuja yesterday.

Represented by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Dr. Ibrahim Kana, at the event organised by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, Keyamo said:

“The global aviation community stands at a crossroads. On one hand, we are drivers of economic growth, connectivity, and national development.

‘’On the other, we are duty bound to address our environmental impact with utmost seriousness. The challenge of climate change is not a distant theoretical concern; it is a present and pressing reality that demands decisive, concerted action.

‘’For Nigeria, a nation poised for exponential growth in air travel and trade, embedding sustainability into the very core of our aviation infrastructure is not an option, it is an imperative for long term, resilient prosperity”

Also speaking, the Managing Director of FAAN, Mrs Olubunmi Kuku, said climate change posed a threat to global aviation industry, with potential negative ripple effects on business and livelihoods, if not properly managed.

Kuku, who was represented by the Director of Human Resource and Administration, Dr. Luqman Eniola, said FAAN was committed to decarbonising its operations through implementation of strategic measures.

On the essence of the stakeholder engagement, she said: “This forum is expected to help FAAN understand emission management measures, so we can integrate them into our carbon management plan for the airport, where it is necessary.”

She hinted that the FAAN ACA Team and the Carbon Emission Reduction Committee, CERC, carried out mapping in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Enugu and Port Harcourt, noting that electricity consumption accounted for about 90 per cent of the total emissions for Lagos airport from 2017 to 2023.

Kuku said implementation of emission reduction measures for the Lagos airport has commenced, adding that more actions would be considered in the reconstruction and expansion of the airport’s terminal buildings.

“The Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, is also important to us and this is why we are hosting this event today to ensure that we hear from you, and we will journey together.

‘’As they say, ‘never walk alone’! We want to walk with you, and we need you to walk with us in our determination of net-zero emissions target in our airport operations,’’ Kuku said.",https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-50.png,N,,2025-09-12 19:57:08.184606

""Global ammonia production is a little under 200 million tonnes annually - if you were to use ammonia in shipping, you could basically double that market between now and 2050,"" said panellist Stephen Jackson, CEO of Ammonia Europe, who stressed that Ammonia Europe sees the maritime sector as the ""main...lead market"" for green ammonia demand.
""We are predominantly targeting the maritime sector and pushing hard for the adoption of the IMO framework,"" continued Jackson, adding that for the ""new value chains"" the issue is ""demand, demand, demand.""
That could in turn help bolster the case for shipping firms to adopt ammonia as a marine fuel.

Speakers were discussing the outlook for the sector at the DARE2X ""What Can Brussels Do For Green Ammonia: European Industry, Policy and Regulations"" conference in the Belgian capital on Thursday.

""Global ammonia production is a little under 200 million tonnes annually - if you were to use ammonia in shipping, you could basically double that market between now and 2050,"" said panellist Stephen Jackson, CEO of Ammonia Europe, who stressed that Ammonia Europe sees the maritime sector as the ""main...lead market"" for green ammonia demand.

It is ""feasible"" that as much as ""900 million tons of ammonia"" could potentially be ""needed by 2050,"" said Topsoe's Rob Stevens, Secretary and President Emeritus at the Ammonia Energy Association (AEA), citing high-case AEA projections which identified the key demand growth areas as shipping, fertiliser, and for ammonia as a hydrogen carrier.

The problem facing green ammonia is ""developing the new end uses and ensuring that the fuel is available and available at cost for the new demand markets,"" stated Jackson.

""We are predominantly targeting the maritime sector and pushing hard for the adoption of the IMO framework,"" continued Jackson, adding that for the ""new value chains"" the issue is ""demand, demand, demand.""

""We need those demand signals, and we need the price of clean fuels to come down,"" said Jackson.

Regulatory risk

Asked whether the US government's recent threats against the IMO's net zero framework — seen by many as vital to making green ammonia viable as a marine fuel — might undercut projected maritime demand for green ammonia, panellists noted that an agreement could still be reached, without Washington's cooperation.

""We share similar concerns about the US trying to torpedo the whole agreement,"" said Jackson, but he stressed that in the maritime industry ""the US maybe doesn't weigh quite as much as it does in other sectors, and we do have good chances of getting [the IMO legislation] through.""

Similarly, Stevens said that the AEA is working with the IMO and emphasised the organisation's international structure, and suggested that shippers might come to use different fuels in different jurisdictions.

Ammonia and methanol

Participants at the conference highlighted ammonia's growing role in shipping, and panellists suggested that ammonia might be able to overtake its main rival as a green fuel, methanol, in the coming years.

There are five operational ammonia-fuelled ships and 69 firm orders, including 29 ammonia carriers and 28 bulk carriers, AEA data stated. And there are a further 415 ships on order which comprise 154 ammonia dual-fuel vessels and 261ammonia-ready, the presentation continued, also noting successful bunkering tests at Rotterdam, Singapore and Pilbara.

Citing legislation and the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector, Stevens predicted that ""aviation, in my opinion, is going to out-compete shipping for biogenic carbon,"" supplies of which may be limited. That could in turn help bolster the case for shipping firms to adopt ammonia as a marine fuel.

Engine specialists Everllence — formerly MAN-ES — predicted ammonia will be the ""most prominent fuel"" for shipping by 2050.

The ""toxicity challenge...remains a crucial focus and requires responsible introduction of ammonia as a marine fuel,"" said Rasmus Holm Bidstrup, a director at Everllence.

Bidstrup also noted that he sees little demand so far for hydrogen as a marine fuel or for on-board crackers due to hydrogen's properties and ammonia's smooth combustion.",https://www.qcintel.com/i/qci_logo_sq_300x300.png,N,,2025-09-12 20:56:24.113457

oi-Dennis Abraham James

Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has announced that the blending of isobutanol with diesel will soon be scaled up. Gadkari made the announcement while speaking at The India Sugar & Bio-Energy Conference 2025 and stated that work has already started on it reports the Economic Times.

Gadkari also confirmed that ethanol blending with petrol has now touched the 20% mark. He added that the government is working on increasing the ethanol blend for sustainable aviation fuel as part of its wider strategy to strengthen India's renewable energy sector.

The minister explained that ethanol blending programmes have directly impacted crop prices. Corn farmers, for example, have earned more than ₹42,000 crore under the current initiative. Surplus crops, such as corn, are increasingly being channelled into the energy sector, helping to secure steady incomes for farming communities.

He further said India is producing surpluses of rice, wheat, sugar, and corn. Converting these into biofuels has significantly raised farm earnings across states. Ethanol production, he pointed out, has also relieved the sugar industry from delays in payments to cane farmers, ensuring smoother financial flows.

Gadkari addressed concerns raised over the ethanol-blended petrol programme mandating 20% ethanol in petrol, stressing that fears about engine damage and warranty lapses were unfounded. All government testing agencies, he noted, have confirmed that no technical issues exist in implementing E20 fuel across the country.

Gadkari recalled that several petitions had been filed against the E20 mandate, questioning its legality and safety standards. He highlighted that the Supreme Court recently dismissed those petitions, removing major obstacles to implementation. This cleared the way for nationwide adoption of E20 petrol without legal uncertainty.

Gadkari underlined that ethanol blending is improving incomes for corn farmers while strengthening India's energy security profile. This direct link between agriculture and energy, he said, represents a core element of the government's strategy to support farmers and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Impact of Isobutanol-Diesel Blending on Vehicles Aspect Details Fuel Properties Isobutanol has higher energy content and lower water absorption than ethanol, making it more compatible with diesel engines already in use across India. Emission Impact Blending isobutanol with diesel reduces smoke, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide. Small blending levels require no major engine modifications, easing adoption. Driver Experience Performance differences are minimal at lower blends. Vehicles run smoothly with little to no effect on mileage or engine behaviour. Sources

Significant Milestone

Brand new A220 named “People's Balus” departed Airbus' final assembly line in Mirabel towards Port Moresby with scheduled stops in Vancouver, Honolulu, and Fiji.

This delivery marks the start of Air Niugini's fleet modernisation programme with eight A220-100 aircraft ordered directly from Airbus and three A220-300s leased from Azorra.

Airline’s A220-300 aircraft is configured to carry 138 passengers.

The aircraft is painted in a special livery dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. A dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters applying 11 distinct colors using an airbrushing technique brought the special design to life.

A220 Confident Player on the Market

Powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF engines, Airbus A220 combines the longest range of up to 6,700km with a 25% reduction in fuel consumption and 25% reduction in carbon emissions per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft.

Brand new A220s are made of 40% advanced materials, making them lighter. The newly designed nose and tail cone help to reduce drag. Furthermore, A220 has the smallest fuselage wetted area in its class, enhancing its efficiency even further.

Already today, A220 can fly with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aiming to be capable of operating 100% SAF flights by 2030.

Airbus A220-100 can carry 100-135 passengers, while the larger A220-300 can fit between 120 and 160 people. Spacious and quiet cabin boosts passengers’ comfort to a new level.

Airbus has received over 940 orders for the A220 Family of aircraft from more than 30 airlines and lessors, with 440 aircraft already delivered to customers. The A220 is operating more than 1,800 routes and serving over 480 global destinations, confirming its status as the leading single-aisle aircraft in the market.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68c43e968990525665321540_PM%2038%20745.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:12.984195

The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 11 September at Kaneka Malaysia’s site in the Gebeng Industrial Estate. The RM 31 million (€6.9 million) project is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026.

The facility will produce up to 30 tonnes of renewable steam per hour, replacing natural gas and cutting around 30,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions each year. The project is part of Kaneka Malaysia’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases targeted by 2030.

Developed under a 20-year supply agreement, the plant will be owned and operated by BACRE’s subsidiary, BACRE Gebeng, with Kaneka Malaysia as the buyer and land provider. It will run on palm kernel shells, empty fruit bunches, and woodchips, using advanced combustion technology, automated ash handling, and strict emission controls.

In addition to direct CO₂ savings, the use of palm residues is expected to avoid methane emissions equal to 70,000 tonnes of CO₂ over the next decade.

Kaneka Malaysia Managing Director Hiroyuki Nishimoto said the initiative shows the company’s focus on sustainability and innovation. “This is a major step forward, marking Kaneka’s first biomass steam project here in Malaysia,” he said.

BACRE Director Hasnoel Ramly said the facility demonstrates how agricultural waste can be turned into clean energy. “It is not just about meeting Kaneka’s needs, but about helping Malaysia’s industries cut carbon,” he said.

The project’s delivery partners include Knight Frank Project Services (contractor), Boilermech Sdn Bhd (technology), and Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (finance), with Emnes providing sustainability support.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biomass-2.jpeg,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:15.351841

On this 24th anniversary of 9/11, I know the whole House will want to join me and, I am sure, the Leader of the House in sending our best wishes to the families and the friends of the victims of those horrendous terrorist attacks.

So, too, our best wishes go to those grieving the murder of Charlie Kirk in the USA, and to our own great colleague, the hon. Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson), for the terrible news she has had this morning.

I thank the recently departed Leader of the House, the right hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell). She and I had our disagreements; I do not think there is much doubt about that. She supported the wrong football team, and I struggled to get her to answer my questions, but she was diligent and effective in responding to Members across the House, as well as in Committee. Without getting too teary about it, I will even miss her appalling puns.

But it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. Hurricane tax dodge blew away the Deputy Prime Minister and destroyed the Prime Minister’s much-vaunted phase two, but it has brought us the former Labour Chief Whip! He was a history teacher, and there cannot be many better forms of public service than that. After his distinguished career channelling industriously away in the usual channels, I warmly welcome him blinking into the bright lights of the Dispatch Box.

I had somehow thought that, having plumbed the depths of incompetence over the summer, the Government would now settle down a bit. How naïve—how desperately foolish—I was. The No. 10 team were obviously taking the mickey. They were laughing at us. “You think this is incompetent?”, they said, “We have hardly got going. We can do vastly better than that. Resets are for wimps—let’s have a full-blown crash reshuffle. Let’s have a new Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary, as well as a new Deputy Prime Minister. And let’s undermine the Chancellor of the Exchequer by ostentatiously lining up the former Chief Secretary to replace her. The markets will really welcome that. Even better—let’s have an election for deputy leader of the party. People are already scared to death about all the taxes coming in the Budget, but they will be completely reassured if we run a Labour leadership election at the same time. Ideally, we can make the deputy leader a former Cabinet Minister whom the Prime Minister has just abruptly fired. That’ll be good for stability. Oh, and we can go further! We can actively undermine relations with our closest ally if we throw in a major scandal over the Prime Minister’s personal choice as ambassador to the USA.”

If only this were a joke—instead, it is a tragedy. It is like we are trapped in an unending episode of “The Office”, with the Prime Minister as David Brent. The unions are ratcheting up their pay demands. The RMT is holding seven days of rolling walk-outs. The tube has come to a standstill. The only people who probably will not be affected are junior doctors in London, who have voted to have strikes until the new year, so they will be staying at home anyway. As the former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies remarked, it all shows how “staggeringly unprepared” Labour was for government, and it is we across this House and all our constituents who are paying the price for their arrogance and negligence.

The Leader of the House will only just be coming up to speed now, of course—one perfectly understands that—but, if I may, I would make one early request of him, with the utmost seriousness. He will know that many thousands of veterans, including hundreds in my constituency and in his, have had their lives thrown into uncertainty and bad—desperate, in some cases—anxiety by the Government’s decision to repeal the Northern Ireland veterans legislation, the Northern Ireland (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023. That was more than a year ago now. The Government promised a legally sound and effective legislative solution to the problem they had created, so could the Leader of the House let us know—now or in a written update before the recess—when the Northern Ireland Secretary will come to the House and publish that solution?

First, may I add my tribute to my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), for her excellent work as Leader of the House over the last year? She spearheaded the revival of the Modernisation Committee, which was a manifesto commitment, and oversaw the packed legislative programme that formed the basis of this Government’s first King’s Speech. I know that I am among many MPs across the House who want to thank her for her diligence and hard work.

I would also like to express my thanks to Colin Lee, the Clerk of Legislation, who retires this week, having joined the House service in 1988. MPs from across the House have valued his wise counsel over many years, and I know the whole House will wish him well.

I know that the House will also share my sadness about the death of Sir Roger Sands, who was Clerk of the House from 2003 to 2006. Sir Roger was a distinguished servant of the House for 41 years, and the House will want to convey our condolences to Lady Sands and Sir Roger’s family.

I thank the shadow Leader of the House for welcoming me to my place. Before I turn to his remarks, I should caution him, and indeed the House, that the last time I answered a question at the Dispatch Box was in the same year that the iPad was released. Both you and I, Mr Speaker, had a little more hair and of a darker hue. At the time the average price of a pint of beer was £2.91—there are people sat behind me who were not even old enough to buy alcohol then.

I am looking forward to these sessions with the shadow Leader of the House. We have been in the House together for a decade, but I cannot claim to know him particularly well, so I also went to Wikipedia to find out a bit more. He is a philosopher, a historian and an author of note. It is clear that he is a thinking Conservative, which is an increasingly rare commodity.

I associate myself with the right hon. Gentleman’s comments about the anniversary of 9/11, and about the death of Charlie Kirk. Let us remember that, in these circumstances, Mr Kirk’s family have been robbed of a father and a husband. There is no justification at all for political violence, whatever the views of the person involved.

I know that there will inevitably be a degree of knockabout about the state of the Government, and indeed of the Opposition, at business questions. I am happy, any day, to have a debate on the comparison between this Government’s 14 months and the right hon. Gentleman’s disastrous Government of 14 years. The only thing that we were unprepared for was the scale of the state that this country was in.

On the right hon. Gentleman’s substantive point about Northern Ireland, he knows that those are difficult matters and that the Government have given a commitment to bringing forward legislation. It is important that reassurances are in place, and I can tell him that the Government will be saying something shortly.

Let me finish with this. The shadow Leader of the House and I both have a deep respect for Parliament. I can give him and the House the reassurance that I take my responsibility, both as the Government’s representative in Parliament and as the House’s representative in Government, very seriously indeed.

Order. I expect this to run for around an hour, so Members can help each other with short and punchy questions. I call Elsie Blundell to set a good example.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his place. I applaud the Government for the bold action that they are taking to reform the criminal justice system, but more must be done to safeguard communities from violent reoffenders. In Middleton, I have been in touch with the courageous family of Michael Hoolickin. Michael was tragically killed in 2016 by a prolific offender who, despite supposedly being under the supervision of the local probation service, was not prevented from committing that appalling act, which has devastated the lives of Michael’s family and friends. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate in Government time so that Members may consider how to mitigate reoffending by violent perpetrators, and to give voice to the countless bereaved families out there, who deserve our compassion and focus?

That is without doubt an appalling tragedy, and my thoughts are with Michael’s family. It is important that we address reoffending—that is critical to public safety. On Tuesday we have the Second Reading of the Sentencing Bill. It aims to reduce offending, which has a devastating effect on victims. I encourage my hon. Friend to consider speaking in that debate.

I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.

I welcome the new Leader of the House to his place. I join him and the shadow Leader of the House in thank the previous Leader of the House, the right hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), for her sterling efforts, especially with so many people bobbing to ask questions every Thursday morning. I look forward to working with the Leader of the House in the various Committees on which we serve. I hope that he will follow the Government’s mantra to go further and faster, especially in modernisation.

Today is a big day for news. In particular, I echo the words condemning the appalling attack on the office of the hon. Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson)—[Hon. Members: “Hear, hear.”]—for whom I have a huge amount of respect.

I also join other colleagues in recognising that today is the 24th anniversary of 9/11. I am sure that the whole House agrees with the importance of remembering the victims, including British citizens, their families and those who continue to be affected physically and mentally by the attack and its aftermath.

This week, I again met victims and family members who have been subjected to ongoing injustice in our health system, in particular women and their children who were affected by shocking failures of medical devices or by the prescription of drugs that had devastating and life-changing consequences. While pregnant, my constituent Mary was prescribed the anti-epilepsy medication, sodium valproate. Very sadly, Mary joined so many other parents whose children were consequently born with significant birth defects. Like any parent of a disabled child, Mary is incredibly worried about their future and what support will be in place to look after them when she is no longer able to.

Victims and their families are exhausted. They have campaigned for many years to draw political attention to such matters, but it seems that successive Governments are not listening. Indeed, the Government have yet to respond to the Hughes report on the sodium valproate and pelvic mesh scandals that was published more than 18 months ago. Will the Leader of the House ask the Health Secretary to make a statement to this House to provide an update urgently?

I thank the hon. Lady for the tone of her question. I, too, look forward to working with her on the Commission and the Modernisation Committee. I commend her for campaigning on these important matters. Our sympathies are with those affected, and we are fully focused on how best to support patients and to prevent future harm. The Government will continue to listen to those affected in this complex area, and I will ensure that Ministers in the Department of Health and Social Care and in the Cabinet Office have heard her concerns. If my hon. Friend wishes to meet them, I will seek a meeting.

I had the pleasure of meeting Fergus, Freddie and Michael, members of the band Jam Tub, on a recent visit to Framwellgate school in Durham. These musicians are passionate about contributing to Durham’s cultural vibrancy, performing at events such as the much-loved Durham fringe festival. They contacted me after they noticed a distinct lack of venues across the whole of County Durham for young bands to perform and practice in, limiting their opportunities to grow as musicians. Will the Leader of the House agree to a debate in Government time on the importance of addressing regional cultural inequalities that are having an impact on the opportunities available to talented youngsters not just in Durham, but across the country?

As a Durham lad, I concur with my hon. Friend. It is a question not just of venues in Durham, but of venues across the country. The Government and, in particular, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are cognisant of that. We will be doing everything that we can to support them. Such issues affect a lot of constituencies. Therefore, should she choose to seek a Backbench Business debate or even an Adjournment debate, I am sure that she would receive support from across the House.

I call the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his position. I hope that we can have an early meeting to ensure that Back Benchers can have their voice heard in this Chamber, as before.

I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for 13 October, when we return from the conference recess. Given past experience of when we return from recesses, with the likelihood of statements and possibly urgent questions, and given that 78 people want to speak on the baby loss debate, I ask him to consider giving it protected time, so that they are able to relay their stories.

In addition, the business in Westminster Hall on Tuesday 16 September will be a debate on the International Day of Democracy. On 16 October, there will be a debate on World Menopause Day, followed by a debate on Ada Lovelace Day and Government support for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. On 23 October, there will be a debate on histological testing of excised moles, followed by a debate on the impact of NHS workforce levels on cancer patients.

I was very tempted to ask a question about the legalisation that happened in an employment tribunal earlier this week that means it is now possible to discriminate against people because of the football team they support. However, there is a much more serious issue: the situation in Nepal.

Following the deaths of 20 protesters, the Prime Minister of Nepal has resigned, the Parliament building has been set on fire and there is the threat of a military coup. I have many constituents with relatives in Nepal, and they are worried about the situation for their families. Will the Leader of the House arrange for a Foreign Office Minister to give a statement next week on what we are doing, as the United Kingdom, to protect those families and support the families in the United Kingdom?

I thank the hon. Gentleman for his work as Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, and I look forward to working with him. I will commit to an early meeting with him and also to regular meetings. He will know I have long taken the view that we need to take care on Mondays, whether it is with Backbench business or Government business, when we return from recess. I will give some thought to protected time, but the reality is that we can often manage the business of that day. The Government can manage the number of statements that go on; there is an issue around managing urgent questions, which is not the Government’s decision, but it nevertheless can be managed. I will return to that issue if need be.

On the really important matter of the situation in Nepal, let me say the recent loss of life and violence in Nepal is appalling. We support fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights, including the right to protest and peaceful assembly, but violence is not the way forward. I expect that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office will be across this matter, but I will draw his remarks to its attention.

School holidays are great, but they can be a really tough time for some families. Programmes such as the holiday activities and food programme help to bridge the gap by providing not only meals, but opportunities to build social skills and confidence with age-appropriate activities and a side serving of fun. This year I attended a HAF Plus event hosted by Northumbria University, at which young people aged 13 to 16 could do just that by taking part in activities from baking to gaming and martial arts, which were designed by young people themselves. I am delighted that the Government have invested to extend the scheme for another three years. Can we have a debate in Government time on how we can build on the success of HAF?

I am delighted to hear about the success of the programme; as an alumnus, I am not surprised that Northumbria University is helping to deliver such successful programmes. It is a fantastic thing for our region. We recently announced that £600 million is being invested to extend the holiday activities and food programme for another three years, and it has already reached more than half a million children in the past year. I will ensure that the Secretary of State has heard my hon. Friend’s question this morning.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his place and pay tribute to his predecessor, the right hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell)—I have to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) that she supports exactly the right football team.

People in Staffordshire Moorlands are very concerned that they should have their say about what happens in devolution plans. I am sure the Leader of the House will share my astonishment that the Reform-led Staffordshire county council has put forward a proposal for an east Staffordshire unitary authority, which would see not just Staffordshire Moorlands, but Burton, Uttoxeter, Tamworth and Lichfield drawn into a greater Stoke-on-Trent. Can the Leader of the House find time for a debate on the importance of local people having their own say on what happens in their local area?

I have to say to the right hon. Member—I was going to say my right hon. Friend, which she is in many ways—that I do not share her astonishment about that at all, because that is not unique in places where Reform has councillors and is running councils. Nevertheless, it is an absolute shame that Reform councillors appear to have gone back on their word in this case. One of the themes that must run through the work we do in local government is listening to local people. I have no doubt that she will continue to make that case, and I urge her to do so by organising a debate on the matter.

The Sikh Helpline is a fantastic charity in my constituency that supports Sikhs and people from all backgrounds with abuse, addiction and mental health issues. Over the summer, it did a 350-mile bike ride from Scotland to West Brom to raise money. Will the Leader of the House congratulate all the riders who took part and make time for a debate on the importance of such civil society organisations?

I first want to recognise the fantastic work that my hon. Friend did as my predecessor’s Parliamentary Private Secretary. I thank her for what I assume, therefore, is her first business question. A 350-mile bike ride is a terrific achievement, and I join her in recognising the importance of the work that the Sikh Helpline does for its local community. That is the sort of matter that could perhaps be raised in an Adjournment debate.

I too welcome the new Leader of the House to his position. I suspect he will have rather more fun at the Dispatch Box than his successor in the Government Whips Office will. I associate myself with his kind remarks about Colin Lee, whose service as one of the Clerks of the House has been exemplary. As one of the longest-serving members of the Speaker’s Panel of Chairs, I have had the pleasure of working with Colin over very many years. He will be sorely missed, and the House owes him a huge debt of gratitude.

Charities in the United Kingdom working in Africa tell me that as a result of the withdrawal of the United States Agency for International Development, women and children are dying in droves. The House will not be sitting when President Trump visits the United Kingdom, so we will not have an opportunity to send a clear message from this House at that time, but the Prime Minister will have an opportunity. Will the Leader of the House ask the Prime Minister to place on the agenda for discussion in the margins the withdrawal of USAID from Africa, which is having such a devastating effect?

I will commit to making the Prime Minister aware of what the right hon. Gentleman has asked, and I hope that will be heard when the President visits. Given the right hon. Gentleman’s experience and voice, I am pretty sure that message will be heard loud and clear.

One of the concerns that my constituents in Lowestoft raise is the closure of our public toilets due to the local council’s redevelopment of our old Wilko site. I am concerned that older and disabled residents in particular are being dissuaded from spending their time and money in our town centre’s shops due to fear of being caught short. I recently met the British Toilet Association, and I learned that in the US there is a national standard of one toilet for every 10,000 people. I therefore ask the Leader of the House whether we can have a debate in Government time on the need for more toilets on our high streets.

I could not agree more about the importance of the availability of toilets in our town centres. I am sure that issue comes to MPs’ attention very often. For many people—particularly those with complex needs or health conditions—the lack of a toilet can be the deciding factor in whether they leave the house. As the issue is clearly one for so many colleagues across the House, I think it would be a great topic for a Westminster Hall debate.

I too welcome the Leader of the House to his place.

Just three days ago, the BBC revealed how effortlessly an illegal vape laced with Spice can be purchased through Snapchat. One in six confiscated vapes in schools now contains Spice, which is described as a zombie drug—a prison drug. That is potentially condemning young people to a lifelong addiction and a criminal life, yet this week Ofcom wrote that such evidence does not meet the bar for enforcement action, even under the new Online Safety Act 2023. Can we have a statement from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to explain why Ofcom is refusing to hold social media companies accountable for drug dealing on their platforms, which puts thousands of young people at risk?

As a former drugs Minister, I absolutely share the hon. Lady’s concern. I have always thought that a strong line should be taken, and of course social media plays a role in that. I thank her for raising that really important issue, which is important for many people, not least parents. I will draw her concerns to the attention of the new Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary.

Our high streets in Leigh and Atherton are being undermined by illicit shops that are used for money laundering, illegal working and counterfeit goods. Raids on shops have taken place this week, leading to the seizure of over £10,000-worth of illicit goods, but the shops reopen within hours. Criminals are exploiting loopholes in the Licensing Act 2003, and councils are struggling to act. Will the Leader of the House confirm that restoring town centres is a Government priority, and will he allow time in Parliament to debate strengthening licensing laws and closing these damaging loopholes?

I congratulate my hon. Friend on her recent marriage. She raises a very important matter, and she is a doughty campaigner for her local community. High streets are a cornerstone of our local communities, and we are delivering 13,000 more officers in neighbourhood policing roles to tackle these matters. I will draw her comments to the attention of the relevant Department, but I encourage her to attend the next Home Office questions next week in order to raise this issue with Ministers directly.

I welcome the right hon. Gentleman to his new role.

May I echo the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Marie Goldman) in drawing his attention to the reply that his predecessor gave to me on 27 February concerning the Government’s response to the report on valproate? It really is necessary that we get a response. Janet Williams and Emma Murphy from the Independent Foetal Anti-Convulsant Trust came to see me this week. They are grateful for the opportunity to meet a Minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, but they really need a formal response to the commissioner’s report of 19 months ago.

The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I am new to this role, but I give him a commitment that I will follow that up after this session. Hopefully, I will be able to arrange a meeting with the Minister and get a response, which sounds overdue.

I have been supporting constituents living in ex-military housing on Embry Road in Wittering, in my constituency. The Ministry of Defence sold the homes years ago, but my constituents have been left in limbo because their properties remain wrongly classified under MOD commercial energy contracts. Despite repeated attempts, many have been unable to set up domestic accounts and are now suddenly facing backdated gas and electricity bills of up to £6,000. Does the Leader of the House agree that the issue of billing errors deserves a debate in Parliament? Will he ensure that Ministry of Defence officials contact me so that we can get those homes reclassified, which would allow my constituents to access fair tariffs and avoid further financial distress?

I thank my hon. Friend for raising that issue, and recognise that his constituents who have been affected will have gone through a great deal of stress in trying to deal with it. I will ask colleagues in the Ministry of Defence to reach out to him, in the hope that these matters can be resolved as soon as possible.

May I, too, welcome the new Leader of the House to his place?

The Trussell Trust’s “Hunger in Wales” report, which was published this week, shows that families with three or more children are far more likely to be forced to turn to food banks. The two-child limit is at the root of this injustice. It deliberately punishes children because of the number of brothers and sisters they have, and it is driving thousands of families into needless hardship. Will Labour in Westminster and Labour in Cardiff work together to grant debates in Government time on the urgent need for this impoverishing policy to be scrapped?

The right hon. Lady knows that we are already taking action to help working parents. For example, free breakfast clubs will put £450 in the pockets of working parents. We have doubled the amount of free childcare for eligible working parents, we are expanding free school meals and we are extending the household support fund. I mentioned earlier in my remarks the holiday activities and food programmes. We are doing a great deal.

I know that there are discussions and debates about what other action can be taken. The Government have a child poverty taskforce, which reports from time to time and will be reporting soon, regardless of whether it has something to say about this issue. I have no doubt that these will be hot topics in the run-up to the Budget, and there will be ample time to debate them.

I welcome my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House to his place.

I recently had the privilege of visiting Lambley reed pond. Will my right hon. Friend join me in thanking and paying tribute to Bonnie Bramwell and all those on the Lambley reed pond committee, who have worked tirelessly to protect and enhance one of the most beautiful hidden gems in my constituency?

Yes, I will. Environmental matters are so important in constituencies, and the work of community groups is so important, because they are the heart of what makes a true community. I pay tribute not just to that group, but to my hon. Friend for his tireless work on their behalf.

Two nights ago, a man in his 30s was stabbed in the centre of Bognor Regis, and that follows a fatal stabbing earlier this year. Will the Government bring forward a debate to consider how to make high streets safer and tackle the increasing prevalence of knife crime in small seaside towns such as Bognor Regis?

We are taking action to tackle knife crime. In fact, we have given a commitment to halve it over the next decade and, I hope, go even further. The hon. Member said two things that are particularly relevant to me. One is that, as a former Home Office Minister, I am acutely aware of the importance of levels of knife crime. The other is that, as an MP for a seaside town, I know how important it is that they are safe places not just for people to visit, but for people to live. The Government are absolutely determined to bear down on violent knife crime, and I am sure there will be opportunities to discuss that in future legislation or should she choose to seek a debate on the matter.

Many right hon. and hon. Members will know the name Armitage Shanks as the company that has been making basins and toilets for over 200 years. However, fewer people will know that it takes its name from the village of Armitage in my constituency. Sadly, Armitage Shanks is planning to scale down its operation there, shutting one of its kilns and threatening up to 100 jobs. I am working closely with the GMB union to make sure that those affected can find other opportunities and to safeguard as many livelihoods as we can, but the impact of those job losses on the community will be serious. Can the Leader of the House arrange for a debate in Government time on how the Government can help protect historic brands such as Armitage Shanks?

The news of job losses that my hon. Friend brings to the House is disappointing. It is always disappointing when jobs are lost, and I know the whole House will share his concern, particularly as it is a well-known name employing a large number of people. We are committed to supporting British industry, and Armitage Shanks is a name well known throughout the land. The Chancellor has announced the date of the next Budget, which will turn to the long-term reforms that Britain needs to unlock growth and ensure that the economy works for working people. I will of course bring forward time for a debate following the Budget in the usual way.

This is a truly sad and tragic day for our friends in the United States of America as they remember the events of 9/11 in 2001, and given the tragic assassination last night of Charlie Kirk. I was privileged to welcome him to the Houses of Parliament in 2018 and take him to Speaker’s House for a Christmas reception. He was a friend of the United Kingdom, he stood up for freedom and his Christian faith, and we mourn his loss and send our condolences to his family and friends.

Talking about someone of principle who stands up for freedom, 13 October—the day the House returns after the conference recess—will be the 100th anniversary of the birth of our finest post-war Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate on the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, which was to restore the British economy, stand up for Britain around the world, defend freedom and not give away British islands but protect, defend and restore them, as she did for the Falkland Islands in 1982?

I echo the remarks I made earlier about Charlie Kirk. Whether we shared views or not, political violence is never acceptable.

Should the hon. Member wish to seek a debate on the anniversary of Mrs Thatcher’s birth, I can assure him that it would be well attended. I can also assure him that there would not be the unanimous approval of her legacy and record that he perhaps thinks there would be. I come from a community that was devastated by the loss of heavy industry, and to be honest, many of those communities are still suffering. The difference between those days and today is that when there is industrial change, this Government stand with working people to lessen the impact and ensure that new growth brings new jobs.

I think I am the only MP who can say they have two amazing football stadiums and two majestic cathedrals in their constituency. Liverpool Riverside is in the top 10 areas nationally for jobs, economic income and economic value. However, the hospitality sector is still struggling to recover from covid and the rise in national insurance contributions. Will the Leader of the House allow for a debate in Government time to discuss how we can bring the UK closer to EU competitors by reducing VAT and providing the maximum discount for hospitality sites with a rateable value of under £500,000, to stimulate demand, boost competitiveness and keep venues open?

My hon. Friend is a doughty campaigner not just for her constituency, but for her city. The Government are always concerned about the state of hospitality and making sure that we encourage investment in hospitality, which is at the centre of many of our constituencies, not least mine. We must ensure that there is not just decent pay and conditions, but respect for the people who work in the sector. I gently say to my hon. Friend that I know the importance of getting the tax situation right, but we need to raise national insurance contributions in order to fill a financial hole. These were not easy decisions, but they were made, and people cannot have it both ways—they cannot have more spending on public services or hospitality support unless we actually raise the money in the first place.

I would like to request a debate on rural broadband and rural 4G. Broadband coverage in much of Devon is poor, in spite of the last Government saying that they would spend £5 billion on it. These 4G notspots are widespread, but the Government scheme to get rid of them bears absolutely no relation to the broadband scheme. Will this Government please get a map of those areas without proper broadband, plot the 4G notspots on it and at least get everyone I represent one or the other?

I will draw these issues to the attention of the relevant Department, but we are investing £500 million this year to deliver Project Gigabit and the shared rural network, to drive the roll-out of digital infrastructure in parts of the UK that are currently underserved. That will improve full nationwide connectivity by 2030, with more than £2.3 billion of contracts signed to connect over 1 million homes in some of Britain’s most remote locations.

I welcome the new Leader of the House to his place and thank him for all the help and support he gave those of us who were newly elected to this place 12 months ago in his previous role.

Last Friday, Cumbria’s first community county flag was unveiled at a special service at Carlisle cathedral. Cumbria county flag is the result of a county-wide competition and public vote, won by Cumbrian artist Ben Walker and presented to the lord lieutenant by the 1st Wetheral Brownies. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Mr Walker on his excellent design and thank Cumbria’s lord lieutenant for organising such a fantastic initiative that celebrates community cohesion and pride?

I am happy to send my congratulations to Mr Walker and the lord lieutenant. We are proud of our flags, both national and regional. I know that Mr Speaker likes to mark historic county days by flying flags from Parliament’s flagpoles, so we may see Cumbria’s new community flag flying in Parliament Square in the future.

May I ask the new Leader of the House for some help? I have been working with the Hinckley school to try and get its science and technology building project sorted. That has been going on for a couple of years and we are at a crucial point with contractors. With the reshuffle, the Minister in charge of that portfolio has been moved on, and we are therefore in a pending position. I have already sent the information to the Leader of the House and I would be grateful if he would contact the Department for Education on my behalf to put pressure on to ensure that we get a decision made on this, so that the development can get started before the winter sets in.

I know that the hon. Gentleman has raised this issue with Ministers before, and I also understand that officials from the Department for Education reached out to discuss the matter on Monday. I pay tribute to him for campaigning on the matter as an assiduous constituency MP on behalf of children, predominantly, but also parents and staff of the school. He will appreciate, as he has acknowledged, that new Ministers are in post after the reshuffle, and there is indeed a new Minister in this role. I will ensure that this is raised with the Minister at the earliest opportunity, in the hope that the hon. Gentleman gets the earliest response possible.

I warmly welcome the Leader of the House to his new role and associate myself with the support across the House for my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson). Members have raised many times the unacceptable level of threats that we face. Increasingly, abuse and threats are being driven and whipped up by one platform in particular, X, previously known as Twitter, which has become a sewer of antisemitism, racism, misogyny and dangerous conspiracy theories. Its owner has specifically targeted Members of this House. With a new director of communications in No. 10 and a refreshed Front Bench, may we have a debate in Government time on whether it is appropriate for that platform to continue to be used for official Government communications?

What my hon. Friend says about X is truly shocking. We are very much in favour of free speech, but we are also against incitement to violence. We have delivered the Online Safety Act 2025 to seek to strike the balance between user protection and freedom of speech. On the matter of the Government’s use of X, it is right that the public are kept up to date with information and a number of people still use X, although of course many are moving to other platforms. I am sure that the Government will take that into account in our deliberations in future, and we also keep our wider social media practices under review.

My new political movement, Restore Britain, is currently running a membership poll on support for deporting all illegal migrants. The response, from thousands of people, is almost unanimously in favour. Will the Leader of the House make time for a debate on mass deportations, given the extraordinary level of public support, and ensure that the House has the opportunity to debate not just the moral imperative but the legal and operational reforms required, including secure detention facilities, bilateral returns agreements, foreign aid suspensions, remittance taxes, visa cancellations, the introduction of a true hostile environment and plenty more, in order to deliver the mass deportation of every last illegal migrant at scale and pace?

I am tempted to give the answer that one of my predecessors, Ted Short, gave, which is to say, “No”. However, I will not do that because these are important matters. I made it very clear in my opening remarks that I regard my role in this House as respecting the views of Members and making opportunities for Members to debate those, even if they are—I have to say—abhorrent. The hon. Gentleman has been here long enough to know that there are many ways in which these matters can be raised—he has just done so now. I am resisting the temptation to recite the very important work that the Government are doing, but if he seeks a debate on these matters in the usual way, perhaps he will be successful.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his new role and hope to see him being as generous with Government time as he was with his own time in his previous role. As he knows well, this month our country will celebrate 200 years since the world’s first passenger railway journey took place on the Stockton to Darlington railway. This momentous innovation changed the world and led to a huge industrial boom for our region. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers have been employed in manufacturing and engineering roles over the past 200 years, but those jobs have declined recently due to the last Government’s neglect of British industry and manufacturing. Given how vital the ambitions of our region are for the industrial strategy, will he grant Government time to debate how this Government will back British workers, back British industry and get our region booming again?

I commend my hon. Friend for the way she speaks for her constituency. It is important that we remember the 200th anniversary of the Stockton to Darlington railway, as it allows those of us from the north-east to claim that we are the cradle of the industrial revolution. As she alluded to, these things change over time. The Government are absolutely committed to bringing growth to every part of our country, including our north-east. That means working through our elected mayors as well as making sure that the skills we have in those engineering industries are kept—even though they are changing skills—and reskilling takes place. We must also have the support in place for companies who seek to invest in our region.

Order. About 20 Members are still on their feet and I am aiming to finish questions to the Leader of the House at 1 o’clock, so please keep your questions very brief.

I welcome the new Leader of the House to his place. Grave breaches of international humanitarian law continue in Gaza, including the unlawful blockade of aid and illegal settlements. According to an aid worker I met recently, sanitary products are being withheld from women and girls. Meanwhile, our Prime Minister rolls out the red carpet for the Israeli President, a man who has said on the record that the entire Palestinian nation is responsible for the 7 October attacks. Will the Leader of the House please commit to a debate in Government time on the UK’s duty to ensure that international law is always upheld and on how we must work with law-abiding international partners to guarantee that carries real weight on the world stage?

The Government have been clear in their condemnation of many of the things that have been happening over the last time in Gaza. They have made it clear that it is important that aid gets into the area and that we move towards a ceasefire to resolve this. But when the hon. Member talks about whom we might talk to about that, I say gently that most conflicts end with some kind of diplomacy, and that requires people to talk to each other, even though they may not agree. That allows the UK Government and the Prime Minister to put views across, which is really important. International law is at the heart of everything that the Government seek to do. As for an opportunity to raise that, there have been many statements and debates in this place about this important matter, and my intention is that that will continue.

I have enjoyed many Bournemouth air festivals, so its cancellation has left a huge gap. I recently met an event organiser who has a plan, and I am open to meeting more organisers. The BH Area Hospitality Association, under the leadership of Rosie Radwell, has launched “Check In – Chill Out”, which is a campaign to showcase how great Bournemouth is. Does the Leader of the House agree in the strongest possible terms that Bournemouth is the best seaside town? Will he congratulate the campaign? Will he grant a debate on tourism, particularly for coastal and seaside towns?

I very much congratulate Bournemouth on how it is promoting its town, as well as my hon. Friend on how he is promoting it. I have to say he is stretching it a bit by asking me to say it is the best seaside town since I have Whitley Bay in my constituency, but it should not be a competition. What we need to do is promote seaside and coastal towns. They are fantastic places to live and to visit.

Last weekend, I met residents of New Park, alongside local Liberal Democrat councillor, Monika Slater. Residents are frustrated about the new Tesco that has been built and its impact on local businesses, with contractors regularly flouting the planning rules to work outside permitted hours. Will the Leader of the House allow for a debate in Government time on local authority enforcement powers and, perhaps, how we can get Tory-run North Yorkshire council to use them?

I am not sure of the detail of this case, but it is not unfamiliar to many of us to see the stress that big developments sometimes cause to residents. Again, this is the sort of thing the hon. Gentleman should seek an Adjournment debate on.

I recently had the pleasure of attending this year’s switch-on of the iconic Blackpool illuminations, lighting up our promenade and attracting millions and millions of visitors each year since 1879. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Kate Shane, Richard Williams and all the people at Visit Blackpool, Blackpool council and Lightworks for delivering such an impressive event this year, and join me in encouraging more people, far and wide, to join us in Blackpool for the illuminations this year?

I absolutely join my hon. Friend in congratulating Kate Shane and everyone at Visit Blackpool on their hard work. I also congratulate him, because he is a champion not just for Blackpool’s cause, but for seaside and coastal towns in general. I have very fond memories of holidays in Blackpool—I have to say some time ago—and trips to see the illuminations. From the illuminations, the tower, the piers and the Pleasure Beach, my hon. Friend’s constituency really has something for everyone. I encourage people to visit the illuminations, not least because they ensure the town has attractions all year round and it is not just seasonal—that is very important.

One of my constituents has raised their concerns with me about the SEEMiS software used in the Scottish school system and the ability of staff to alter cases with no record of changes being made. Transparency in our public bodies is vital to the public trusting both our institutions and us. In these times when public trust in bodies is so low, will the Leader of the House grant time for a debate on upholding the Nolan principles across all public bodies, so that taxpayers can have confidence that decisions are made with integrity and transparency?

Again, I have to admit that I am not across this issue. We would be very supportive on the general principle of transparency. As I am not sure where responsibility lies for such decisions, I suggest that the hon. Lady writes to me, and she might seek a debate on the issue.

I am aware that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, are a strong champion of animal welfare, so you might be pleased to know that tomorrow, for the end of our lido season, is a “bring your dogs to come and swim” day. You might also be pleased, alongside the Leader of the House, to know that this year over 37,000 people have visited Peterborough lido since it opened its doors in May. That is an incredible turnaround since we faced the risk of it closing earlier this year. I pay tribute to Clare Marshall, the Friends of the Lido and the staff of the lido for that amazing work. We can now look forward to the Year of the Lido in 2026, as the lido celebrates its 90th anniversary. I am not ambitious enough to invite the Leader of the House to come for a swim with me in the lido, but will he join me in congratulating everyone who supports our lido in Peterborough, and may we have a debate in Government time about the vital role that lidos play in so many of our communities?

I am not sure that would be a particularly attractive sight, I have to say, because my memory suggests that my costume has a hole in the knee. [Laughter.] But I do want to join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to Clare Marshall, the Friends of Peterborough Lido and of course its staff. A number of MPs have similar concerns—particularly seaside and coastal MPs, but also in other places around the country—and this is exactly the sort of topic that would be good for a Westminster Hall debate or a Backbench Business debate. I urge him to apply.

I welcome the right hon. Member to his new role. There is less pressure as Leader of the House in contrast to the onerous duties of Chief Whip. He referred to the colour of his hair, but he still has his hair whereas mine has been disappearing for many years.

Concerning reports have emerged that the Indian Government are increasing efforts to forcibly return Rohingya refugees to Burma, following the deportation of 40 individuals in May. Rohingya refugees face the risk of severe human rights violations and persecution upon their return. Given the UK’s longstanding obligation to the principle of non-refoulement and the special relationship with India, will the Leader of the House urge the Foreign Secretary to provide a statement outlining what action the Government will take to address this deeply concerning development and to ensure that the rights and safety of Rohingya refugees remain a priority?

Perhaps this job is less pressured than my last one, but I confess that this morning it did not feel that way. As ever, the hon. Gentleman raises a very serious issue. This Government are committed to defending human rights abuses, and regularly engage with the Government of India on a range of human rights matters. I will ensure that the Foreign Office has heard the concerns he raises, and I am sure that at the next Foreign Office questions he will also seek to raise the matter.

While I will not be able to get everybody in, I will get more in if Members can keep their questions to about two sentences. To provide a good example, I call Matt Rodda.

Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker—no pressure. Earlier this week, I was notified that Southern Gas Networks wants to dig up a major road in Reading for 18 weeks. This is the latest in a series of sudden and abrupt interventions by utility companies. Can we have a debate in Government time on the behaviour of utility companies and how better to regulate their activities digging up roads?

Again, these are issues that affect constituents across the country. I am sure that if my hon. Friend sought a debate on these matters, either in Westminster Hall or a Backbench Business debate, he would find that it was well attended.

Sadly, last week in my constituency there was yet more flooding. This follows on from a very dry period and the hottest summer on record. Clearly, the weather is changing. Would the Leader of the House consider bringing forward a debate on building resilience to more extreme weather events, as he makes the political weather?

My hon. Friend raises an important matter. I am sure there will be a lot of people across the country, particularly those who were hardest hit by the very fine and dry weather, concerned about what might happen going forward, in both the short and long term. Our flood resilience taskforce is focused on the long-term delivery of our flood resilience strategy and investment. Should she seek a debate, it would allow Ministers to set out our plans.

In recent days I have been contacted by many residents concerned about increasing hate crime, racist graffiti, vandalism and even violence against police at protests. Will the Leader of the House join with me in the view that there is no place for hate in Hillingdon or anywhere in the UK, that our diversity is our strength, and that those coming to our community to work in our hospitals, in social care and to set up businesses are very welcome? Will he also make time in this place for a debate about a national cohesion strategy, and local strategies to follow?

I absolutely join with my hon. Friend in his remarks. I am proud to say that this country is overwhelmingly inclusive, but it would be wrong to say that we do not face challenges in some communities. The Government are committed to developing a longer-term, more strategic approach to social cohesion. Housing, Communities and Local Government questions will take place once we return from recess. The subject would also make a timely Westminster Hall debate.

The women’s rugby world cup is providing a fantastic sporting showcase, including the seven matches hosted by Sandy Park in Exeter to sell-out crowds. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating the organisers, including the staff at Exeter city council and the teams for an excellent tournament so far, and send the best of luck from this place to all the home nation teams as they enter the knock- out stages this weekend?

With record-breaking crowds at the rugby world cup and tens of thousands of fans packing out the Mall for the Lionesses’ victory parade after their amazing success in the Euros, we are showing ourselves to be true world leaders in women’s sport. I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the organisers, but also in wishing success for the home nations. As he knows, there is a game this weekend between England and Scotland —both home nations—so it is a case of which side to pick.

This week, 6 Towns Radio, a community radio station broadcasting to the six towns of Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme celebrates its 15th birthday. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Dan Townley, Terry Bossons and all the volunteers at 6 Towns Radio as it celebrates its milestone? Does he agree that community radio has played, and will continue to play, an important role in connecting our communities?

I certainly join my hon. Friend in congratulating 6 Towns Radio on its 15th anniversary and community radio right across our country. The Government recognise the importance of community radio and continue to support the sector as part of a diverse media landscape. He may wish to go further than just seeking congratulations for what is happening in his area and consider a Backbench Business debate on the matter, because I am sure that many colleagues would wish to speak in such a debate about their own community radio stations.

Last Saturday, the Linlithgow Union Canal Society celebrated its 50th anniversary with a flotilla from Winchburgh to Linlithgow, marking five decades of volunteer-led preservation and promotion of Scotland’s inland waterways. Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating the society and its volunteers on that milestone and wish them all the very best for the next 50 years?

I do not have any canals in my constituency for pretty obvious reasons, but I love them and I think they are fantastic. Local waterways are so important; they do not just link communities but bring them together. I am pleased to offer my congratulations and again point to the fact that community organisations are the absolute backbone of our constituencies and I wish them well going forward.

I congratulate Cornwall on being in wave one of the Government’s innovative roll-out of the neighbourhood health services. We are one of 43 areas making that shift and we have provided services locally, such as community health and wellbeing workers, which have been very well received and which make a difference. May we have a debate in Government time on that shift to community care, with the recognition that urgent and emergency care is an area where Cornwall, like others, has struggled, so alternative services should always be in place as we make that switch?

My hon. Friend will know that the NHS is one of our priorities. She will also know that we are beginning to invest more and to turn the NHS round, but that it is a considerable challenge given the state that we found it in 15 months ago. I urge her to seek a debate on these matters, so that local communities can raise their own specific concerns, which are real and tangible. The Government have very optimistic plans for what can happen with regard to services. It is important that people are treated close to home and indeed, in some cases, at home. That is a considerable challenge, but it is one that we intend to meet.

I welcome the Leader of the House to his place. Last weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the 100-year anniversary of the Midland Red Coalville bus garage, which showcased some fantastic buses through history for people to enjoy. Will the Leader of the House join me in thanking Leicester Transport Heritage Trust, the vehicle owners, Coalville Heritage Society, Snibston Heritage Trust and the district and local councils for their hard work in showcasing their buses and putting on this amazing event? Will he also recognise the work of local volunteers and their contribution to our local communities?

As yesterday’s debate highlighted, the whole House cares deeply about bus services and their role in our local communities. This sounds like a fantastic event to celebrate an impressive anniversary and a great deal of hard work to organise it. I am happy to pay tribute to everyone concerned and delighted to hear about the event’s success. It might have been for the anniversary of the Midland Red Coalville bus garage, but it is about celebrating buses and volunteers as well.

The forced adoption scandal has outraged people in Newcastle-under-Lyme, and up and down the country. This week I heard from Karen Constantine, who gave birth aged 15 in the late 1970s. She was forced out of education in north Staffordshire and into a mother and baby home in Birmingham, and was pushed to give up her child. Although she did not give up her child and fought really hard against others who tried to force who to, other women were not so fortunate. Will the Leader of the House join me in calling on local authorities to preserve and protect all adoption records, so that mothers are able to get the justice they deserve and find their children? Can I also urge him to do all he can to get a formal apology from the Dispatch Box to those women, who so desperately deserve justice?

I thank my hon. Friend for raising this matter and for raising Karen’s case. As he points out, others were less fortunate than Karen. However, these are remarkably distressing and life-changing situations. Such abhorrent practices should never have taken place, and our deepest sympathies are with those affected. We take these matters extremely seriously and continue to engage with those impacted to provide support. We are also improving access to adoption records, including by asking adoption agencies to preserve records for at least 100 years, and I will ensure that the Education Secretary hears about my hon. Friend’s concerns.

That concludes business questions. I thank the Leader of the House for his time.",https://hansard.parliament.uk/dist/opengraph-card.png,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:16.780790

Terms such as ‘carbon neutral’, ‘deforestation free’ and ‘aligned with net zero’ became widespread in corporate messaging, frequently without rigorous or transparent substantiation. In recent years, however, courts and regulators have begun to treat such language as factual representation—claims that must be verifiable, accurate and intelligible to non-expert audiences. This shift is reflected in a growing number of legal disputes and in prominent rulings across sectors such as aviation, finance, and consumer goods. In this environment, climate-washing—misleading or exaggerated communication regarding climate-related impacts, commitments, or mitigation efforts—has emerged as a distinct and rapidly expanding strand of litigation, which gathered pace in 2024 and has continued into 2025.

From Greenwashing to Climate-Washing

Greenwashing refers to communications that mislead the public into believing an organization’s environmental performance is better than it is. The UN Secretary-General has called for ‘zero tolerance’ of greenwashing, and his High-Level Expert Group has urged drawing a ‘red line’ around it, warning that misleading net-zero claims undermine credible climate action. Climate-washing is best understood as climate-related greenwashing, typically involving unsupported or overstated claims about emissions reductions, carbon-neutral products (often via offsetting), or alignment with net-zero goals. It covers communications that create a false impression of an organization’s contribution to climate-change mitigation—by inflating benefits, omitting known risks, or presenting isolated initiatives as overall performance. The concept applies to both companies and public entities.

Common climate-washing risks include advertising or messaging likely to mislead consumers or investors; deceptive ESG certifications, ratings, or audit statements; and false or inflated claims about carbon credits. Existing consumer-protection and advertising rules provide a legal basis to challenge such claims. In parallel, emerging due-diligence and reporting obligations—such as mandatory human-rights and environmental due-diligence laws—could also be used to address misleading climate-related messaging across supply chains. In some investor-facing contexts, securities law may apply.

The Rise of Climate-Washing Litigation

Across jurisdictions, courts ask what overall impression the climate-related communication, taken as a whole, conveys and whether the evidence substantiates it. They also consider whether the claim is likely to influence purchasing or investment decisions. This approach has pulled once-aspirational language into the realm of enforceable fact. In March 2024, the Amsterdam District Court held that parts of KLM’s ‘Fly Responsibly’ campaign were misleading because the advertisements suggested that offsets and alternative fuels could make flying ‘sustainable’, overstating their environmental benefits and not providing clear, specific context on their limitations. The same logic shaped UK enforcement in August 2024, when the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that a Virgin Atlantic radio ad describing a flight as powered by ‘100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel’ was misleading. The unqualified claim was likely to lead listeners to overestimate the environmental benefits and omitted essential information on lifecycle emissions and their limits. The regulator required clear qualifying information in future ads. In June 2024, Germany’s Federal Court of Justice clarified that ‘climate-neutral’ claims trigger strict transparency duties: it must be immediately apparent whether ‘neutrality’ is achieved through actual reductions or by compensation (offsetting).

‘This approach has pulled once-aspirational language into the realm of enforceable fact’

The scrutiny extends beyond consumer advertising. In March 2024, Australia’s Federal Court—following Vanguard Investments’ admissions—found that representations about an ‘ethically conscious’ bond index were misleading because the screening methodology did not match the product description. The court imposed an aggregate A$12.9 million penalty alongside an adverse publicity order. Taken together, these developments show how climate-washing arises across three recurring channels—corporate pledges, product attributes, and investor disclosures—and how each is increasingly actionable when the headline promise outruns the underlying method and evidence.

The Numbers Behind the Shift

The Grantham Institute’s 2025 Climate Litigation Snapshot covering 2024 trends shows a maturing field. By the end of 2024, the global dataset reached 2,967 climate-related cases, with 226 filings recorded for 2024. About one in five of the cases filed in 2024 targeted companies or their directors and officers, underscoring rising corporate exposure.

Overall climate litigation remains most concentrated in the United States, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Germany. In this context, climate-washing has become a prominent corporate-facing claim type: 25 new climate-washing cases were identified in 2024, bringing the post-2015 total to just over 160. Of the more than 100 climate-washing cases decided by the end of 2024, over 60 per cent were classified as successful for claimants. Advertising and product-labelling claims feature prominently, while newer filings increasingly probe omissions in climate-risk disclosures and the integrity of carbon-credit projects and offsetting claims.

Stricter Rules for Environmental Marketing

The European legislation is reshaping the standards for climate-related communication. Directive (EU) 2024/825 on Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition raises the baseline for environmental marketing across the EU: it prohibits vague or misleading claims that cannot be substantiated with verifiable evidence understandable to the average consumer, and it bans claims that a product has a neutral (i.e., ‘carbon neutral’), reduced, or positive impact on the environment in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions where that claim is based on offsetting. Member States must implement the Directive by 27 March 2026. The rules apply from 27 September 2026.

‘The European legislation is reshaping the standards for climate-related communication’

By contrast, the proposed Green Claims Directive—intended to harmonize how explicit environmental claims are substantiated—stalled in June 2025 after the European Commission signalled an intention to withdraw the proposal unless revised, and a scheduled trilogue was cancelled. For now, the proposal remains in limbo. The result is a more decentralized but steadily stricter enforcement landscape, with national consumer-protection and advertising authorities already applying higher standards in practice.

Toward Credible Climate Communication

Climate-washing litigation continues to raise legitimate questions about its long-term impact on corporate behaviour and climate governance. While courts increasingly strike down misleading climate claims, some warn of a counter-effect: greenhushing, in which firms reduce or obscure climate communications to minimize legal risk. Yet recent evidence suggests this caution often reflects gaps in delivery rather than prudence. A 2025 study of more than 1,000 companies with voluntary 2020 emissions targets found that only about 61 per cent met them, while many stopped reporting progress. Likewise, a 2024 study by MIT, Columbia Business School and the European Central Bank found no meaningful difference in tangible climate actions between financial institutions with net-zero pledges and those without.

These findings strengthen the case for closer scrutiny. Courts are not merely criticizing vague language; they are ordering withdrawals, corrective statements, and, in some cases, injunctions—outcomes that carry through to insurance, lending, and credit ratings. With regulators in the EU, UK, US, and beyond tightening expectations, companies face growing pressure to align messaging with verifiable performance. None of this argues for silence. It argues for credibility: clear scope, stated baselines and timeframes, and accessible summaries of methods, assumptions, and limitations, so that a lay reader can follow the reasoning and a specialist can test it. Organizations that move from ambition-led narratives to evidence-based communication will reduce dispute risk—and build more durable trust among consumers, investors, and the wider public.",https://www.hungarianconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFP__20230607__f0377194__v1__HighRes__GreenwashingConceptualCompositeImage-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 11:56:49.480477

This may involve drying, grinding, and sometimes pelletizing the biomass to facilitate efficient gasification.

Process: The prepared biomass is fed into a gasifier, where it is subjected to high temperatures (700-1500°C) in a controlled environment with limited oxygen.

Reaction: Under these conditions, the biomass undergoes thermochemical conversion into a synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture primarily composed of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H₂), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and small amounts of methane (CH₄) and other gases.

Syngas Composition: The syngas composition can be adjusted by varying the gasification conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the amount of oxygen or steam.

Process: The raw syngas produced from gasification contains impurities such as particulates, tar, sulfur compounds, and other contaminants that must be removed.

Cleaning Steps: The syngas is passed through several cleaning processes, including filtration, scrubbing, and chemical absorption, to remove particulates, sulfur compounds, and other impurities.

Conditioning: The hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H₂/CO) ratio in the syngas is then adjusted through a water-gas shift reaction to optimize it for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The adjusted syngas typically has an H₂/CO ratio of around 2:1.

Process: The conditioned syngas is fed into a Fischer-Tropsch reactor, where it is catalytically converted into long-chain hydrocarbons.

Catalysis: The FT process uses a catalyst, typically iron or cobalt-based, to facilitate the chemical reactions. The syngas reacts over the catalyst at temperatures of 200-350°C and pressures of 20-40 bar.

Products: The FT synthesis produces a mixture of hydrocarbons, ranging from light gases to waxes, which can be further processed into different fuels. The primary products are synthetic crude oil (syncrude) and water.

Process: The heavy hydrocarbon chains (waxes) produced in the FT process are then subjected to hydrocracking, where they are broken down into shorter, more useful molecules.

Reaction: In the hydrocracking unit, the FT waxes are mixed with hydrogen and passed over a catalyst at high temperatures and pressures. This process converts the heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fractions, including kerosene-range hydrocarbons suitable for SAF.

Fractionation: The resulting mixture is then separated into different fuel fractions through distillation or fractionation. The kerosene fraction, which meets the specifications for jet fuel, is separated as SAF.

Aviation has long been a symbol of global connectivity, innovation, and human progress. Yet today, as the planet grapples with the existential threat of climate change, aviation also represents one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize. With aviation contributing roughly 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, the climate impact of flight cannot be ignored. Compounding this challenge is the fact that high-altitude emissions—including contrails and nitrogen oxides—exacerbate aviation’s environmental footprint even further.

As global air traffic is projected to double by 2040, the sector must urgently transition to low-carbon alternatives. Hydrogen and electric aircraft may offer promise in the long term, but they are not yet scalable or practical for the vast majority of commercial aviation today. The most immediate and scalable solution lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a drop-in fuel, compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure.

When produced from waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO), waste fats, and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel. It requires no major aircraft modifications and leverages current airport systems. But for SAF to truly scale, three critical pillars must be addressed: feedstock availability, infrastructure readiness, and traceability.

This is where Malaysia’s opportunity begins. Located along the Straits of Malacca—a global artery for trade and energy—Malaysia is uniquely poised to become a SAF hub for the world. The country’s combination of logistical connectivity, abundant feedstock supply, favorable policy landscape, and strategic industrial partnerships make it an ideal launchpad for SAF expansion.

At FatHopes Energy, we have spent over a decade and a half developing Southeast Asia’s largest decentralized network for UCO collection. What began as a grassroots initiative is now a sophisticated operation spanning households, restaurants, food processing facilities, and roadside stalls. Every liter of oil collected is digitally tracked, ensuring a transparent and verifiable supply chain. Traceability is the backbone of the SAF industry.

Without it, sustainability claims risk greenwashing and carbon accounting becomes unreliable. Our digital traceability infrastructure allows for end-to-end verification, from the point of waste generation to export shipment. This capability ensures that every drop of feedstock meets international standards like ISCC, CORSIA, and RED II compliance.

Yet feedstock alone is not enough. To elevate Malaysia as a global SAF supplier, we must invest in refining infrastructure. This is why we have partnered with Topsoe—a global leader in refining technology—to conduct a detailed feasibility study for a commercial-scale SAF refinery in Malaysia. This facility will be purpose-built to process waste oils into high-performance jet fuel.

The SAF refinery will act as a catalyst for a new industrial economy in Malaysia—one that generates green jobs, supports rural communities, drives export revenue, and reinforces national energy security. Importantly, this vision is deeply rooted in Selangor. FatHopes Energy has always been a Selangor-based organization—bringing value from across Asia into the state through waste-based feedstock aggregation, technological innovation, and sustainable logistics systems.

Now, we are proud to anchor this next phase of growth directly in Selangor. Our vision is clear: In Selangor, For Selangor, By Selangor. This means our SAF refinery will be built in Selangor, sourcing a significant portion of its waste-based feedstock from Selangor, and delivering SAF primarily for Selangor’s aviation needs—especially the growing air traffic at key airports in the state. This approach will not only strengthen Selangor’s position as Malaysia’s industrial heartland—it will also make it a national leader in green fuel innovation and sustainable economic development.

We envision a future where Selangor’s role in aviation extends beyond movement of people and goods—it becomes a beacon of climate leadership. This project is more than a refinery. It is a bold declaration that Malaysia, and specifically Selangor, is ready to lead the global decarbonization effort from the heart of Southeast Asia.

Our vision is not constrained by borders. We believe Malaysia can fuel international carriers, serve global hubs, and define new benchmarks for what sustainable aviation looks like at scale. By embracing SAF, we are not only cleaning the skies—we are redefining Malaysia’s role in the global energy transition.

But achieving this vision requires continued collaboration. We need policy alignment to incentivize SAF production. We need international offtake agreements to secure demand. We need carbon pricing mechanisms that reward low-carbon fuels. And above all, we need the courage to act decisively in this pivotal decade. The journey has begun. The foundation has been laid. Now is the time to accelerate.",https://www.fathopesenergy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/refueling-of-airplane-at-airport-2025-02-16-10-53-09-utc-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 11:56:56.610519

Given its significant contribution to carbon emissions, the transportation sector is a top priority,"" Eniya said in her presentation during the EITS Discussion Series 2025: The Future of Transport Energy Transition, held in Jakarta on Wednesday, September 10, 2025.

Eniya outlined that the government’s strategy includes electrification of transportation, as well as the development of bioethanol, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (bioavtur) for the aviation industry.

“The grand design for transport energy transition is aimed at achieving long-term emission reductions,” she said.

EV charging infrastructure

State electricity company PT PLN has reaffirmed its role as a key driver of electric vehicle infrastructure development. According to Executive Vice President for Project Development, Financing and Licensing, Moch Padang Dirgantara, PLN has adopted an end-to-end approach starting from renewable-based power generation to customer-oriented public EV charging stations (SPKLU).

“As of September 2024, PLN had deployed over 2,100 charging stations across 1,463 locations, along with 2,200 battery swap stations. A year later, that number has doubled to 4,216 charging units in 2,800 locations, from Aceh to Papua,” Dirgantara reported.

He noted that PLN’s infrastructure rollout is open to public participation. “Through Energy Ministry Regulation No. 182/2023, we’re opening investment opportunities to MSMEs, cooperatives, and even individuals. This inclusive approach will ensure that the EV ecosystem grows in a way that benefits all stakeholders,” he said.

Despite these advancements, electric vehicle adoption in Indonesia is facing headwinds. Member of the National Energy Council (DEN), Dina Nurul Fitria, pointed out a recent slowdown in EV sales growth, attributing it to the expiration of purchase incentives.

“Previously, government subsidies, including relaxed financing schemes from state-owned banks, played a key role in stimulating EV demand. But after these incentives ended and given limited consumer purchasing power interest has waned,” Dina cited.

She also highlighted that the decreasing prices of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have made them more attractive. “Even consumers who can afford a new car tend to opt for non-EVs,” she said.",https://cdn.indonesiabusinesspost.com/4/1/7/2/eits-discussion-series-2025-the-future-of-transport-energy-transition_300x206.jpeg,N,,2025-09-12 11:57:17.169326

Reflecting its purpose to move people forward in life, Cathay is working towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2050 and transitioning towards more circular use of resources and circular solutions.

Cathay General Manager of Sustainability Grace Cheung said, “Sustainability is essential to the future of aviation. The issues are complex and can only be addressed by moving forward thoughtfully through collaboration with customers, business partners, suppliers, regulators, communities and our people. ​ ​

“Only with our collective efforts can we go further together. We are honoured to be recognised for our endeavours as we continue to chart a path forward with sustainability leadership at the forefront.”

Cathay’s sustainability strategy focuses on addressing the impact of climate change through fleet modernisation, increased fuel efficiency, and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, it aims to reduce cabin waste by promoting a more circular use of resources and implementing recycling initiatives.

Circular economy and waste management

Cathay continues to make progress in adopting more circular solutions for resource use. In particular, Cathay Pacific has committed to reducing its reliance on single-use plastics (SUP), with a pledge to cut the use of passenger-facing SUP items from 7.7 pieces per passenger in 2019 to 1.5 pieces by the end of 2025. As of the end of 2024, Cathay Pacific’s SUP usage had been reduced to 2.6 pieces per passenger.

In-flight, Cathay has introduced enhanced approaches to boost the recycling of water bottles, with over 1.4 million plastic bottles by weight recycled since these enhanced measures were introduced in 2024. Meanwhile, all water bottles on outbound flights from Hong Kong are made with 100% recycled plastics (rPET) to improve the circularity of plastic use in Cathay’s operations. To further reduce plastic waste, the airline has been exploring alternative materials, such as recycled paper for wrapping headphones and blankets instead of plastic. Trials are also being conducted to examine the implementation of more reusable serviceware in the economy class cabin to minimise single-use items in-flight.

Climate action and alternative fuels

The industry widely considers SAF as the most critical lever for decarbonising aviation. Cathay launched its Corporate SAF Programme in 2022 to help accelerate the transition to SAF, enabling corporate partners to address their indirect emissions associated with air travel and airfreight services. In recent years, Cathay has successfully conducted uplifts of SAF onto its flights at both Hong Kong and other airports worldwide.

This year, Cathay has announced three new offtake or partnership agreements. This includes partnering with Sinopec to refuel some of Cathay Pacific’s flights departing from Hong Kong International Airport with blended SAF, with SK Energy for some flights departing South Korea, and with DHL Express to uplift blended SAF onto some flights operated by its express all-cargo carrier Air Hong Kong at Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports. ​

In addition, Cathay has joined hands with partners from across the value chain to promote the development of a supportive SAF policy at its Hong Kong hub. ​",https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-9.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:22.498044

The Ethanol to Jet Fuel Market was valued at USD 320.64 Million in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 857.51 Million by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 17.64%. As the aviation industry intensifies efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, ethanol-derived jet fuel is emerging as a significant solution within the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ecosystem.

Key Market Drivers

Decarbonization Mandates in the Aviation Sector

The increasing urgency to decarbonize the aviation industry is a primary factor fueling the ethanol to jet fuel market. Aviation contributes 2-3% of global CO? emissions, a figure expected to grow alongside air travel demand. To achieve net-zero targets by 2050, international bodies like ICAO and national governments are mandating the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

Ethanol-based SAF, particularly via the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process, delivers lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional jet fuel. Policy frameworks like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offer tax credits of up to USD 1.75 per gallon for qualifying SAF, with ethanol positioned advantageously due to its availability and lower carbon intensity. In the EU, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation requires a progressive increase in SAF blending, from 2% in 2025 to 63% by 2050, which opens substantial opportunities for ethanol-based fuels.

Key Market Challenges

High Capital and Operational Costs

The ethanol-to-jet fuel market faces significant financial barriers due to high capital and operating costs associated with ATJ technology. Building a commercial-scale ETJ facility demands substantial investments ranging from USD 300 million to USD 600 million, depending on the capacity and technical specifications. In addition to the capital expenditure, the ongoing operational costs remain elevated due to the complex conversion processes, high energy inputs, and maintenance of advanced catalytic systems. Feedstock costs, especially for cellulosic and second-generation ethanol, also add to the expense. While some relief is provided by SAF subsidies and tax credits, their limited duration and scope reduce their effectiveness. Emerging economies lack comparable support mechanisms, hindering global scalability. As most projects are still in pilot or demonstration stages, long-term viability hinges on both technological breakthroughs to reduce costs and the establishment of stable, long-term policy incentives.

Key Market Trends

Shift Toward Cellulosic and Waste-Based Ethanol Feedstocks

An important trend in the ethanol to jet fuel market is the transition toward using cellulosic and waste-derived ethanol as feedstock. Unlike first-generation ethanol sourced from food crops, cellulosic ethanol is derived from non-food biomass such as crop residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste. These advanced feedstocks comply with stringent sustainability and carbon reduction guidelines under frameworks like the EU RED II and the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. Cellulosic ethanol can deliver GHG reductions of up to 90% over conventional jet fuels, making it highly attractive for SAF production.

Companies like Blue Biofuels and LanzaTech are at the forefront of leveraging lignocellulosic and waste gases to produce ethanol, which is then converted into jet fuel. Technological advances in enzyme efficiency and microbial fermentation are improving conversion yields, while financial incentives for ultra-low carbon fuels are encouraging broader adoption. This trend not only improves environmental performance but also reduces dependency on food-based crops, aligning with circular economy principles.

Labeling the green transition in aviation as a ""playground for the rich"" is not without basis, considering the staggering costs involved.

Yet, Vietnam’s aviation sector remains firmly committed to its ""green path"" under the guiding spirit of “Transition, sacrifice, and sustainable development.”

An irreversible global journey

The world is navigating a turbulent energy transition. Global climate policy remains inconsistent, as exemplified by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change under President Donald Trump.

Yet paradoxically, the U.S. continued to engage in sector-specific mechanisms like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Funding for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) research remained intact, signaling a technological and market shift that transcends short-term political agendas.

Vietnam has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the global community. At COP26, the country boldly pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This wasn’t just a political declaration - it has since been institutionalized through national strategies, planning, and action plans in every sector, with strong direction from the Party and Government.

Most recently, at the P4G Summit in Vietnam, General Secretary To Lam emphasized the country’s strategic vision of green growth built on three pillars: green institutions as the foundation, green technology as the breakthrough engine, and green human resources as the core. This vision serves as the guiding principle for the entire transition process, with the aviation sector playing a crucial role.

A quiet journey and a 30% emissions cut

Few people are aware that Vietnam’s aviation green transition did not begin with the rise of CORSIA or SAF. The industry had already completed a ""first phase"" of its green transition over several years, quietly but effectively reducing emissions.

This initial success stemmed from business decisions and operational optimization, ensuring aviation safety and security while also benefiting the environment and economy. It served as a vital emissions buffer, showcasing the industry’s technological and management capabilities. However, the achievements of this “win-win” phase may obscure the massive financial and technological hurdles ahead, which will require direct investment and short-term sacrifice.

One of the most effective emissions-reduction strategies is investing in new-generation aircraft that are more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly. Vietnamese airlines have proactively made this a strategic priority, both to enhance competitiveness and to fulfill environmental responsibilities.

Vietnam Airlines, the national carrier, was among the first in the Asia-Pacific region to operate both Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB wide-body aircraft. These aircraft not only offer better passenger experiences but also consume up to 25% less fuel than their predecessors, significantly cutting CO2 emissions.

Meanwhile, Vietjet Air has focused on optimizing its narrow-body fleet with Airbus A321neo aircraft - among the most efficient single-aisle jets globally. Each A321neo can cut CO2 emissions by over 5,000 tons annually and reduce noise by up to 50% compared to older models. The use of Pratt & Whitney GTF engines further boosts fuel savings by 15-17%, contributing to the airline’s Net Zero 2050 strategy.

Beyond fleet upgrades, Vietnam’s aviation sector has embraced a revolution in air traffic management by applying advanced technologies aligned with ICAO’s roadmap.

Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) technology enables aircraft to follow optimized flight paths using satellite navigation instead of ground-based beacons. This shortens flight distances, reduces flying time, and conserves fuel - ultimately lowering emissions. Vietnam is currently implementing PBN at all 22 airports nationwide, improving the national airspace network’s efficiency.

Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) is a shared digital platform enabling real-time coordination between airport operators, air traffic control, airlines, and ground services. Successful A-CDM implementation at Noi Bai and Tan Son Nhat airports has raised on-time performance to 94%, reduced taxi times, minimized congestion, and significantly cut fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

Based on international aviation benchmarks, these efforts have helped reduce CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometer by about 30% compared to early 2000s technology and flight management practices. This is not only a remarkable environmental achievement but also a sign of Vietnam’s solid technological foundation for entering the next, more challenging phase of the green transition.

A new frontier: CORSIA and the SAF revolution

While the first phase of the transition was driven by economic and operational needs, the current phase is marked by a shift from voluntary actions to compliance with international regulations. Public attention and policy pressure surged with the emergence of CORSIA and SAF.

These developments represent the visible tip of a larger iceberg - where national commitments must be fulfilled through specific and costly actions. Vietnam’s early and voluntary participation in these mechanisms reflects a strategic move, not passive compliance. It’s an effort to turn pressure into opportunity by restructuring the industry, improving competitiveness, and attracting green finance.

CORSIA, established by ICAO, is a market-based mechanism helping global aviation reach net zero by 2050. Meanwhile, SAF is considered the ""golden key"" for long-term emission reduction. Made from renewable sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and algae, SAF can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60% to 94% over its lifecycle compared to traditional Jet A1 fuel.

Recognizing the importance of these changes, Vietnam has taken proactive steps. The country officially registered and was confirmed by ICAO to join the voluntary phase of CORSIA starting January 1, 2026 - demonstrating responsibility while allowing time to prepare and seek international support before mandatory participation begins in 2027.

In May 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated its first SAF-powered commercial flight from Singapore to Hanoi and pledged to comply with SAF requirements for EU-originating flights. Vietjet Air has also flown SAF-powered routes from Ho Chi Minh City to Melbourne and Seoul, reaffirming its commitment to sustainability.

Petrolimex Aviation became the first Vietnamese company to import and refuel SAF, laying the groundwork for a domestic green energy supply chain. At a broader level, the Vietnam Petroleum Institute (VPI) is researching local biomass sources and suitable SAF production technologies, aiming for partial domestic supply in the future.

The biggest challenge: Financial burden

International compliance will undoubtedly bring huge operating costs. For example, under the voluntary phase of CORSIA (2024-2026), a major Vietnamese airline may need to spend between USD 13 million and USD 92 million on carbon credits, depending on market fluctuations.

Similarly, the EU’s ReFuelEU requirement for a mandatory 2% SAF blend on outbound flights could add roughly USD 4.8 million annually to Vietnam Airlines' European route fuel costs. These rising costs will inevitably be passed down partially to airfares, impacting airline competitiveness and customer choices.

With major markets like the EU implementing environmental regulations, green transition is no longer optional. Without compliance, Vietnamese airlines risk losing access to European routes - cutting off vital cargo channels and isolating the industry from global trade. Thus, this is a calculated sacrifice: short-term profitability must give way to long-term survival, sovereignty, and self-reliance in an evolving world.

Compounding this challenge is Vietnam’s lack of large-scale SAF production technology and supply chain expertise. Heavy reliance on expensive imports poses energy security and cost risks. Currently, SAF costs two to six times more than Jet A1 fuel, while global supply meets only 0.1% of total demand. This remains a monumental obstacle for Vietnamese aviation.

Sacrificing for sustainable development

The green aviation revolution is no longer a luxury for wealthy nations - it is a strategic battleground for survival in global aviation. Today’s costs should be seen not as losses, but as investments in economic sovereignty and future market access. Accepting short-term hardship is essential to avoid exclusion and to build a strong, sustainable aviation sector for future generations.

Vietnam’s history is marked by generations who sacrificed for independence, freedom, and unity. Today, in a new era, we face a different kind of battle - a silent one against climate change. The journey toward a green future demands a different kind of sacrifice: economic trade-offs, perseverance, and resilience.

This is not the aviation industry’s burden alone - it’s a national mission. Under the leadership of the Party and Government, and with the support of the people, Vietnam’s aviation sector is moving swiftly to build a green institutional framework, invest in green technology, develop domestic SAF production, and train a new generation of experts and engineers to master emerging technologies.

Green transition is not an expense but an investment in the future. With determination and ambition, Vietnam’s aviation industry will rise above this challenge, soaring not only through greener skies but also along a sustainable development path - asserting Vietnam’s role as a responsible and visionary global player.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/9/12/vietnams-aviation-goes-green-a-costly-journey-for-a-sustainable-future-692.png?width=0&s=p4tac0TohRplY2Wa2k_PfA,N,,2025-09-12 06:56:27.363087

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 14 May 2025 and, at the time of writing, is at Report stage (having been amended in Committee).

It introduces powers for the government to set up and operate the RCM to support SAF production (SAF being defined broadly as ""aviation fuel that is renewable transport fuel"") in the UK, including:

Powers to designate a government-owned company as the counterparty, and to direct the counterparty to enter into revenue certainty contracts;

Powers to impose a levy on aviation fuel suppliers to fund the revenue certainty mechanism, and to impose fines for suppliers that fail to pay the levy (£100,000 or 10% of turnover, whichever is less) - the low level of fine (£100,000) suggests that the levy itself will be low, otherwise there would be no incentive to pay it;

Powers to develop detailed regulations, including on levy administration, eligibility for contracts, and transparency requirements.

The devil will of course be in the detail of those regulations and these could take some time to develop. They will need to address how the reference price for SAF will be determined (as there is currently no recognised market index for SAF in the UK) and how long the subsidy period will be. The Bill gives the Government power to direct the counterparty to enter revenue certainty contracts for 10 years, but this can be extended by secondary legislation.

The government intends for all the required legislation for the revenue certainty mechanism, including the regulations made under the act, to be in place by the end of 2026. So, watch this space for further consultations as the regulatory landscape is shaped.

What Happened at SAF Bill Committee Stage

Debates focused on the impact on competition, the design of the RCM and the potential impact on ticket prices, among other issues:

multiple witnesses, including airline representatives, expressed scepticism about the £1.50 passed on cost figure and suggested the actual cost to passengers would be much higher;

some stakeholders fear the levy could negatively affect the competitiveness of the UK aviation sector, particularly in comparison to other nations without similar mandates and funding mechanisms. Complexity or lack of transparency around the levy calculation may exacerbate this;

another concern – one particularly raised by airlines – highlighted the risk of supply shortages, particularly of advanced (second and third generation) SAF. Witnesses warned that, without sufficient domestic production, airlines could face crippling buy-out penalties, which would increase costs without achieving decarbonisation goals;

there were also questions raised about the intellectual property in UK-developed fuels being lost overseas.

Concluding Comments

The aviation industry has been mainly supportive of the Bill and the need for a RCM to support SAF scale-up and commercialisation. However, some trade bodies are worried the levy will increase the costs to passengers, given that fuel bills already make up around a third of an airline's costs. Some had wanted the scheme to be funded through the industry's contribution to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Others are calling on the government to prioritise PtL fuel (third generation SAF) in the RCM, rather than the more established fuel types.

Next steps

The SAF Bill gives broad powers to set up the RCM, but the regulations to be made under the Bill once it has become an Act will set out the detail of how the scheme will work. So we will keep an eye out for consultations on those.

Air Niugini receives first Airbus A220

Air Niugini, the national carrier of Papua New Guinea, has taken delivery of its first Airbus A220-300 aircraft, which it is leasing from Azorra. The airline becomes the 25th operator of the A220 worldwide, which is now in service with carriers across five continents.

The aircraft, named “People’s Balus”, departed the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mirabel on its delivery flight to Port Moresby, with planned stopovers in Vancouver, Honolulu and Fiji. The delivery marks a significant milestone in Air Niugini’s fleet modernisation programme, which includes eight Airbus A220-100 aircraft on direct order from Airbus and three Airbus A220-300 aircraft being leased from Azorra.

The aircraft’s special livery commemorates the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea’s independence. The intricate design was created by a dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters, who applied 11 distinct colours using a specialist airbrushing technique.

The Airbus A220 is set to become the centrepiece of the airline’s regional and international fleet, offering a new standard of operational efficiency and passenger comfort. Its exceptional efficiency, combined with a spacious cabin and the range to serve a variety of destinations, makes it an ideal choice for the carrier’s network and its broader ambitions for long-term growth.

The Airbus A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF engines, delivering a 25% reduction in carbon emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target for all aircraft to be able to operate with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

As of the end of August 2025, Airbus has secured more than 940 orders for the Airbus A220 from over 30 customers and has delivered more than 440 aircraft. The A220 is already operating on more than 1,800 routes to over 480 destinations worldwide, underscoring its leading position in the small single-aisle market.

Earlier this week, Down To Earth (DTE) reported that the Indian government is finalising a national SAF policy and a roadmap through 2050 to meet CORSIA mandates and become an export hub.","India could achieve self-sufficiency in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030 and even emerge as a major export hub, industry stakeholders said at a recent discussion on decarbonising aviation, while seeking urgent policy support and financial incentives from the government.

“By our calculations, we should have a mandate SAF requirement of 350 to 500 million litres which translates to 700 million litres to a billion litres only of ethanol by 2030,” Sameer Sinha, chief executive of sugar business at Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd, said at the India Sugar and Bio-Energy conference. “There is a huge potential in the feedstock that’s available…our ethanol has low carbon intensity (CI)…we have immediate self-sufficiency for the country for our SAF mandate.”

“We can be a very competitive centre for export of SAF because of the proximity to the large aviation hubs of Middle East such as Dubai, Singapore and especially given the low CI value of our ethanol,” he added.

They underlined the need for a conducive ethanol policy “right up front”, citing the success of the 2018 National Biofuel Policy.

The national biofuel policy enabled India to go from 5 per cent blending in 2019-20 to 20 per cent by 2025-26. ""So, that's a remarkable thing of what an optimised policy can do,” the producer noted. They also called for pricing clarity and mandated offtake.

“If I look at the current pricing of aviation turbine fuel at Rs 90 per litre, our ask should be somewhere around 2.75 times, and if we consider 2G ethanol, it would be in the range of 2.5-3.5 times,” he said.

Industry demanded capital subsidies, preferential pricing for first plants, higher debt-equity ratio (3:1), accelerated depreciation, tax holidays and stacking of state incentives, alongside airport storage, blending and distribution infrastructure upgrades. Airlines must also share the initial cost burden, they said.

“If it's a domestic airline, our calculation shows it would hardly be Rs 200-300 per passenger in terms of increase,” the producer said.

They also flagged the urgency of putting carbon accounting and certification systems in place for compliance under International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) framework.

“An 80-tonne-per-day plant would cost around Rs 1,400 crore, and take about three and a half years at least to make. This means that the first SAF plant, even if we start now, can only be ready in 2029,” he noted.

Kanika Chawla, SAF strategy and business development at Airbus India and South Asia, said it was supporting both producers and airlines in SAF adoption.

“Our current aircraft are capable of flying with approximately 50 per cent of SAF, and our target is that by 2030, we increase that to 100 per cent SAF,” she said, adding that India must “look at SAF from an innovative lens” and treat it as an “ecosystem where the producers, the airline, the regulators need to work unanimously”.

The industry executives urged the government to finalise a national SAF policy by the end of this financial year, calling it a low-hanging fruit to cut aviation emissions by 50-60 per cent.

By partnering with Haffner Energy, Luxaviation aims to establish a new standard for how business aviation can effectively drive the scale-up of sustainable fuel production.
For Haffner Energy, the agreement is instrumental in facilitating the financing of its SAF projects across Europe.
Philippe Haffner, CEO of Haffner Energy, noted that long-term offtake agreements are among the most crucial conditions for securing financing for SAF production facilities.
Haffner Energy has already announced the development of several SAF projects, including sites in France and Iceland, with full-scale production expected to be reached by 2030.","In a significant move to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry, business aviation powerhouse Luxaviation Group and pioneering biomass-to-clean-fuels company Haffner Energy have announced a non-exclusive, 15-year offtake agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The deal, which includes fixed volume and price terms, represents a critical step forward in moving from aspirational commitments to tangible, long-term solutions for sustainable aviation.

The partnership is an extension of an existing collaboration that began earlier this year when Luxaviation expressed interest in SAF Zero, a dedicated entity focused on promoting and producing sustainable aviation fuels. This new agreement solidifies their joint commitment to making SAF more accessible and widely used across Europe.

Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group, emphasized the importance of the deal, stating, ""This agreement marks a decisive move from vision to reality."" He highlighted that securing a long-term SAF supply is not just an operational investment for Luxaviation but a firm commitment to its clients and the broader industry's future. By partnering with Haffner Energy, Luxaviation aims to establish a new standard for how business aviation can effectively drive the scale-up of sustainable fuel production.

Luxaviation, which operates one of the largest private aircraft fleets globally, has a comprehensive three-pronged strategy for decarbonization. This includes improving fuel efficiency, actively increasing the use of SAF and electrifying ground operations, and offsetting remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The company has been tracking its progress since 2021 through its annual sustainability report and further demonstrated its dedication by launching the ""Go-to-Zero"" Investment Fund in 2023 to foster SAF production.

For Haffner Energy, the agreement is instrumental in facilitating the financing of its SAF projects across Europe. Philippe Haffner, CEO of Haffner Energy, noted that long-term offtake agreements are among the most crucial conditions for securing financing for SAF production facilities. Such agreements guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable price over extended periods, providing the financial certainty needed to build new production plants.

Haffner Energy has already announced the development of several SAF projects, including sites in France and Iceland, with full-scale production expected to be reached by 2030. This timeline aligns with the next stage of the European SAF mandate, which will require a minimum 6% blend of SAF in jet fuel.

Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are active members of Project SkyPower, an international, CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF, underscoring their leadership and collaborative spirit within the industry.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-12 05:57:38.027932
