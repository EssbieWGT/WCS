Durch gezielte Fuel Efficiency-Maßnahmen konnte Lufthansa Cargo im Jahr 2024 rund 5.700 Tonnen Kerosin einsparen, was einer CO2-Reduktion von rund 18.000 Tonnen entspricht.
Gleichzeitig wurde die Ladeinfrastruktur im Lufthansa Cargo Center (LCC) mit insgesamt sechs Ladepunkten an zwei Gebäuden umgesetzt.
Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem branchenführenden SFC-Netzwerk unterstützt die Strategie von Lufthansa Cargo für eine nachhaltigere Zukunft.","Verantwortungsvolles Handeln ist die Grundlage der unternehmerischen Tätigkeit von Lufthansa Cargo. Die Frachtfluglinie setzt auf Qualität, Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit beim Luftfrachttransport und ermöglicht globalen Handel so nachhaltig wie möglich. „Unser Anspruch ist es, Verantwortung zu übernehmen und unsere ehrgeizigen Klimaziele weiter voranzutreiben“, sagt Nicole Mies, Head of Communications & Corporate Social Responsibility bei Lufthansa Cargo. „Im Jahr 2024 haben wir gemeinsam mit unseren Kunden, Partnern und der Wissenschaft neue Möglichkeiten ausgelotet, viele Schritte unternommen und wertvolle Fortschritte erzielt. Nicht überall stehen wir schon da, wo wir hinwollen – aber wir arbeiten konsequent weiter daran, eine Luftfracht zu gestalten, die effizient, innovativ und zukunftsorientiert ist.“

Das weltweite Umweltmanagementsystem von Lufthansa Cargo ist erneut nach dem internationalen Umweltstandard ISO 14001 zertifiziert. Es stellt die kontinuierliche und transparente Steuerung, Überwachung und Verbesserung der Umweltbilanz sicher – und das nicht nur in der Luft, sondern auch am Boden. Zur Aufrechterhaltung der Zertifizierung weist das Unternehmen jährlich externen Gutachtern nach, dass die Anforderungen der Norm eingehalten werden und das System auf allen Ebenen funktioniert und gelebt wird.

Moderne Flotte

Als Airline entsteht der gesamte CO2-Fußabdruck von Lufthansa Cargo zu fast 99 Prozent durch den Flugbetrieb. Der derzeit größte Hebel zur Reduktion von CO2 in der Luftfahrt ist der Einsatz neuer, treibstoffeffizienterer Flugzeuge. Flugzeuge der neuesten Generation verbrauchen im Vergleich zu ihren jeweiligen Vorgängermodellen bis zu 30 Prozent weniger Treibstoff und emittieren entsprechend weniger CO2. Lufthansa Cargo setzt in ihrer eigenen Langstreckenflotte mit einem Durchschnittsalter von 7,6 Jahren ausschließlich auf die Boeing 777F – das derzeit modernste und effizienteste Frachtflugzeug seiner Klasse. Im Sommer 2024 begrüßte das Unternehmen seinen 18. Langstreckenfrachter am Flughafen Frankfurt. Weitere sieben Boeing 777-8-Frachter mit der kommenden Technologie sind bestellt und werden bis 2030 erwartet.

SAF-Kooperationen

Der Einsatz von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ist für nachhaltigeres Fliegen ein entscheidender technologischer Schlüssel und essenziell für die Energiewende in der Luftfahrt. Auf Basis von biogenen Reststoffen hat es über den gesamten Lebenszyklus einen rund 80 Prozent geringeren CO2-Fußabdruck als herkömmliches Kerosin. Mit ihrem Add-on Service „Sustainable Choice“ lädt Lufthansa Cargo alle Kunden dazu ein, einen Beitrag zur Dekarbonisierung der Luftfracht zu leisten. Der optionale Service kann einfach über die Lufthansa Cargo-Homepage hinzugebucht werden und kombiniert die CO2-Reduktion durch SAF-Einsatz mit der Kompensation durch den Beitrag zu hochwertigen Klimaschutzprojekten. Gleichzeitig können große, individuelle Vereinbarungen, sogenannte Bulk Deals, auf interessierte Partner von Lufthansa Cargo zugeschnitten werden. Im Jahr 2024 konnte Lufthansa Cargo auf diese Weise rund 8.500 Tonnen CO2einsparen.

Fuel Efficiency Maßnahmen

Lufthansa Cargo strebt eine maximale Reduktion der CO2-Emissionen im Flugbetrieb an und setzt dabei auf effektive Maßnahmen. Neben einer modernen Flotte und dem Einsatz von nachhaltigem Flugkraftstoff (SAF) liegt der Fokus auf der kontinuierlichen Optimierung des Flugbetriebs. Durch gezielte Fuel Efficiency-Maßnahmen konnte Lufthansa Cargo im Jahr 2024 rund 5.700 Tonnen Kerosin einsparen, was einer CO2-Reduktion von rund 18.000 Tonnen entspricht. Den größten Einzelbeitrag leistet dabei die Statistical Contingency Fuel-Methode (SCF). Diese statistische Analyse ermöglicht, einen Teil der benötigten Reservekraftstoffmenge für jeden Flug präziser zu kalkulieren. Dabei werden historische Flugverbräuche analysiert und aktuelle Faktoren – beispielsweise Wetterbedingungen am Zielflughafen – bei der Treibstoffplanung berücksichtigt. So lassen sich unnötige Kraftstoffreserven vermeiden, ohne die Flugsicherheit zu beeinträchtigen. Darüber hinaus wurde SCF Ende des Jahres 2024 durch eine weitere automatisierte Datenintegration ergänzt, um die Kraftstoffplanung für das Rollen am Boden vor dem Start noch präziser zu kalkulieren. Diese optimierte Taxi Fuel-Berechnung erhöht somit zusätzlich die Effizienz der Treibstoffplanung für den gesamten Flugprozess.

Eine weitere wichtige Maßnahme ist ""RETI"" (Reduced Engine during Taxi In): Dabei wird beim Rollen zur Parkposition – wenn möglich – ein Triebwerk abgeschaltet, wodurch jährlich rund 400 Tonnen Kerosin und 1200 Tonnen CO2 eingespart werden.

Maßnahmen am Boden

Am Boden arbeitet die Frachtfluglinie mit Hochdruck an dem Ziel der CO2-Neutralität bis 2030. Zusätzlich sucht die Organisation im Teamwork immer neue Wege, um Energie, Treibstoffe, Ressourcen und Abfälle zu vermeiden. Ein Beispiel der zahlreichen Maßnahmen aus dem Jahr 2024 ist der Umstellungsstart der Operations-Dienstwagenflotte auf E-Fahrzeuge. Die insgesamt 30 Fahrzeuge, die für Dienstfahrten am Hub Frankfurt eingesetzt werden, sollen schrittweise gegen neue E-Fahrzeuge ausgetauscht werden. Die ersten Neuwagen sind bereits eingetroffen und im Einsatz. Gleichzeitig wurde die Ladeinfrastruktur im Lufthansa Cargo Center (LCC) mit insgesamt sechs Ladepunkten an zwei Gebäuden umgesetzt.

Darüber hinaus werden seit Sommer 2024 defekte und abgelaufene Frachtgurte in Zusammenarbeit mit der WfB Rhein-Main e.V. recycelt. Das wiederverwendbare Material wird für Baustellenabsicherungen oder Dämmplatten genutzt, das Aluminium der Spannschlösser wiederverwertet. So spart Lufthansa Cargo in Frankfurt jährlich mehrere Tonnen Abfall.

100-Flüge-Programm

Zudem unterstützt Lufthansa Cargo aktiv die Erforschung der so genannten Nicht-CO2-Klimaeffekte des Luftverkehrs. Um deren Auswirkungen besser zu verstehen und Maßnahmen zur Verringerung der Gesamtklimawirkung abzuleiten, beteiligt sich die Lufthansa Group an Forschungsprojekten. Lufthansa Cargo hat im Jahr 2024 gemeinsam mit Lufthansa Airlines und anderen deutschen Fluggesellschaften am „100-Flüge-Programm“ teilgenommen, das vom Arbeitskreis klimaneutrale Luftfahrt des Bundeswirtsschafts- und Bundesverkehrsministeriums initiiert wurde. Lufthansa Cargo hat hierfür 23 Flüge ausgewählt, von denen 13 in der Routenplanung in der Flughöhe angepasst wurden, um Kondensstreifen zu vermeiden, und weitere zehn Referenzflüge zum Vergleich. Ziel ist es, Daten zur Vorhersage von Kondensstreifen-Gebieten in der Flugplanung zu nutzen und ihre Qualität und Verlässlichkeit zu testen. Zum Nachweis, ob auf umgeleiteten Flügen tatsächlich Kondensstreifen vermieden werden konnten, werden Satellitenbeobachtungen herangezogen und ausgewertet. Die Auswertung der Flüge erfolgt im Rahmen des Forschungsprojekts „D-KULT“ auf Basis der dort entwickelten Daten und Prototypen von Computerprogrammen, zusammen mit den Projektpartnern Deutscher Wetterdienst, Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) und Lufthansa Systems.

Klimaschutz ist Teamwork

Der notwendige Wandel kann nur gemeinsam mit starken Partnern erreicht werden. Lufthansa Cargo ist eng vernetzt und im aktiven Austausch mit ihren Kunden und Innovationstreibern aus Forschung, Wirtschaft und Politik. Im Jahr 2024 konnte das Unternehmen beispielsweise den Beitritt zur Smart Freight Centre Community bekanntgeben. Das Smart Freight Centre (SFC) ist eine internationale Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich auf die Reduzierung von Treibhausgasemissionen im Güterverkehr konzentriert. Ihr Ziel ist es, Mitglieder und Partner bei der Reduzierung ihrer Treibhausgasemissionen zu unterstützen, um bis zum Jahr 2050 oder früher einen emissionsfreien globalen Logistiksektor zu erreichen, der mit dem Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen vereinbar ist. Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem branchenführenden SFC-Netzwerk unterstützt die Strategie von Lufthansa Cargo für eine nachhaltigere Zukunft.

This action follows a court order from the circuit court in Florida. The 3 planes are seized at Miami International Airport.

The Ongoing Year-Long Court Case

This seizure is part of the decision of a court case filed a year ago by the investors. From a spoken agreement, the investor company, while lending 3 aircraft to the airline, would get compensation for each flight operated with those aircraft.

The agreement was between Blue Diamond General Investments and Miami-Dade-based Caribbean Sun Airlines. The leased aircraft operates under the name World Atlantic Airlines.

The complaint from the investment company follows World Atlantic Airlines’ inability to pay the compensation from passenger flights operated with the aircraft.

Aircraft Seized Until Debt is Repaid

With attempts to solve this dispute through a payment schedule, the airline now owes the investment firm over USD 1.8M (£1.43M).

On 21 March 2025, this year-long court case finally comes to a court decision: the court ordered a prejudgment writ of attachment and garnishment. This allows the investment company to take the planes back from the airline until they repay their debt.

The 3 McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft in the lease are now being held at the Miami International Airport by the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s office.

The 3 planes seized in Miami for now will not be flying again until the debt is repaid to the investment company.

While not all airlines in financial emergencies come to a similar situation as World Atlantic Airlines, the reason for the airline’s inability to repay its debt is still unknown.

They make aerospace components for other companies, but they also have a lineup of light aircraft that they have designed and produced themselves. One such aircraft is the Tecnam Astore, a light sport aircraft that had a limited production run by Tecnam. The small, low-wing aircraft is a fun little sport plane that can seat two pilots, and was advertised by Tecnam as having a sporty and luxurious interior. Read on to find out about the many features of the Tecnam Astore.

Sporty Performance

Acrobatic Size

An Astore is the Italian word for a Goshawk, a nimble bird of prey that the Astore lives up to. The Astore is itself nimble in size, with a total length of 22.97 ft (7 m) and an overall height of 7.55 ft (2.3 m), with its wings spanning a total of 28.38 ft (8.65 m). The potential agility of the Astore is shown off by the fact that its wingspan is longer than the length of the aircraft, allowing for more of its limited weight and structure to be dedicated to its aerobatic wings.

The Astore's wing is cantilevered and has a high aspect ratio for its size to allow for better performance and also features full flaps for enhanced landing and takeoff operations. The total area for the airplane's wing is 131 square feet (12.2 square meters), with the wings set at a dihedral angle of five degrees. The aspect ratio of the wings is also 6.2.

Its airframe is constructed entirely of aluminum, with a canopy crafted of carbon and glass composite fiber for extra weight savings. The Astore's standard empty weight is only 809 lb (367 kg) and has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,320 lb (600 kg), which is also its maximum landing weight. Its maximum useful load is 511 lb (233 kg), more than enough to carry its two pilots and any small baggage they may bring on board the aircraft.

The Astore also has a tri-cycle landing gear configuration, with the fixed landing gear being covered by aerodynamic fairings to reduce drag.

High power in a small package

While the Astore is small in size, it can punch above its weight class with its engines. The sport plane can be powered by either a 98 horsepower (72 kW) naturally aspirated Rotax 912ULS2 four-cylinder engine or a more powerful 115 horsepower (85 kW) Rotax 914UL2, the turbocharged version of the same engine. Affixed to the engine shaft can either be a two-bladed propeller, or a three-bladed propeller for enhanced performance. Feeding the engine is done by the 29 US gal (110 liters) of fuel that is carried by the Astore.

The propellers, manufactured by the company Sensenich, are constructed of wooden composite and are installed with a fixed angle, though that angle can be manually adjusted on the ground depending on the flying characteristics desired by the pilot.

Efficient cruising

The Astore can fly up to a maximum cruise ceiling of 15,000 ft (4,572 m), though you probably wouldn't want to even fly any higher given that the cabin is unpressurized. The sport plane can also be pushed to a top cruising speed of 120 knots (138 miles per hour), though the aircraft is structurally limited to a top speed of 150 knots (173 miles per hour). The aircraft can climb at a rate of 1,100 feet per minute (335 meters per minute), allowing you to achieve your maximum cruise ceiling in less than fourteen minutes. The Tecnam Astore also has a fairly short takeoff distance of 715 ft (218 m) and an even shorter landing distance of 505 ft (154 m). It has a very slow stall speed of 44 knots (51 miles per hour) with an even slower stall speed with its flaps down of 38 knots (44 miles per hour).

Probably the most impressive feature about the Tecnam Astore is its range. With only its 29 US gal (110 liters) of fuel aboard the aircraft, the Astore can cruise a maximum of 750 nautical miles (863 statute miles / 1,389 km), plenty of distance for not only for normal recreational flying but even for cross-country traveling. A Cessna 172 Skyhawk , by contrast, has a maximum range of 640 nautical miles (737 statute miles / 1,185 km) (though keep in mind that the 172 Skyhawk has a much higher payload capacity and a higher cruising speed).

Customizability

Tecnam offers the Astore with a number of available standard configurations, and also features almost 60 different options that can be added on. Astore offers the basic lowest-cost version of the Astore, and also has three additional packages with set upgrades that range in price. The packages include upgrades to:

Instrumentation and avionics

Radio and navigation equipment by both Garmin and Dynon

Autopilot

Miscellaneous equipment like microphones, speakers, and headsets

Exterior equipment like an aircraft recovery parachute and wheel and brake upgrades

Engine equipment like an auxiliary alternator or a carburetor heating system

Interior finishes and furnishings

The packages may come with set features but Tecnam prices all of the available options individually for customers to purchase separately for their own unique aircraft configuration. Some of their premium interior upgrades include chrome finishes to control knobs, leather and Alcántara fabric surfaces, a unique interior paint scheme, and customizable name plate.

On the exterior, Tecnam offers a variety of colors and surface paint finishes as well as a variety of paint styling. The exterior of the aircraft can be painted in the normal basic colors, like red, blue, green, etc., but Tecnam also offers additional premium paint finishes, like metallic silver, metallic gold, and metallic blue as well as chome accents. The paint schemes also feature a number of striping options that the customer can choose.

Variable pricing of the Astore

With the high customizablility of the Astore comes variations in how the Astore is priced for customers. When purchasing the plane, owners can price the aircraft to fit their needs, making the plane as cheap or as expensive as they desire.

With the more luxurious options coming in at thousands of dollars per item, customers can take the bare-bones approach and purchase the basic Astore, which starts at $147,000. This price (and the ones following) is all-inclusive with no additional charges paid by the customer. Customers only need to put 10% down as well before they take delivery, where the full amount of money owed is due. The basic Astore comes with basic analog instruments and does not feature any additional premium features.

The first option upgrade offered by the Astore starts at $167,500, which features upgrades to the instruments with additional indicators added, like attitude and flap indicators. Engine analog instruments are also added, including a tachometer, oil pressure and temperature, and fuel quantity measurements. The avionics are also added, with Garmin communications equipment added with transponder and GPS devices.

The final two options offered by Tecnam are similar to each other. The first of these two options, priced at $173,500, replaces most of the analog instruments with two Dynon avionics screens, where engine and flight parameters are displayed. In addition, the radio and communications equipment are replaced with versions supplied by Dynon. The second of these two options, priced a little higher at $176,000, effectively does the same as the previous option, but instead of Dynon hardware and electronics, they are replaced with Garmin versions.

The Tecnam Astore today

Unfortunately, it does not look like the Astore is manufactured by Tecnam anymore. Their website makes no mention of the aircraft and, presumably, it is only available for purchase in private sales as a used aircraft. Tecnam still offers other models similar to the Astore, like the P2002 and the P-mentor, both classified as light sport aircraft.

The Tecnam Astore is an aircraft that has a unique and sporty design that aviation enthusiasts can appreciate. It caters to customers that want a customizable aircraft that they can craft to match whatever tastes they may have. The pricing options and availability of upgrades make the Astore a special aircraft coming from a smaller aircraft manufacturer with smaller produciton runs. With its combination of sporty design and high fuel efficiency, the Astore stands out as a compelling option for both new aviators and seasoned pilots seeking a unique and enjoyable flying experience. Through its aircraft targeted at the light sport pilot community, Tecnam continues to solidify its reputation in the general aviation industry with aircraft like the Astore.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/artboard-16_9-8.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 19:56:30.347438

The International Air Transport Association has officially launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Registry, now managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization . This initiative aims to standardize the tracking and reporting of SAF usage, facilitating a global market to expedite the aviation industry's transition toward net-zero emissions by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is projected to contribute up to 65% of the carbon mitigation required for the aviation sector to achieve its net-zero target. Despite this potential, SAF currently accounts for only about 0.3% of global aviation fuel consumption. The SAF Registry is designed to address this disparity by ensuring that the environmental benefits of SAF are accurately recorded and attributed, promoting increased production and adoption.

Willie Walsh, IATA's Director General, emphasized the registry's role in fostering a transparent and efficient SAF market. He stated that the registry will connect airlines with SAF producers worldwide, ensuring that carriers can access SAF regardless of their location, and producers can reach a broader market. This global approach is expected to stimulate both supply and demand, addressing one of the critical challenges in SAF adoption.

The establishment of CADO to manage the SAF Registry underscores the industry's commitment to decarbonization. CADO, incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada and headquartered in Montreal, aims to provide robust governance for the registry. Membership is open to entities involved in the SAF value chain, including airlines, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. This inclusive approach is intended to foster collaboration across the sector, ensuring that all parties contribute to and benefit from the registry's operations.

The SAF Registry offers several key capabilities. It provides a wide geographic scope, allowing airlines to purchase SAF from producers worldwide, with each batch's environmental attributes meticulously tracked and assigned to the purchasing airline. This system ensures accurate reporting of emissions reductions, aligning with international standards and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the registry is designed to be neutral concerning regulations and SAF types, facilitating broad application and compliance with schemes such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The launch of the SAF Registry comes at a time when the aviation industry faces significant challenges in meeting its sustainability targets. Willie Walsh has previously expressed concerns about the industry's progress toward net-zero emissions, highlighting that efforts are falling behind schedule. He has pointed out that while airlines have committed to these goals, other stakeholders, including fuel suppliers and regulatory bodies, need to play a more active role. Walsh has criticized fuel companies for not fulfilling their SAF supply commitments, noting that airlines are bearing increasing costs as a result.

The SAF Registry is expected to address some of these challenges by providing a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF transactions. By ensuring that the environmental benefits of SAF are properly recorded and transferred between parties, the registry aims to build confidence among stakeholders and encourage greater investment in SAF production. This, in turn, could help alleviate supply constraints and reduce costs associated with SAF adoption.

In preparation for the registry's launch, IATA released the SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, developed in collaboration with over 40 airline experts worldwide. This methodology provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, ensuring transparency and preventing double-counting. It aligns with international protocols and industry best practices, offering guidance for emissions calculations and reporting.

The development of the SAF Registry has garnered support from a broad range of stakeholders. Seventeen airlines, one airline group, six national authorities, three original equipment manufacturers , and one fuel producer have been involved in the registry's development. Notable participants include Singapore Airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore , reflecting the global nature of the initiative.

The aviation industry has been advocating for policies to support SAF production and adoption. IATA has called for measures such as diversifying feedstocks, facilitating co-processing at crude oil facilities, and providing incentives to renewable fuel facilities to encourage them to transition to SAF production. These policies are seen as essential to scaling up SAF production and making it a viable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

I’ve shared my experience of trying to squeeze in a few final Tier Point-earning flights before the change took effect.

My Journey To 35,000 British Airways Tier Points Before March 31, 2025, Program Massacre

My BA flight last Monday posted correctly under the old system. However, an earlier Finnair flight (part of the same itinerary) posted yesterday with bizarre new Tier Points:

British Airways Flight Posting Experience After the Switch from Executive Club to “The Club” with Lifetime Tier Points Conversion

This was the second-to-last leg of a round-the-world trip I booked last year, originating in Cairo at a great price.

Oneworld Business RTW Trip Frequent Flier Program Crediting Dilemma

The Finnair segment should have posted with the same (new) Tier Points as the BA segment—but it didn’t.

To make things even more confusing:

It shows 80 Tier Points earned toward next year’s status (which was the old amount).

Yet the incorrect number of new Tier Points was added to my lifetime tally.

These Tier Points should have been credited to last year’s earnings. That matters, because with just a few more, I could qualify for one more “joker”—a perk that lets you open award inventory even when it’s otherwise unavailable (earned after 6,000 old Tier Points).

The lifetime tally isn’t impacted for me personally, as I’m now over the 550,000 Tier Points required under the new rules. But I’ll never qualify for GGLfL (Gold Guest List for Life); the revenue requirements are, frankly, insane.

The Bigger Problem with Revenue-Based Programs

This is the issue with revenue-based loyalty schemes: you have to micromanage every itinerary to ensure correct crediting. What happened here with Finnair is a perfect example.

UPDATE: Reminder To Audit Your Finnair Flight Postings For Discrepancies: Case Helsinki – Doha (Resolved)

Conclusion

I’m certain I’m not alone—there are likely many “The Club” members who have received too few Avios or Tier Points, just as I’ve been credited with far too many.

If you reissue, change, or encounter irregular operations, revenue-based systems often fail to account for it accurately. You must audit every single flight post to ensure accuracy.

In my case, I received 17,612 excess New Tier Points (at least toward lifetime status). BA also appears unable to properly credit flights taken before April 1 but posted after—leading to major discrepancies across lifetime, last year’s, and current year’s Tier Point balances.

Alternatively, another approved pathway is co-processing defined in ASTM D1655 and Def Stan 91-091, where the same raw bio-ingredients are processed along with conventional crude oils.
Accordingly, these parameters are specifically mentioned as additional requirements in specifications such as D7566 Table A2.1, D1655 Table A1.1, or Def Stan 91-091 Table 3.
Together these parameters define the low temperature fluidity of jet fuels, critical to the safe operations of aircraft.
The instrument and associated test methods have been approved in applicable global specifications of jet fuels (ASTM D1655 Table 1, ASTM D7566 Table 1, Def Stan 91-091 Annex E).","Article Summary

Some major oil companies such as Neste, TotalEnergies, and World Energy have started processing SAF during the past few years, and many more are investing in new biorefineries or converting existing facilities to do the same.

All SAF’s are designed to be drop-in jet fuels, meaning that their chemical compositions are similar to those of conventional fossil-based jet fuels and therefore do not require modifications in aircraft engines or supply infrastructure. However, the fact that the feedstock is non-conventional and frequently bio-based means that some additional requirements are necessary to ensure that the fuels are strictly regulated and fit for purpose.

The HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters & Fatty Acids) production pathway defined in ASTM D7566 Annex 2 is the dominant process used by current commercial-scale SAF producers. This process uses hydrogenation, cracking, and isomerisation to convert vegetable oils, waste oils and residue fats into jet-fuel like molecules. Alternatively, another approved pathway is co-processing defined in ASTM D1655 and Def Stan 91-091, where the same raw bio-ingredients are processed along with conventional crude oils.

When SAF is produced via the HEFA pathway, whether singly or co-processed, the possibility of unconverted esters and fatty acids can impact critical parameters such as thermal stability, low temperature viscosity, or freezing point. Accordingly, these parameters are specifically mentioned as additional requirements in specifications such as D7566 Table A2.1, D1655 Table A1.1, or Def Stan 91-091 Table 3.

Phase Technology’s JFA-70Xi is a three-in-one analyser specifically designed for the jet fuel industry to measure three critical parameters: freezing point according to international test methods IP 435 / ASTM D5972, kinematic viscosity at both -20°C and -40°C according to ASTM D7945, and also density. Together these parameters define the low temperature fluidity of jet fuels, critical to the safe operations of aircraft. The instrument and associated test methods have been approved in applicable global specifications of jet fuels (ASTM D1655 Table 1, ASTM D7566 Table 1, Def Stan 91-091 Annex E).

The key advantage of JFA-70Xi is the ability to measure the three critical parameters in only 15 minutes with best-in-class precision. With the superior advantage of the ASTM D5972/IP 435 automatic freezing point method to detect low levels of incidental materials and other contaminants, it is currently the referee method when SAF is co-processed to ensure that the freezing point will not be negatively impacted by levels of unconverted raw materials (see D1655-20c Table A1.1 note H; or Def Stan 91- 091 Issue 14 Table 3 Note 5). For the required viscosity testing at both -20°C and -40°C of SAF, the ASTM D7945 method is an approved alternate viscosity test method in all of ASTM D1655, ASTM D7566 and Def Stan 91-091 global jet fuel specifications.

Another advantage of JFA-70Xi is the phase plot that is generated for every test, showing the temperature vs. optical signal changes during the cooling and warming cycles.",,N,,2025-04-06 13:56:25.523447

Regional airports and local governments across the country face these continuing challenges.","ALGA News recently sat down with aviation expert and Hales North Managing Director Sara Hales to discuss local government’s key role in the future of regional airports across Australia. Ms Hales highlighted that many regional airports, largely owned by local governments, are facing significant changes and challenges.

ALGA: As you know, local governments manage and maintain many regional airports around the nation. Tell us your thoughts about how the future is looking for these important aviation assets?

Sara Hales (SH): Over the next 20 years, regional airports must deal with unprecedented change. Hundreds of new aircraft types are under development, which range across fuel types, propulsion systems, mission types and crew requirements.

The promise of electric aviation to reduce operational costs suggests a possible resurgence of intra-regional aviation and growth in general aviation. This could drive increased demand on regional airport infrastructure.

However, the mix of fleet will change, and so will customer needs. Consideration must be given to provision of alternative fuels, electric recharging and battery storage, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure. Local governments must also assess the provision of aircraft pavements, movement areas, procedures and airspace protection to support emerging aircraft types.

Many regional airports must navigate these changes with constrained cashflow and often poor financial performance. While vital to their communities – supporting business, trade, investment, health, and emergency services – they often operate at a financial loss.

ALGA: We know councils are at the forefront of climate action so how will this issue affect our airports?

SH: Climate change will continue to impact this sector, presenting both risks and opportunities. Community dependence upon aviation and airport assets will compound as regions deal with increasingly frequent fires, floods and other severe weather impacts. Changing climate conditions will also affect infrastructure lifespan, requiring adaptive planning.

Importantly, the global aviation industry will continue its march towards net zero 2050, driving airports to adapt their asset renewal and investment strategies. Carbon emissions that are free today may come at a cost tomorrow, influencing financial and operational decisions.

Thought must be given to supporting airline customers to decarbonise their operations. Shifts such as move towards electric ground handling equipment, provision of pre-conditioned air and electricity to aircraft on bay, changes to flight procedures to reduce fuel burn and consideration to taxiway gradients that support single engine taxi are all themes that regional airports much seek to accommodate.

ALGA: Gazing into your crystal ball, what does the future of regional aviation look like?

SH: In the future, aviation will likely be more important to more people and communities. Regional aviation will likely increase.

Workforce availability and retention will be ongoing challenges, alongside new responsibilities like carbon accounting and reporting. The geopolitical environment remains uncertain, and long-term capital allocation decisions must factor in emerging risks. Meanwhile, digital transformation will accelerate, with smart technologies like digital twins and Internet of Things (IoT) devices increasingly adopted, and consideration given to heightened cybersecurity threats, including AI-driven risks.

While airports can be costly, they are critical infrastructure and local gateways: difficult to replace and essential to future economic and social wellbeing and community resilience of communities. This is the strategic planning landscape for many regional airports.

ALGA: How can local government manage the financial burden of running these important community assets? How can they improve financial sustainability, enhance climate resilience, support changing customer needs and strengthen community economic and social wellbeing?

SH: Strategic planning considers these impacts in the context of the community the airport serves, identifying opportunities and risks, and aligning infrastructure investment with financial realities.

Strategic planning also involves legacy infrastructure, future proofing assets, optimising operations, and strengthening financial performance through developing productive and collaborative relationships with others. It focuses on leveraging both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue, managing risks, attracting investment, and identifying opportunities to improve cash flow.

Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously said: “The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do”. This is highly relevant to the airports, which, in our high-cost regulatory environment, cannot afford to be all things to all people.

ALGA: What is your expert advice for councils managing small airports and aerodromes?

SH: By focusing on core strengths and excluding distractions, resources can be effectively allocated to ensure success. A prime example is Virgin Australia’s remarkable turnaround, achieved through strategic clarity and disciplined execution.

Regional airports and local governments across the country face these continuing challenges.

A clear strategic direction, supported by an actionable plan, enhances financial sustainability, informs infrastructure design and supports climate resilience, and community well-being.",https://alga.com.au/app/uploads/cropped-cropped-favicon-2018-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-06 05:57:21.021338

BAGTAG fits perfectly ZERO, Ink’s new concept that redefines the airport experience. Ink ZERO takes passengers through check-in, bag drop, security, and boarding without paper or mobile phones. Using electronic bag tags within this environment supports a truly digital, efficient, and touchpoint-light journey.

Implications for the Aviation Industry

Asiana Airlines and Korean Air’s merger will change the aviation landscape globally.

Increasing Market Share in Asia

The acquisition increases Korean Air’s market dominance in Asia and abroad. Korean Air is better positioned to compete with regional heavyweights like China Eastern Airlines and Japan Airlines. Incheon Airport in Seoul is anticipated to grow in importance as a worldwide hub and play a major part in international travel.

Advantages for Travellers

The merger will have several positive effects on travellers. A larger route network will give travellers more flexibility in terms of timing and connectivity. A wider network of clients can earn and redeem points. Furthermore, by pooling resources, the airline may make investments in modernised fleets, improved lounges, and enhanced in-flight experiences.

International Collaborations and Regulatory Obstacles

The merger’s effects on airline alliances and regulatory issues are important considerations. Asiana is a member of Star Alliance, and Korean Air is a founding member of SkyTeam. The agreement has been closely examined by competition regulators across several nations, who are worried about diminished competition and possible fare hikes. Reduced competition on some routes may help some rivals, but the merged airline will also be in a stronger position to take on leading carriers globally.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-142341008_3736125383109174_8967045553856800325_n.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-05 22:56:37.045445

We have got in a bit of a habit of holidaying in Dubai every December. Going away during some of the Christmas chaos and getting some winter sun is perfect for us. We choose Dubai because it isn’t too far away, we can always use companion vouchers (as long as we book 355 days in advance) and we know what we are getting; great food, great service, and perfect weather. I know Dubai is 50/50 with a lot of people but I’m not sure what there isn’t to like when you manage expectations. If you want culture there are plenty of other places. If you want a great winter holiday with guaranteed weather, then the UAE is your place!

For the last few years, we have stayed at Le Royal Meridien (rated 11/850 hotels in Dubai), which is classed as being located in the Dubai Marina, but it is situated directly on JBR Beach too. The location works perfectly for us as Dubai Marina is a great place to explore with many restaurants and shops. It is also easy to access most other areas of Dubai by car. We stayed at the far end of The Palm once at the Waldorf Astoria and it just felt like it was a bit too far to get anywhere. It can sometimes take 20-30 minutes to leave The Palm alone.

Le Royal Meridien has been open since 1994 and is one of the original luxury Dubai hotels. You can tell how old it is purely by the fact that it isn’t a huge high rise and is on such a large plot. The good thing is that it doesn’t feel old; it has had numerous upgrades to the rooms and grounds over the years. It has 504 rooms and suites spread across three buildings. It is a Marriott Hotel and we have used points in the past to upgrade. You can also collect points on all spending in the hotel resort during your stay, which is great as the hotel has 14 different restaurants and bars with varying cuisines and styles.

Check In

The reception area is modern, grand and is always spotlessly clean. Every time we walk into this space for the first time, the very recognisable smell reminds us that we’re back to somewhere very familiar. I love that smell!

One downside to flying to Dubai with British Airways is that the two options of flights leave you checking in at either 2am or 10am. The latter is our preferred time, having had an overnight flight, but it does mean that the room is usually not ready, understandably.

The staff, however, are always very welcoming and helpful. During this stay we had two rooms, and one of them was ready, so we could dump our bags, get changed quickly and go and have a much needed nap by the pool whilst the other room was being prepared.

Room

We have stayed in a few different room types over our years of visiting. We were in the Tower Suites for our first year, which includes club access. However, these rooms have had a very large apartment block built in front of them, restricting nearly all sea views. The next year we booked a club room but asked to stay in the suites at the opposite side, which have refurbished rooms and the best views. This was much better for us, despite the fact that the walk to the club lounge was much longer.

Since having our little boy and travelling with Grandparents, we have opted for a larger, connecting room, which is the Super Deluxe 1 Bedroom Suite with Balcony and it is located in the main building.

A tip for this building is that you need to request to be on the far right hand side (if you are standing out the front of the hotel) as these rooms have the best sea view and you can see the big wheel and part of The Palm.

The room is really lovely and spacious and our favourite room we have stayed in so far. You enter into a main living area with a dining table, sofa area and mini bar/drinks station. To the left is a connecting door to the other room we had and straight ahead leads to a long balcony with the previously mentioned stunning sea views.

The bedroom is separate with a large open space, including a bigger bed which was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in, a desk, sofa and a large wardrobe area hidden behind a wall behind the bed.

The bathroom is modern with a double sink, and plenty of storage, a bath, roomy shower, toilet and bidet. The amenities are Malin and Goetz, which aren’t my favourite, but they’re still a nice brand.

The house keeping staff need to be mentioned, as they really do an excellent job. We were fully stocked with everything we needed, including more water than we’ll ever need, which is so nice to have readily available.

When we were shown to our room by the check in staff, they did ask us what time of day we would like the rooms cleaned in the morning and for turn down service. I thought this was a really nice touch, however, the message wasn’t passed on. It didn’t bother us, but our house keeping clearly took note of our routine anyway and adapted to when he was fairly certain we wouldn’t be there.

Hotel Grounds

The hotel grounds are immaculately kept and regularly updated. As I mentioned before, the hotel is based on a large plot so everything is a little spaced out which is a good thing and doesn’t bother us at all, but for anybody with mobility issues, or just not that into moving too much on holiday, there is a buggy buzzing around to take you to whichever point you need, and there is never usually a wait for it, you can just ask any member of staff to call it for you wherever you are and it’ll arrive within minutes.

There are three pool areas: main pool, infinity pool and childrens pool. We have found with the pool areas that at the time of year we go, you have to chase the sun a little. The high rise apartment block next door casts shade over all of them in the afternoon.

The water is always a little cooler than we would want it to be as well, despite being advertised as heated. It clearly is but maybe not as much as it could be.

There is also an adults only area that is located on a grass area between the three pools, it is always quite quiet there, which I guess is the point.

We spend nearly all of our time on the beach at this hotel. Le Royal has direct access to Jumeirah Beach with a really large private section. Having walked down the beach many times, we’ve always noted how small the other hotels beach areas are, and the loungers are crammed into row upon row.

Le Royal has such a wide beach area, that they have permanent wooden gazebos for each group of loungers, which is usually four between them. Each gazebo has their own buzzer to be able to buzz for service.

The food and drinks menu on the beach and by the pools is extensive and it is usually very speedy, although we have been at busier times where they haven’t had enough staff and they just can’t keep up with the orders. It’s worth mentioning at this point, though, that the staff are the main reason we keep coming back to this hotel specifically. The service is beyond what we would ever expect, and we are treated so well by each and every member of staff we come across. So many of the staff have been there since we first started going to the hotel, which seems strange in what is usually such a low staff retention industry. From speaking to them, they say that they are very well looked after and you can tell they enjoy their jobs.

One important thing to note about the beach is the noise. There are planes constantly flying overhead as the skydiving centre is directly opposite, and there are two beach clubs to the right of the hotel that play music that gets progressively louder throughout the afternoon. It actually doesn’t bother us at all, it’s nice to have background music, and watching the sky divers all day is pretty entertaining, but I can see how some people would not like it, so if you sit much further over to the left of the beach, you can eliminate some of it.

Restaurants

Originally, when coming to Dubai, we would travel out of the hotel every night and explore all of the amazing (but increasingly expensive) restaurants Dubai has to offer. However, since having our toddler with us, we have been including Half Board to our stay and staying at the hotel for most of our dinners. Now, everybody is different, but we just can’t get on board with a buffet dinner. No matter how good the offering is. When we are on holiday we like dinners to be calm and sociable with great service. The buffet at this hotel, Brasserie 2.0, is very highly regarded, and we do hear good things, but we make the most of our half board by using the dine around option. This means that you can visit almost all of the restaurants in the hotel and they have set menus that are totally included, or you can go a la carte and use AED 150 per person towards your bill. Usually with other hotels, we have found the set menus to be limited and boring; however, at Le Royal, the majority of the time, it includes most of what we would have wanted to order anyway, which makes it a very cost effective way to eat in Dubai. They usually include a few premium orders, which is a nice surprise, so you don’t actually feel like you’re eating off a set menu.

Our favourite restaurants are Zengo, which is Asian cuisine and up there with one of the best Asian restaurants we have been to, La Strega an Italian with fantastic pizza and Geales a British fish restaurant. Unfortunately, on this visit Geales was closed as they are have been refurbishing and rebranding it to The Beam. We are hoping it is just as good as before, because it was an exceptionally good place to eat for not only fresh grilled fish, but really delicious fish and chips.

The Half Board can also be used in restaurants in the sister hotel just behind called Grosvenor House. This hotel is directly on the Dubai Marina and has some really excellent places to eat. Plus there is a free shuttle between the two hotels making it very easy to get to. In fact the Dine Around can be used at over 100 restaurants throughout Dubai.

As far as hotel breakfast buffets go, Le Royal do a very good one. Like a lot of these hotels, it can get very busy, especially at peak times. They have quite a good seating system, which means you never wait too long, but it does still feel a little chaotic. There are multiple stations, from pancakes and waffles, to any egg you want, to Middle Eastern Cuisine, so a huge amount of choice, somewhat overwhelming if you’re anything like me!

When Geales was still open, if you stay in one of the suites you can have your breakfast in there. It is much smaller, with less options, but still plenty for what you need and a much calmer environment. I do hope this will be included as part of the new restaurant.

Other Amenities

During our stays here, we have used the gym quite a lot. It’s a great gym, with a range of equipment and dumbbells up to 48kg, which is a big tick for Eugene. It can get busy first thing in the morning, but never to the point that you can’t do a full workout.

The spa is located near the gym and has recently been upgraded. We didn’t use the spa specifically, but Eugene did have a massage. He said the area was nice and calming. It wasn’t one of the best massages he has ever had, so he didn’t feel like it was excellent value for money, although spa treatments in hotels rarely are.

There is also a beautifully designed Beauty Bar.

I mentioned earlier in my review about the Club Lounge. We haven’t used it for a few years as in the evenings it is Adults Only. I would definitely recommend it if you don’t have kids with you though. You can have your Breakfast there, like Geales, it is much smaller than the main buffet but fully caters for what you would need and is very relaxed. They offer afternoon tea between 3pm and 5pm, we haven’t ever done this, as we like to stay on the beach until much later, but it would be nice if you needed to get out of the sun. The biggest benefit, though is the pre-dinner drinks between 6pm and 8pm. We all know that Dubai is very expensive for alcohol, so Eugene and I used to very much enjoy a couple of drinks before dinner and it felt like we were getting very good value for the extra we had paid for Club access. They also offer a small buffet in the evening of canapes and light bites which some people have told us they can feel like they have had a full dinner from.

The kids club is open 10am to 7pm for children between the ages of 4 and 12. We haven’t been able to use it as our boy is too young, but it looks like a lot of fun and a very safe environment.

Conclusion

We really do have the best time when we stay at Le Royal Meridien. The main reasons are that we feel taken care of by the staff and it’s also the convenience. The fact that it is located so close to Dubai Marina and easy to get to the rest of Dubai is a huge bonus, but also the fact that if you aren’t doing a really long holiday, you don’t need to leave the hotel at all because of the large range of restaurants and the value of the Half Board.

Whilst looking for other hotels in Dubai, we also haven’t seen a beach area that can compete with Le Royal’s unless you go a bit further out.

We are definitely keen to try some other hotels around Dubai, but the key thing for us to beat is the restaurant choice and beach area, so if you have any recommendations, let us know!

Na última sexta-feira (28), ocorreu a primeira reunião técnica do Grupo de Trabalho (GT) de Transportes do BRICS, por videoconferência. O encontro, que reúne representantes do Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul, focou em discussões sobre transporte sustentável e conectividade aérea, alinhando prioridades que serão apresentadas na cúpula prevista para julho, no Rio de Janeiro.

O Ministério de Portos e Aeroportos (MPor) do Brasil destacou suas iniciativas voltadas à sustentabilidade nos modais de transporte, com ênfase na mobilidade urbana. Entre os tópicos em pauta, a redução de gases poluentes e a promoção de energias limpas no setor aéreo foram destacados. O Brasil, que é precursor na produção de combustíveis sustentáveis para aviação, apresentou suas ações, como a implementação de fábricas de petróleo sintético para criar o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

O GT também discutiu a descarbonização dos portos e do transporte marítimo, propondo a adoção de combustíveis de baixo carbono, alinhando-se assim às metas da Organização Marítima Internacional para diminuir as emissões de Gases de Efeito Estufa (GEEs). Uma das propostas que surgiu foi a criação de um sistema de suprimento energético diretamente dos portos para os navios, uma solução potencial para melhorar a eficiência energética na navegação.

Outro ponto significante da reunião foi a proposta de uma Aliança Logística Internacional do BRICS, destinada a promover uma logística mais ágil e eficaz em situações de emergência humanitária. O grupo se baseou em eventos recentes, como a tragédia no Rio Grande do Sul, para justificar a necessidade de uma resposta mais rápida em situações similares.

Com a presidência brasileira do bloco iniciada em janeiro, o GT de Transportes do BRICS tem mais duas reuniões programadas para abril e maio deste ano, culminando em uma reunião ministerial em Brasília que deve apresentar os resultados alcançados. Esta movimentação pretende preparar o terreno para a 17ª cúpula dos BRICS, que ocorrerá em julho. O Brasil definirá como tema central desta cúpula ""Fortalecendo a Cooperação do Sul Global para uma Governança mais Inclusiva e Sustentável"", buscando consolidar relações exteriores e promover iniciativas de inclusão social e sustentabilidade.

A cúpula não contará apenas com os membros fundadores – Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul – mas também com países convidados como Arábia Saudita, Egito, Emirados Árabes Unidos, Etiópia, Indonésia e Irã, além de diversos outros membros associados que compõem o grupo.

E-Jet SAF meets the specifications of ASTM D7566 Annex A1.
Why choose E-Jet SAF over other SAFs?
Unlike biofuels, which are constrained by land use and deforestation risks, E-Jet SAF is electrochemically produced from CO2, water, and renewable energy.
Twelve aims to produce millions of gallons per year by the end of the decade, partnering with airlines and corporate partners to use E-Jet fuel, E-Jet attributes or SAFc, and E-Naphtha-based chemicals.","Twelve's E-Jet® SAF is a breakthrough for powering sustainable aviation.

What is E-Jet SAF?

E-Jet® fuel is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), also known as eSAF, made from CO2, water, and renewable energy. It’s drop-in ready for existing aircraft engines and cuts lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, with lower sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate emissions. E-Jet SAF meets the specifications of ASTM D7566 Annex A1.

Why choose E-Jet SAF over other SAFs?

Unlike biofuels, which are constrained by land use and deforestation risks, E-Jet SAF is electrochemically produced from CO2, water, and renewable energy. Compared to biofuels, it uses up to 1,000 times less water and 30 times less land, with up to 30% more reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to bio-based SAF.

E-Jet SAF allows airlines and travelers alike to significantly decrease their emissions now without having to retrofit planes and supply chains.

What does E-Jet SAF cost?

Powered by clean energy, E-Jet® SAF will become cost-competitive with conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel once it reaches full scale.

Is E-Jet SAF in production?

In July 2023, construction began at Twelve’s AirPlant™ One facility in Moses Lake, WA. Once operational, it will be the first commercial-demonstration scale E-Jet SAF plant.

E-Jet production will start in 2025, with an initial capacity of up to 50,000 gallons/year.

How fast can E-Jet SAF production scale?

Twelve aims to produce millions of gallons per year by the end of the decade, partnering with airlines and corporate partners to use E-Jet fuel, E-Jet attributes or SAFc, and E-Naphtha-based chemicals.

What are the barriers to scaling?

Scaling requires access to affordable clean energy (solar, wind, hydro), biogenic or direct air capture CO2 sources, and innovative project financing partners to unlock the next generation of fuels to power the industrial transformation.

How impactful is E-Jet SAF?

E-Jet® SAF has far lower lifecycle emissions than other fuels.

Learn more:Know Your SAF: Guide to Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

Conventional jet fuel: 11.9 kg CO2e/gal

Alcohol to Jet (SAF): 3.3 - 8.8 kg CO2e/gal

E-Jet® SAF: 0.6 - 2.0 kg CO2e/gal

What is Twelve’s impact on global emissions?

Twelve’s carbon transformation technology has the potential to cut up to 10% of global emissions, including 50% of hard-to-decarbonize industrial emissions. At full deployment, it could address 2-3 gigatonnes of CO2 per year.

Who are Twelve's customers?

Twelve is proud to partner with Alaska Airlines, Boston Consulting Group, International Airlines Group, Shopify, and more.

Interested in partnering? Contact us here.

How can corporate customers purchase SAF credits from Twelve to offset operational/travel emissions?

Corporate customers can directly contact Twelve to purchase sustainable aviation fuel credits (SAFc) to offset their scope 3 emissions, i.e. operational and/or travel footprint. These credits are transferred to the customers once the E-Jet fuel that is associated with the credit purchase has been used by an airline. Alternatively, corporate customers can jointly purchase E-Jet fuel in partnership with any airline of their choice and retire the credits as needed. Twelve works with industry-leading registries like the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance and the International Air Transport Association to transfer the credits to customers with lifecycle traceability.

Now, over a decade later, the ongoing investigation has been temporarily suspended until the end of 2025.

Search Suspended due to Weather Complications

After an inconclusive initial four-year investigation, Ocean Infinity announced plans to resume the search for the missing flight in December of 2024. A few months since the promise of further exploration, the search has been put on pause due to weather limitations affecting the search area of the Indian Ocean.

“Right now it’s not the season” stated Malaysian Government Transport Minister, Anthony Loke. “I think they have stopped the operation for the time being and will resume the search at the end of this year”.

Loke made the statement at a press conference held at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, following the arrival of airline British Airways’ first flight to Malaysia after reinstating their Kuala Lumpur route.

A Timeline of Missing Flight MH370 – A Decade of Limited Discovery

Despite undergoing the largest search in aviation history, the missing Boeing 777 which carried 239 passengers is yet to be found. Here is a short summary of what we know after a decade of search efforts.

2014: Disappearance and Initial Search

On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur at 00:42 local time, set to land in Beijing. The last known voice contact records the aircraft’s captain stating “Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero”. Two hours after takeoff, the airline lost contact with the aircraft, and it had vanished from civilian radar. Malaysia Airlines issued a press statement announcing a loss of contact with the plane.

Search and rescue operations began, concentrating on the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca. By the end of the following day, more than 40 aircraft and 24 vessels from several nations were contributing to the search. On March 10, the Royal Malaysian Air Force confirms the flight made a “turn back”.

As the search and rescue phase turned to efforts of search and recovery, a series of investigations were undertaken. A sonar search of the seafloor began on April 14 and concluded on May 28, finding no debris.

2015 – 2017: The Search Continues and Draws to a Close

Underwater searches continued to take place, and by January 28, 2015 after countless speculation, Malaysia declares the disappearance an accident.

After finding unrelated debris on Reunion Island, debris confirmed to be from the missing aircraft is found on the islands of Pemba and Mauritius in September and October of 2016. However, the discovery of this debris did not result in uncovering the location of the main body of underwater wreckage. The underwater search came to an end in January 2017.

2018 – Today: Private Company Ocean Infinity conducts Series of Searches

Searches resume in January 2018 under private company Ocean Infinity who agree upon a “no find, no fee” arrangement with Malaysia.

Going forward, retail success will depend on adopting a scalable, digital infrastructure capable of evolving alongside changing sustainability and compliance demands.","As governments enact sweeping regulations to eliminate forced labor, child exploitation, and environmental abuses, companies are under growing pressure to take full responsibility for every link in their global sourcing networks. From the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to America’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), these laws are reshaping how businesses monitor and verify the conditions under which products are made. Combined with increasing consumer demand for transparency on human rights and environmental practices, these forces are driving a fundamental shift in how companies oversee their supply chains. To navigate this new landscape, companies must embrace advanced digital tools that enable real-time visibility and accountability at every level of their supply chains. Increasingly, these tools extend beyond raw material sourcing to offer full visibility across a product’s entire life cycle, from design and production to delivery and disposal, enabling brands to address sustainability and labor concerns from start to finish.

Technology is making it possible to achieve the level of oversight that regulators and consumers now demand. Multi-enterprise supply chain platforms and new artificial intelligence innovations are playing an increasingly pivotal role in monitoring supplier networks, ensuring compliance, and mitigating risks before they escalate into legal or reputational crises. These tools offer capabilities that traditional compliance methods never could. Rather than relying on periodic audits that provide only a limited snapshot of a supplier’s conditions, AI enables continuous monitoring, alerting companies to potential labor violations in real time. With an estimated 50 million people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, including 28 million in forced labor, proactive oversight is critical.

While all industries are susceptible to labor abuses, fashion is uniquely vulnerable to them. The U.S. Department of Labor has identified countries including India, Turkey, China, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Benin, Brazil, and Egypt as high-risk areas for child labor, particularly in the production of cotton and leather. Given the prevalence of child labor – 160 million children globally, according to the International Labor Organization – brands cannot afford to ignore what’s happening in the deeper tiers of their supply chains. AI-driven supply chain mapping tools help solve this problem by tracing every component back to its origin, identifying all parties involved in production, including subcontractors, and flagging any links to suppliers that have been associated with forced labor or environmental violations.

AI and automation are proving to be indispensable for achieving compliance at scale. By analyzing massive datasets, AI can detect anomalies that might indicate exploitative practices, such as sudden fluctuations in labor costs or unusual supplier turnover rates. These red flags allow brands to take corrective action before violations escalate into full-blown crises.

AI-powered document verification also streamlines compliance by building a complete chain of custody for each item and ensuring that suppliers’ certifications are legitimate, reducing the risk of fraudulent claims about ethical sourcing practices. These capabilities are critical as bad actors continue to falsify sustainability credentials, making it difficult for brands to separate trustworthy suppliers from those merely paying lip service to ethical sourcing.

Beyond regulatory compliance, investing in AI-driven traceability solutions is becoming a strategic imperative for brands looking to build consumer trust. Studies show that 66% of U.S. consumers consider sustainability when making a purchase, and many are willing to switch brands based on sustainability practices. Companies that can offer proof of ethical sourcing will gain a competitive edge, while those that fail to do so risk losing consumer confidence. The need for more sophisticated supply chain monitoring will only grow as new regulations come into force and consumer expectations continue to rise. AI’s role in this space will expand beyond compliance and risk mitigation to include predictive capabilities that help companies make smarter sourcing decisions. AI is increasingly able to anticipate potential disruptions, helping companies adjust their sourcing strategies in real time. The most forward-thinking brands are already leveraging AI to enhance their sustainability efforts, using machine learning to optimize procurement decisions, reduce waste, and lower their overall environmental footprint.

Leading supply chain platforms are integrating these AI-driven solutions into a single, seamless system that manages everything from supplier onboarding to compliance verification. These capabilities help companies monitor supplier risk, analyze compliance documents, and track the chain of custody for each order, creating a verifiable record of responsible sourcing.

Accountability in supply chains is intensifying. Governments are cracking down on unethical sourcing, and consumers are demanding greater transparency. The companies that embrace AI and traceability solutions now will be best positioned to thrive in this new reality. Companies that delay adoption, however, will find themselves vulnerable to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and lost consumer trust.

Eur Ing Hong Wai Onn—a chartered chemical engineer, chartered environmentalist, and founder of the Research Institute for Sustainable Excellence and Leadership (RISEL), offers groundbreaking insights into how biomass valorization could revolutionize the sector across the continent.

Converting Agricultural Waste into Economic Opportunity

“We cannot continue to view palm biomass as waste,” Hong emphasizes. “Every strand of fiber, every discarded fruit bunch represents an untapped opportunity for innovation and sustainability.”

This perspective is particularly relevant for Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, where palm oil production continues to grow as a vital economic sector. By implementing biomass valorization technologies, these countries could transform what is currently considered waste into valuable resources, effectively creating new revenue streams while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.

A Dual Approach to Climate Mitigation

Hong's advocacy for biomass valorization extends beyond economic benefits to offer a concrete pathway for emissions reduction. “Biomass valorization is not just an industrial solution,” he explains, “it's a pathway to reducing carbon emissions and breaking our dependence on fossil fuels.”

The conversion of palm oil biomass into ethanol presents particularly promising opportunities. This bioethanol can be blended with conventional fuels, reducing fossil fuel consumption, or further upgraded through the Alcohol-to-Jet pathway to create Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“This alternative route is becoming increasingly important,” Hong notes, “as the current focus on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids pathway will eventually face feedstock limitations.” With used cooking oil supplies becoming fully utilized, ethanol derived from palm biomass offers a more scalable and sustainable alternative for SAF production.

Beyond Ethanol: Diversifying Value-Added Products

The potential for biomass valorization extends beyond ethanol. Empty fruit bunches can also be processed into butanol, which serves as a drop-in fuel for maritime applications. Research in this area has advanced beyond laboratory and pilot stages, with plans for semi-commercial production plants already underway.

For African palm oil producers, these developments represent an opportunity to leapfrog traditional production methods and establish more advanced, environmentally conscious industries from the outset.

Strengthening Sustainability Standards

Hong has played a key role in shaping the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Standards. His deep insights and extensive experience, particularly in the upstream sector, have been instrumental in strengthening Malaysia's sustainability framework.

“I see MSPO as on par with internationally recognized certification standards like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In fact, MSPO certification is mandatory in Malaysia, meaning that every single drop of palm oil produced in the country is sustainably certified,” he emphasizes. His commitment to advancing environmental and industry standards offers valuable insights for African producers developing their own frameworks.

Hong acknowledges that continuous improvement in standards is essential. “No standard is perfect or time-resistant. Continuous improvement is necessary, which is why standards need to be reviewed regularly,” he explains. One key area for enhancement could be strengthening carbon emissions accounting and carbon footprint reporting. “If a palm oil company is valorizing and upcycling palm biomass, it should be recognized and credited for such initiatives. Perhaps certification systems could explore closer collaboration with carbon credit mechanisms to incentivize sustainable practices,” he suggests.

Hong's recognition as the first Malaysian engineer granted the Freedom of the City of London underscores the global significance of his work. This honor reflects not just individual achievement, but the potential of sustainable development to transcend national boundaries.

The Freedom of the City of London is one of the oldest surviving traditional ceremonies still in existence today, and it has been bestowed upon notable figures such as Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. Being admitted into this esteemed group places Hong among a distinguished list of individuals who have made impactful contributions to society, highlighting the international resonance of his efforts in advancing sustainability and engineering excellence.

Overcoming Implementation Challenges

Despite its potential, biomass valorization faces hurdles in implementation. “The high capital investment required can be a barrier at this stage,” Hong acknowledges. However, with economies of scale and appropriate government support, these obstacles can be overcome.

“Imagine a scenario where ethanol blending in petrol is mandated, and domestically produced ethanol from biomass qualifies for double-counting due to its low carbon intensity,” he suggests. “This could elevate ethanol prices to a level where biomass valorization becomes commercially attractive.”

Such policies would simultaneously reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower the carbon footprint of palm oil industries—""a classic case of killing two birds with one stone,” as Hong puts it.

A Vision for Africa's Palm Oil Future

Through RISEL, Hong Wai Onn continues to advocate for sustainable development approaches that could be transformative for Africa's agricultural sectors. “It's certainly not an easy journey,” he concludes. “We're paving the way for a new model of sustainable industrial development—one that supports nations in accelerating their progress toward net-zero emissions targets.”

For African palm oil producers, this vision offers a compelling alternative to conventional development paths—one that transforms environmental challenges into economic opportunities while positioning the continent's palm oil industry at the forefront of sustainable innovation.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/RnIktkqTURBXy82ZjQ0ZmRlYTUwYTI3ZjUzNTA1ZWNiZTQ4NzZmYTAyMi5qcGVnkpUDAADNA_HNAjiTBc0EsM0Cdg,N,,2025-04-05 14:56:28.947486

Dreams of the sparkling green hydrogen industry of the future are withering on the vine in the US, but they are still alive and kicking in other parts of the world. The EU, for example, is vigorously pursuing new opportunities to import the stuff from other countries. Too bad President Trump has blown up a chance for US producers to get a piece of the action, but them’s the breaks.

Pro tip: Next time, don’t vote for the convicted felon.

Green Hydrogen Imports Coming To The EU

Green hydrogen fans have had a tough row to hoe. The industry is still in the early stages, with stubbornly high costs, supply chain gaps, shifting public policies, and buyer resistance among the factors leading some stakeholders to pull back or leave the business altogether.

Still, the nations of Europe are among those depending on green hydrogen to decarbonize heavy industries. The additional attraction of pushing Russia out of the EU energy import picture is also at work.

In addition to domestic production, the EU is leaning on overseas markets to feed its green hydrogen hunger. Among the opportunities to surface on the CleanTechnica radar, Canada is laying plans to export its green hydrogen to Europe through Belgium, and stakeholders in northern Africa are eyeballing a pipeline to the EU through Italy.

In other news, Bloomberg reports that TotalEnergies is planning to import green hydrogen from Brazil to supply its petroleum refineries in Europe.

Then there’s Ukraine, which not a member of the EU — yet. The country officially became a candidate for EU accession in 2022, after Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Ukraine has an ample supply of wind and solar power, as well as copious stocks of biomass for producing green hydrogen. Even with the war raging into its fourth year, Ukraine is still pursuing plans to export hydrogen to the EU through an existing network of pipelines that sprawls around Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Germany.

Another Loss For US, Another Gain For EU

The leading green hydrogen producer Air Liquide caused many a tear to shed in the US when it announced a pullback on its green hydrogen commitments. The French firm was initially involved in six new Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs organized through the US Department of Energy in 2023.

The Hydrogen Hubs program was funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with a stipulation to include natural gas with carbon capture, as well as renewables. The law is the law, but the Republican majority in Congress has refused to hold Trump to any law, preferring to dump its responsibilities onto the judicial branch. As a result, nothing was done to stop Trump from suspending the program after he took office on January 20.

Air Liquide, for one, saw the writing on the wall. In February, the company let word slip that it is still committed to the two hubs that incorporate natural gas. However, the company adopted a wait-and-see stance on the other four hubs, in consideration of the abrupt shift in federal energy policy.

But, that was not the end of the green hydrogen story for Air Liquide. Last month the company resurfaced with plans for a 200-megawatt electrolyzer project in Rotterdam and a 250-megawattt facility in the Netherlands. Both projects are aimed at supplying green hydrogen for heavy duty transportation and other industrial uses, in addition to supplying TotalEnergies’ refineries.

Yet Another Green Hydrogen Loss For The US

The similarly named firm Air Products also packed up and took its business elsewhere after Trump took office, though for other reasons. On February 24 the Pennsylvania-based company with a global reach announced that it is shelving plans to build a 35-tonne-per-day liquid green hydrogen facility in Massena, New York, citing an unfavorable decision regarding tax credits and “slower than expected development of a hydrogen mobility market in the region.”

In the same announcement, Air Products also bailed on a sustainable aviation fuel project in California and a carbon monoxide project in Texas. “The decision to exit these three projects will streamline our backlog and focus Company resources on projects that drive value for Air Products’ shareholders,” the company explained.

Among those other value-driving projects is the company’s massive green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia, attached to the country’s ambitious NEOM planned city. “The NEOM green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia is approaching 80 percent completion, with green ammonia production expected to commence at the end of 2026,” Air Products notes.

Saudi Arabia has already lined up Germany as an off-taker for its green hydrogen. Word of the deal with Germany surfaced in February, and last week it became official.

The Electrolyzer Angle

In another interesting development, on April 1 Reuters was among the news organizations reporting that Belgium tasked its Monarch, King Philippe, to travel to Vietnam with a large entourage for some deal-making in a number of areas including green hydrogen.

The leading Belgian electrolyzer firm John Cockerill took a preliminary step towards investing in a Vietnamese electrolyzer factory during the trip. “A spokesman for the Belgian firm said the agreements were the first step for a possible investment in a Vietnam factory to manufacture pressurised alkaline water electrolysers,” Reuters reported.

As for why all this overseas outreach is going on, that’s easy. There are not enough domestic projects in the pipeline to meet the EU’s ambitious green hydrogen targets.

The US-based energy transition think tank RMI ran the numbers and produced a report last month noting as much. “Executing this vision has proved difficult, with many early expectations — such as rapid progress, cost reductions, and broad offtake applications — now proven to be overly ambitious or unattainable in the short term,” RMI observed.

To get back on track, RMI advises drawing back on the idea of deploying green hydrogen for “low-impact” uses, like heating buildings or fueling light-duty vehicles, and focus instead on priority areas. “Public and private investments should be directed to steelmaking, fertilizers, refining, aviation, and shipping; sectors where hydrogen provides the most decarbonization value,” RMI states.

“Allocating resources to low-impact uses like heating and light-duty vehicles represents inefficient use of scarce public funds and risks delaying necessary transitions through electrification and energy efficiency measures,” they emphasize.

“It’s time to retire any lingering misconceptions of hydrogen as a Swiss army knife for economy-wide decarbonization,” they add for good measure.

RMI also indicates that the EU will have to import green hydrogen in order to meet its near-term goals, which it is doing. If you can guess how much of that imported product will come from the US, drop a note in the comment thread.

There are high hopes for the expansion of the SAF industry and the increased use of SAF in the aviation fuel mix.
The growth in SAF production is expected to support the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate aviation industry in the coming decades.","There is an increasing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as airlines worldwide strive to decarbonize operations. Aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, meaning that it is difficult to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with aviation activities. However, airlines around the globe are increasingly incorporating SAF into their fuel mixes to reduce emissions, with many planning to significantly increase the use of SAF in the coming decades. To achieve this, governments and private companies must invest heavily in SAF research and development, as well as production, to advance the industry in line with aviation decarbonization targets.

SAF is an alternative to conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel, produced using non-petroleum feedstocks. It can be blended with jet fuel, with limits between 10 to 50 percent at present, to help reduce aircraft emissions. More than 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF at 46 different airports, mainly in the United States and Europe, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Aviation continues to contribute around 2.5 percent of all carbon emissions and 12 percent of the CO2 emissions from the transport industry. The ICAO aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which it will achieve primarily by increasingly using SAF to fuel flights. The 2021 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge brings together multiple U.S. federal agencies for the purpose of expanding domestic SAF consumption to 3 billion gallons in 2030 and 35 billion gallons in 2050.

Some of the feedstocks used to produce SAF include the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, and fats, greases, or oils. SAF production is in the early stage of development, and there are only three known commercial producers in the U.S. at present; World Energy, Neste, and Montana Renewables LLC.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute around 65 percent of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The IATA expects new technology, electric and hydrogen, to contribute 13 percent of this reduction, infrastructure and operational efficiencies 3 percent, and offsets and carbon capture 19 percent. However, achieving this will require the significant scaling of production, which is expected in the late 2030s, as SAF becomes competitive with fossil kerosene and credible offsets become scarcer.

While there are high hopes for SAF to help decarbonize the aviation industry, a 2024 report from the think tank The Institute for Policy Studies found that the SAF industry is lagging behind climate targets. The report showed that there was “no realistic or scalable alternative” to conventional kerosene-based jet fuels and said SAF are well off track to replace them within the timeframe required to avert dangerous climate change, despite public subsidies. The report stated, “While there are kernels of possibility, we should bring a high level of scepticism to the claims that alternative fuels will be a timely substitute for kerosene-based jet fuels.”

Chuck Collins, the co-author of the report, said, “To bring these fuels to the scale needed would require massive subsidies, the trade-offs would be unacceptable and would take resources aware from more urgent decarbonisation priorities.” Collins added, “It’s a huge greenwashing exercise by the aviation industry. It’s magical thinking that they will be able to do this.”

In the U.K., 50 percent of all agricultural land would need to be given up to sustain current flight passenger levels if jet fuel was entirely replaced, according to the report. This demonstrates the significant difficulties in scaling SAF production.

By 2030, global demand for SAF is expected to reach 17 million tonnes per year, equivalent to between 4 to 5 percent of total jet fuel consumption, according to the World Economic Forum. This would require an estimated $19 to $45 billion in investment to achieve.

However, while some regions of the world are falling behind, others are making strides in SAF development. In Asia, the SAF supply is expected to outpace regional demand in 2025 and 2026 as new production facilities open. This is expected to drive down prices, something the aviation industry has long been waiting for. At least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have commenced or are expected to start production this year. However, the compulsory use of SAF in the jet fuel mix is currently non-existent across Asia, with the first compulsory use of SAF beginning in 2026, as Singapore and Thailand enforce a 1 percent mandate. South Korea will introduce a 1 percent SAF mix in 2027, and Japan has a 10 percent mandate for 2030.

There are high hopes for the expansion of the SAF industry and the increased use of SAF in the aviation fuel mix. The growth in SAF production is expected to support the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate aviation industry in the coming decades. However, while the aviation sector is optimistic about this shift, others are more doubtful that SAF can be scaled at the level required to significantly drive down emissions.

The Influence of Competition Even though Ryanair dominates the European low-cost travel market, it faces fierce competition from EasyJet, Transavia, and Vueling.","Ryanair is considering cutting flights to and from France in 2025, which would be a major change for low-cost travel in Europe.

Motives for the Choice

Several reasons are thought to be behind the airline’s plan to reduce French flight routes.

Rise in operating expenses

The growing expense of operating in France is one of the main elements determining Ryanair’s choice. Budget air travel has become less affordable due to new environmental charges on airline tickets imposed by the French government. Furthermore, rising fuel prices and airport taxes have made the economy more difficult for low-cost airlines like Ryanair.

Difficulties with Regulation

France’s stringent labour rules have caused conflict between Ryanair and regulatory bodies in the past. In France, airlines must adhere to strict employment laws, which raise staffing costs and increase the risk of labour strike interruptions.

Strikes by Air Traffic Control (ATC)

In recent years, France has experienced several air traffic control strikes that have caused several flight cancellations and delays. Due to these disruptions, Ryanair, one of the biggest low-cost airlines in Europe, has been disproportionately impacted, resulting in enormous financial losses and unhappy customers. The airline has advocated for reforms throughout Europe on several occasions to stop national ATC strikes from impacting aircraft that are merely flying over France.

The Influence of Competition

Even though Ryanair dominates the European low-cost travel market, it faces fierce competition from EasyJet, Transavia, and Vueling. Ryanair may find it more difficult to uphold its low-cost business model while adhering to local laws and taxes in France amid rising competition.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ryanair.jpg?fit=1024%2C603&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-05 13:56:50.376186

This is the second major aviation reform under his leadership. The bill aims to bring India’s aircraft leasing and financing system in line with global norms, helping attract more investment into the country’s fast-growing aviation sector.

The bill is based on the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which was designed to make international aircraft leasing deals more straightforward and consistent. Although India signed on to this convention in 2008, the lack of proper legal backing led to leasing costs being 8 to 10 per cent higher than in many other countries. This new law is meant to fix those legal loopholes, giving more assurance to aircraft lenders and lowering leasing expenses for Indian airlines.

Stressing the need for the new legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister outlined the goals behind the move and credited strong leadership for the aviation sector’s rapid growth. He shared striking numbers to back this up from independence until 2014, around 10.38 crore passengers flew annually in India. But by 2024, that number had more than doubled to 22.81 crore. The number of airports also saw a big jump, from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more expected to open soon. The fleet size followed a similar trend, rising from 340 aircraft in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. The minister noted that no other country has seen such fast-paced aviation growth in a short time.

The proposed bill aims to simplify aircraft leasing, attract more aviation investment to India, and boost the country’s compliance with the Cape Town Convention. These steps are expected to cut airline costs and make it easier for new players to enter the market.

During discussions on the bill, broader issues facing the civil aviation sector arose, especially the steep cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which makes up nearly 45% of airline operating expenses. The minister highlighted concerns about the varying ATF tax rates across states and encouraged more states to cut their taxes, as some already have. He noted that doing so would help improve regional air connectivity and make flying more affordable for passengers.

Looking ahead, the Civil Aviation Ministry has set bold goals focused on sustainability and expanding capacity. By 2025, it plans to produce 2.5 crore litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and shift more than 100 airports to renewable energy sources, showing India’s strong push toward eco-friendly aviation.

Another major challenge is the rising need for skilled pilots, with an estimated requirement of 30,000 to 34,000 in the next 10 to 15 years. To tackle this, the government is working on setting up more Flight Training Organisations (FTOs) and increasing the number of commercial pilot licenses issued each year.",https://myind.net/sites/default/files/field/image/d05f8b56_whatsapp_image_2025-04-05_at_12.28.56_399413b8.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 08:56:25.714370

The event brought together industry participants, experts, and various stakeholders to deliberate on strategies for enhancing ethanol production and the utilization of the existing assets with the addition of grain modules.

India’s commitment to the Ethanol Blending Program has led to significant policy measures aimed at augmenting ethanol production. To address the seasonal availability of sugarcane, the Government of India has announced financial assistance to support cooperative sugar mills with existing/running ethanol plants for conversion into multi-feedstock-based plants. The initiative includes interest subvention for those cooperative sugar mills that supply ethanol to Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for blending with petrol to produce ethanol from various feedstocks, including cereals like maize and damaged food grains (DFG).

Looking beyond E20, the GoI is exploring higher ethanol blends such as E85 for four wheelers, E100 for two-wheelers, diesel blending, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to further reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy security.

Union Minister of Cooperatives, Amit Shah recently spoke in Gujarat at the groundbreaking ceremony of two cooperative sugar mills, highlighting that the Cooperatives Ministry has launched several initiatives to support over 60 crore farming families. He also emphasized that the Global Biofuel Alliance could help India become a major player in the international ethanol market and that, once domestic production surpasses local consumption, India could export ethanol globally, benefiting farmers and the economy.

Speaking at the workshop, Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Founder Chairman of Praj Industries, stated, “As we transition beyond E20 in India, the focus must be on expanding feedstock options, enhancing production efficiency, and tapping into global markets. With the Global Biofuel Alliance opening new avenues, Indian distilleries have the potential to become key players in the international biofuel trade. At Praj, we remain committed to pioneering sustainable solutions that drive India’s energy security while creating economic opportunities for farmers and industries alike.”

Atul Mulay, President – Bioenergy, Praj Industries, stated, “With our proven expertise and leadership in bioenergy solutions, Praj is committed to driving India’s next phase of ethanol expansion. By supporting the adoption of grain-based ethanol production, we are reinforcing our dedication to the nation’s energy security and sustainability goals.

Leveraging our advanced technologies and robust manufacturing infrastructure, we are strengthening India’s ethanol ecosystem, enabling year-round production, and paving the way for a more self-reliant and greener future.”

Rajesh Tope, a veteran cooperative leader and Former Minister for Public Health and Family Welfare of Maharashtra, who attended the workshop, commented, “Praj’s workshop was exceptionally insightful and timely for the industry, offering in-depth knowledge on advanced ethanol production technologies. By leveraging existing machinery and adopting grain-based modules, mills can ensure year-round operations, significantly enhancing efficiency and profitability. This addition can boost revenue margins by ₹300-₹400 per tonne of cane crushed, making it a transformative step for the sector. Availability of feedstock at right price will also be important for success of this program.

Water-saving and steam-saving technologies are the need of the hour, and it was encouraging to see solutions like air-cooled condensers showcased at the workshop. Furthermore, generating CBG from spent wash and press mud presents an effective way to manage hazardous spent wash while aligning with the waste-to-energy principle.

This forward-thinking initiative will not only strengthen ethanol production but also improve financial sustainability for mills and accelerate India’s biofuel ambitions.”

The workshop served as a platform for knowledge exchange, showcasing the latest advancements in ethanol production technologies and the strategic roadmap for achieving higher blending targets, while also addressing key concerns such as the availability and pricing of raw materials.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dr.-Pramod-Chaudhari.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 08:56:29.507262

Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 tonnes of SAF that will help reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 tonnes. The extension to the agreement enables Microsoft to address Scope 3 lifecycle emissions and is the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement to date between an airline and corporate customer, according to publicly available data.

Scope 3 encompasses lifecycle carbon emissions that are not produced by a company itself, but that it is indirectly responsible for up and down its value chain. By partnering with its corporate customers, IAG is able to purchase more SAF and reduce its Scope 1 (direct) emissions. Corporate customers also benefit by lowering Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from the industry commensurate to a proportion of their corporate flying.

“We’re pleased to work with like-minded organisations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions,” said Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Officer, IAG. “Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF that is used by the Group’s airlines to ship data centre components globally, in partnership with Microsoft’s freight forwarders. Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.

“We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production,” said Julia Fidler, Environmental Sustainability Fuel and Materials Decarbonization Lead, Microsoft. “We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

Using alternative fuel sources – rather than newly extracted fossil materials – means SAF releases existing carbon, instead of adding new carbon from fossil fuels to the atmosphere. By the end of 2024, 1.9% of IAG’s total fuel usage for the year was SAF and total expenditure, including future commitments for SAF offtakes, exceeded $3.5 billion.

The SAF used as part of the IAG and Microsoft agreement will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery, and from sustainably source bioethanol at Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, LanzaJet’s facility in the United States. Both fuels are certified by International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, a $1 billion initiative supporting new climate technologies through investments, has previously invested in LanzaJet. LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines facility is the world’s first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet production facility and will supply SAF to British Airways.

He also predicted a ""gloves-off"" competition to build a next-generation airplane with Airbus' US rival Boeing.
Folding wings Airbus engineers are looking to longer wings to create more lift and reduce drag, which in turn means using less fuel.
The latest generation of airliners, like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, use carbon fiber-reinforced polymers in the wings and fuselage.
There are still more than 10 years before Airbus sees its next generation of planes taking to the skies.","While Airbus has pushed back plans for a hydrogen-powered plane, it plans to build a high-tech plane that is cheaper and more environmentally friendly.

Business Insider got a look at the tech that might drive it.

At its recent summit in at its headquarters Toulouse, France, CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters it was developing a new single-aisle aircraft to succeed its A320 family and enter service in the second half of the 2030s.

He said the hydrogen-powered plane was canceled as it risked being ""a Concorde of hydrogen"" and not commercially viable at scale.

He said a next-generation plane would not come with ""incremental optimization"" but ""clean sheet designs."" He also predicted a ""gloves-off"" competition to build a next-generation airplane with Airbus' US rival Boeing.

This is the new tech it's developing.

Open-fan engines

Higher fuel efficiency is a major discussion point in aviation, but making it happen will require ""a fundamental change in the shape of the engine,"" said Mohamed Ali, GE Aerospace's chief technology and operations officer.

Turbofan jet engines work by taking in air. Some of this air enters the engine core where it is mixed with fuel and combusts to drive the turbines. The rest of the air is accelerated by the fan and bypasses the core.

Engines which have a higher proportion of bypassed air are more fuel efficient. However, this ratio is limited by the size of the intake duct.

""Here is the solution, and that's the beauty of physics. You can remove that duct and go to open fan,"" Ali said.

While today's engines have a bypass ratio of up to 12:1, Ali said current designs for an open-fan engine would improve that to 60:1.

Airbus and CFM — a joint venture between GE and Safran — plan to test open-fan engines on an Airbus A380 by the end of the decade.

They are also planning for the new engines to be able to operate entirely with sustainable aviation fuel. This can be produced from plants and cooking oil, but its takeup has so far been hindered by high costs and a lack of availability.

Folding wings

Airbus engineers are looking to longer wings to create more lift and reduce drag, which in turn means using less fuel. However, the size of a plane's wings is limited by the size of airport gates.

Yet if the wingtips can fold, planes can still have longer wings in flight and fit into airport gates on the ground.

If this sounds familiar, you might've seen something similar on the coming Boeing 777X, although Airbus is planning to first use it on narrow-body planes.

""If you think about the next generation of single-aisle aircraft, it will fly many times a day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,"" said Sue Partridge, head of the Wing of Tomorrow program. ""That folding wing system needs to work reliably.""

New materials and some automation

Another step forward in fuel efficiency could be found in new composite materials.

The latest generation of airliners, like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, use carbon fiber-reinforced polymers in the wings and fuselage. These are stronger and lighter than aluminum, but more advances could be made.

""We are working on the next generation of composite materials, with our material suppliers working as partners with us,"" Partridge told the summit.

Just before the summit began, Reuters reported that both planemakers are looking at thermoplastics for future aircraft.

Single-aisle planes are more popular than widebodies, with Airbus eyeing a target of producing 75 a month.

""We need to be able to make our aircraft and our wings at high rate and at a cost that's actually sustainable for our business,"" Partridge said.

She added that the Wing of Tomorrow program was looking at robotic and automation technologies to see how they could speed up manufacturing.

Automation won't just take place in the factories, however.

At the summit, BI rode in a self-driving van testing Airbus' new autonomous technology, Optimate.

It's been testing cameras, radar, and lidar to help follow airport lines for autonomous taxiing and to avoid potential collisions. Near misses have been growing more common in recent years, and Airbus also predicts there will be twice the number of aircraft in 20 years.

AI could also be used to predict traffic and help pilots reroute around turbulence or bad weather.

There are still more than 10 years before Airbus sees its next generation of planes taking to the skies.

Faury, the CEO, compared the process to ""a caterpillar in a cocoon becoming a butterfly.""

""In this transition, there's a bit of paralysis,"" he said. ""There's a lot of forces at stake, it's painful, and then the butterfly takes off. We don't know what it looks like until we're there.""

""We remain committed to our purpose, which is to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world,"" he added. ""We think it's a beautiful purpose, but it's not an easy one.""",https://i.insider.com/67e5434b63d72727e19861b1?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-04-05 04:56:31.906191

Dhaka: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has officially introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, now under the management of the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO).

This new platform aims to accelerate the global adoption of SAF and support the aviation industry's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.""

Described as a“critical platform” by IATA, the SAF Registry enables airlines and industry stakeholders to track, verify, and claim their SAF usage in a secure and transparent way.

It ensures that environmental benefits from SAF purchases are recorded immutably, eliminating the risk of double counting – an essential step in building trust and accountability in the carbon reduction process.

“Aviation's decarbonisation is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO, we have put in place a system that benefits all stakeholders, airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate customers. It is a foundational tool for building a transparent, global SAF market.”

Thomsen, however, emphasised that the registry is only one piece of the puzzle. She also called on governments to urgently shift financial support from fossil fuel industries toward renewable energy development, including SAF.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” she said.

As SAF continues to emerge as a key solution for decarbonising air travel, the launch of the registry marks a major milestone, bringing structure, trust, and momentum to the global effort to make aviation more sustainable.

The registry, now live, aims to create a transparent global marketplace for SAF by securely recording environmental attributes of transactions to prevent double counting—ensuring emissions savings are claimed only once by purchasers.

SAF, a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, is critical to aviation’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The registry will allow airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate clients to document and verify SAF purchases, streamlining compliance with climate obligations. IATA emphasized that the platform’s immutability—a safeguard against data manipulation—is key to building trust among stakeholders.

“This registry is a foundational step, but not a silver bullet,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist. “Governments must now prioritize policies that scale renewable energy production, including SAF, by redirecting subsidies from fossil fuels to green energy—just as they did for wind and solar.” Thomsen stressed that without urgent policy shifts, the industry’s decarbonization timeline risks delay.

The initiative arrives as global SAF production remains minimal, accounting for less than 0.2% of total jet fuel demand. While over 50 airlines have pledged to use 10% SAF by 2030, supply chain bottlenecks and high costs persist. The registry seeks to mitigate these challenges by enhancing market liquidity and transparency, though analysts caution that production incentives and infrastructure investments remain unresolved.

The SAF Registry’s launch reflects aviation’s growing reliance on collaborative frameworks to meet climate targets. Similar registries, like the European Union’s emissions trading system, have faced criticism for complexity and uneven enforcement. However, CADO’s centralized governance model could address past fragmentation, particularly in regions lacking robust carbon accounting systems.

Historically, renewable energy transitions have hinged on policy-driven subsidies. IATA’s call to replicate wind and solar incentives underscores the urgency: SAF production must grow 3,000% by 2030 to meet industry targets. Yet geopolitical tensions, feedstock limitations, and competing demands for biofuels complicate this trajectory.

For now, the registry’s success hinges on widespread adoption. If integrated into national climate frameworks, it could unlock cross-border SAF trading and attract private investment. But as Thomsen noted, “miracles” require more than data tools—they demand a global policy pivot toward renewables, starting today.",https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IATA.png,N,,2025-04-05 17:56:12.241046

Energy is a big issue, and policies that jump-start that aspect of the American economy are what many people voted for last fall. Farming states can help supplement domestic energy production with the right federal policy.

Today, America is in danger of falling behind global competitors in producing critical sources of sustainable aviation fuels. The administration’s goal is energy independence, yet the aviation industry is in danger of becoming dependent on sustainable fuels from China and Brazil. The nation needs to make progress on sustainable fuels.

With the right policies, Congress can expand sustainable aviation fuel production, consumption and distribution. The administration could take executive action on energy independence by dedicating resources to this issue.

One goal of tariffs is to leverage better trade deals with China. If we don’t act soon, China and Brazil will fill the void and send sustainable aviation fuels for use by U.S. aircraft. American airline companies want to source fuel from U.S. agriculture and distributors, yet the capacity is not present.

Domestic businesses are eager to produce. Advantage News reported in March, “Illinois stands to become (a) leader in the production of sustainable aviation fuels.” It reported that “corn and soybean farmers in Illinois look to benefit from another byproduct of their fields. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduce emissions from air transportation. It takes about 1.5 gallons of ethanol to make one gallon of sustainable aviation fuel.”

American aircraft can use up to 50% of sustainable fuels mixed with jet fuel. Innovation has progressed so that by 2030 aircraft can fly with all sustainable fuels. This is an innovation that Congress and the administration should exploit.

The Department of Energy has set high targets, and the tax code is structured to give tax credits to produce sustainable aviation fuels. Farmers and energy producers have benefitted from innovation that allows the conversion of crops, waste, captured gasses, biomass and plants as a resource for making these fuels. More needs to be done.

One way to stimulate investment is to extend and improve tax credits. An “all of the above” approach embracing fossil fuels in addition to jet fuel from farmers will allow airlines to stop buying from China and Brazil. Regulation and red tape that slow permitting and the production of biofuels need to be reformed.

Fracking, drilling and mining are helping us get to energy independence. Yet, more can be done by targeting agriculture, timber and bioenergy to produce more, thus supplying increased sources of sustainable fuels.

The Brazilian CEO of Itaipu, Enio Verri, who is in Brasília, recorded a welcome video and made the company available to the deputies.
Binacional’s executive financial director, André Pepitone, presented the panel “The socioeconomic and energy security role of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant”.
The vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies' Mines and Energy Committee, congressman Gabriel Mota (Republicans-RR), praised the initiative and the opportunity to discuss the sector with other entities in the sector.
“Industry cannot function without energy, families need energy, schools need energy, hospitals need energy, and Brazil continues to be a source of clean, renewable energy, currently playing a very important role,” he added.","Members of the Chamber of Deputies' Mines and Energy Committee met in Foz do Iguaçu (PR), this Thursday, the 3rd, at the Itaipu hydroelectric plant, to discuss the main challenges and opportunities of the Brazilian electrical system, such as energy transition, energy production and commercialization and the impacts of the new electrical matrix on consumer tariffs.

The meeting was coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), with support from Itaipu Binacional and institutions in the electrical system. The Brazilian CEO of Itaipu, Enio Verri, who is in Brasília, recorded a welcome video and made the company available to the deputies.

According to the executive secretary of the MME, Arthur Cerqueira Valério, the objective of the meeting was to promote rapprochement between the electricity sector and the parliamentary committee.

“The idea here is to explain to parliamentarians our structure and our challenges, so that they have a better understanding of the complexity of the sector and the difficulties faced on a daily basis. In addition to presenting a little of the grandeur of Itaipu and the work that is carried out here,” he said.

Binacional’s executive financial director, André Pepitone, presented the panel “The socioeconomic and energy security role of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant”. The debates were attended by the general director of the National Electric System Operator (ONS), Marcio Rea; the president of the Energy Research Company (EPE), Thiago Prado; the president of the Board of Directors of the Electric Energy Trading Chamber (CCEE), Alexandre Ramos; and the director of the National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel), Agnes Maria de Aragão da Costa – among other authorities in the sector. Also present on behalf of Itaipu were Iggor Rocha (administrative) and Luiz Fernando Delazari (legal).

The vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies' Mines and Energy Committee, congressman Gabriel Mota (Republicans-RR), praised the initiative and the opportunity to discuss the sector with other entities in the sector. The new board of directors of the committee took office just two weeks ago.

“We will address important issues here and I have no doubt that it will be of great value,” he said.

“First, because [energy] is a vital sector and a key input for any society,” added Congressman Danilo Forte (União/CE), a member of the committee. “Industry cannot function without energy, families need energy, schools need energy, hospitals need energy, and Brazil continues to be a source of clean, renewable energy, currently playing a very important role,” he added.

Role of Itaipu

In his presentation, Pepitone spoke about Itaipu's legal nature, governance aspects, and detailed the control and prevention mechanisms adopted by the company. He explained that Itaipu maintains a Compliance department to ensure that the company is in compliance with current laws, regulations and internal standards; an Ombudsman's Office, which is a channel for complaints and information for internal and external audiences; and Internal Audit, which acts at any stage of the contracting process.

In addition, Itaipu hires an External Auditor through a bidding process to assess the compliance of the accounting statements with international accounting standards and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which establishes strict corporate governance rules.

“This requirement further reinforces transparency and rigor in the monitoring of the company’s resources,” said the director.

Pepitone also presented to the deputies details of the agreement signed with Paraguay in April 2024, and the contributions to the Commercialization Account managed by ENBPar, which allowed the maintenance of Itaipu's tariff at US$ 16,71 kW.month for the Brazilian market from 2024 to 2026, the same value practiced in 2023. It is the lowest value of the plant's energy in more than 20 years, standing at R$ 204,95/MWh for the consumer.

“Itaipu currently maintains one of the lowest tariffs in Brazil, positively impacting the lives of millions of Brazilians,” emphasized the director.

According to ANEEL Order No. 3.080 of October 10, 2024, the average cost of energy acquisition by distributors for 2025 was estimated at R$307,29/MWh. Thus, according to Pepitone, Itaipu offers an advantageous price for Brazilian consumers and contributes significantly to tariff affordability, since its transfer value to distributors is substantially lower than the Pmix – the average transfer price of all distributor contracts.

Energy and sustainability

In addition to contributing to the low tariffs, the executive financial director noted that investments in regional development projects are part of Itaipu's business mission and were reinforced by reversal note 228, exchanged between the governments of Brazil and Paraguay in 2005, establishing that initiatives in the field of social and environmental responsibility “must be included as a permanent component in the energy generation activity”.

These investments – currently organized in the Itaipu Mais que Energia program – benefit 11 million Brazilians in 434 municipalities in Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul, with effective results, such as the recovery of more than 8 thousand springs, the development of 33 environmental sanitation plans, the construction of 90 Recyclable Recovery Units (UVRs), support for indigenous and fishing communities and improvements to the infrastructure of 80 philanthropic hospitals.

At the same time, the company today stands out as a protagonist in the global debate on energy transition, supporting events such as the G20 meetings and the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP), and investing in research into new energy sources, such as solar, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Another piece of information addressed by the director was the amount paid by Itaipu in royalties since 1984, directly benefiting six Brazilian states and 347 municipalities, in addition to the federal government. In 2024, this amount reached R$1,2 billion. For comparison purposes, this amount is more than three times the amount paid by the 59 plants that are members of the National Interconnected System (SIN) as financial compensation for the use of water resources.

“In other words, Itaipu’s actions and socio-environmental investments are not a temporary choice or a choice made by the current administration, but a commitment established by both countries. And most importantly, even while continually investing in social and environmental projects, Itaipu maintains one of the lowest energy rates in Brazil, proving that it is possible to combine sustainability, energy security and economic efficiency,” concluded Pepitone.

Technical visit

This Friday, the 4th, as part of the program of the Meeting of Deputies of the Mines and Energy Committee, the parliamentarians will participate in a technical visit to the Itaipu hydroelectric plant and will learn about the Meninos do Lago social canoeing project, maintained by Binacional and which serves young people in vulnerable situations in Foz do Iguaçu and the region.",https://folhadolitoral.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250403WB1377-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 12:56:28.019169

Labour corporate welfare for Rolls-Royce

In the 2023/24 year, government subsidies to corporations totaled £32 billion. The year before, they were £53 billion because gas inflation not only increased bills but also the government increased corporate handouts to profiteering fossil fuel companies. And now Starmer has announced a further £22 billion bung to the fossil fuel sector for carbon capture projects that don’t work.

Add in Rolls-Royce and its potential subsidy, and the situation is ridiculous.

Energy isn’t the only privatised sector where we’re paying twice. 2023/24 government subsidies to the railway industry totaled £23 billion. When you take a train, remember you already paid for some of the ticket. Labour is bringing the operating network for rail into public ownership, but it is leaving the trains themselves privatised. That means we will still be renting the actual trains from the private sector as it milks us dry.

The ‘rolling stock’ companies that hoard the trains have paid dividends to shareholders at £3.6 billion since 2014/2015, according to research from We Own It.

Sustainability and aircraft

One positive thing is that Rolls-Royce is committed to making its engines compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80%. SAF production needs to dramatically increase to address climate change.

The fuel could become cheaper than fossil fuels if production increases, but companies and the aviation industry are currently sleeping at the wheel. At present, one flight can emit as much Co2 as some people do in a whole year.

Another facet to Rolls-Royce is that it makes engines for military aircraft, suppling 160 customers in 103 countries. Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) reports that arms total 32% of its sales.

If Rolls-Royce wants people to publicly fund it, then it should operate as a not-for-profit. Meanwhile, it’s a no brainer than energy and rail should be fully publicly owned.

• British Airways frequent flyer scheme changes: everything you need to know But since the relaunch of the Club last week there have been some extra grumbles from frequent flyers.
Much of it has centred on the lack of clarity around spend on BA-branded American Express credit cards, which confers bonus tier points to members and makes it easier to achieve elite status.
However, they have been reassured by the airline that these points will be credited to the previous collection year.
“It’s a novel idea for BA Club members, but it might catch on,” he says.","Flyers now earn one “tier” point per pound spent with the flag carrier, with the threshold for the silver level set at 7,500 points, up from 600. A small silver lining — pardon the pun — is that for the first time passengers can also earn tier points from booking packages with British Airways Holidays, as well as extras such as increased baggage allowances, seat selection and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)credits

When the changes were announced at the end of December there was an outcry from loyal passengers, with Rob Burgess, founder of the frequent-flyer website Head For Points, saying that the new scheme “makes it very clear to the leisure and small-business market that British Airways has no interest in their loyalty”; although Gilbert Ott, founder of God Save the Points, defended the inclusion of spending on package holidays.

This backlash prompted BA to tweak the new scheme in February. It reintroduced passengers’ ability to earn status if they fly a certain number of times with the airline — 25 for bronze and 50 for silver — regardless of the cost of the flights; plus a tier points bonus offer to provide “clarity” to its customers.

• British Airways frequent flyer scheme changes: everything you need to know

But since the relaunch of the Club last week there have been some extra grumbles from frequent flyers. Much of it has centred on the lack of clarity around spend on BA-branded American Express credit cards, which confers bonus tier points to members and makes it easier to achieve elite status. In December the airline announced that holders of the premium card could earn up to 2,500 extra tier points — or £2,500 worth — “by spending on their card”, but then said that it would reveal details “later in 2025” about exactly how much would need to be spent. This information has not yet been revealed, although it is understood that clarification is not far off. Last week frequent flyers who moaned at the airline on Twitter about the lack of detail around Amex spend were told by BA that it was “coming soon”.

Meanwhile, those who booked last-minute flights before the March 31 deadline to earn enough tier points to push them into a higher status bracket have found that their points were not credited in time and have instead been converted to the new system. However, they have been reassured by the airline that these points will be credited to the previous collection year.

BA said: “As part of the new British Airways Club we’ve provided more certainty for customers by extending the bonus tier point offer to the end of the year, introduced more ways than ever to earn tier points and we have a way to reward leisure customers that we haven’t in the past with an uncapped British Airways Holidays proposition. In 2025 British Airways American Express Premium Plus Card members will be able to earn up to 2,500 tier points by spending on their card, with more details on this offer coming soon.”

• Travellers are obsessed with status — and airlines are going into battle for their loyalty

Other airlines have been cannily looking at the fallout from BA’s scheme and tweaking their programmes, and it is possible to earn the same status and perks by joining the schemes of other airlines in the Oneworld association, of which BA is a member. By collecting Avios and points with the Oneworld members Qatar Airways and Iberia, for example, passengers can earn status more easily and enjoy the same perks as holders of BA silver and gold cards, including free seat selection, priority check-in and lounge access. Meanwhile, Royal Jordanian, also part of the Oneworld alliance, offers a “status match” that guarantees the same elite status for a small fee.

Kenton Jarvis, the chief executive of easyJet, said that Europe’s second largest airline — increasingly viewed as an alternative to BA — was considering launching a loyalty scheme in the wake of the Club changes, although he admitted that there were no imminent plans.

There are new schemes from the ultra-low-cost airlines too. At the end of March Ryanair launched Prime, a subscriber discount scheme that for £79 a year gives members reserved seats, travel insurance and access to a monthly exclusive seat sale. It says that passengers who fly more than 12 times a year will save with this offer, although frequent flyers will note that baggage is not included.

Last September Wizz Air, which mainly flies to Europe, along with some mid-haul routes to Saudi Arabia, launched a popular “all-you-can-fly” product. It costs £599 for the year and allows passengers to take an unlimited number of flights — although baggage costs and an £8 admin fee per flight are chargeable.

• British Airways’ loyalty changes are the end of middle-class flight perks

“We can also expect a new wave of matches from these airlines next spring as current BA elite members face up to status expiry on April 30,” Burgess says. “And easyJet also smells blood and will hopefully have its own loyalty scheme up and running by the end of the year, ready to match British Airways’ elites.”

If not, he advises passengers to become “free agents” — selecting flights based on price, schedule and the airline service. “It’s a novel idea for BA Club members, but it might catch on,” he says.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO), a new independent body tasked with managing the upcoming global registry for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, said CADO would oversee the SAF registry as an entity separate from IATA, operating under a global methodology designed to ensure transparency and build trust among stakeholders.

“The creation of CADO supports IATA’s soon-to-be-launched SAF Registry and reflects our commitment to rigorous oversight,” Owens Thomsen said. She called on all relevant parties across the SAF value chain, including governments, to join the organisation and support its mission.

A new warning from the Bank of Spain highlights a quiet but urgent issue just as the country gears up for its busy summer travel season: certain 50-euro bills are being withdrawn from circulation starting this April.

These aren’t counterfeit notes. They’re real banknotes that have been stained—usually with blue or violet ink—by anti-theft security systems embedded in ATMs. This technology is designed to fight physical theft by releasing a chemical dye if tampering is detected. The result? A stained bill that’s no longer usable in shops, restaurants, or even for personal exchanges.

What Makes These 50-Euro Bills So Problematic?

The 50-euro bill is the most commonly used note in Spain. Its mid-range value makes it ideal for tourists paying for meals, train tickets, or souvenirs. Unfortunately, it’s also the most targeted for both counterfeiting and anti-theft staining. When these notes get marked with ink, they’re considered invalid—even though they’re not fake. This presents a big problem for travelers who may unknowingly accept them in transactions.

It’s important to note that the ink-staining system doesn’t make a bill counterfeit, but it does render it unfit for future use. If you try to spend one, you may be denied service or questioned. And if you received the bill during a legitimate transaction, you likely won’t get reimbursed—unless you can prove you were the direct victim of a crime.

As part of this recall, the Bank of Spain is asking everyone to double-check their cash—especially bills received through informal exchanges or small businesses that handle a lot of paper currency. Since the stains may look subtle or accidental, travelers could easily miss the warning signs.

If you spot a suspicious blue or purple mark on a 50-euro note, don’t attempt to use it. Instead, bring it to a local bank branch, where staff can analyze the note and determine if a replacement is possible. The process may take time and doesn’t guarantee reimbursement, but it’s the best available option.

Why Now? Summer Season Brings More Cash—and More Risk

Spain’s tourist season sees a significant rise in cash payments, especially from international travelers who may prefer cash over cards to avoid foreign transaction fees. This influx also increases the chances of fraudulent or damaged notes entering circulation. By recalling these ink-marked bills, Spanish authorities aim to reduce confusion and prevent unnecessary losses during the peak travel months.

At the same time, Europe is experiencing a gradual shift away from physical currency. The latest report from the Bank of Spain shows that while most people still use cash regularly, digital payments through cards and mobile apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay are quickly catching up. In fact, countries like Sweden are already well on their way to becoming nearly cashless.

Governments across Europe are encouraging this shift to digital payments not just for convenience, but also to curb tax evasion and reduce untraceable transactions. For tourists, this means paying by card or app is often the safer choice—especially in unfamiliar cities or when dealing with large sums of money.

Still, many travelers prefer to carry at least some cash for emergencies, small purchases, or tipping. If that’s you, make sure to inspect every note you receive. Look carefully for any signs of discoloration or blotchy ink, particularly in shades of blue or violet. If you’re unsure, ask for another note or head to a bank before continuing your travels.

This move by the Bank of Spain is less about causing panic and more about raising awareness. It’s a proactive step to ensure travelers and locals alike aren’t left with unusable money—and to stay one step ahead of fraudsters in a rapidly changing financial landscape.

One such implication has to do with biofuel, an energy carrier that is central to both industries’ plans, in particular because biofuels can be blended with conventional shipping and aviation fuel.
The implication for the maritime sector is clear: the role that biofuels can play in its energy transition will be small at most.
For a variety of reasons, ammonia may be a compelling option for fuel-shifting in the maritime shipping sector.
Turning marine sector targets in achievable strategy Country representatives, industry groups, and nongovernmental organizations are gathering in London for the 83rd convening of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee.","The aviation industry and the maritime industry have both made commitments to reduce their net greenhouse emissions to near-zero by midcentury. A variety of measures of varying effectiveness and reliability can be deployed to lower the industries’ net emissions – efficiency improvements, mode-shifting, on-shoring, and out-of-sector offsets, to name a few – but the most important, most impactful step will be to deeply reduce the carbon intensity (CI) of the fuels that power airplanes and marine vessels.

A wholesale shift to low carbon intensity energy carriers poses huge quantitative and qualitative challenges for the two industries, particularly because they need to move in concert. The challenges associated with the shift and the tools that might be used to address them are connected in ways that have important implications for each sector’s decarbonization strategy. One such implication has to do with biofuel, an energy carrier that is central to both industries’ plans, in particular because biofuels can be blended with conventional shipping and aviation fuel. In recent model runs that consulting firm DNV prepared for the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime sector demand for biofuel reaches 2.0-7.8 Exajoules (EJ) by 2050 – or roughly 47% to 181% of the 4.3 EJ of biofuels currently produced worldwide.1

The problem, in short, is that the amount of biofuel the two industries expect to use going forward far exceeds the amount of existing biofuels, and scaling new climate-beneficial biofuels and supply chains entails significant challenges. Airlines have fewer alternatives when it comes to energy carriers so they will be highly motivated to outspend marine shipping companies (and every other industry) for all the biofuel they can get. The implication for the maritime sector is clear: the role that biofuels can play in its energy transition will be small at most.

As the International Maritime Organization finalizes a set of industry-wide, midcentury decarbonization targets this month, a measure of its commitment to those targets will be the extent to which it acknowledges the competing demands that will frustrate biofuel-based strategies and prioritizes the development of other low-carbon energy carriers and compatible propulsion systems.

Massive demand for biofuel in both industries faces limited supply and climate-beneficial supply challenges

The total amount of energy that the aviation sector and the maritime sector will need in 2050 is projected to be about 38 EJ – 24 EJ for aviation and 14 EJ for maritime. Any number of things – upturns or downturns in the global economy, major shifts in demographics, policy, or consumer behavior – could cause the actual level of energy demand from the two sectors to be substantially higher or lower than 38 EJ, but the challenge remains unavoidably stark: the aviation and maritime sectors are set to consume roughly the same amount of energy each year as India currently does, and all that energy will need to be clean.

And not just any form of clean energy will do. The process of moving a cargo-laden, 200,000-tonne vessel across ten thousand kilometers of ocean favors energy-dense fuels, especially because the amount of space dedicated to on-board energy storage affects the amount of paying cargo a ship can carry. Aircraft have even less leeway. Because liquid fuels that pack a lot of energy into a small and lightweight package help mitigate the fundamental difficulty of getting and staying aloft, energy-dense hydrocarbons power the vast majority of aviation applications and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Battery-powered aircraft are under development, but they face formidable constraints around size and range.

For years, then, the aviation industry has looked to biofuel as the energy carrier it could lean on to achieve deep emission reductions. It popularized a generic-sounding term for the fuel – “sustainable aviation fuel” or SAF – that appropriates biofuels’ promise of a carbon-neutral, closed-loop future while also keeping some distance from biofuel’s real challenges. Regardless of how it’s marketed, though, SAF made from biogenic matter is still biofuel – which means that bio-SAF production at scale poses many of the same challenges to food markets, water quality, and ecosystem health that have made the mass production of ethanol and biodiesel for on-road vehicles so problematic.

The environmental benefit of conventional biofuels on a per-unit basis typically gets smaller as overall production levels get bigger. Fuels made from wastes like crop residue and other advanced feedstocks can deliver real reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions, but the supply of suitable waste biomass is limited, and it remains to be seen if other advanced feedstock supply chains can be significantly scaled. The vast bulk of biofuels made today come from commodity oilseeds and starches like soy and corn grown with emitting inputs on prime farmland. Producing exajoules worth of biofuel is easier and cheaper when the feedstocks are cultivated, harvested, and processed on huge tracts using industrial agricultural equipment and practices. Sustainable intensification and strategic perennialization of agricultural land could increase climate-beneficial feedstock supply, but expanding biomass supply chains could cause direct or indirect conversion of grasslands and forests into agricultural land, depending on how the biomass is grown.

As detailed by CATF in Decarbonizing Aviation: Challenges and Opportunities for Emerging Fuels (2022), the International Energy Agency (IEA) published a determination that the global supply of “sustainable” biofuel could roughly triple between 2021 and 2030. Setting aside doubts that such an increase could occur without driving significant land use change-related GHG emissions, CATF compared IEA’s 2030 supply estimate to the projected energy demand from the aviation sector and found that the entire global supply of biofuels would amount to 69% of the energy that aircraft will need in 2030, 59% in 2040, and 52% in 2050. A subsequent report from CATF, Decarbonizing Aviation: Enabling Technologies for a Net-Zero Future (2024), outlines the extent to which the aviation industry will need to rapidly develop and deploy other energy carriers like synthetic SAF and hydrogen, given that all the world’s liquid biofuel can only meet about half of the sector’s mid-century energy demand. The process of commercializing synthetic hydrocarbons will be slow and expensive; the same is true for introducing hydrogen aircraft. Employing high-quality offsets from direct air capture or biomass carbon removal systems (which may produce hydrogen as a co-product) will also require a significant amount of time to scale. As such, the aviation industry will want to mitigate the related financial and logistical challenges by maximizing its use of bio-SAF, so it is unlikely to get outbid for the available supply of biofuel, especially by industries that can turn to other options.

The marine shipping industry must look beyond biofuels to decarbonize

Fortunately, marine shipping is one of those industries that has enough operational flexibility to avoid getting into a bidding war with the aviation sector. In Managing the Transition to Zero-Carbon Marine Fuels (2024), CATF shows how ship owners can gradually but significantly reduce their emissions by deploying dual-fuel engine technologies and phasing in low-carbon fuels.

For a variety of reasons, ammonia may be a compelling option for fuel-shifting in the maritime shipping sector. The production of ammonia is massively scalable because its constituent parts – nitrogen and hydrogen – are nearly inexhaustible (although isolating hydrogen is energy-intensive). However, like biofuels, optimal engineering practices and management strategies must be implemented to avoid high reactive nitrogen losses, which could negate any GHG emissions reductions. Ammonia can be used as fuel in both purpose-designed and modified internal combustion engines (ICEs), either neat or in a blend with petroleum fuel. Marine vessels are especially well-positioned to use ammonia-fueled ICEs because they can accommodate heavier engines and larger fuel tanks more easily. Many ports already site and build ammonia storage and handling equipment, which could help lessen the chicken-or-egg problem that often confounds the transition to alternative transportation fuels. Finally, more work needs to be done to test ammonia’s safety as an energy carrier, but marine vessels are already fueled and operated by professionals who can be trained to handle it safely.

Turning marine sector targets in achievable strategy

Country representatives, industry groups, and nongovernmental organizations are gathering in London for the 83rd convening of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee. The agenda is anything but dry: the delegates are set to approve measures “aimed at driving the international shipping industry’s transition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by or around, i.e. close to, 2050.” The measures to be endorsed are a global pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions and “a goal-based marine fuel standard that will phase in the mandatory use of fuels with less GHG intensity.”

The carbon intensity standard will be a powerful tool for eliminating maritime sector emissions, provided the IMO designs the standard to account for global, multi-sector trends in the energy market. Because one of those trends is the growing mismatch between demand for low-carbon biofuels and the volume at which biofuels can be sustainably produced, a carbon intensity standard for the maritime sector that assumes significant access to biofuels is destined to fail.

The maritime sector’s new midcentury targets are commendable. But targets require execution, and execution requires commitment and foresight. Industry and governments can demonstrate their commitment to the mid-century targets by supporting the development of viable decarbonization pathways that don’t depend on access to biofuel (e.g., by limiting the extent to which biofuels can earn compliance credits under a clean fuel standard or by subsidizing the use of synthetic fuels), and they can demonstrate foresight by steering investment toward dual-fuel engines, on-board storage technologies, bunkering facilities, and other technologies that support the transition to ammonia and/or other massively-scalable low-carbon fuels.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02104338/GettyImages-1300225698-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 23:56:46.916995

IATA represents 340 airlines that comprise over eighty percent of global air traffic. The SAF Registry will be managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) and seeks to encourage the shift toward net zero emissions by 2050.

What is the SAF Registry?

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry is a global system, created by the International Air Travel Association (IATA) to record and organise fuel transactions. The standardisation of these accounts allows for greater transparency of fuel purchases and consumption. This, in turn, can be used to stimulate the achievement of environmental aims. The Registry has been developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, original equipment manufacturers, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies. There are currently over 30 early users who are in the process of onboarding and ready to use the SAF Registry system.

The SAF Registry is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO). The Canadian-based not-for-profit was created by IATA in March 2025 for the sole purpose of maintaining and operating the Registry. As a founding member, IATA continues to provide technical and operational support for the SAF Registry.

What are the aims of the SAF Registry?

SAF is a scarce resource and is only attainable in a few countries around the world. The Registry will help to connect airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, simultaneously reducing the issue of geographical distance and lessening the challenge of limited SAF supply. This new network encourages a call for an accelerated transition toward decarbonisation, highlighting a responsibility to support renewable energy sources by lowering costs. In addition to this, the Registry allows for increased communication and connectivity, benefiting global harmonisation.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist said:

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort. In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.

You can earn up to 1,000 Tier Points per membership year by purchasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credits. You can do this via cash or Avios and effectively buy tier points.

What Are Sustainable Aviation Fuels?

If you’ve seen the term SAF pop up more often recently and wondered what it means, here’s what you need to know. SAF is an alternative to traditional jet fuel made from synthetic aviation fuels, aviation biofuels, or recycled carbon aviation fuels.

When burned, they produce carbon dioxide levels similar to conventional aviation fuels, but the carbon dioxide generated is already part of the carbon cycle and not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel.

The end result is a reduction in carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. SAF is still in short supply and accounts for just 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use. BA was legally required to use a minimum of 2% SAF by 2025, which will increase to 10% by 2030.

The Cost and Value

Reminder: 1,000 Tier Points do not have the value they used to. You now need 1,500 for Bronze, 7,500 for Silver and 20,000 for Gold.

You can spend a maximum of £1,000 on SAF contributions each membership year (1st April to 31st March) or each £1 you spend on SAF, you will be awarded 10 Avios and 1 tier point.

You can track the number of Avios and Tier Points you would earn on the SAF calculator on the landing page:

You can also purchase this amount using 125,000 Avios.

However, you would get 10,000 Avios back paying with Avios, making it 115,000 Avios, which is still a very poor value.

Spending £1,000 or 125,000 Avios is equivalent to saving 4.31 tonnes of CO₂e. You can track the amount you spend on SAF contributions on your British Airways Club statement. You can also look at the Tier Point awarding tracker on the landing page:

When Would Purchasing SAF be Worth It?

Forget about Tier Points for a moment. If you would consider contributing to SAF without your transaction being able to earn Tier Points, that’s a personal decision.

If you’re purchasing SAF to increase your Tier Point balance, this is only really worth it if you’re short of just a few tier points needed to reach the next tier without flying. Even then, you need to think that each Tier Point is £1 and how much reaching the next Tier in The British Airways Club is worth for you. If you’re using Avios to purchase SAF for this purpose, is the transaction the best use of your Avios?

Where is Your Money Going?

The SAF transaction is processed by BA’s partner Chooose.

According to the T&Cs:

“When you contribute to SAF today, you are doing so by purchasing the attributes associated with a given amount of unblended, physical SAF which British Airways has flown or will fly on in the next 12 months. The sale of these attributes provides you, a buyer, with a claim to the carbon reduction benefit associated with the purchased amount of SAF“.

How This Differs from Other Airlines

Iberia Plus: The revamped Club Iberia loyalty programme offers plenty of ways to earn tier points from non-flight activities. At least these are live, as opposed to BA, which has launched the new British Airways Club without revealing details of how to earn tier points with AMEX! With Iberia, you can earn up to 30% of your status requirement through non-flying partners.

Air France-KLM: Instead of relying on a separate platform or asking members to manually “boost” their balance post-booking, Air France and KLM have integrated SAF donations directly into the flight booking process.

It would be good to see more BA partner activities count towards status!

Other Things to Note

There is a £10 minimum per transaction.

Your tier points and Avios should be credited to your account within 72 hours.

Final Words

There’s no doubt that contributing to Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a good thing in principle. It’s great to see BA making it part of their net zero push.

Before you rush to start spending Avios, you should know that while it’s great to have more ways to earn Tier Points, this is arguably one of the worst-value opportunities unless you’re in a very specific situation. Unless you’re just short of the next tier and have no travel planned before your membership year ends, spending £1,000 or 125,000 Avios for 1,000 Tier Points is hard to justify.

It’s up to you whether you want to contribute to SAF. If you do this, it’s best not to do it solely to earn tier points but more for the environmental benefits.

IATA SAF REGISTRY LAUNCHED

The SAF Registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way.

It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost-recovery basis.

Significantly, this Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply —which is acutely scarce. SAF is currently available in only a few locations globally.

The Registry thus connects airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location.

In addition, it gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonization.

The SAF Registry is technology and feedstock-neutral, therefore favoring the emergence of diverse SAF production streams across the world.

It will be able to accommodate specific regulations while favoring global harmonization.

Moreover, interoperability with other registries is an important feature of the Registry, supporting competition and open markets.

The Registry was developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, as well as corporate travel management companies.

With over 30 early users already in the process of onboarding and ready to use the system, the Registry is underpinned by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology which provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, regardless of location.

Tallow suppliers in Brazil for instance were already experiencing decreased interest from US producers before tariffs.
In general, market participants say international tallow suppliers would have to drop offers to keep trade flows intact.
But tariffs on major suppliers of tallow to the US, and the threat of additional charges if countries retaliate, could give refiners pause.
Biofuel producers in these zones could theoretically refine foreign tallow, claim a 45Z subsidy, and avoid feedstock tariffs as long as they ship the fuel abroad.","New US tariffs on nearly all foreign products could deter further imports of beef tallow, a fast-rising biofuel feedstock and food ingredient that had until now largely evaded President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape global trade.

Tallow was the most used feedstock for US biomass-based diesel production in January for the first month ever, with consumption by pound rising month to month despite sharp declines in actual biorefining and in use of competing feedstocks. The beef byproduct benefits from US policies, including a new federal tax credit known as ""45Z"", that offer greater subsidies to fuel derived from waste than fuel derived from first-generation crops.

Much of that tallow is sourced domestically, but the US also imported more than 880,000t of tallow last year, up 29pc from just two years earlier. The majority of those imports last year came from Brazil, which until now has faced a small 0.43¢/kg (19.5¢/lb) tariff, and from Australia, which was exempt from any tallow-specific tariffs under a free trade agreement with US. But starting on 5 April, both countries will be subject to at least the new 10pc charge on foreign imports. There are some carveouts from tariffs for certain energy products, but animal fats are not included.

Some other major suppliers — like Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand — will soon have new tariffs in place too, although tallow from Canada is for now unaffected because it is covered by the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.

Brazil tallow shipments to the US totaled around 300,000t in 2024, marking an all-time high, but tallow shipments during the fourth quarter of 2024 fell under the 2023 levels as uncertainty about future tax policy slowed buying interest. Feedstock demand in general in the US has remained muted to start this year because of poor biofuel production margins, and that has extended to global tallow flows.

Tallow suppliers in Brazil for instance were already experiencing decreased interest from US producers before tariffs. Brazil tallow prices for export last closed at $1,080/t on 28 March, rising about 4pc year-to-date amid support from the 45Z guidance and aid from Brazil's growing biodiesel industry, which is paying a hefty premium for tallow compared to exports.

While the large majority of Brazilian tallow exports end up in the US, Australian suppliers have more flexibility and could send more volume to Singapore instead if tariffs deter US buyers. Export prices out of Australia peaked this year at $1,185/t on 4 March but have since trended lower to last close at $1,050/t on 1 April.

In general, market participants say international tallow suppliers would have to drop offers to keep trade flows intact.

Other policy shifts affect flows

Even as US farm groups clamored for more muscular foreign feedstock limits over much of the last year, tallow had until now largely dodged any significant restrictions. Recent US guidance around 45Z treats all tallow, whether produced in the US or shipped long distances to reach the US, the same. Other foreign feedstocks were treated more harshly, with the same guidance providing no pathway at all for road fuels from foreign used cooking oil and also pinning the carbon intensity of canola oil — largely from Canada — as generally too high to claim any subsidy.

But tariffs on major suppliers of tallow to the US, and the threat of additional charges if countries retaliate, could give refiners pause. Demand could rise for domestic animal fats or alternatively for domestic vegetable oils that can also be refined into fuel, especially if retaliatory tariffs cut off global markets for US farm products like soybean oil. There is also risk if Republicans in the Trump administration or Congress reshape rules around 45Z to penalize foreign feedstocks.

At the same time, a minimum 10pc charge for tallow outside North America is a more manageable price to pay compared to other feedstocks — including a collection of charges amounting to a possible 69.5pc tax on Chinese used cooking oil. And if the US sets biofuel blend mandates as high as some oil and farm groups are pushing, strong demand could leave producers with little choice but to continue importing at least some feedstock from abroad to continue making fuel.

Not all US renewable diesel producers will be equally impacted by tariffs either. Diamond Green Diesel operates Gulf Coast biorefineries in foreign-trade zones, which allow companies to avoid tariffs on foreign inputs for products that are ultimately exported. Biofuel producers in these zones could theoretically refine foreign tallow, claim a 45Z subsidy, and avoid feedstock tariffs as long as they ship the fuel abroad. Jurisdictions like the EU and UK, where sustainable aviation fuel mandates took effect this year, are attractive destinations.

And there is still strong demand from the US food sector, with edible tallow prices in Chicago up 18pc so far this year. Trump allies, including his top health official, have pushed tallow as an alternative to seed oils.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-04-05 04:56:41.166614

SAF — fuel made from renewable sources like used cooking oil or agricultural waste — has been touted as a key solution.
That’s where the SAF Registry comes in, according to IATA.
“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.
While IATA played a key role in creating the system, the goal is for the registry to operate independently, with membership open to international organizations and companies across the SAF supply chain.","The global aviation industry just got a major boost in its push toward sustainability. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a system designed to track and verify SAF transactions worldwide. Now managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), the registry aims to create a transparent and reliable marketplace for SAF, helping airlines and corporate customers account for their emissions reductions.

Ensuring Transparency in SAF Transactions

With aviation responsible for about 2-3% of global carbon emissions, the industry is under increasing pressure to cut its environmental impact. SAF — fuel made from renewable sources like used cooking oil or agricultural waste — has been touted as a key solution. But there’s a problem: supply is extremely limited, and it’s often difficult to track who is using SAF and how much of a difference it’s actually making.

That’s where the SAF Registry comes in, according to IATA. The system is designed to ensure that every gallon of SAF is properly recorded, eliminating concerns about double counting and allowing airlines to claim their SAF investments toward emissions reductions.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist. “In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders. It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain.”

One of the biggest barriers to SAF adoption has been its availability. Right now, production is concentrated in just a few locations, making it logistically difficult—and expensive—for many airlines to incorporate SAF into their operations. The registry could help solve that problem by connecting fuel producers with airlines no matter where they are, making it easier for the industry to scale up SAF usage.

Beyond airlines, the registry is also designed to involve corporate customers. Large businesses that rely on air travel for their operations have been looking for ways to offset their emissions, and the registry gives them a way to directly invest in SAF. By purchasing SAF credits, companies can contribute to aviation’s decarbonization while also meeting their own sustainability goals.

CADO, the organization now responsible for maintaining and operating the registry, was founded in March and is based in Montreal. While IATA played a key role in creating the system, the goal is for the registry to operate independently, with membership open to international organizations and companies across the SAF supply chain.

Already, more than 30 companies—including airlines and aerospace firms—have started the onboarding process. Participation in the registry is free until April 2027, at which point it will switch to a cost-recovery model.",https://images.airlinegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/14155811/53320472361_0d3d027fd2_k.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 13:57:12.217158

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires biofuels—like ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel—to be part of the national fuel supply.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is investing $537 million in 543 biofuel projects across 29 states, as USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced. This funding comes from the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP).

The investment includes projects approved in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. It also supports President Trump’s 20th Executive Order to boost American energy production and help farmers, ranchers, and small businesses in rural areas.

Powering America’s Energy Landscape with Biofuels

Biofuels are liquid fuels made from plant or animal materials, commonly called feedstocks. They can also include gases like methane (from landfills or biogas) and hydrogen (from renewable sources). While most biofuels power vehicles, they can also be used for heating and electricity. Many government programs support biofuel use because they come from renewable sources.

Different industries and laws use various names for biofuels—like ethanol, biodiesel, biojet, or sustainable aviation fuel.

The press release highlighted that Secretary Rollins announced the investment at an event at Elite Octane LLC. This company is in Atlantic, Iowa, which has the highest capacity of biofuel production in America. Iowa has 42 ethanol plants that produce more than 4.7 billion gallons each year and 10 biodiesel plants that generate 416 million gallons annually.

The funding will help gas stations upgrade their storage tanks and fuel pumps. This makes higher ethanol and biodiesel blends more available. Farmers, small businesses, and local economies benefit from this as it creates more demand for corn and soybeans.

Biofuel exports are also on the rise. USDA revealed that in 2024, the U.S. exported 585,324 metric tons of ethanol, bringing in $5.11 billion. The key buyers were Canada, South Korea, and the European Union. They all want cleaner fuels more than ever.

What’s Inside the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP)

The Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP) was established at USDA Rural Development during President Trump’s first term. Under this program, gas stations can offer biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel more easily. It helps cover the cost of upgrading fuel pumps and storage tanks so more drivers can choose cleaner, homegrown fuel.

About 290 million cars on U.S. roads can use E15, a fuel blend with 15% ethanol. More than 22 million vehicles can run on E85, which has even more ethanol. Diesel vehicles can use B20, a blend with 20% biodiesel. Expanding access to these fuels helps drivers save money and reduces pollution.

Supporting Farmers and Rural Businesses

HBIIP creates more demand for crops like corn and soybeans, which are used to make biofuels. This investment will help American farmers and boost rural economies. It will also give easy access to cleaner and homegrown fuel to drivers.

Overall, as families gain more access to biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, they end up paying less.

Secretary Rollins confirmed this by noting,

“President Trump is honoring our commitment to America’s farmers, ranchers and small businesses, especially here in Iowa where corn and soy growers are crucial to supporting ethanol and biodiesel production. Under the President’s leadership, we are moving away from the harmful effects of misguided climate policies like the Green New Deal. Instead, the USDA will deploy energy investments that prioritize the needs of our rural communities. Through HBIIP, we will expand access to domestic, homegrown fuels which will increase good paying jobs for hardworking Americans, restore rural prosperity and strengthen our nation’s energy security.”

Ethanol: The Emission Control Champion

Ethanol is the most common biofuel. It’s a renewable alcohol fuel made from crops like corn, sugarcane, or other plant materials. Microbes (like yeast) break down or ferment plant sugars, turning them into ethanol.

It’s often mixed with gasoline, like E10 (10% ethanol, 90% gasoline), to reduce emissions and improve engine performance. Ethanol is also used in chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries.

The Census Bureau of the U.S. revealed that ethanol exports for 2024 totaled 1.72 billion gallons just through November. It surpassed the previous annual record of 1.67 billion gallons set in 2018.

Poet Biorefining is the largest ethanol producer in the United States. As of 2024, the South Dakota-based company had an ethanol production capacity of 2.7 billion gallons per annum across 33 plants in the Midwest.

A USDA study showed that greenhouse gas emissions from corn-based ethanol are about 39 percent lower than gasoline.

Thus, using more biofuels is a step toward a cleaner, energy-independent future.

US Biodiesel Exports Drop Sharply in 2024

Biodiesel is a clean-burning alternative to regular diesel, made from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking grease. It’s non-toxic and breaks down naturally.

The most common blend is B20, which is 20% biodiesel and 80% regular diesel.

While most biodiesel fuels trucks and heavy machinery, a small amount is now used for heating and electricity. In 2023, about 95% of U.S. biodiesel went to transportation.

The US Census Bureau reported that biodiesel exports took a steep dive in 2024, falling 30% from the previous year’s record high. The US exported 176.8 million gallons in 2024, down from 254.5 million gallons in 2023. This was the lowest volume since 2020, when 142.8 million gallons were shipped.

Export volume of biodiesel from the United States from 2001 to 2023 (in 1,000 barrels)

Canada and Peru remained the top buyers, together accounting for over 99% of total US biodiesel exports in both years. However, exports to Canada dropped 33%, while volumes to Peru saw a modest 2.4% rise.

Fastmarkets noted that some exporters pointed to stricter Canadian rules as a key reason for the drop. This means that new traceability and harvest attestation requirements under Canada’s CFR likely slowed shipments starting in September.

Others suggested that growing renewable diesel imports may have reduced Canada’s need for biodiesel. Unlike biodiesel, renewable diesel performs well in cold weather.

Renewable Diesel Reshaping U.S. Fuel Market

Regular gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel are made from hydrocarbons (hydrogen + carbon molecules). But renewable variants are made from feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats, or used cooking oil. The raw materials for biodiesel and renewable diesel are the same. Renewable hydrocarbon fuels are also called Drop-in” Fuels.

There has been a significant rise in the U.S. to import more fats and oils because of the strong demand for renewable hydrocarbon fuels.

The renewable versions are nearly identical to petroleum diesel and, therefore, are compatible with existing engines and pipelines. This makes them an easy switch from fossil fuels. However, the cost of renewable diesel is higher than traditional petroleum.

From the chart, we can see that last year, the renewable diesel capacity of the U.S. was around 5.5 billion gallons per year. USDA also forecasts the capacity to hit ~ 6.5 billion gallons per year by 2025.

California Drives Real Growth

California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) played a major role in renewable diesel’s growth. It gives carbon credits to fuel producers who cut emissions. Since the state maxed out ethanol and biodiesel blending, blenders switched to renewable diesel, as it has no blending limit.

This policy gave investors confidence. They invested in new projects, knowing the demand would last. Notably, because of LCFS, renewable diesel is now a key player in America’s clean fuel market.

Two major federal programs support the growth of renewable diesel:

Blender’s Tax Credit cuts production costs by giving tax breaks to companies that blend renewable diesel with petroleum diesel.

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires biofuels—like ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel—to be part of the national fuel supply.

Oil and Biofuel Groups Debate Higher Blending Mandates

Reuters reported that oil and biofuel companies met with the EPA, pushing for higher biomass diesel blending mandates. This could signal upcoming changes to U.S. biofuel policies.

The coalition wants to raise biomass diesel mandates to 5.5–5.75 billion gallons, up from 3.35 billion, and keep the ethanol mandate at 15 billion gallons. However, smaller refiners argue these increases could hurt jobs and raise fuel prices.

Fuel retailers and truck stop operators skipped the talks, demanding the return of the blenders tax credit, which they say helped keep fuel costs down. Without it, they warn that higher mandates could lead to price hikes (diesel prices by 30¢/USG) and political backlash.

The EPA has not commented on the issue yet.

Overall, biofuels offer cleaner alternatives to traditional fuels, helping reduce pollution while keeping cars, trucks, and planes running smoothly. Amid all resistance and higher costs, it could be a key factor in America’s energy transition.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2502286989.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 15:56:28.660482

The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.
Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector.
The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024.
Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building.","The Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025, introduced by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was passed in the Lok Sabha on April 3, following its earlier approval in the Rajya Sabha. With both Houses clearing the legislation, this marks the second major aviation reform under his leadership.

The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.

It builds on the framework of the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which sought to simplify and standardize international leasing agreements. Although India formally adopted this convention in 2008, gaps in legal enforcement led to higher leasing costs—typically 8 to 10 percent higher than in other nations. This legislation aims to address those gaps, ensuring legal certainty for aircraft financiers and reducing costs for Indian carriers.

Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector. He pointed to concrete figures demonstrating this growth: between Independence and 2014, the total number of passengers flying annually in India stood at 10.38 crore.

In just the next decade, that number more than doubled to 22.81 crore in 2024. Similarly, the number of airports in India grew from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more set to be launched soon.

The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. He stated that no other country has witnessed such rapid aviation expansion in such a short period.

The bill is expected to streamline leasing processes, make India a more attractive destination for aviation investments, and improve the country’s compliance scores under the Cape Town Convention. These changes are essential for reducing airline costs and encouraging new entrants into the sector.

Discussions on the bill also touched upon broader challenges in the civil aviation sector, such as the high cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which accounts for nearly 45% of an airline’s operational costs. The minister expressed concern over the variation in ATF tax across states and urged more states to follow the example of those who have reduced their rates. Lowering these taxes, he argued, would boost regional connectivity and reduce costs for passengers.

Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building. Plans are in place to generate 2.5 crore liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2025 and transition over 100 airports to renewable energy, underscoring India’s commitment to greener aviation.

The sector also faces a growing demand for trained pilots, estimated at 30,000 to 34,000 over the next 10 to 15 years. The government is working on increasing the number of Flight Training Organizations (FTOs) and issuing more commercial pilot licenses annually to meet this demand.",https://ddnews.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:56:38.341254

“Our goal on this program was to update Chinese stakeholders on U.S. practices on biofuels, especially fuel ethanol for SAF, share the Council’s approach and achievements in promoting the use of biofuels for carbon reduction and provide reference values for Chinese government agencies to set industry standards and participate in international collaboration in the future,” Sanchez said.

The highlight of the mission was a SAF Partnership Conference held in Chengdu, organized by the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) and Sichuan Provincial Government that featured panel discussions and presentations about the current state of SAF and the pathways of stable and cost-competitive SAF.

Speaking during a panel session on feedstock diversification, Goh presented an overview on the potential role of alcohol to jet (ATJ) technology in supplementing China’s SAF production goals. While hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) fuel remains the primary pathway for SAF adoption, the Council believes there is value in discussing ethanol as an ATJ feedstock and staff sought to raise this awareness and propagate future discussions during the conference.

Later that day, the team met with SAF-focused staff from China National Aviation Fuel Southwest Company and Sichuan Airlines to better understand their goals for SAF production and use, industry standards and how the U.S. industry can support the international transportation sector’s goals of reducing carbon emissions.

The mission ended with a meeting with a local SAF producer that is building a production site in western China with a capacity of 500,000 tons of SAF per year. Goh gave a detailed presentation on the ATJ process and its commercial viability and the open discussion that followed demonstrated their willingness to explore alternative pathways to meet China’s SAF aspirations.

Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.","International Airlines Group and Microsoft are strengthening their efforts to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions across the industry by extending their 2023 co-funded purchase agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by five years. Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 metric tons of SAF that will help reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 metric tons. The extension to the agreement enables Microsoft to address Scope 3 lifecycle emissions and is the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement to date, according to publicly available data.

Scope 3 encompasses lifecycle carbon emissions that are not produced by a company itself, but that it is indirectly responsible for up and down its value chain. By partnering with its corporate customers, IAG is able to purchase more SAF and reduce its Scope 1 (direct) emissions. Corporate customers also benefit by lowering Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from the industry commensurate to a proportion of their corporate flying.

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF that is used by the Group’s airlines to ship data center components globally, in partnership with Microsoft’s freight forwarders. Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability officer, said, “We’re pleased to work with like-minded organizations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions. Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

Julia Fidler, environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonization lead at Microsoft, said, ""We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production. We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

Using alternative fuel sources – rather than newly extracted fossil materials – means SAF releases existing carbon, instead of adding new carbon from fossil fuels to the atmosphere. By the end of 2024, 1.9% of IAG's total fuel usage for the year was SAF and total expenditure, including future commitments for SAF offtakes, exceeded $3.5 billion. IAG has been working with the aviation industry in its campaign for further government policy support to stimulate investment in new SAF production technologies.

The SAF used as part of the IAG and Microsoft agreement will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery, and from sustainably source bioethanol at Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, LanzaJet’s facility in the United States. Both fuels are certified by International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

As the demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) markets grows, conservation practices like no-till farming and cover cropping are becoming increasingly important. Corn farmers are beginning to use conservation practices for the option to sell to companies wanting ethanol for SAF. Reducing the number of trips across the field, implementing minimal or no-till farming, and utilizing cover crops can significantly lower the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of corn used for SAF.

Justin Rahn, an Illinois corn farmer, recently went to the SAF conference, Illinois Future of Fuels: Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference, held by Illinois Manufacturers’ Association (IMA). Rahn spoke on a panel during this conference to talk about the conservation practices he partakes in and how they affect his farm. Attendees unfamiliar with farming practices were able to ask him questions about sustainable practices and learn their impacts directly from a farmer.

Reducing Carbon Intensity with Conservation Practices

""Fewer trips across the field, minimal tilling, and cover crops help reduce carbon emissions,"" Rahn explained. Some cover crops contribute by putting carbon directly into the soil, further improving sustainability by using crops as opposed to machines to implement carbon into the soil.

Precision Conservation Management Data Collection

Due to the requirements of SAF, farmers will need to track their conservation practices to have the opportunity to sell to SAF markets. ""I work with PCM [Precision Conservation Management], who collects and tracks everything I do on my farm. They meet with me twice a year to record what I planted, how much fertilizer I used, how many passes I made, and what inputs were applied to my fields. At the end of harvest, they track my yields, moisture levels, and transportation distances,"" Rahn shared.shared.

This data provides insights to farmers on the effectiveness of conservation practices and makes it easier for farmers to sell to SAF markets. These practices can be of great use to farmers, but they do come with challenges.

Challenges in Conservation

Farmers face several challenges when integrating conservation practices into their operations. ""Terminating cover crops at the right time can be difficult, especially when the weather doesn’t cooperate. Germination and growth in fall can be a struggle, particularly in dry soil conditions,"" Rahn explained.

Another issue is the high costs of using cover crops and the need for financial incentives. ""We need to be paid more for what we’re doing—cover crops cost money, and farmers need support to make it work,” Rahn expresses. He goes on to address that the companies who need the ethanol for SAF should be the ones to provide those incentives.

For conservation practices to be used by more farmers, they must have incentives. ""There is an incentive if the premium is high enough,"" Rahn stated. However, some farmers still rely on conventional methods like chisel plowing to manage soil compaction, highlighting the need for a balance between profitability and sustainability.

Whatever the outcome of the election in November, Hecht said he expected the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office would make good on the conditional offer.

He was focused instead on the concern that public opposition could stand in the way of raising money for a project expected to create 300 jobs.

""Investors at Goldman Sachs are going to Google up what's going on,"" he said in that October interview. ""If the first thing they see is a ----show in Erie, nobody is going to want to invest. They are going to take their money and put it into something else.""

A statement from IRG on Thursday, however, suggests that the changes in administration policy made it more difficult to raise money.

""Among these challenges are a hold of unspecified duration placed on funding commitments issued by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office,"" IRG said in a statement. ""Additional challenges include recently-announced tariffs on materials and on equipment from Europe not made in the US, resulting in expectations of substantially higher project development costs than anticipated, as well as difficulties in securing long-term purchase agreements for recycled materials from plastics manufacturers and consumer product groups, many of whom are cutting back on sustainability pledges.""

Other loans are on hold as well

International Recycling Group's project hasn't been the only one affected.

According to an advisory from the international law firm of Holland & Knight, the Department of Energy has moved ahead with a $782 million advance on a loan guarantee for the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

However, that loan, according to Holland & Knight, marks the first significant disbursement to a DOE loan or grant project since President Donald Trump signed an executive order that paused the release of federal funds under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act, including Department of Energy Loans and Grants.

In October, Hecht defended the intentions of the loan program under President Joe Biden, which provided funds for projects deemed too risky for commercial lenders.

""it's doing exactly what the administration intended it for, which is to stand up to commercialize and deploy novel technologies that are ready for deployment,"" he said.

Pulling the plug wasn't easy for Hecht.

""I am personally devastated after 18 years of working to bring this vision to a reality that we have failed to overcome these challenges,” he said.

'To see it pulled is a significant loss'

Brandon Mendoza, CEO of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, expressed his own disappointment in a statement.

“The Erie Regional Chamber is frustrated by the financial pressure building due to economic uncertainty at the federal level, which IRG cited as the reason to cancel plans for its Erie plastics recycling plant project,"" he said in a statement.

""This project had significant support at the state and local level, across public and private sectors, and to see it pulled is a significant loss.""

Kim Thomas, executive director of Infinite Erie, also registered disappoint about canceling plans for the project.

""This project is part of the Infinite Erie investment playbook and has received widespread financial support across local and state government, as well as private sector investments,"" she said.

What brought the project to Erie in the first place?

There was more than one reason that Hecht chose Erie, including the presence of a thriving plastics industry and Penn State Behrend's status as one of the nation's leading schools for plastics engineering.

But it was something else that prompted Hecht to visit Erie after originally deciding on another location.

It was a news story about Erie Insurance announcing a $50 million Opportunity Zone investment fund.

He worked with the company for months to vet the concept.

By the time IRG was ready to announce its plans in October of 2020, Erie Insurance and Erie-based Plastek Group had agreed to make a combined $9 million investment in the project.

Plastek was more than an investor. It was on the road to becoming a customer.

The Erie-based company, which manufactures a large share of the deodorant containers used around the world, was under pressure from its customers to use recycled materials to make those containers.

In 2020, Dennis Prischak, the company's CEO, said ""We’re keenly aware of the increasing demand from consumers for post-use content in new packaging.""

Investors in the company react

There is little to suggest that either of those companies will be able to recover the money they invested to develop the business.

Speaking on behalf of Erie Insurance, company spokesman Matthew Cummings said, ""We are disappointed that the project is ending this way, but it is the right decision and only option given the current challenges and complexities.""

He went on to acknowledge the risk involved in an investment of this kind.

""We have always recognized that our investment carried an inherently high level of risk. It was also an investment in a promising local economic development, job creation and sustainability project.""

Cummings concluded: ""We appreciate the work and expertise that Mitch and his team at IRG, as well as countless other community partners and investors, put into this economic development effort.""

Prischak said Thursday that Plastek and his family became involved for what they believed were all the right reasons.

""We are very sad and disappointed at the recent news and the fact that plastics recycling, the plastics industry, the environment, and the jobs IRG would have created in Erie have missed out on a great opportunity,"" he said.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/09/NETN/75589557007-p-1-hecht-100824.jpg?crop=5138,2891,x0,y206&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-04 07:56:50.279854

The new platform is designed to fast-track the global adoption of SAF and help the industry meet its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Step forward for sustainable aviation

Described as a “critical platform” by IATA, the SAF Registry enables airlines and industry stakeholders to track, verify, and claim their SAF usage in a secure and transparent way.

It ensures that environmental benefits from SAF purchases are recorded immutably, eliminating the risk of double counting – an essential step in building trust and accountability in the carbon reduction process.

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO, we have put in place a system that benefits all stakeholders, airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate customers. It is a foundational tool for building a transparent, global SAF market.”

Shift from fossil fuel

Thomsen, however, emphasised that the registry is only one piece of the puzzle. She also called on governments to urgently shift financial support from fossil fuel industries toward renewable energy development, including SAF.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” she said.

As SAF continues to emerge as a key solution for decarbonising air travel, the launch of the registry marks a major milestone, bringing structure, trust, and momentum to the global effort to make aviation more sustainable.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/04/04/nazariy-kovalchuk-uGGBsPokvH8-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 04:56:09.009121

CTM supports organisations and business travellers to understand this shift by displaying SAF scores at the time of booking in the Lightning online booking tool. This feature puts information in front of travel bookers and travellers so they can make more informed travel choices that support their organisation’s sustainability goals.

Businesses, governments and non-profit organisations are all seeking ways to minimise the environmental impact of their corporate travel. CTM’s sustainability tools have been at the forefront of smarter data, decisions and measurement across the whole lifecycle of a business trip.

CTM is excited to strengthen its partnership with RDC Aviation, a leading airline data analytics company, to deliver actionable SAF scores in Lightning for our customers.

“The SAF Rating provides CTM customers with additional context to help them make informed decisions about the sustainable travel options available to them, sitting alongside RDC’s detailed and accurate emissions data in CTM’s Lightning online booking tool. We’re proud to work with CTM to deliver meaningful insights for business travellers.” Gareth Kitching, Director of Operations, RDC Aviation.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF works in the same way as traditional jet fuel, which you’ll often hear it referred to as a “drop-in fuel”, that can be blended with jet fuel and used in commercial airlines with no significant changes to an aircraft or its engine. Today, SAF can be made in three ways, as a biofuel, a waste fuel, or synthetic “e-Fuel”.

Biofuel: Where crops can be grown and fermented to turn sugar or fat into ethanol.

Waste Fuel: Used cooking oils, greases and other oils can be refined into jet fuel.

E-Fuels: Where electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen then combined with carbon dioxide to make drop-in hydrocarbons like diesel and jet fuel.

The International Aviation Travel Authority (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The largest acceleration is expected in the 2030s as policy support becomes global.

SAF scores – What are they made of?

To provide the most comprehensive assessment of airline SAF adoption, the scores displayed in Lightning, provided by RDC Aviation include several different data points, including but not limited to:

Partnership/development: Agreements between an airline and one provider to test, develop and/or produce SAF.

SAF offtake agreement: Arrangement between the airline and producer to purchase SAF.

Stake in production: Partnership in the SAF production (airline as a partner in the company).

CO2 offset: Airline and/or passenger offset carbon emissions.

Sustainability program: SAF as a criteria of the airline sustainability program.

Efficiency of their fleet: Reflection of investment in modern, efficient equipment and aircraft.

A key factor to scoring is the commitment of airlines to sustainable aviation which includes goals for future use of SAF. The specific metrics and data captured by RDC Aviation as part of this assessment and scoring include data on 250 leading world airlines that show:

Current percentage: Volume of SAF used, which could be network-wide, or, if available, on a particular route shown in Lightning.

Commitment percentage: Volume of SAF committed to purchase. This could be network-wide or on a shown route.

Commitment date: The specific date the SAF commitment will be implemented.

How can CTM customers use SAF scores?

Lightning users will be able to see SAF scores for all 250+ leading airlines when viewing flight results, alongside other critical flight information used to determine an appropriate choice such as price, in-policy status, seat availability, granular carbon emissions, and other planned data such as on-time performance.

Users can sort results by SAF score, highlighting those airlines with AAA SAF scores first. CTM will also be making the SAF scores available to travel managers upon request who wish to incorporate the data into their preferred airline review and contracting process or airline RFPs.

The addition of SAF scores further strengthens Lightning’s sustainability features including carbon emissions for air, hotel and car; the ability to filter and preference car results for EV and hybrid vehicles and the ability to sort flights, hotels and cars by lowest emissions.",https://au.travelctm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-favicon-96x96-CTM-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-04 08:56:10.288388

Developed by IATA and now live under CADO’s management, the Registry is designed to support a global market for SAF by recording transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It enables airlines and their corporate customers to claim the environmental benefits of SAF against regulatory obligations and voluntary emissions targets, helping to accelerate aviation’s transition to net zero by 2050.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist. “In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.”

The Registry tracks environmental attributes throughout the SAF value chain to prevent double counting and ensures purchases are immutably recorded. It connects SAF producers and suppliers with airlines globally—regardless of location—helping overcome current supply limitations and enabling in-sector emissions reductions.

The system also allows airlines’ corporate customers to support decarbonization through co-financing arrangements, leveraging their ability to contribute to the cost of sustainable fuel uptake. Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will operate on a cost recovery basis.

IATA emphasizes that the Registry is technology- and feedstock-neutral, promoting a diversity of SAF production methods and supporting harmonization across regions. It is also designed to be interoperable with other registries, encouraging open markets and competition.

“The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced,” said Thomsen. She added that further progress depends on stronger government support for renewable energy, including redirecting subsidies away from fossil fuels.

Developed in consultation with airlines, OEMs, governments, fuel suppliers, and corporate travel stakeholders, the SAF Registry already has over 30 early users onboarding. It is underpinned by IATA’s SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, providing a consistent framework for environmental claims regardless of geography.

One of the most promising solutions emerging in this context is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to projections, if we are to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, more than 60% of the reductions in aviation sector emissions will need to come from SAF. This statistic clearly underscores the critical importance of accelerating both the production and adoption of this innovative fuel.

Facilitating its adoption, perhaps the key advantage of SAF is its ""drop-in"" capability, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring any modifications. This positions SAF not merely as a potential future solution but as a viable option available to the industry today. Airlines can begin integrating SAF into their operations now, making strides toward sustainability without the need for costly overhauls of their current fleets.

The transition to SAF is further bolstered by a supportive regulatory environment and favorable market dynamics. Initiatives such as the European “Refuel EU” program and the “SAF Grand Challenge” in the United States, backed by the Inflation Reduction Act, have established a robust regulatory framework to encourage investment and innovation in SAF production. Countries like the United Kingdom, Japan, and Singapore are also taking proactive steps to develop strategies that will accelerate the growth of SAF, ensuring that the aviation sector can meet its environmental goals.

Moreover, there is a growing commitment from major airlines to incorporate SAF into their operations. Companies are responding to increasing pressure from customers, investors, and NGOs to decarbonize their activities. By signing long-term purchase agreements for SAF, these airlines are not only committing to a greener future but also facilitating the financing and industrialization of the necessary infrastructure for SAF production.

But development of SAF requires a broader effort than that of just the aviation industry. It requires collaboration among a range of stakeholders: fuel producers, airlines, regulators, and financiers, to note a few.

Speaking at Toronto Pearson International Airport as the carrier re-started flying to Canada for the first time since 2014, Branson said: “People said it was impossible to fly across the Atlantic with SAF. We needed to prove them wrong and took off from London [in November 2023] with a full belly of SAF and landed in New York.

“I have tried to break a number of records. I attempted to cross the Atlantic in a boat and it sank. I then tried in a hot air balloon and it ended up in the sea and we had to be rescued by helicopters. Then we flew the first transatlantic flight by a commercial plane on 100% SAF and we landed safely at JKF.

“We’ve proven it can be done but it’s not easy because getting the quantities of SAF that we need is tough – and we’re challenging the industry to get enough SAF so that all our planes can fly on it.”

He added: “Obviously, what’s happened in America is going to make it tougher. The world was moving towards a place where it was a priority to make this happen and now for one side at least, it’s not high on the agenda.”

Asked how President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping trade tariffs might affect the Virgin group of companies, Branson said: “All I can say is that between Canada and Britain there are no tariffs that I am aware of.

“I can’t see any tariffs existing between our two countries and I hope we can become even closer than we have been over the last 50 years and we will try to make sure that happens.”

Branson was also asked what made him confident Virgin Atlantic would not withdraw again from Canada, as it had in 2001 after 9/11, ending its Toronto service, and then pulling out of Vancouver after flying there between 2012-2014.

“Nothing is guaranteed in life. But we’re much stronger than we were 20 years ago,” he said.

“We managed to survive Covid without British government help and were the only airline to do that. We paid back debts and made a profit so I’m confident that 25 years from now, Virgin will still be going strong. We’ve also got new partners which we didn’t have before, [in Delta, Air France/KLM and Westjet].”

He added that he would like to see the Canadian operation expand.

“I’d love to see Virgin flying to the other side of Canada in the near future. I’m not going to mention specific cities, but you can guess which one.

Petersen is worried about the impact the tariffs could have on the state’s biggest trading partners and the impact of anticipated reciprocal tariffs.
In the meantime, Glessing said farmers will have to try and minimize market loss while continuing to look for new opportunities.
He said they’re working hard to focus on the relationships with their trading partners, but it’s hard for people to plan for the future with so much uncertainty.
Petersen said another way around the tariffs is add value within our own country.","GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. — Uncertainty about the future is a feeling no one wants.

“People may feel effects of tariffs tomorrow, others may not feel them for six months to a year,” said Thom Petersen, the commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

Petersen said the last few years have been tough on farmers, and tariffs will add to the strain.

“Basically, it’s going to add to chaos,” Petersen said.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on nearly all imported goods.

Petersen is worried about the impact the tariffs could have on the state’s biggest trading partners and the impact of anticipated reciprocal tariffs.

“About a third of our crop is exported and my concern is what the reciprocal tariffs will look like from some our biggest trading partners, and if some of our trading partners that we’ve worked years to develop relationships that our farmers have worked years to develop those relationships that those markets will go and look somewhere else.”

The tariff announcement comes on the heels of a difficult year for farmers.

“Farmers are struggling. We know mediation notices sent to farmers are double this year from what they were in 2024, so we know farmers are having a hard time on balance sheets, so any kind of cut or slowdown is going to be difficult,” Petersen said.

“Commodity prices have been challenging the last three years probably 2-3 and those margins are very, very tight,” said President of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Dan Glessing. “It’s been some tough sledding the last couple of years.”

Glessing is also a dairy farmer. He’s hoping for swift action by the administration on unilateral trade deals. Unilateral because he doesn’t think this administration will be interested in bilateral trade.

“It’s concerning to our members, to farmers, obviously, we are very good at producing food and fiber in this country and if that doesn’t get to where it needs to go, and if farmers can’t stay in business, that’s a challenge,” Glessing said.

He said some countries will need to continue importing American products and will continue to do so. However, they might not import as many products if there’s an additional cost to import them.

“Realistically, we don’t know how long they’re going to be on that’s probably the most unsettling part of it The duration of them is kind of the key to how much an effect it has on our bottom line,” he said.

In the meantime, Glessing said farmers will have to try and minimize market loss while continuing to look for new opportunities.

Petersen said they’ll have to explore other markets of trade farmers can tap into and add value where they can like biofuel and sustainable aviation fuel.

He said they’re working hard to focus on the relationships with their trading partners, but it’s hard for people to plan for the future with so much uncertainty.

“You know we’re really concerned for some of our farmers that they really can’t get through another bad crop year, a bad price or production year, so the tariffs you know too are being levied against some of our biggest trading partners,” Petersen said. “A lot of concern about uncertainties and we’ll just have to see how this plays out

He said he thinks tariffs are an outdated idea because we have become a global market.

Petersen said another way around the tariffs is add value within our own country.

“It takes time though to build new factories. It takes time to hire new people, you know, so I just don’t see that we’re going to see an immediate return on some of these tariffs. I think it’s going to take time to sort some of that out,” Petersen said.",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/089a5537-cc16-4098-8daf-a67e93c42971/20250403T232851/089a5537-cc16-4098-8daf-a67e93c42971_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 00:56:07.938893

Brazil SAF industry set to take off in 2027

Sao Paulo, 2 April (Argus) — Brazil's aviation industry is keeping an eye on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) regulations as the domestic market awaits the kickoff of local production to comply with the planned blend mandate and with potential for exports. The fuels of the future law envisages raising biofuel mix standards to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in domestic flights over a 10-year period starting in 2027, as Brazil has committed to applying a 10pc SAF mandate by 2037. The country's efforts to implement a SAF mandate runs in tandem with the guidelines from UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) program, which oversees GHG reduction in international flights. The program set up two phases until reduction targets are fully implemented, so airlines and producers adapt to changes efficiently. Airlines can voluntarily adhere between 2024-2026, followed by global compulsory targets from 2027-2035, prompting SAF usage or carbon credits compensation. The mandatory phase embraces all international flights, including those from and to non-voluntary countries, except for so-called underdeveloped countries and those with a low share of global air traffic flows. Brazil's SAF is a newborn industry that holds potential for feedstock supply , mostly for its traditional production pathways using soybean oil, corn and sugarcane ethanol, as well as widespread agricultural lands engaged in biomass production without practicing land-use change. Its variability also allows new projects to reuse degraded lands and existing agricultural assets to comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sustainability criteria related to land-use and soil health enhancement. SAF input in Brazil faces economic hurdles as high market volatility weighs on long-term investments, says A&M Infra's management consultant Filipe Bonaldo. But he also says that the political agenda will not hinder the energy transition as has happened in the US under President Donald Trump, since Brazil's economy is heavily based on agriculture its regulatory processes spur optimism. As an agricultural powerhouse, Brazil offers low-cost production and multiple sources to provide demand, both internally and offshore. Brazil is the third largest global exporter in agriculture and livestock markets, leading soy, orange juice and beef markets globally, according to agriculture and livestock confederation CAN. Debut in Rio Brazilian fuel distributor Vibra is the first to offer SAF in Brazil, before the blend mandate comes into effect. The company imported 550,000l (16,000bl) of SAF produced with used-cooking oil (UCO) from the port of Antwerp, in the Netherlands, in January. The biofuel is available for customers at Vibra's facility at the Rio de Janeiro international airport after a 10-month logistics plan was concluded. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) has secured all processes of the plan, from the supply chain of the product to distribution. Vibra operates in more than 90 airports in Brazil and accounts for 60pc of national aviation market share through its sector subsidiary BR Aviation, said executive vice-president of operations Marcelo Bragança. Why it took so long? The sector has long had doubts over the technical feasibility of admitting the use of biofuels in aviation , especially from a security point of view, said Anac's head of the environment and energy transition Marcela Anselmi. The agency, along with oil and biofuels regulator ANP, follow international regulations for SAF as it requires a physical and chemical resemblance to current fossil aviation fuels to ensure flight operations security. It is still not possible to use 100pc of SAF in aircraft motors, said Anselmi. There is a 50pc mix limit that inhibits worldwide adherence as there are technical restrictions yet to overcome. Recent engagement in the energy transition agenda is promoting biomass supply for aviation, as well as road and marine modalities, requiring new production pathways. For example, ATJ uses ethanol to convert it into SAF, which can be expensive to install and implies high capital expenditure. In a global context, Brazil stands in the vanguard of the SAF agenda as Europe and the US have only deployed legislation related to output and consumption over the past two years, Anselmi pointed out. Meanwhile, South America's planned SAF production capacity may reach 1.1mn l/yr in 2030, according to EPE.

US oil, farm groups push EPA for steep biofuel mandate

New York, 1 April (Argus) — The American Petroleum Institute and biofuel-supporting groups told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials at a meeting today that the agency should sharply raise advanced biofuel blend mandates for 2026. The coalition told EPA that it supported a biomass-based diesel mandate next year of 5.25bn USG, up from 3.35bn USG this year, and a broader advanced biofuel mandate, including the cellulosic category, at 10bn Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits, up from 7.33bn RINs this year, according to three different groups that attended the meeting. Both mandates would be record highs for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Soybean oil futures and RIN credit prices have risen sharply over the past week on optimism that oil and biofuel interests were working to coordinate volume mandate requests for consideration by President Donald Trump's administration. The coalition is also pushing the agency to set a total conventional volume requirement at 25bn RINs, which would keep an implied mandate for corn ethanol flat at 15bn USG. Ethanol groups had previously eyed a mandate even higher, but limits on the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline make much more-stringent requirements a tough sell to oil refiners. The coalition provided no specific request for the cellulosic biofuel subcategory, where most credit generation comes from biogas. Credits in that category are more expensive, but price concerns have been less potent recently given an EPA proposal to lower previously set cellulosic obligations, signaling that future volume requirements can be cut, too. EPA is aiming to finalize new RFS volume mandates by the end of the year if not earlier, people familiar with the administration's thinking have said. EPA officials signaled at the meeting they were working urgently on the rulemaking. ""The agency is intent on getting the RFS program back on the statutory timeline for issuing renewable volume obligation rules,"" EPA said, declining to comment further on its plans for the rule. The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy credits from those who do. Under the program's unique nesting structure, credits from blending lower-carbon biofuels can be used to meet obligations for other program categories. One gallon of corn ethanol generates 1 RIN, but more energy-dense fuels earn more RIN credits per gallon. Some disagreements persist While groups at the meeting were aligned around high-level mandates, how administration officials and courts treat small refinery requests for exemptions from RFS requirements could undercut those targets. Groups present were broadly aligned on asking EPA not to grant widespread exemptions, though there is still disagreement in the industry about how best to account for exempted volumes when deciding requirements for other refiners. Groups present at the meeting today included the American Petroleum Institute and representatives of biofuel producers and crop feedstock suppliers. Some groups that previously engaged with the coalition's efforts to project unity to the Trump administration were not present. And some groups more historically skeptical of the RFS and more supportive of small refinery exemptions — including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — have not been closely involved. Fuel marketer groups notably did not attend the meeting after a representative sparred with others in the coalition at an American Petroleum Institute meeting last month. Some retail groups, including the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, instead sent a letter to EPA today arguing that the groups pushing steep volumes are discounting potential headwinds to the sector from new tax credit policy. Some of the groups advocating for higher biofuel volumes have pointed to high production capacity and feedstock availability, but have preferred to ignore thornier issues like tax credits, lobbyists say. ""An overly aggressive increase in advanced biofuel blending mandates under the RFS will be punitive for American consumers"" without extending a long-running $1/USG tax credit for biomass-based diesel blenders, the retailers' letter said. That incentive expired last year and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" credit, which offers subsidies to producers instead of blenders and throttles benefits based on carbon intensity. Generally lower credit values for biomass-based diesel — coupled with the US government's delays setting final regulations on qualifying for the credit — have spurred a sharp drop in biofuel production to start the year. Without a blenders credit, the RFS volume mandates pushed by some groups could increase retail diesel prices by 30¢/USG, the fuel marketers estimate, a potential political headache for a president that ran on curbing consumer costs. Other biofuel groups say that extending the credit would be an uphill battle this year, with some lawmakers and lobbyists instead focused on legislatively tweaking the 45Z incentive's rules to benefit crop feedstocks instead of reverting wholesale to the prior tax policy.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures. Industry participants said yesterday that the EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids, and Biomass Fuels is drafting implementing regulations that would include a two-and-a-half year pause to obligatory acceptance of ISCC EU certification for waste-based biofuels. ""This action is said to be subject to further legal scrutiny and will need approval by member states,"" the ISCC said. Currently, member states accept EU-recognised voluntary scheme certification as proof that fuel or feedstocks are compliant with the bloc's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria. Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap. The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels and would seriously jeopardise the ability of the obligated parties to comply with blending mandates,"" the ISCC said. The ISCC has been singled out in a discriminatory way and has supported European Commission and member states' investigations into alleged fraud, it said. ""We are more than surprised by this step […and] are unable to see the rationale of the planned measure, which seems ad hoc and baseless,"" it added. Secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) Xavier Noyon told Argus that, if confirmed, the suspension would affect thousands of operators. ""At this time, member states are refusing to comment, and we call on the commission to urgently clarify any decisions of this nature that are on the table,"" he said. The EBB published its own proposed revision to the RED implementing legislation last month, which expanded the supervisory power of member states over voluntary schemes and certification bodies. The European Commission confirmed that the committee met on 26 March to discuss sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, avoidance of double counting, and alleged fraud. ""We are still working on our examination of this alleged fraud in biodiesel imports from China,"" said commission energy spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. But the commission has not taken any decision yet and cannot allude to ""possible"" scenarios, she said.
