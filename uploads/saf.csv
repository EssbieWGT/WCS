During the 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) reported robust performance metrics for 2025, with international passenger traffic climbing 10% and cargo demand expanding 7% through September, both outpacing global averages.

However, beneath these encouraging numbers, industry executives are grappling with an increasingly complex operating environment.

The tariff turbulence

No issue loomed larger than the resurgence of tariffs, which AAPA Director General Subhas Menon characterized as an “entirely man-made” crisis. While aircraft and engines remain exempt, the raw materials and components that feed the aviation supply chain are not, creating cost increases that ultimately impact both airlines and passengers.

“Airlines are not against cost increases, only costs that don’t serve a useful purpose,” Menon noted, highlighting the impact of tariffs on both supply chains and consumer demand through inflation.

Charting a sustainable path

During the assembly, member airlines unanimously adopted ambitious sustainability targets, committing to 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) utilization by 2030. Thailand emerged as a regional leader, announcing plans to supply 2% SAF by 2026 and up to 8% by 2030 – notably without mandates or additional taxes on frequent flyers.

However, frustration simmered over the industry’s heavy reliance on SAF as the primary solution.

“We are asked to rely mostly on a hard-to-get commodity,” Menon observed, advocating instead for a balanced approach that gives equal weight to breakthrough technologies in propulsion and design.

Military conflicts force airlines to reroute and respond

Beyond economic pressures, airlines are also facing unprecedented operational challenges.

Military conflicts have closed crucial airspace over 14 countries in the past year, with Russian airspace restrictions forcing costly route diversions. Adding to safety concerns, military forces have been spoofing navigation satellite systems, creating what industry leaders see as an ironic threat from those meant to protect civilian aviation.

The assembly passed resolutions addressing these challenges, calling for regulatory harmonization, enhanced regional maintenance capabilities, and improved safety protocols for lithium battery transport, a growing concern as the use of electronic devices proliferates.

Resolutions passed at the 69th AAPA Assembly

During the assembly, APAC aviation leaders unanimously adopted resolutions focused on four pressing industry priorities:

Aviation sustainability: The assembly set an ambitious collective goal of reaching 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use by 2030. Leaders are calling on governments to put in place the policies and regulations needed to speed up SAF production and adopt fuel criteria that meet ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) standards. The resolution also encouraged states to implement ICAO-approved systems for tracking and registering SAF while supporting affordable production methods like co-processing.

Supply chain strengthening: Member airlines pushed for targeted investment incentives and streamlined regulations to boost regional maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) and manufacturing capabilities. The resolution highlights the importance of embracing circular economy practices, including recycling and reusing serviceable aircraft materials whenever possible.

Aviation safety – Lithium batteries: A separate resolution tackled the safe transport of lithium batteries, encouraging regulators to bring their practices in line with ICAO guidance for spare lithium batteries. The resolution emphasized the need for better data sharing and clearer public information about how passengers can safely carry and use lithium batteries.

Taxes and charges: Members agreed to urge regulators to avoid imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not directly cost-related or don’t align with ICAO guidance. The resolution warns against measures that place unnecessary financial pressure on airlines or hold back sustainable growth in air transport.

Looking ahead: the aviation industry cannot continue to be a “cash cow”

Despite turbulent times, AAPA members remain bullish on 2026, banking on resilient Asian economies and strong underlying demand for air travel.

The focus will now be on advancing safety and sustainability while strengthening supply chain resilience through closer collaboration with regulators and suppliers.

With his trademark knack for puns, Menon concluded his address with a touch of industry humor.

“This industry has been seen as a cash cow for the economy and states,” he said, “but it cannot be a cash cow if its udders are perpetually under repair.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/11/AAPA-Assembly-of-Presidents-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:57:18.614967

Researchers found that partially suppressing genes in cyanobacteria improved their growth under stressful conditions.

The CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool is used to alter the genetic code of bacteria and other microbes.

This research aims to accelerate the production of affordable biofuels and recyclable plastics from renewable resources.

To make beer and wine, a microscopic fungus called yeast consumes sugars in fruits or grains and converts them into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. But the microbe yeast cannot tolerate different stressful conditions, said Carrie Eckert, leader of the Synthetic Biology Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a recent talk to Friends of ORNL.

One of the goals of the Center for Bioenergy Innovation (CBI) at ORNL, which is one of four Department of Energy Office of Science Bioenergy Research Centers, is to alter the natural behavior of plant cells and bacteria such as Clostridium thermocellum to enable them to tolerate the industrial processes needed to make ample amounts of affordable products, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

CBI, she said, has made small amounts of sustainable aviation fuel using engineered strains of the Clostridium thermocellum bacteria. These microbes make ethanol by breaking down the tough plant material in sustainable woody biomass from poplar trees or grassy biomass from fast-growing switchgrass.

Eckert, a recently appointed chief science officer at CBI, told the FORNL audience about recent research she performed with three researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder using genetic engineering. By tweaking genes in certain bacteria and exposing them to temperature and light conditions different from what they prefer, the researchers found that the bacteria surprisingly improved their growth while adapting to new conditions they were not expected to tolerate.

Their research results were published in the March 21 issue of the journal, “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.” Their experiments were performed using Synechococcus cyanobacteria, better known as blue-green algae.

This one-celled species is the world’s oldest organism to perform photosynthesis as it grows during the day in warm, carbon-rich waters in oceans, rivers and lakes. Blue-green algae, which has enriched the atmosphere with the oxygen humans need to survive, is actively being researched as a promising source for making sustainable aviation fuel.

Eckert and her colleagues found that repressing, or partially shutting down the expression of, all genes in their cyanobacteria sample so they make less protein caused its cells to grow better under two environmental stressors. They were temperatures colder than the 37 degrees Celsius they prefer and white light shone continuously on them, replacing the daily cycle of light and dark the organisms are used to.

The new knowledge could lead to the use by CBI of renewable microbes and plant cells from poplar trees and switchgrass (two non-edible plants that grow fast) for demonstrating the scaled-up industrial production of affordable biofuels and recyclable plastics with improved properties.

To change the building blocks of the bacterial cells’ genetic code, Eckert has used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool developed by Jennifer Doudna, an American scientist, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, a French scientist. The two women won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their innovative work based on the discovery that bacteria use this tool to protect themselves from a virus that previously attacked them.

Eckert gave a short tutorial to the FORNL audience about two types of CRISPR tools. She said that the naturally occurring defense system found in bacteria is known as CRISPR, an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. When a virus attacks a bacterium, it captures a small piece of the virus’s DNA and stores it in its own genome, creating a genetic memory. If the same virus attacks again, the bacterium recognizes and destroys it.

To locate a specific gene to be altered, Eckert said that scientists create a guide RNA that perfectly matches the DNA code of the target. Like GPS for car drivers, the gRNA guides the Cas9 protein it’s a part of to the exact spot on the DNA molecule. That’s where the Cas9 protein uses its molecular scissors to make a precise cut, removing the undesired DNA from the gene.

Scientists can edit a problematic gene by inserting a new piece of DNA at the cut to turn the old, defective gene into a new, corrected one.

It’s sort of like cut, copy and paste in word processing. This technique has been used by medical researchers to correct genetic mutations that cause diseases like sickle cell anemia.

Eckert noted that she has used CRISPR to genetically engineer yeast and E. coli bacteria.

However, in the research she performed recently with her UC Boulder colleagues, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) was employed. This gene silencing technique uses a modified CRISPR-Cas system to repress gene expression without cutting out a piece of DNA. Instead, this tool for gene regulation knocks down, rather than completely knocks out, a gene’s activity.

The mutated Cas9 protein, which is unable to cleave the DNA, can be guided to the target gene where it interferes with the gene’s expression, silencing it.

“The altered Cas9 protein blocks the RNA polymerase from copying and transcribing the gene enough to repress its expression,” she noted. As a result, the gene makes little or no protein.

Eckert said she and her colleagues have devised a method to determine which edited genes are associated with particular traits, such as the ability to grow. The method involves repressing all the genes in the bacterial sample and exposing them to environmental stressors.

She and her colleagues used the CRISPRi gene-silencing tool and a large library of molecular guides they made to understand how photosynthetic bacteria respond to stresses such as changes in light and temperature.

“We built a library of almost 33,000 guide RNAs for targeting all the genes in the genome of our cyanobacteria samples,” Eckert said. Ten guide RNAs ping each gene, producing different levels of knockdown of gene expression.

Through sequencing of bacterial genes in the targeted cyanobacteria that survived the “high-throughput” guide RNA pinging of the genes and through computational methods, the scientists could determine which genes improve growth and which ones inhibit it.

The researchers then exposed the cyanobacteria to a lower temperature than the cells thrive on and to white light instead of the different levels of red and blue light they use for photosynthesis depending on their depth in the water. When the cyanobacteria were exposed to the lower temperature and red or blue light, “they got really sick,” Eckert said. “They fall out of the population.”

She later explained that cyanobacteria have circadian clock genes. They enable the algae to prepare for the predictable daily cycle of light and dark, scheduling photosynthesis during the day and nitrogen fixation at night.

When the scientists exposed a sample of cyanobacteria to continuous white light and colder temperatures than they prefer (22 degrees Celsius instead of 37 degrees), Eckert said they found that the bacterial growth improved.

The explanation? Because the cyanobacteria were exposed to continuous white light instead of the daily light-and-dark cycle of red and blue light they need to obtain carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide to make the sugar enabling them to grow, the circadian clock genes ceased to use the organism’s energy to make proteins, giving it extra energy to spur its growth.

In this research, they found that even partial suppression of all the genes in a genome improved the microbes’ ability to grow while adapting to environmental stresses.

""This powerful technique delivers a faster, more comprehensive way to influence microbial traits for biotechnology,” she said. “It provides more insights into gene functions than traditional genome editing. It accelerates our ability to augment microbes to produce desired fuels, chemicals and materials.”

CBI researchers plan to apply this novel technique to optimize the growth of previously identified microbes used to make biofuels and bioproducts by finding ways to help them acclimate to stressful conditions.

Eckert’s talk to FORNL was titled “The Role of Synthetic Biology in the Realization of the Bioeconomy.” She explained that research at CBI supports its goal to find ways to help create a circular bioeconomy, which will use renewable biological resources to produce large quantities of biofuels and better chemicals while minimizing waste and carbon dioxide emissions.

This approach might replace the current linear system of taking, making, and wasting materials based on finite fossil resources (e.g., using petroleum to make plastics that cannot be recycled and end up in the landfill).

In answers to questions, Eckert said fuels and chemicals that are industrially produced by microbes (often by fermentation of renewable biomass) include acetone, butanol, ethanol, insulin and 2,3-Butanediol, which has been used in printing inks, perfumes, and pharmaceuticals. But she added, while the production of these substances has been scaled up, it is often not very profitable.","https://www.oakridger.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/NOAK/87333295007-carrie-eckert-ornl-credit-1-copy.jpg?crop=1378,775,x0,y66&width=1378&height=775&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 11:57:23.897303

Founded by Luis de Ita Maubant and Reiner van Gageldonk, the Norwegian startup has developed a platform that combines big data, artificial intelligence, and geospatial analysis to predict where and when charging demand will occur. By monitoring over half a million charging stations in Europe and analysing millions of charging sessions in detail – from traffic flows to land use models, from demographic data to vehicle registrations, all the way to competing services – SurplusMap identifies the micro-markets in which chargers will reach sustainable usage levels and flags those in which this will not happen, avoiding wasted investments.

Going beyond static maps and driving toward predictive infrastructure intelligence, the platform enables operators and investors to make decisions on future implementation. ""We have created SurplusMap to make electrification work in practice, not just on paper,"" CEO Luis de Ita Maubant tells Renewable Matter. ""With unique data and artificial intelligence, we can guide the expansion of charging stations and prepare to integrate them into tomorrow's energy system.""

As increasing numbers of charging stations are installed across Europe, the problem of making the grid work economically remains. The risk is that an indiscriminate race to installation might lead to an excess of supply and loss-making infrastructure.

In Northern Europe, various charging point operators, such as supermarket chains and retailers, already use SurplusMap to optimise networks, while Berlin-Brandenburg Airport is collaborating with the startup to manage the charging of cars, taxis, and HGVs.

Supported by EIT Urban Mobility, the company sees charging hubs as assets for the energy grid, not only in the service of motorists but also as contributors to the stability of the electric system. In partnership with the city of Oslo, the startup is researching how charging models impact the grid and how hubs can become balancing instruments. A pilot project, planned for 2026, aims to prove how public charging can support both citizens and the energy system.

The agreement, finalised on the sidelines of the Dubai Airshow, links the UAE’s largest carrier with its primary fuel provider at a time when airlines worldwide are under pressure to cut emissions and secure long-term access to lower-carbon fuels.

The MoU lays out a framework for feasibility studies that will assess what it would take to establish a reliable SAF supply chain in Dubai. These studies will examine supply infrastructure, potential local production, blending requirements and the commercial conditions needed to ensure long-term viability. A joint steering committee will guide the evaluation, signalling a coordinated effort between two of the UAE’s most influential aviation players.

SAF is a certified drop-in fuel that works with existing aircraft and airport systems. It can be blended with conventional jet fuel at up to 50% and, in its unblended form, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. This makes it one of the most practical near-term solutions for the aviation sector as broader decarbonisation technologies continue to develop.

Emirates has been active in UAE-level SAF initiatives, contributing to the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and participating in committees focused on biofuels, hydrogen and next-generation aviation fuels. The policy aims to position the UAE as a regional centre for alternative fuels, with a target of 700 million litres of SAF production by 2030.

The airline has been running SAF demonstration flights to test operational readiness. In January 2023, it operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine. This was followed by the first A380 demonstration flight using 100 per cent SAF in one engine in November 2023. Emirates also operated flights from Dubai International Airport using more than 315,000 gallons of blended SAF that month, integrated directly into airport fuel systems.

A decisive push in U.S. aviation decarbonization

A new multi-year supply agreement between DHL Express and Phillips 66 is set to reshape the availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the U.S. West Coast. The companies have signed a contract for more than 240,000 metric tons of SAF over three years, a scale that places the deal among the largest for any American air cargo operator.

The fuel will support DHL’s air operations through deliveries at Los Angeles International Airport, the logistics group’s main West Coast gateway, with planned expansion to San Francisco and other regional airports. DHL will use a book-and-claim system to account for emissions reductions across its global network, a mechanism increasingly adopted by aviation customers seeking verifiable decarbonization pathways.

At its core, the agreement reflects the intensifying pressure on logistics and freight companies to decarbonize hard-to-abate transport segments while keeping pace with tightening regulatory expectations. With investors, regulators and corporate customers demanding clearer Scope 3 strategies, the expansion of credible SAF supply has become a pivotal element in global freight planning.

Production anchored at a flagship renewable fuels complex

Phillips 66 will produce the SAF at its Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California, a facility undergoing a major conversion to manufacture renewable fuels at scale. The plant has the capacity to produce 150 million gallons of neat SAF annually, allowing the company to supply long-term commitments such as DHL’s.

RELATED ARTICLE: DHL Leads Sustainable Transport with Hydrogen Trucks in Germany

For DHL’s operations, the supply volume translates into an expected reduction of roughly 737,000 metric tons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions over the contract period. The company has framed the agreement as a key lever in advancing its net-zero 2050 strategy, which relies heavily on securing consistent access to lower-carbon fuel.

Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said: “This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals. By securing a reliable supply of SAF, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions – and those within our customers’ supply chains – but also setting a precedent for the logistics and air cargo industries in the U.S. Our collaboration with Phillips 66 underscores our commitment to a lower-carbon future and demonstrates the importance of sustainable practices in our operations.”

Phillips 66 leadership echoed the strategic rationale. Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial, stated: “This agreement between Phillips 66 and DHL demonstrates our shared commitment to SAF market leadership and credible action in the growing SAF industry. Through our global renewable fuel business, we are committed to supporting DHL and our customers in achieving their decarbonization goals. Our agreement with DHL showcases cross-industry collaboration, and together, we aim to drive progress toward sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.”

A growing global SAF portfolio

For DHL, the U.S. deal strengthens a portfolio of SAF partnerships secured across Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific since 2021. The company’s GoGreen Plus service, which enables corporate customers to cut Scope 3 emissions through SAF usage, depends on sustained access to high-integrity fuel supply. As more multinational shippers begin accounting for logistics-related emissions within procurement decisions, scalable SAF access has become a differentiator for aviation-heavy supply chain providers.

The agreement also highlights the broader policy and market dynamics surrounding renewable fuels. U.S. federal and state incentives have begun accelerating SAF production, while forthcoming mandates in Europe and rising voluntary demand from corporate buyers are shaping the global competitive landscape. Producers capable of delivering consistent volumes at verifiable carbon intensity levels are positioning themselves to capture a growing share of the market.

What executives should watch

For aviation, logistics and energy executives, the DHL–Phillips 66 deal points to a tightening interplay between corporate climate commitments, regional policy incentives and the maturing economics of SAF production. It also illustrates the role of cross-sector alliances in scaling alternatives to conventional jet fuel at a pace aligned with climate targets.

As U.S. and international regulators consider stricter aviation emissions frameworks, supply agreements of this size show how major carriers are preparing for a future where lower-carbon fuel becomes a structural, rather than optional, element of fleet strategy. And as global trade continues to rely on rapid air freight capacity, the sustainability of these routes will depend on how quickly the SAF ecosystem expands beyond isolated, project-based volumes into consistent regional supply chains.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DHL-Phillips-66-to-Deliver-Major-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Supply-for-U.S.-Cargo-Routes.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:58:21.349500

The sustainable aviation fuel is a strategic of decarbonization policy, energy innovation, and aviation sector transformation. Sustainable aviation fuel is defined by the European Union as liquid aviation fuel derived from biomass, waste oils, renewable electricity, or captured carbon that achieves at least 50% lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction compared to conventional jet fuel, which serves as the primary near-term instrument for reducing aviation emissions without requiring aircraft redesign. This regulatory backbone, combined with airport sustainability certifications from the Airport Carbon Accreditation program and corporate net zero pledges from carriers like Lufthansa and Air France, crystallised demand signals across the value chain.

MARKET DRIVERS

EU Regulatory Mandates Create Non-Discretionary Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The European Union’s binding regulatory framework has fundamentally shifted sustainable aviation fuel from an optional mitigation tool to a compulsory input for all commercial flight operators is leveraging the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. As per the finalised ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation adopted in 2023, fuel suppliers must ensure that 2% of all aviation fuel delivered at EU airports in 2025 consists of sustainable aviation fuel, with incremental increases to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. This legal obligation applies uniformly across all 27 member states and covers over 600 commercial airports, generating a baseline of structural demand irrespective of ticket prices or passenger volumes. According to Eurostat, EU airports handled more than 8.4 billion litres of jet fuel in 2024, implying an immediate requirement for at least 168 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel in 2025 alone. The regulation also introduces a credit trading mechanism, allowing compliant suppliers to monetise over fulfilment, thereby creating financial incentives for early investment. These interlocking policies eliminate market ambiguity and compel airlines, fuel suppliers, and producers to secure long-term offtake agreements, which establish a policy-driven demand floor that anchors the entire value chain.

Corporate Air Travel Decarbonization Commitments Accelerate Offtake Agreements

The voluntary but binding corporate climate strategies are the direct procurement of sustainable aviation fuel across Europe’s business and premium travel, which is additionally expected o elevate the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. As per the Corporate Jet Commitment launched under the World Economic Forum, over 70 European multinational corporations, including Unilever, Siemens and Novo Nordisk, have pledged to power 100% of their business air travel with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. These commitments translate into multi-year offtake agreements that de-risk producer investments. In 2024, Scandinavian Airlines signed a 10-year deal with Neste to supply 50 million litres annually, while Lufthansa Group secured 75 million litres per year from multiple producers through 2030.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Feedstock Scarcity and Competition from Other Renewable Sectors Limit Scalability

The limited availability of certified low-carbon feedstocks and intense competition from other bio-based industries are majorly limiting the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. According to the European Environment Agency, the total sustainable residual oil and fat supply in the EU, including used cooking oil and animal tallow, amounted to approximately 3.2 million metric tons in 2024, equivalent to only 5 billion litres of potential fuel, far below projected demand. Simultaneously, the renewable diesel sector is driven by the EU’s Fit for 55 transport decarbonization package that consumes over 85% of these same feedstocks, as reported by the International Energy Agency. Moreover, sustainability criteria under the Renewable Energy Directive II restrict the use of crop-based feedstocks, eliminating potential alternatives like camelina or carinata at scale.

High Production Costs and Lack of Economies of Scale Impede Commercial Viability

The advanced systems are more expensive than conventional systems, primarily due to immature production technologies and the absence of large-scale dedicated facilities. The high production cost and lack of sufficient support from the government bodies are also degrading the growth of the European sustainable aviation fuel market. This four to seven-fold premium renders the fuel economically unviable without subsidies or premium offtake agreements. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation, achieving cost parity requires production scales exceeding 1 billion litres per plant, levels not yet realised in the region. The capital intensity is further exacerbated by the need for specialised hydrotreatment or Fischer-Tropsch units that cannot be easily retrofitted from existing refineries.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Emergence of Power to Liquid Fuel Pathways Offers Long-Term Decarbonization Leverage

The power to produce liquid sustainable aviation fuel produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂ using renewable electricity is a substantial opportunity to leverage new opportunities for the growth oof oftathe inable aviation fuel market. In 2024, the German government launched the H2Global initiative, allocating 2 billion euros to support kerosene production, while Spain’s Repsol began construction of a 100,000 litre per year pilot plant in Bilbao. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that power-to-liquid costs could fall below 1.50 euros per litre by 2035 with scaled electrolysis and falling renewable power prices.

Airport Infrastructure Modernisation Enables Blending and Distribution at Scale

The systematic retrofitting of European airport fueling systems through seamless integration into existing logistics is another opportunity prompting the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. The aviation fueling operates through centralised hydrant systems that require precise compatibility and quality assurance. Amsterdam Schiphol and Oslo Gardermoen have already implemented dedicated sustainable aviation fuel hydrant lines by enabling a drop in use without aircraft modifications. These investments reduce handling complexity and transaction costs, making large-scale adoption operationally feasible. Furthermore, standardised quality protocols under ASTM D7566 ensure fuel integrity across the supply chain.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Uncertainty in International Carbon Credit Recognition Undermines Investment Certainty

The lack of global harmonisation in carbon accounting for sustainable aviation fuel creates significant financial and strategic risk for European producers and airlines, which is a challenging factor for the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel market. Under the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s CORSIA scheme, which governs international flight emissions, only fuels achieving 10% or greater lifecycle CO₂ reduction qualify for emissions offsetting credits. However, the methodology for calculating those reductions differs from the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, leading to discrepancies in recognised carbon savings. According to the International Air Transport Association, a sustainable aviation fuel batch deemed to offer an 80% reduction under EU rules may be credited with only 60% under CORSIA due to divergent land use change and product allocation assumptions. This inconsistency complicates long-term offtake pricing and discourages cross-border investments. Moreover,non-EUU jurisdictions like the United States apply their own lifecycle models under the Inflation Reduction Act, which further fragments the global incentive landscape.

Limited Public Acceptance of Novel Feedstocks Triggers Policy and Permitting Delays

The deployment of next-generation sustainable aviation fuel pathways is frequently obstructed by public scepticism and regulatory caution regarding novel feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste or forest residues. Although the Renewable Energy Directive permits advanced feedstocks, local permitting authorities often delay or reject plant proposals due to concerns over air emissions, odour or perceived competition with waste recycling. As per the European Biomass Association, over 40% of proposed waste-to-fuel projects in France and Italy faced community opposition in 2023, resulting in average permitting delays of 18 months. Additionally, the EU’s updated Industrial Emissions Directive imposes stringent Best Available Techniques requirements that increase capital costs for gasification and pyrolysis units. These social and regulatory headwinds slow the transition from pilot to commercial scale, particularly for non-lipid pathways that are essential to meet 2035 policy targets.

SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

By Fuel Type Insights

The biofuel segment was the largest by capturing 58.3% of the European sustainable aviation fuel market share in 2024 due to its commercial readiness, regulatory acceptance,c, and compatibility with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Nearly all sustainable aviation fuel consumed in Europe in 2024 was derived from lipid-based feedstock, primarily used cooking oil, animal fats and non-food vegetable oil,,s that processed via established pathways like HEFA. Airlines, such as KLM and Lufthansa, have executed more than 500,000 commercial flights using bio-derived blends since 2020 without engine modifications. The fuel’s drop in nature allows immediate integration into the current jet fuel supply chain with no capital expenditure at airports. Furthermore, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation explicitly recognises biofuels as compliance tools from day one,whilee while pathways remain in demonstration phases.

The power to liquid segment is anticipated to grow at the fastest CAGR of 11.2% during the forecast period, with its potential for near-total decarbonization and alignment with the continent’s renewable electricity ambitions. As per the International Renewable Energy Agency, Europe installed over 20 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2024 alone, providing a growing surplus for fuel production. The European Commission’s Innovation Fund allocated 450 million euros in early 2024 specifically for power-to-liquid demonstration facilities, including projects by Siemens Energy and SAS. Additionally, the EU’s Net Zero Industry Act identifies electrofuels as strategic and mandates streamlined permitting for production sites.

By Technology Insights

The HEFA SPK technology segment was the largest by holding a prominent share of the European sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024 due to its commercial validation, feedstock flexibility, and certification under ASTM D7566 since 2011. This pathway converts triglycerides from waste oils and animal fats into hydrocarbons chemically identical to conventional jet fuel, enabling up to 50% blending without aircraft modifications. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, over 98% of sustainable aviation fuel flights operated in Europe between 2020 and 22024 utilised HEFA SPK blends. The technology benefits from repurposed hydrotreating infrastructure originally built for renewable diesel, allowing faster scale-up than novel processes. Furthermore, the European Commission’s delegated acts under ReFuelEU explicitly include HEFA SPK in the list of eligible fuels for compliance credits from 2025 onward.

The Fischer Tropsch SPK segment is swiftly emerging at the fastest CAGR owing to its ability to utilise non-lipid feedstocks such as municipal solid waste and green hydrogen-derived syngas. According to the European Biomass Association, over 250 million metric tons of recoverable municipal and industrial waste are generated annually in the EU, offering a vast untapped resource base. In 2024, Finland’s Fulcrum BioEnergy Europe partnered with British Airways to commission a 100 million litre per year FT SPK plant in the UK using household waste as feedstock. Similarly, Germany’s Sasol and LanzaJet are piloting integrated biomass gasification and FT synthesis units under Horizon Europe funding.

By End Use Insights

The large airlines segment accounted for a dominant share of the European sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024 due to their extensive route network, high fuel bburdenand public sustainability accountability. These airlines face intense scrutiny from investors, passengers, and regulators to meet the Science-Basedgets Targets initiative validated net-zero commitments. As a resuresultthey have signed the bulk of Europe’s long-term offtake agreement, including Lufthansa’s 75 million litre annual deal with Neste and Air France’s partnership with TotalEnergies for 100 million litres per year by 2026. The European Commission’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive further mandates large firms to disclose scope 3 emissions, including fuel choices, amplifying reputational stakes. Additionally, their purchasing power enables volume discounts and co-investment in production facilities, making sustainable aviation fuel economically more feasible than for smaller operators. This combination of scale compliance pressure and strategic procurement secures large airlines as the dominant end-use segment.

The non-scheduled operators segment is gaining huge traction by showcasing the fastest CAGR of 36.2% during the forecast period, with private jet charter services, cargo airlines and air ambulance providers— ree fastest growing end users of sustainable aviation fuel in Europe, driven by premium client expectations and niche operational advantages. Companies like VistaJet and NetJets have responded by mandating 30 to 100% sustainable aviation fuel blends on all European departures. Cargo operators such as DHL Express have committed to powering all intra-European freight flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2027 under its GoGreen program. The International Air Transport Association notes that non-scheduled operators benefit from flexible scheduling and smaller fuel volumes, enabling easier logistics for premium fuel sourcing. Moreover, their ability to pass costs directly to clients avoids the fare sensitivity faced by commercial airlines.

Surging demand from tech giants to offset AI-linked emissions is squeezing supply of durable carbon removal credits (biochar, DAC, land restoration). Prices are now about 4× higher than forest-preservation offsets. Since 2019, companies have spent hundreds of millions, with combined spot buys and offtakes topping $10B (CDR.fyi). In 2024, buyers purchased 8 Mt of durable removals; in 2025 YTD, 25 Mt—yet <1 Mt has actually been issued, mostly biochar, pushing buyers toward long-term offtakes (Isometric/Patch). Patch says ~33% of requests seek biochar but <20% close; reforestation requests 25%, sales 12%. To secure supply, Pure Data Centres Group will invest £24m in a U.K. biochar plant (Wiltshire), scaling in ~18 months to 18,500 t/yr, with three more sites planned. Microsoft says large offtakes “unlock a virtuous cycle” by anchoring projects; Alphabet declined comment. As AI expands data-center footprints—often on fossil power—demand signals are strengthening.

Nestlé, Mars Urge EU: Don’t Delay the Deforestation Law

Major brands — including Nestlé, Mars Wrigley, Ferrero and others — asked EU lawmakers to avoid new delays to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). They warn that a ‘stop-the-clock’ or open-ended review would extend legal uncertainty, penalize early movers, and undermine the EU’s credibility with producer countries. The European Commission still plans entry into force end-2025, with a 6-month enforcement grace for large firms and SMEs covered end-2026; it also proposed simplifying reporting by focusing statements on companies that first place products on the EU market. Brands support streamlining but say some tweaks could add burdens for downstream players. They propose: only first placers file statements, while all companies must keep due-diligence systems, act on substantiated concerns, and keep supplier/buyer records. A Parliament vote on the package is next week. The EUDR covers commodities like palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa, rubber, soy (and products like leather, chocolate, tires, furniture).

‘Existential Threat’: Small Doses of Ocean Plastic Can Kill Marine Life

New research led by Ocean Conservancy warns that ocean plastics pose an “existential threat” to marine biodiversity — and that very small amounts can be fatal. Scientists analyzed 10,412 autopsies: 1,537 seabirds (57 species), 1,306 sea turtles (7 species) and 7,569 marine mammals (31 species). Plastics were present at death in 47% of turtles, ~33% of seabirds, and 12% of marine mammals. For seabirds like Atlantic puffins, <3 sugar cubes of plastic implies a 90% chance of death; for turtles (e.g., loggerheads), just over two baseballs; for marine mammals (e.g., harbor porpoises), about one football. Rubber & hard plastics are especially deadly for seabirds; soft plastics & fishing gear hit marine mammals hardest; turtles are vulnerable to both. An estimated 11 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year — roughly a truckload a minute. Authors say these thresholds can guide science-based targets and policy.

Irish Direct Air Capture (DAC) company, NEG8 Carbon, has signed a contract for Phase 1 of a major project in the UK to develop large-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF) production using a low-carbon energy source. This paves the way for economic production of eSAF at scale, which is critical for decarbonisation of the aviation industry.

The CO₂ provided via DAC will be combined with green hydrogen and nuclear-generated electricity to create eSAF in a specialised process. The eSAF produced will save over 90% emissions compared to traditional jet fuel and will comply with international SAF mandates.

The project, known as Eq.flight, will be led by Equilibrion who are pioneering the drive to decarbonise aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy through small and advanced modular reactors.

Equilibrion was awarded £1 million for Phase 1 of the Eq.flight project as part of the UK Department of Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund (AFF) 2025 investment of £63m in 17 clean aviation initiatives, bringing to £198m the total value of state investment in this area since 2022.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology is particularly suitable for this project as it uses low-carbon heat and electricity from nuclear, which greatly reduces the cost and increases efficiency of the DAC process.

NEG8 Carbon Founder & Managing Director, Ray Naughton, said:

“This positions NEG8 Carbon as one of the leaders in the field to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel using Direct Air Capture of CO₂. The potential in this market is driven by the EU and UK government mandates to airlines to use more SAF in their fuel mix progressing to 70% in the EU by 2050. This creates a global SAF market with a value of $400 billion by 2050. NEG8 Carbon is now positioned to be a major player in this market.”

Philip Rogers and Caroline Longman, Co-founders and Directors at Equilibrion said:

“We are committed to developing solutions that enable the aviation sector to offer lower emission flights to customers around the world by leveraging low-carbon nuclear electricity and heat. Power-to-liquids powered by advanced nuclear reactors offers the potential for the scale of production needed to make a major impact on climate change.”

What is Direct Air Capture (DAC)?

Direct Air Capture is a technology that extracts carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air. NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology works by using fans to draw in large quantities of air and passing it through NEG8’s revolutionary low-cost CO₂ extraction system. The extracted CO₂ is either permanently stored underground or used practically in carbon utilisation processes.

What is eSAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is produced from a broad range of materials and feedstocks, whereas eSAF is made from CO₂ captured from the air and green hydrogen. DAC is the only technology which can provide a large-scale source of green CO₂ at million tonne scale at the eSAF production location.

About Equilibrion

Equilibrion is a UK-based project developer and consultancy focused on using the potential of nuclear power to mitigate climate change. Eq.flight represents its flagship PtL SAF initiative, designed to deliver reliable, mandate-compliant fuel at scale. The company supports UK ambitions to decarbonise aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy, bridging energy and climate strategy through small and advanced modular reactors.

About the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF)

The Advanced Fuels Fund is a UK government initiative that supports first-of-a-kind (FOAK) commercial and demonstration-scale projects. All selected projects have demonstrated their potential to produce SAF capable of reducing emissions by more than 65% on a lifecycle basis when used in place of conventional fossil jet fuel.

The United Arab Emirates signalled a decisive shift in aviation policy by announcing that all national carriers will soon operate under a binding requirement to blend sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, into every flight departing the country. A voluntary pledge of one percent SAF by 2031 already exists, yet regulators now intend to convert that guideline into law well before the decade closes. Moving from encouragement to obligation will send a powerful market signal to fuel suppliers and investors.

Building a Domestic SAF Ecosystem

The government is backing the policy with infrastructure. A new plant in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone will repurpose waste cooking oil and other residues into 125 million litres of certified SAF each year, with plans to double this output during a second construction phase. Additional joint ventures, including a proposed facility in Hong Kong with international partners, demonstrate how the UAE is positioning itself as a hub for regional SAF distribution.

Non-Obvious Insight: Supply Chain Resilience

Beyond emissions reduction the mandate quietly strengthens national energy security. By turning local waste streams into jet fuel the country diversifies feedstocks and lowers exposure to global crude price fluctuations, creating a resilient aviation supply chain that can support growth even during volatile markets.

Economic Considerations

SAF currently costs more than conventional kerosene, yet the government is exploring tailored incentives such as loan guarantees and carbon credit allocations to smooth the cost curve for airlines. Early scale benefits often unlock rapid price declines, a trend previously observed in solar and battery sectors.

Global Influence

By embedding sustainability directly into flight operations the UAE establishes a reference model that other tourism driven economies can emulate. International airlines landing in Abu Dhabi or Dubai will experience established SAF supply chains, encouraging broader adoption.

We recognise there's significant work ahead to address supply constraints and infrastructure requirements, but partnerships like this are essential to identifying practical solutions and building the foundation for broader SAF accessibility in Dubai and eventually across our network.""

Hussain Sultan Lootah, Acting CEO of ENOC Group said, “At ENOC, we recognise the critical role that Sustainable Aviation Fuel plays in reducing carbon emissions across the aviation sector. This MoU with Emirates reflects our shared commitment to developing local SAF production and the infrastructure needed to make low-carbon aviation a reality. As the UAE works toward supplying 1% of jet fuel to national airlines from locally produced SAF by 2031, we believe this collaboration brings us a step closer to that goal. ENOC will continue to invest in innovation, strengthen partnerships, and explore practical pathways to build reliable SAF supply chains that support the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 ambition.”

As a safe and fully certified drop-in fuel compatible with existing aircraft fleet and airport infrastructure, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel at a ratio of up to 50%, creating an aviation fuel that is significantly lower in lifecycle carbon emissions. In its neat form, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.1

Emirates is actively engaged in advancing the UAE's sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem through membership in the Technical Group under the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee, established by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy.

The airline has contributed to the UAE's General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which aims to transform the UAE into a regional hub for alternative aviation fuels with production targets of 700 million litres by 2030. Additionally, Emirates and the UAE GCAA have played key roles in developing the UAE's power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, driven by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the World Economic Forum.

Emirates also spearheaded SAF demonstration flights on its Boeing 777 and A380 aircraft. In January 2023, the airline operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine, and in November 2023 conducted the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its four engines. That same month, Emirates operated flights with sustainable aviation fuel from Dubai International Airport using 315,000 gallons of blended SAF integrated into the airport’s fuel infrastructure.

During its 2024-25 financial year, the airline procured 7,519 tonnes of SAF at airports across its network, including Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Oslo, Singapore, Paris, Lyon and Nice.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?
What is Australia's stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel?","Passenger and commercial flights operating out of Singapore are set to become more expensive after the announcement of a world-first sustainable fuel tax added onto ticket prices.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) recently revealed it would introduce a ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy"" for flights booked from April 1, 2026 and due for departure from the South-East Asian country from October 1.

""The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore's effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,"" CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said.

""It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.

""We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.""

Two of Australia's three major commercial airlines — Qantas and Jetstar — offer flights to Singapore.

There are various other international carriers that also fly from Singapore to Australia, including Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Emirates and British Airways.

So, how will the price hikes impact Australians and could a similar tax be implemented here? Let's break it down.

Price increases will be linked to flight distances

Singapore says the SAF Levy will be implemented in a bid to align with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) goal of net zero carbon emissions in global aviation by 2050.

In 2024, the country launched a sustainable aviation plan to reduce domestic airport emissions from 2019 levels by 20 per cent by 2030.

As part of that plan, the CAAS said the new levy ""is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1 per cent SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel"".

It means travellers on flights departing Singapore will be charged more, depending on how far away their destination is and how much fuel is expected to be used during the journey.

The levy will only be listed as a separate tax charge on airline ticket receipts for people who begin their journey in Singapore.

Travellers transiting through the country or transferring to another airline during a stopover in Singapore will not have to pay extra, the CAAS's Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Ng told the ABC.

""For flights with multiple stops, the SAF Levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore,"" a CAAS statement said.

To determine how much to charge, the CAAS said all destinations were grouped into four geographic categories based on distance. The amount also varies based on whether the passenger flies economy or premium.

Travellers flying from Singapore to other parts of South-East Asia in an economy seat will be charged the least, at just $S1 ($1.18) on top of the cost of their ticket.

Travellers to Australia will face a $3.30 fee for economy and $13.21 for premium cabin seats, while passengers who fly in business or first class to North, Central or South America will be charged the most — an additional $49.08.

Australian and international travellers have increasingly been visiting or returning from Singapore amid a rebound in air travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

At least 39,590 short-term visitors were recorded entering Australia from Singapore as to September this year, up from 31,370 and 31,140 at the same time in 2024 and 2023 respectively, ABS data shows.

The CAAS said the levy would also include per-kilogram charges for shipping cargo through Singapore, ranging from $S0.01 to $S0.15 depending on geographic category, and private jet operators would be charged a fee per-aircraft of between $47.19 and $7,668 based on the type and size of plane.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that an SAF is ""a liquid fuel currently used in commercial aviation which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80 per cent.""

It can be made from various sources, including oils, fats, green waste and non-food crops or via a synthetic process that draws carbon from the air, the organisation says.

Loading...

""It is ‘sustainable’ because the raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, or is responsible for forest degradation,"" the IATA says on its website.

""Whereas fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon that had been previously locked away, SAF recycles the CO2 which has been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock during the course of its life.""

At least 175 airports worldwide are already distributing SAF to commercial carriers and more than $103 billion has been announced in investments in the sector, according to the ICAO.

Will Australia adopt this levy?

Australian airlines and their customers are currently not subject to mandatory flight sustainability costs.

Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia do, however, offer travellers the option to voluntarily pay extra to offset their individual carbon emissions made during a flight.

Neil Hansford, an aviation expert and the CEO of Strategic Aviation Solutions, told the ABC he expected Australia to watch Singapore's SAF Levy implementation closely in determining whether to create a similar tax in the future.

""If it's going to be based on the fuel, they'll have to apply an excise … They'll either increase the excise or do a per tonne, per litre rate.""

Australia's major airlines have previously voiced opposition to government-enforced measures that could increase costs for passengers.

In submissions made to a 2024 Senate committee inquiry examining a proposal for airlines to compensate their customers for delayed or cancelled flights, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Rex Airlines all argued against fee-based measures, saying they do not improve the customer experience.

What is Australia's stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

In recent years, the federal government and Australia's commercial airlines have been actively pursuing increased sustainability in the country's aviation sector.

In 2021, the Bioenergy Australia advocacy group reported that production costs were the biggest challenge to airlines opting out of mostly using traditional jet fuel during their flights.

A ""Bioenergy Roadmap"" released in that year by the federal government predicted that ""with increased target focus"", up to 45 per cent of the aviation market could be fuelled by sustainable options by the 2050s.

Bioenergy Australia has also previously proposed the creation of a ""Singapore-Australia-New Zealand Jet Council"" to lobby governments into supporting aviation sustainability across airlines, fuel suppliers, airports and aircraft manufacturers.

Qantas announced in May this year that almost two million litres of SAF had been imported into Australia, in a joint commercial deal made with Sydney Airport and Ampol.

""The fuel could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft, reducing the resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400 tonnes,"" a Qantas statement said at the time.

""This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions generated by 800 cars.""

In a statement to the ABC on Tuesday, a Qantas Group spokesperson said that Qantas and Jetstar supported the use of SAF to reduce emissions.

“The availability and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be critical for all airlines to reduce their direct emissions and we’re seeing more governments taking steps to encourage and enable growth in SAF supply and demand,"" the statement said.

""Singapore is taking a transparent approach to increasing SAF use and enabling emissions reduction.”

In September this year, the Albanese government announced a $1.1 billion pledge to help boost the production of ""low carbon liquid fuels"", including at least $33.5 million dedicated to a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.

""The first production of ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029,"" a joint statement released by Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

""Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use.

Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, is soaring toward a greener future. The airline’s commitment to sustainability spans far beyond just fuel-efficient aircraft. From modernising its fleet to incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Cathay Pacific is taking bold steps to reduce its carbon footprint and revolutionise air travel in Asia and beyond. With a goal of achieving 100% SAF by 2030 and reducing in-flight waste, the airline is making significant strides in transforming aviation into a more eco-conscious industry. This innovative journey isn’t just about fleet modernisation; it’s about sustainability across every aspect of its operation.

Cathay Pacific’s Green Fleet: The Key to Sustainability

One of the primary pillars of Cathay Pacific’s sustainability plan is its modern fleet of fuel-efficient jets. The airline has begun replacing older aircraft with newer, more environmentally friendly models like the Airbus A350 and A321neo. These planes are significantly more fuel-efficient, reducing emissions and optimising operational costs. By 2027, Cathay Pacific will also replace its ageing Boeing 747 cargo planes with the Airbus A350F, which will further lower its environmental impact.

The airline’s shift to more advanced, energy-efficient aircraft is a critical step toward making air travel more sustainable in the long term. With reduced emissions, these aircraft offer a greener alternative to the traditional, less-efficient planes still in operation around the world.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Game Changer

Cathay Pacific is also a frontrunner in promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. In collaboration with aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the airline has made significant investments to ensure its fleet can operate on SAF. By 2030, Cathay aims for 100% of its jet fuel to be derived from SAF, which has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of air travel.

Currently, some Cathay flights already use a mix of conventional jet fuel and SAF, which is sourced from renewable materials like used cooking oil. This fuel reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil-based aviation fuel. The airline’s partnership with Airbus also includes a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million to help accelerate SAF production, not only in Asia but globally, paving the way for a more sustainable aviation industry.

Minimising Waste: Cathay’s Eco-Conscious Cabin

While planes and fuel take centre stage, sustainability for Cathay Pacific extends far beyond the cockpit. The airline is also focusing on reducing waste and minimising its environmental impact in the cabin. Cathay has made remarkable progress in reducing single-use plastics onboard. From 2019 to 2025, the airline has reduced the average number of plastic items per passenger from 7.7 to just 1.5. Moreover, 50% of the remaining plastic onboard is made from recycled materials, and the airline is actively looking for alternative eco-friendly materials to further reduce plastic waste.

One notable achievement is the switch to 100% recycled plastic for all water bottles served on flights departing from Hong Kong. This initiative alone has contributed to a dramatic reduction in the airline’s plastic consumption, setting a positive example for other airlines in the region.

Waste Reduction and Circular Economy: A New Approach to Food Waste

Cathay Pacific is also leading the way in sustainable food waste management. In Hong Kong, food waste from flights is no longer just discarded; it’s recycled into electricity. The airline has implemented a system that sorts food waste at its Cathay Dining Flight Kitchen, sending it to an organic resources recovery centre. The food waste undergoes anaerobic digestion, a process that generates electricity – enough to power approximately 8,000 households annually.

This innovative approach not only helps reduce landfill waste but also supports a greener, circular economy where waste is viewed as a resource rather than something to be discarded.

The Future: Greener Together

Cathay Pacific’s sustainability strategy is built on collaboration. In addition to working with Airbus on SAF production, the airline is also involved in a partnership with the Oneworld alliance and Breakthrough Energy Ventures to fund the development of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels. This collaboration aims to advance SAF technologies in the long term, ensuring that they are scalable, cost-competitive, and accessible across the entire aviation industry.

As part of its holistic approach to sustainability, Cathay also has ambitious targets for waste reduction in the cabin. By 2030, it plans to reduce the amount of waste generated per passenger to just 0.63 kg, a 30% reduction from 2019 levels.

What Travelers Can Do to Support Sustainability

While Cathay Pacific is taking significant steps to green its operations, there are simple ways travelers can support the airline’s sustainability efforts. First, passengers can choose flights that operate on sustainable fuels when possible. Many airlines, including Cathay, are transparent about their environmental efforts, so travelers can be more conscious when booking their flights.

Another way to help is by bringing reusable items onboard, such as water bottles and travel mugs. This reduces the demand for single-use plastics and contributes to Cathay’s goal of reducing plastic waste. Additionally, travelers can support eco-friendly tourism by choosing sustainable travel destinations and encouraging other airlines to follow Cathay Pacific’s lead in adopting sustainable practices.

Sustainability in Hong Kong’s Travel Industry

Hong Kong’s travel and tourism industry is gradually embracing sustainability, with airlines like Cathay Pacific taking the lead. For travelers, this represents a shift toward more eco-conscious holiday options. As travelers become more aware of the environmental impacts of air travel, they are increasingly seeking out airlines that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability.

Biofuel company Sky Renewables has partnered with eight central Queensland farmers to trial growing the crop as a feedstock for renewable energy.

Traditionally grown in Europe, Russia and the United States to produce sugar, beets were first grown in Victoria's Gippsland region in the late 1800s, but the industry collapsed after World War II.

Already working with the industry that came to replace it — sugar cane — the company's chief executive Simon Yim hopes beets will prove superior when it comes to fuel.

As the Queensland government holds its own hearings into sugar's bioenergy opportunity, the industry is hopeful the COP30 climate talks in Brazil will set clear targets to incentivise further investment.

Waste game

In the Burdekin region near Townsville in north Queensland, Mr Yim works with canegrowers to produce biomethane, a renewable natural gas.

""We are trying to persuade the growers to abandon burning the cane field before harvesting so that we can take the tops and trash and use it as a feedstock,"" he said.

But 600 kilometres to the south, around Emerald, where cotton and grains are the staple crops, eight growers have signed up to work with the company over the next two years.

Mr Yim said the beets would be trialled as a winter rotational crop, extracting the sugar juice to ethanol, an ingredient in biofuel.

He said the lack of infrastructure made beets unviable as a sugar crop when compared to the established cane industry, but as a water-efficient feedstock for the fledgling biofuel industry, it stacked up.

""Right now, what was considered waste just a few years ago [has] become valuable,"" he said.

Shahana McKenzie, the chief executive of industry representative body Bioenergy Australia, said there were positive signs that value was being recognised globally.

""There has been a very strong focus on decarbonisation of the electricity sector globally,"" she said.

""It's really good to see that now there is this focus moving towards low-carbon liquid fuels and renewable gases.""

Two years ago, global leaders agreed to transition away from oil, gas and coal at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, but the deal was criticised for failing to set actionable targets.

Ms McKenzie said the most recent climate talks in Brazil had the opportunity to drive global market development by addressing the shortage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""It sends a signal out globally across the countries to say this is now an area of focus.""

Sustainable momentum

In September, the Australian government announced a $1.1 billion program to promote biofuel manufacturing and development, in a bid to provide decarbonised fuel options to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.

Mr Yim said international interest in SAF production had accelerated since Europe set a minimum supply mandate, which requires fuel at EU airports to contain a minimum of 2 per cent SAF in 2025, increasing to 70 per cent by 2050.

""For example, Qantas has committed to 10 per cent SAF in their tanks starting in 2030.""

Ms McKenzie said regional and rural Australia was in a unique position to capitalise on the interest.

""What we have seen over the past 12 months is absolutely a strong focus from businesses out of the US as well as Europe looking at Australia and saying, hang on, there's a lot of feedstock there,"" she said.

""With that feedstock in the regions, we can be providing economic returns into regional Australia.

""If we're talking about the low-carbon fuels and renewable gas projects, we're talking about thousands of jobs, we're talking an additional 10 billion GDP.""

In Queensland, that opportunity is being explored through an inquiry into sugarcane bioenergy opportunities.

Hearings resume in Brisbane on November 19. Among those providing submissions is the peak industry body for the sugarcane milling sector, Australian Sugar Manufacturers.

""Sugar-derived biofuels [can] provide affordable biogas to regional manufacturers and replace coal to make steel production green with renewable pellets made from sugar by-products.

""This agenda will create thousands of new jobs in places like Bundaberg, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns, and will attract more manufacturing businesses to regional Queensland through access to affordable energy and secure the long-term viability of the sugar industry that already supports 20,000 jobs.""

While aviation fuels composed of up to 100% SAF have been trialled successfully, 100% drop-in blends are not yet allowed based on ASTM International, who set global standards for aviation fuels [Citation49].","Introduction

The global aviation industry has grown steadily over the past decades and is a key driver of global economic development [Citation1]. However, this industry, like many others that rely on traditional petrochemical fuel stocks, is facing multiple challenges [Citation2]. These include increased global demand for energy, increasingly limited petrochemical feedstocks and the pressing need to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to limit climate change [Citation3].

The aviation industry is estimated to contribute approximately 2.4% of the global CO2 emissions, with this figure due to increase because of the increasing reliance on air transportation for commercial and personal travel [Citation4,Citation5]. Many stakeholders have supported the creation of targets to reduce CO2 emissions by the aviation industry. One of the key strategies to achieve this goal is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). Conventional aviation fuels are produced by refining liquid fossil fuel sources. Synthetic aviation fuels, such as those produced from methane (Gas-to-liquid GTL), can be made from fossil or biological sources. The ASTM International has approved a range of non-fossil-fuel-based jet fuel pathways with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) being derived from non-fossil fuel sources, but also requiring a lifecycle reduction in carbon emissions, no deforestation and no competition for needed food production [Citation6]. Therefore, not all biologically-derived fuels (biofuels) will meet the criteria to be considered a SAF. Current SAFs include fuels derived from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) from biologically-sourced oils or fats, non-HEFA pathways derived from wastes, and those utilising low carbon power sources. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that SAFs have the highest potential to reduce aviation CO2 emissions, with a typical 80% reduction when compared with conventional fuels and alternative aviation fuels such as GTL [Citation4,Citation7].

The introduction of new fuels will impact many areas of aviation fuel systems including supply, storage, usage and certification. SAFs and synthetic fuels are derived from non-conventional feedstocks, utilise a variety of processing technologies and, as such, could differ substantially in terms of the types and proportions of hydrocarbons available to support the growth of fungi, yeasts and bacteria commonly found in fuel systems [Citation4,Citation8]. The microbiome of fuel is of importance not just to the aviation industry, but also to the wider fuel community, as microbial contamination can result in fuel spoilage, microbially-induced corrosion, equipment malfunction or failure, all of which represent significant threats to the safety and security of these systems [Citation9,Citation10]. Currently, eight different Synthetic Blending Components (SBCs) deriving from various renewable feedstocks have been approved for blending with conventional jet fuel to produce SAFs [Citation11]. In this study, we explore the impact of three different sustainable blends on the growth of microbial contaminants.

The use of new fuels could lead to an alteration in the composition of the microbiome in fuel, fuel-associated water and sessile biofilms, subsequently requiring an adjustment of monitoring and testing regimes for the microbial contamination in these systems. The aviation industry currently uses different methodologies to detect microbial contamination during aircraft maintenance operations, and it is important to ensure that these methods remain accurate and reliable. Current testing regimes include both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Culture-based methods include IP385 [Citation12] that utilises growth on nutrient media [Citation13] and thixotropic gels [Citation14]. Culture-independent methods include the monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced by microorganisms [Citation15,Citation16] or detecting antigenic material using lateral flow devices [Citation17]. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and assesses the level of contamination using different metrics such as enzymatic reactions, antibody/antigen interactions or assessment of growth. As such, alterations in the microbiome composition due to the introduction of synthetic fuels and SAFs has the potential to influence the performance of the tests. Therefore, as a first step, understanding the impact of these fuels on microbial community composition is vital.

In this study, we explore the impact of conventional, synthetic fuels and SAFs on microbial community composition, using biomass measurements and culture-independent techniques. There is a small body of literature exploring the microbiome of conventional Jet A-1 aviation fuel [Citation10,Citation18–20] and biodiesels [Citation21,Citation22], but few exploring the impact of synthetic fuels. Ruiz et al. [Citation23] used metagenomics and culture-based methods to study the effect of different fuels and blends (conventional diesels and jet fuels, renewable jet fuel (camelina-derived, hydro processed HRJ-5) and renewable diesels (algal-derived, hydro processed F76 and catalytic hydrothermal conversion CHCD)) on bacterial communities derived from seawater although these systems tended to go anaerobic and are more representative of marine sediment. Lobato et al. [Citation24] studied how two fungal isolates grew when supplied with conventional jet fuel, farnesane or a blend. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first that examines the impact of a range of potential or commercially-available SAFs and synthetic aviation fuels on the growth of mixed microbial communities as assessed by deep sequencing approaches and biomass measurements. Further, it presents an analysis of the most dominant microbial contaminants across the tested fuels, discussing the effectiveness of current fuel microbiological tests.

Results

Biomass accumulation

The dry weight of samples after 4 weeks of growth is shown in . (The biomass after 2 weeks’ growth was too low to measure reliably and would have benefited from a greater volume being filtered). Microbial growth was evident in all microcosms containing fuel – there was no growth in the controls containing BH medium without fuel. There was no significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test, df = 15, p = 0.672) in total biomass between fuel types or the two starting communities.

A. Dry weight of biomass after 4 week’s growth on different fuels inoculated with community 1 (C1) and 2 (C2). B. Bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS) and gene copy numbers mL−1 of microcosms containing different fuels, inoculated with two communities and harvested after 2 or 4 weeks of growth. Results are the mean +/− standard error. Fuel types are indicated by different shapes (Conv – conventional fuel, SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Syn -Synthetic aviation fuel.

DNA was extracted from each microcosm after 2 and 4 weeks, and the amount of bacterial and fungal DNA quantified using q-PCR against 16S rRNA and ITS genes respectively (). Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were much more abundant (mean 5 x 107 copies mL−1) compared to eukaryotic ITS genes (mean 41 copies mL−1). For eukaryotic ITS genes, there was no significant difference between fuel types, or week of harvest, but community 2 samples contained a mean of 81 ITS copies mL−1 compared to 22 ITS copies mL−1 in community 1 (p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no difference in 16S copies mL−1 between communities (p = 0.17), a small difference between week 2 and week 4 (p = 0.029) and differences between fuels (p = 0.0028). Post-hoc analysis showed that 16S rRNA copies mL−1 were lower in microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo blend than the other fuels. These data were not corrected for potential differences in rRNA or ITS copy number in the target organisms as uncertainties in the true copy numbers expected in diverse microbial populations do not improve the reliability of metataxonomic surveys [Citation39]. These differences are likely to be more marked in fungal communities [Citation40] but the overall fungal abundance was very low in these samples.

High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities

High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS amplicons was used to investigate the impact of different fuel types on microbial community composition. For the bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons, high quality sequence data was obtained for the majority of samples. However, for the ITS amplicons, very few sequences were obtained for community 1, reflecting the low biomass of eukaryotic microbes in these samples, and some samples contained few amplifiable ITS sequences for community 2. Therefore, results are presented for all bacterial samples, but only a limited number of Community 2 for fungal samples.

Community composition and Principal Components Analysis are shown in . Generalised linear models were used to identify statistically significant differences between bacteria.

Relative abundance of (A) bacterial ASVs at the Family and (B) fungal ASVs at the Genus level. Replicates have been merged and ASVs whose relative abundance was less than 2% have been grouped as ‘Other’. Taxa ending in ‘sp’ could not be classified at the level indicated – the lowest taxonomic group that could be assigned is shown. Principal components analysis of samples based on (C) 16S rRNA sequences and the weighted Unifrac distance measures and (D) ITS sequences based on weighted Bray distance measures. Each point is an individual replicate. Fuel types are indicated by different shapes (Conv – conventional fuel, SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Synthetic aviation fuel. The % variance explained by each component is indicated on the axes.

The initial inocula of both communities were dominated by bacteria in the Family Pseudomonadaceae, with contributions from Comamonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Aquaspirillaceae in community 1 and Enterobacteriaceae in community 2. The fungal inoculum in community 2 was composed mainly of the Genera Amorphotheca resinae and Cadophora melinii. The number of sequences obtained from fungal communities was low for many samples, hence a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different fuel types on fungal growth was not possible, but in most samples, A. resinae and C. melinii remained dominant with additional contributions from Hawksworthiomyces taylorii.

When incubated with different fuel types, the complexity of the bacterial communities tended to fall after 2 week’s incubation, with Pseudomonadaceae dominant, and then recover (Supplementary Figure 2). With community 1, microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo behaved differently from the rest of the fuels, with a greater relative abundance of Comamonadaceae present at both week 2 and 4 and a corresponding decrease in the relative abundance of the Pseudomonadaceae. In community 2, microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo showed an increase in the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (although this was not statistically significant as there was variation in the responses of the replicate microcosms) with a reduction in the relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae. The other major ASVs showed little, or no, significant changes between fuel types or were of low relative abundance.

Microcosms containing these fuels were separate from the conventional fuels in the Principal Components Analysis (See Supplementary Table 1 for statistical analysis). In community 2, microcosms containing Farenesane and Gevo also differed from the other fuels, although members of the Enterobacteriaceae increased in relative abundance. These patterns were still evident at week 4 although members of the Aquaspirilliaceae and Burkholderiaceae increased in relative abundance. For fungal communities, most samples were dominated by Amorphotheca, Aspergillus and Cadophora spp.

Community members common to different fuel types

Detection of microbial contamination of fuels based on the identification of specific ASVs will be influenced by the relative abundance of core community members. Given the low abundance of fungal ASVs in these samples, analysis is focussed on detection of bacterial ASVs. The ‘observed’ index indicates the number of ASVs found in each sample (note: dada2 processing removes singletons so rare ASVs will not be counted). The ‘coverage’ metric calculates the number of different ASVs that would need to be detected to sample a given proportion of the population (, ). The starting inocula had observed values for C1 of 80.0 +/− 3.2 and C2 of 31.7 +/− 4.65. After 2- or 4-weeks’ growth in microcosms, these values fell to mean values of 46.5 +/− 2.1 and 19.7 +/− 1.9, respectively (averaged across both sampling times and all fuels). Using a detection limit of 90%, the coverage metric for the C1 inoculum was 22.5 +/− 0.6 ASVs and for the C2 inoculum, 4.7 +/− 0.3 ASVs. The dominance of Pseudomonads in these samples was evident as these values fell to 2 and 1 ASVs respectively when a 50% coverage rate was considered.

After incubation for 2 weeks, the coverage values of microcosms inoculated with community 1 fell markedly, then increased after 4 weeks (except in Farnesane and Gevo, where it further decreased). The lower diversity of C2 resulted in much lower coverage values at both time points.

The 10 most abundant ASVs, based on their mean relative abundance across all samples, were used to determine the proportion of bacterial ASVs that would be detected in each sample (). In these communities, which were dominated by Pseudomonas spp., ASV1 had a mean relative abundance of 59.3% across both time points, communities and all fuels, and a minimum relative abundance of 17.7% in any individual sample.

Cumulative relative abundance of the top 10 most abundant ASVs, ranked for all fuels. For microcosms, open shapes are week 2, filled shapes week 4. Values are the mean with the standard error shown in grey; Pseudomonadaceae: Pseudomonas sp. (ASV1, ASV2, ASV13, ASV11); Comamonadaceae: Acidovorax sp. (ASV7, ASV14); Xanthomonadaceae: Xanthomonas SN8 (ASV6); Aquaspirillaceae: Microvirgula aerodenitrificans (ASV5); Enterobacteriaceae: Kosakonia sp (ASV3); Burkholderiaceae: Cupriavidus sp (ASV8).

The greater diversity in C1 compared to C2 was evident in the cumulative abundance curves. In C2, the curves showed sharp inflection points with most fuels indicating the dominance of the Pseudomonads ASV1 and ASV2. Exceptions were Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo, where other ASVs made significant contributions to the overall community. With C1, sharp inflections tended to be seen at Week 2 but were less evident at week 4, indicating an initial dominance in ASVs 1 and 2, then other community members becoming established. Again, microcosms containing Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo tended to show a more even community membership than the other fuels tested.

The ‘core’ microbiome refers to microbes common to a set of samples, but its calculation depends on the thresholds used to determine presence and the phylogenetic relationship between community members. The latter is particularly dependent on the method used to identify community members - an Amplified Sequence Variant (ASV) is an exact, error-corrected sequence hence ASVs may differ by a single nucleotide, whereas Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) are grouped on the basis of sequence similarity (typically 97%) [Citation41]. As small sequence variations are unlikely to influence microbial detection strategies, the core microbiome was calculated at the Genus level. Supplementary Figure 3 shows the relative abundance of dominant community members present at a relative abundance greater 1%. As the communities were dominated by Pseudomonads, this was the only core Genus identified in all samples and both communities. Other Genera were present in one or more fuel types.

Discussion

The move towards synthetic fuels and SAFs has been identified by many fuel producers as important for the future of the aviation industry. In this study we examine the impact of such fuels on the growth of microbial communities. Alterations in microbial community composition in response to changes in fuel composition may influence fuel system design, operation and contaminant monitoring to ensure effective microbial control. Previous studies exploring the microbiome of fuels have typically focused on those found in conventional fuels such as commercial Jet A-1 and military JP-8, diesels and biodiesels [Citation10,Citation18, Citation20,Citation21,Citation42,Citation43]. A metagenomics study [Citation23], looked at the effect of conventional (Jet-A, JP-5, JP-8, F-76) and sustainable (hydro-processed renewable jet and diesel and hydrothermal conversion diesel) fuels on seawater bacterial communities, indicating increased growth of Proteobacteria in all studied fuels but also some taxa being more abundant in certain fuel types. Another recent study [Citation24], compared the growth of two fungi in jet fuel, farnesane, and in 10% farnesane blend in jet, concluding no inhibition or promotion of fungal growth by farnesane. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to compare the impact of sustainable, synthetic and conventional aviation fuels on mixed, fuel-derived microbial communities, applying both biomass measurements and a culture-independent approach.

Dry biomass is a useful metric for the analysis of microbial growth under different culture conditions [Citation44,Citation45]. Whilst dry biomass was too low to determine accurately 2 weeks after inoculation, by four weeks, measurable biomass accumulated in all microcosms, with no significant difference between fuel types or starting inocula. qRTPCR analysis showed the communities were dominated by bacteria with a relatively low abundance of fungi. This reflected the composition of the two inocula used. The relative abundances of bacteria and fungi can differ markedly between sample originating from different locations. For example, Gaylarde et al. [Citation46] report that cultivatable bacterial cells typically exceed fungal cell numbers by ∼100-fold whereas [Citation43] report similar numbers of bacterial and fungal colony forming units (CFUs) in 3 out of 4 contaminated fuel samples (with no fungal growth detected in the fourth sample). Using culture-independent qRTPCR, Krohn et al. [Citation22] found very variable bacterial:fungal ratios in an analysis of 1,258 samples; bacteria dominated fuel samples, fungi tended to be more prevalent in biofilm samples and a highly variable ratio found in water samples (bacteria were always numerically dominant, but fungi varied from almost zero to near equivalence). The communities in the current study were numerically dominated by bacteria, but fungi were present and included those typical of contaminated fuel. Microbial communities will depend on composition of the starting inocula. Such ‘founder effects’ are commonly seen in microcosm studies, but are equally applicable to constructed environments, where microbial populations develop from an initial source of contamination (whether external input or residual biomass that persists in the tank after cleaning). There was a small effect of fuel type, but it is evident that microbial growth occurred in microcosms with all fuels tested (conventional, synthetic and SAF), and therefore operational risks are likely to continue regardless of the fuel type. However, given the diversity of microbial communities found in surveys, different fuel types may more markedly influence microbial communities that have different compositions.

Here, two different starting communities, derived from contaminated field samples, that were maintained as complex communities, were used to inoculate microcosms where the sole carbon source was provided by eight different fuels. High-throughput DNA sequencing analysis showed that the samples contained a range of taxonomic groups (15 bacterial Families, 14 fungal Genera at relative abundances greater than 1%) but that the evenness of the starting inocula were low, with the bacterial communities dominated by Pseudomonads. The number of observed bacterial ASVs declined in most microcosm samples, but the evenness (‘Simpson’ index) increased indicating that a wider range of bacterial ASVs had become numerically important in the microcosms. This is likely to have resulted from an initial ‘bottle’ effect, often seen when communities are grown in confined environments [Citation47] with later increases resulting from the establishment of slower growing organisms and cross-feeding by primary degraders of other community members [Citation29]. The fungal component of the inoculum was dominated by Amorphotheca resinae (previously known as Hormoconis resinae and Cladosporium resinae) and Cadophora sp – both of which are common fuel contaminants. These persisted in the microcosms along with a Hawksworthiomyces taylorii. The latter is not a reported fuel degrader, but is a known wood degrader [Citation48], many of which are found as fuel contaminants with capability to degrade aromatic ring structures.

Previous research has demonstrated that differences in fuel type may play a role in the community composition. For example, a study by Brown et al. [Citation42] found that the bacterial communities in Jet A-1 and JP8 samples differed, although multiple reasons may have accounted for these differences including the routine use of fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) in military JP-8 fuel and that the Jet A-1 fuel samples came from aircraft in long-term storage in hot desert conditions. Therefore, the differences observed could not be attributed to fuel type but, as with all dynamic systems, other factors may be involved such as environmental conditions, additive packages and geographical location. Exploring the impact of different environmental factors in combination with synthetic and SAFs is an area that requires further exploration.

The composition of jet fuel is defined by specific criteria based on operational capability rather than chemical composition [Citation49]. The fuels in this study had very different compositions ranging from complex mixtures of paraffins, iso-paraffins, cyclo-paraffins, olefins and aromatics found in conventional fuels, through simpler synthetic fuels such as GTL which lack aromatics, and SBCs/SAFs such as Farnesane or alcohol-to-jet (Gevo), composed of one or two main molecular species (see Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, microbial community composition may be influenced by degradation capabilities. However, the enzymatic systems employed by microorganisms can often degrade a range of similar moieties. For example, alkanes of different chain lengths can be degraded via oxidation to fatty acids that then enter the β-oxidation pathway, with each round reducing the alkyl chain length by 2 carbon groups [Citation50–52]. Also, different isolates of the same species may show different preferences or capabilities for fuel components. For example, different isolates of C. resinae shows different abilities to grow on n-alkanes in the range C9 to C18 [Citation53,Citation54]. Striebich et al. [Citation55] showed that Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Yarrowia preferred C10-C22 n-alkanes, whereas Marinobacter preferred lighter or branched chain alkanes. These preferences may influence the precise microbial composition, but generalist degraders are likely to be favoured over specialists. Additionally, current SAF fuels are typically blended with conventional fuels in proportions no greater than 50%, thus it may be that the overall fuel composition is not altered sufficiently to cause significant shifts in the bacterial communities when compared to conventional aviation fuels. While aviation fuels composed of up to 100% SAF have been trialled successfully, 100% drop-in blends are not yet allowed based on ASTM International, who set global standards for aviation fuels [Citation49]. As such it will be important to continue monitoring potential shifts in the microbiome that may be caused by various feedstocks, production processes, and varying blending ratios. Although beyond the scope of this project, alterations in fuel composition may require the use of additives such as lubricity improvers, which may act as carbon sources, or metal atom deactivators which can include heteroatoms such as N. These may also influence microbial growth and community composition.

The detection of microbial contamination in fuel systems needs to target the dominant community members, as small community differences are generally not a concern. In some studies e.g. Krohn et al. [Citation22] diverse microorganisms have been identified in both floating and sessile phases, including those that are slow or difficult to grow in culture. Therefore, the detection of key indicator species is an efficient way to determine contamination in fuel systems providing these are representative of the diversity found in field samples and different operational conditions. Here, Pseudomonadaceae, a Family that contains species such Pseudomonas, Moraxella, and Acinetobacter, were dominant in both starting inocula. These organisms are frequently found in fuel systems and have been linked to operational problems [Citation56]. The dominance of Pseudomonadaceae has been noted in previous fuel studies with [Citation57] examining 54 fuel and fuel-associated water samples, noting high levels of abundance of Pseudomonas spp. in 21% of the cultured isolates. In other studies, however, different groups became dominant including Marinobacter, Burkholderia and Halomonas [Citation10]. Unlike our results, a large diversity of genera has been found in field samples from aircraft tanks and previously less studied genera such as Methylobacterium sp. were identified by transcriptome analysis as the most active in sessile biofilm swabs [Citation22].

Analysis of the relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial ASVs (across all fuels) () showed that detection of these would identify the majority of microbes in the different microcosms, although the cumulative abundance curves were less steep for Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo fuels reflecting the greater diversity in these samples. Analysis of fungal ASVs was limited by their low abundance in these studies, but inspection of the fungal community C2 showed that Hormoconis resinae was present in all samples, suggesting that it is as a good ‘indicator’ species for the detection of fungal contamination in SAFs as it is in conventional Jet A-1 [Citation46]. Other eukaryotes were detected with these often associated with fuel contamination or as environmental organisms associated with wood degradation. Other studies have observed uncultured and unknown organisms [Citation22] and a greater diversity of organisms are likely to be identified in future through high-throughput DNA sequencing [Citation19].

Comparisons () showed that, numerically, microbial composition was affected by fuel type. After 2 week’s growth, there was little difference between fuel types, except for Jet A-1 Merox, where the relative abundance of the Pseudomonadaceae and, to a lesser extent, Aquaspirillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, differed. After 4 week’s growth, there were small differences in community composition between fuel types in microcosms inoculated with C1, but with C2 the relative abundances of Pseudomonadaceae often differed, particularly in Farnesane, Gevo and Camelina fuels.

While within this study it was more difficult to compare the profiles of the different fungal communities, it appears that the profiles were all relatively similar to those in conventional aviation fuels. In samples collected from aircraft fuel tanks [Citation22], fuel and water samples were always dominated by bacteria whereas biofilms sometimes dominated by fungi. Therefore, current testing regimes should be able to assess fungal material in planktonic phases, but caution is required when considering biofilms.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/TBFU.png,N,,2025-11-18 23:56:17.067291

The regulation was initially set to become applicable from the end of December 2024, but was already delayed by a year to give companies more time to prepare for its compliance obligations.","A group of major companies* including Nestlé, Mars Wrigley and Ferrero, among several others, issued a new letter calling on European lawmakers not to implement potential new delays and changes to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), a new law aimed at ensuring that products imported to or exported from EU markets no longer contribute to deforestation and forest degradation globally.

In the letter, the companies warn that new delays will increase market uncertainty, and unfairly punish companies who have already made investments to comply with the new requirements, while rewarding laggards.

The letter follows several weeks of speculation over the timeline for the implementation of the EUDR, starting with a proposal by EU Commissioner Jessika Roswall in September to delay the regulation for a year due to concerns that IT systems currently in place will not be sufficient to handle the data load created by the new rules.

In October, the Commission said that it still plans to have the EUDR enter into force at the end of this year, but introduced a 6-month enforcement grace period for enforcement for large companies, and said that small enterprises will not be covered by the regulation until the end of 2026. The Commission also introduced a series of changes to simplify the regulation, including shifting reporting obligations to focus on the operators that actually place the relevant EUDR products on the market, while downstream operators such as retailers or manufacturers would no longer be obliged to submit due diligence statements, requiring only one submission, instead of multiple ones, in the EUDR IT system across the supply chain.

Despite the Commission’s proposed simplification’s however, some EU member states are still pushing for a one-year delay, and calling for a “stop-the-clock” mechanism to allow an opportunity for lawmakers to re-examine the regulation, as well as for a new review clause which could open up the regulation to further simplification in the future. The EU Parliament is expected to vote on its position on the Commission’s proposals next week.

The new letter follows an initial letter from many of the same companies in early October against the initial proposed delay. In the new letter, the companies state:

“Any proposal for a ‘stop-the-clock’ mechanism or a simplification review clause, leading to a suspension of the EUDR without clarity on its final provisions, would be extending current legal and market uncertainty for the long run. This approach would inflict substantial sunk costs on companies which have made the necessary investments and on-the-ground engagement in preparation for the EUDR, and reward the laggards.”

The companies added that the potential moves “would fatally compromise the EU’s reputation as a reliable partner of producing countries in halting deforestation.”

While welcoming the Commission’s 6-month enforcement grace period, the companies also warned that some of its proposals would not achieve its simplification objective, but could instead result in new complexities for downstream operators such as retailers or manufacturers. The companies instead proposed a “streamlined system” for the EUDR, in which due diligence statements would be submitted only by companies first placing relevant products on the EU market, all companies would be required to establish a due diligence system and to react to any evidence of non-compliance, or substantiated concerns, about products in their supply chains, and to keep records of the companies they buy from and sell to.

The companies said:

“This system would preserve the principles of due diligence and traceability that are essential to meet the aims of the EUDR while reducing the number of due diligence statements needing to be filed and avoiding placing excessive burdens on companies.”

The EUDR was initially introduced by the EU Commission in November 2021, with proposals aimed at effectively banning deforestation-linked products on the EU market, and establishing strong compliance requirements for companies providing or utilizing key commodities and products such as palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa, rubber and soy, in addition to some of their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tires, or furniture. The regulation was initially set to become applicable from the end of December 2024, but was already delayed by a year to give companies more time to prepare for its compliance obligations.

The facility is expected to be operating at full capacity by December. Plans are also progressing on a project to add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity.

During the third quarter of 2025, the HDRD complex produced 2,011 barrels per day, or 67% of design capacity, down from 2,849 barrels per day or 95% of design capacity during the same period of last year.

During an earnings call, Tidewater CEO Jeremy Baines explained that output during July and August averaged 2,920 barrels per day, or 97% of design capacity. The facility was scheduled to complete a three-week turnaround in September. The planned shutdown was extended by two additional weeks due to higher-than-anticipated bowing in the hydrodeoxygenation reactor beds, Baines explained.

Following the planned turnaround, the HDRD complex was also subject to a two-week unplanned outage in October. Baines attributed the unplanned downtime to an equipment anomaly that was temporarily repaired to resume operations. He said throughput has averaged approximately 2,330 barrels per day to-date in November, with production expected to return to full capacity in December after the affected component in reinstalled. A seven-day outage is expected to take place in December to complete installation of that component.

Bains also noted that the company has optimized the turnaround schedule to extend the catalyst life to approximately two and a half years. As a result, the next planned turnaround at the HDRD complex is scheduled for spring 2028.

For the full year, Tidewater expects the HDRD complex to achieve an average throughput of 1,900 to 2,000 barrels per day.

In its third quarter earnings release, Tidewater also provided a brief update on its plans to develop SAF capacity. The company said it continues to advance its proposed 6,500 barrel per day SAF project. Front-end engineering work was completed during the second quarter of 2025.

In September, Tidewater executed an amendment to its existing initiative agreement with the Government of British Columbia, providing for additional BC LCFS Credits. These additional credits are intended to help fund ongoing optimization work as the company works toward a potential final investment decision, currently targeted for 2026. Tidewater said it expects to receive emission credits, in connection with completing the first of three milestones outlined in the amended initiative agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remaining credits expected to be received in the first half of 2026.

While Tidewater Renewables remains optimistic about the project’s potential, the company cautioned that the decision to proceed with the SAF project is contingent upon the execution of long-term offtake agreements, and provincial and federal government support to facilitate obtaining committed financing.

Tidewater reported a net loss of $1 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $367.1 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.5 million, up 21% when compared to the third quarter of 2024.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2022/09/TidewaterLogo_1664229504821.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:56:23.990740

Demand policies include fuel or emissions reduction mandates, fuel levies (such as in Singapore) and low carbon fuel standards. Supply policies include research and development (grant) funding, production incentives and contract for difference (CfD) schemes.

Building on its recent announcement of a record $1.1 billion investment in the LCLF industry, the Australian Government has released a Policy Design and Engagement Paper for its Cleaner Fuels Program. The Australian Government is seeking submissions from industry on the architecture of the Program, which aims to stimulate the supply of LCLFs by providing production-linked incentives over ten years and target support towards LCLF projects that are advanced in development.

Written submissions are due on 19 December 2025 with the Program to be launched and applications open in mid-2026. For businesses across aviation, freight, agriculture, resources and energy, the consultation period provides an opportunity to contribute to the regulatory and commercial framework that will support the LCLF industry over the coming decade.

Drawing on our experience, we have identified five key themes in the Paper for consideration by prospective applicants, investors and offtakers.

1. Defining “eligible fuels”: fuel-agnostic v strategic prioritisation

The Paper considers two broad approaches. The first would treat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel (RD) and other emerging biofuels on an equal footing, with market forces determining which pathways succeed. The second would prioritise fuels essential for hard-to-abate sectors – notably aviation – or de-prioritise those with clearer electrification alternatives.

From a legal standpoint, certainty around eligibility is critical. Applicants need confidence that their chosen pathway will not later be excluded or disadvantaged. Applicants should provide evidence of demand, emissions abatement, and economic impacts for their preferred fuel type. Where relevant, submissions may reference Australia’s broader commitments, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s net-zero 2050 target, to demonstrate alignment with national objectives.

2. Structuring production support: fixed credits or contracts-for-difference?

The Program intends to use a competitive process to ensure value is delivered with the total available funding and enable benchmarking of the amount of funding needed to enable a facility to progress to production. The Program prefers production-linked incentives to upfront grant payments, reducing the risk to taxpayers where producers receive payment without delivering product. Two competing concepts have been presented:

A fixed production credit (c $/L) determined competitively, payable per litre produced. This could be similar to the current fuel excise rebate available to fossil fuel users; or

A CfD scheme where Government tops up the gap between an competitively determined “strike price” and a reference LCLF market price, with symmetrical claw-back if prices rise. A CfD scheme could benefit less advanced LCLF projects or nascent technologies to bridge the higher cost of production to the SAF market price (after the introduction of a production credit), and to enable such other technologies to mature and become more cost effective, thereby diversifying Australia’s production of SAFs.

3. Carbon intensity thresholds and sustainability safeguards

There is a general expectation that only fuels achieving a specified lifecycle emissions reduction threshold compared with fossil equivalents will qualify for the Program, aligning Australia with EU and US thresholds. Whilst the Paper calls for consultation on the implementation of a threshold, having regard to previous consultation it could be in the vicinity of 50%, which may exclude certain domestic feedstocks, such as canola, in the short term.

Beyond carbon, the Paper canvasses broader sustainability criteria – land-use change, biodiversity, water, food security and labour standards – and alignment with certification schemes under the evolving Guarantee of Origin (GO) scheme which will include LCLFs from 2026. Early engagement with certifiers and the development of robust traceability systems will be important. Applicants and those involved in the supply chain may wish to separately review their supply contracts to ensure that sustainability obligations and data-sharing rights required for GO reporting are addressed.

4. Community benefits

The development of a LCLFs industry presents many economic opportunities to Australian communities, including by securing sovereign fuel supply resulting in lower fuel costs, and creating jobs in rural and regional areas where crops such as sugar cane and canola (used in the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) SAF production method) are plentiful.

The Paper asks whether production supported by the Program should be restricted to domestic use. For projects seeking economies of scale through regional exports, including to SAF markets in Asia, this is a relevant consideration. Evidence that export flexibility could enhance domestic supply security may be persuasive.

Additionally, as the Cleaner Fuels Program is administered under the Future Made in Australia Act 2024 (Cth), applicants must demonstrate compliance with six community benefit principles, including promoting safe and secure jobs, supporting First Nations participation, and demonstrating transparency and compliance in relation to the management of tax affairs. In practice, this means proponents could provide social procurement plans, local workforce strategies, and mechanisms for First Nations equity or benefit-sharing.

5. A complex policy intersection

The Program will not operate in isolation. Prospective applicants should map interactions with:

The Safeguard Mechanism, the Australian Government's policy for reducing emissions at large industrial facilities;

The New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, influencing demand for renewable diesel in heavy transport;

State planning and environmental regulations; and

Finance pathways via the National Reconstruction Fund, CEFC or Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.

Each layer involves its own compliance obligations, information requirements and reporting timelines. Coordinated legal advice across environmental, trade, tax, and project finance can assist in managing these requirements efficiently.

Looking ahead – aligning policy ambition with market reality

Australia’s resource endowment – from abundant biomass residues to renewable electricity for e-fuels – positions it well to capture a share of the burgeoning global sustainable fuels market. Projects that are ready to move to final investment decision will likely benefit most from the Program.

For Government, the policy challenge is to design a scheme that supports projects without creating ongoing subsidy dependence or favouring established technologies over innovation. Transparent, bankable, and adaptable incentives will be important. Alignment with international sustainability standards may assist Australian fuel in accessing premium markets overseas, while community benefit obligations can support social licence domestically.

For industry, early engagement, collaboration, and preparation to demonstrate technological capability, carbon integrity, community value, and financial discipline will be key to success in the Program and future commercial benefit from participating in the LCLF industry. The upcoming consultation period provides applicants with a critical opportunity to contribute to the development of the sector’s regulatory framework.",https://www.claytonutz.com/cfimages/CU-Insights.webp/public,N,,2025-11-18 21:56:29.638685

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing air travel demand could double by 2040. In my work with major airlines and aerospace manufacturers, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure this creates. The industry stands at a critical inflection point where sustainability isn’t just an environmental concern—it’s becoming the primary driver of innovation and competitive advantage. As a technology futurist who has advised Fortune 500 companies on digital transformation, I see Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) emerging as the cornerstone of aviation’s future. The current landscape reveals an industry grappling with legacy infrastructure while racing toward a cleaner, more efficient future. What fascinates me most is how quickly this transformation is accelerating—we’re not talking about distant possibilities but immediate business imperatives that will reshape global aviation within this decade.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The SAF Production and Scalability Dilemma

The most pressing challenge I consistently encounter in my consulting work is the massive gap between SAF demand and production capacity. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption, despite growing commitments from airlines and corporate travelers. The fundamental issue lies in scaling production to meet ambitious net-zero targets. I’ve seen airline executives struggle with this reality—they want to commit to SAF but face limited availability and premium pricing. As noted by the World Economic Forum, scaling SAF production requires overcoming significant technological and economic barriers, including high capital costs for production facilities and competition for sustainable feedstocks. The business impact is substantial: airlines risk missing sustainability targets, facing regulatory penalties, and losing environmentally conscious customers to competitors who secure scarce SAF supplies.

Challenge 2: Infrastructure and Supply Chain Transformation

The second major challenge involves overhauling century-old aviation infrastructure and supply chains. In my experience working with airport operators and fuel suppliers, I’ve observed how existing infrastructure was designed for conventional jet fuel, creating compatibility issues with new fuel types. Deloitte research highlights that adapting current refueling systems, storage facilities, and distribution networks for SAF requires massive capital investment and coordinated industry effort. The implications extend beyond airports to the entire value chain—from feedstock producers to fuel blenders and distributors. What many business leaders underestimate is the domino effect: a single change in fuel composition can impact aircraft performance, maintenance schedules, and operational procedures. This infrastructure challenge represents what I call a “systemic innovation barrier”—where progress in one area is hindered by limitations in interconnected systems.

Challenge 3: Economic Viability and Investment Uncertainty

The third challenge that keeps aviation executives awake at night is achieving economic viability while managing investment risks. Harvard Business Review analysis indicates that SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating significant financial pressure on airlines already operating on thin margins. In my strategic foresight sessions with industry leaders, I’ve seen how this cost differential creates a classic chicken-and-egg scenario: without scale, costs remain high, but without cost reduction, scale remains elusive. PwC’s aviation outlook reinforces this concern, noting that the capital required to build sufficient SAF production capacity exceeds $1 trillion globally. The business impact is profound: airlines must balance sustainability commitments with financial performance, while investors weigh the risks of backing emerging SAF technologies against established energy investments.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many industry observers predicted. From my front-row seat watching technological evolution, I’m particularly excited about three breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction.

First, advanced biofuel pathways using novel feedstocks are demonstrating remarkable potential. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet technology that can use ethanol from various sources, including agricultural waste and non-food biomass. I’ve seen this technology in action during my research visits, and what impresses me is its flexibility—it can adapt to regional feedstock availability, making it scalable across different geographies.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. According to recent Accenture analysis, synthetic fuels produced using renewable electricity, water, and captured CO2 could eventually supply up to 15% of global aviation fuel demand by 2050. Major players like Airbus are investing heavily in these technologies, recognizing their potential to decouple fuel production from biological constraints.

Third, digital fuel management platforms are creating unprecedented transparency and efficiency. In my consulting work, I’ve helped implement blockchain-based tracking systems that provide certified proof of sustainability from production to consumption. These platforms create value by enabling premium pricing for verified sustainable fuels while giving corporate customers the carbon accounting data they increasingly demand.

The most forward-thinking organizations are combining these solutions with strategic partnerships. United Airlines’ investment in multiple SAF startups exemplifies this approach—spreading risk while accelerating multiple technological pathways simultaneously.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technological trajectories and industry commitments, I project that SAF will account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel by 2035, with some regions potentially reaching 15-20%. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $30 billion by 2030, representing one of the fastest-growing segments in clean energy.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders reveal several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate this transformation. What if major oil companies reallocate 20% of their conventional fuel investment to SAF production? What if carbon taxes make conventional jet fuel 50% more expensive within five years? What if corporate travel policies mandate 25% SAF usage for all business flights by 2028? Each of these scenarios points toward the same conclusion: the SAF transition will happen faster than current linear projections suggest.

I expect several technological breakthroughs within the next 3-5 years that will dramatically change the economics of SAF production. Advanced catalytic processes could reduce production costs by 40-60%, while synthetic biology approaches using engineered microorganisms could increase feedstock conversion efficiency beyond current limits. The International Energy Agency projects that supportive policies and technological learning could make SAF cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel by 2030 in favorable regulatory environments.

The industry transformation will follow a clear timeline: demonstration-scale plants becoming operational within 2-3 years, first commercial-scale facilities by 2026-2028, and widespread adoption through the 2030s. By 2035, I predict that SAF will no longer be a niche product but a standard component of aviation fuel blends worldwide.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, aviation will undergo its most significant transformation since the jet age. SAF will evolve from a sustainability initiative to a core business strategy, with leading airlines leveraging their SAF access as a competitive differentiator. The opportunities are massive: first-movers in SAF production and distribution will capture extraordinary value, while airlines that secure long-term SAF contracts will enjoy premium brand positioning and customer loyalty. The risks are equally significant: organizations that delay their SAF strategies face regulatory pressure, reputational damage, and potential exclusion from key markets with strict sustainability requirements. The fundamental shift I foresee is from viewing SAF as an environmental compliance cost to recognizing it as a strategic asset that drives business resilience and growth.

Ian Khan’s Closing

In my two decades of studying technological transformations, I’ve never witnessed an industry pivot as rapidly and decisively as aviation is doing with SAF. The future belongs to those who recognize that sustainability and profitability are not opposing forces but complementary objectives. As I often tell the leaders I work with: “The greatest risk isn’t in moving too fast toward the future—it’s in moving too slow.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent pressure to decarbonize while maintaining growth. The current sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production stands at just 0.1% of total jet fuel demand, as reported by McKinsey & Company, creating both an enormous challenge and unprecedented opportunity. What fascinates me most is how this tiny fraction represents the seed of a complete industry transformation that will redefine air travel as we know it. We’re not just talking about incremental changes here – we’re witnessing the birth of an entirely new energy ecosystem that will reshape global supply chains, create new economic powerhouses, and fundamentally alter how we think about mobility. The race to scale SAF production is accelerating, and the decisions made today will determine which organizations lead tomorrow’s aviation landscape.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work with aviation leaders is the massive gap between current SAF production capacity and projected demand. According to Deloitte research, global SAF production needs to increase by at least 1,000 times current levels to meet 2030 targets. What makes this particularly complex isn’t just building more facilities – it’s creating an entirely new industrial ecosystem. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives grapple with the chicken-and-egg problem: airlines can’t commit to SAF without reliable supply, and producers can’t secure funding without airline commitments. The World Economic Forum notes that current SAF production costs remain 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating significant economic headwinds. This isn’t merely a technical challenge; it’s a complete rethinking of energy infrastructure that requires unprecedented collaboration across traditionally separate industries.

Challenge 2: Feedstock Availability and Sustainability Certification

In my analysis of SAF supply chains, the feedstock question emerges as perhaps the most complex puzzle. As noted by Harvard Business Review, the competition for sustainable biomass between aviation, maritime, and other industries will intensify dramatically in the coming years. I’ve consulted with organizations struggling to navigate the intricate web of sustainability certifications, land use concerns, and competing environmental priorities. The challenge extends beyond simply finding enough raw materials – it’s about creating systems that are genuinely sustainable and verifiable. PwC research indicates that without careful management, the rush to secure feedstocks could create unintended environmental consequences or conflict with food production. What keeps aviation CEOs awake at night isn’t just finding feedstocks today, but ensuring they can scale sustainably while maintaining public trust and regulatory compliance.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure Integration and Global Standards

The third critical challenge I consistently encounter involves the physical and regulatory infrastructure required for SAF adoption. According to Accenture analysis, less than 5% of global airports currently have dedicated SAF blending and storage facilities. This creates a logistical nightmare for airlines trying to maintain consistent operations across their networks. In my strategic foresight work, I help organizations visualize the cascading effects of infrastructure gaps – from blending inconsistencies to transportation bottlenecks. The lack of global standards compounds these challenges, creating regulatory fragmentation that increases costs and complexity. Gartner research highlights that without standardized certification and accounting methods, the risk of greenwashing accusations remains high, potentially undermining the entire transition effort. This isn’t just about building new infrastructure; it’s about creating interoperable systems that work seamlessly across borders and organizations.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many predicted. In my research for “The Futurist” series, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction. First, advanced biofuels using novel feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and municipal solid waste are showing remarkable potential. Companies like LanzaJet are demonstrating that waste-to-fuel pathways can achieve up to 70% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. By combining captured CO2 with green hydrogen, these synthetic fuels can achieve near-carbon-neutral operations. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate specifically includes PtL targets, signaling strong regulatory support. I’ve advised several energy companies that are positioning themselves at this intersection of renewable energy and fuel production.

Third, digital tracking and certification platforms are addressing the transparency challenge. Blockchain-based systems, similar to those I’ve helped implement in other supply chain contexts, are enabling real-time tracking of sustainability attributes from production to consumption. This creates the audit trail needed for credible emissions accounting and helps prevent double-counting of environmental benefits.

Fourth, strategic partnerships between airlines, fuel producers, and technology companies are accelerating innovation. The collaboration between United Airlines, Honeywell, and Alder Fuels demonstrates how cross-industry alliances can de-risk development and scale production more rapidly. In my consulting practice, I’m seeing these partnerships become increasingly sophisticated, with shared investment models and risk-sharing arrangements that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological breakthroughs, I project that SAF will account for at least 15-20% of global aviation fuel by 2035. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, the SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2030. This represents one of the most rapid energy transitions in modern history.

What excites me most are the potential technological breakthroughs on the horizon. In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, we explore scenarios where synthetic biology enables cost-competitive SAF production from CO2 captured directly from the air. McKinsey analysis suggests that with sufficient investment and policy support, power-to-liquid fuels could achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel by the early 2030s.

The geographical distribution of production will also transform global energy flows. While current SAF production is concentrated in North America and Europe, I predict that Asia and the Middle East will emerge as major production hubs by the late 2020s. This shift will create new energy trade routes and potentially redistribute economic power within the aviation ecosystem.

Market size predictions vary, but Goldman Sachs Research estimates the total addressable market for SAF could reach $2 trillion by 2050. What’s particularly significant is how this growth will catalyze adjacent industries – from carbon capture technology to hydrogen production to advanced biotechnology. We’re not just watching a fuel transition; we’re witnessing the creation of an entirely new industrial cluster.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes aviation economics and operations. The organizations that thrive will be those that approach SAF not as a compliance requirement but as a strategic opportunity to build competitive advantage. We’ll see consolidation among producers, new alliances between energy and aviation companies, and the emergence of SAF as a traded commodity with its own market dynamics. The risks are significant – technological hurdles, policy uncertainty, and cost pressures could slow adoption. However, the opportunities for first-movers are enormous, from securing preferential supply arrangements to developing proprietary production technologies. The next ten years will determine which organizations lead aviation’s sustainable future.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The transition to sustainable aviation represents one of the most exciting industrial transformations of our lifetime. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes: “The future belongs to those who see opportunities where others see obstacles, and who build bridges where others see barriers.”

Ensure Changi Airport remains price competitive with green jet fuel levy

” (Nov 13).

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050. Various ICAO members, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the UK, have mandated or plan to mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to work towards this goal. Singapore is not the first or only country to do so, and we have chosen to do so in a pragmatic and balanced manner.

We have set the SAF levy for an economy ticket at between $1 and $10.40, and the equivalent levies for business- and first-class tickets at between $4 and $41.60. This endeavours to keep costs manageable and ensures that our air hub remains price competitive.

The SAF levy will apply for tickets and services sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from Singapore from Oct 1, 2026, with the SAF levy amounts remaining unchanged even if SAF prices were to rise later. We have consulted the industry and stakeholders, and do not expect the SAF levy to have a significant effect on air travel demand and the price competitiveness of Changi Airport.

Despite a challenging external operating environment in 2025, Changi Airport is seeing strong growth. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we will surpass 2024 and set a record in air passenger volume in 2025. We will continue to keep a keen eye on cost and ensure that Changi Airport remains price competitive vis-a-vis other airports.

We thank Mr Tan for his support for Changi Airport, a national icon and source of pride for many Singaporeans.

Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, has taken a decisive step toward solidifying its position as one of the most forward-looking carriers in the modern aviation landscape. During the Dubai Airshow, one of the industry’s most prestigious events, the airline announced a substantial expansion of its widebody fleet with a firm order for six Airbus A330-900s, seven additional A350-1000s, and three A350F freighters. This agreement not only reinforces the long-standing partnership between Etihad Airways and Airbus but also reflects the carrier’s strategic vision to enhance operational efficiency, expand global reach, and align its operations with emerging environmental and sustainability standards in aviation.

Strengthening Fleet Capabilities & Market Position

Etihad Airways’ new orders represent a significant expansion of its current capabilities across multiple operational domains—medium-haul, long-haul, and cargo. With the addition of six A330-900s and nine leased units of the same type from Avolon, the airline is establishing a dedicated fleet segment tailored for regional and mid-range routes. The A330neo’s balance of fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and operational flexibility makes it particularly well-suited to Etihad’s growth markets in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The aircraft’s capability to fly up to 8,100 nautical miles without refuelling enhances Etihad’s ability to serve secondary city pairs more efficiently, strengthening its competitive position in connecting East and West through its Abu Dhabi hub.

The inclusion of seven additional A350-1000s raises Etihad’s total orders for this aircraft type to 27, reaffirming its commitment to using one of the most advanced, fuel-efficient, and passenger-friendly long-haul aircraft currently available. The A350-1000’s unparalleled range of up to 9,700 nautical miles allows Etihad to expand its intercontinental network, reaching destinations such as North America, East Asia, and the Pacific with enhanced efficiency and reliability. This expansion also creates the opportunity to standardize operations around Airbus’s most modern widebody family, reducing maintenance complexity, crew training costs, and overall operational inefficiency.

The order for three additional A350F freighters further underlines the airline’s recognition of cargo as a critical growth segment. With global freight demand rebounding and e-commerce driving new forms of logistical supply chains, these freighters will provide Etihad Cargo with the necessary capability and payload performance to compete effectively in international logistics markets. The A350F, equipped with the largest main deck cargo door in the industry and full compliance with ICAO’s upcoming CO₂ standards, positions Etihad as a pioneer in sustainable air freight operations.

Partnership with Airbus & Shared Vision for Sustainable Aviation

The announcements made at the Dubai Airshow underscore the deepening collaboration between Etihad Airways and Airbus. Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus Executive Vice President for Sales, emphasized that Etihad’s continued investment in next-generation aircraft highlights the strength of this partnership and a mutual commitment to shaping the future of aviation in the UAE and beyond. The complementarity between the A350 Family and A330neo platforms offers Etihad an optimal combination of operational efficiency and network flexibility. By strategically diversifying its fleet with these two models, Etihad is effectively future-proofing its operations amid evolving regulatory, economic, and environmental challenges.

Both aircraft families are emblematic of Airbus’s technological evolution. The A350 Family, constructed using advanced composite materials and equipped with state-of-the-art Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, achieves a 25% reduction in fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions compared to older widebody models. Similarly, the A330neo, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, incorporates advanced aerodynamics and a redefined Airspace cabin design that enhances not only the passenger experience but also fuel efficiency and reliability.

Furthermore, Airbus’s commitment to sustainability closely aligns with Etihad’s environmental objectives. Both the A330neo and A350 are certified to operate on up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030. Etihad Airways has been at the forefront of SAF adoption and green aviation initiatives, making this compatibility a vital part of its long-term environmental strategy. The synergy between technological innovation and sustainability highlights an emerging trend in global aviation where performance, profitability, and ecological responsibility are becoming inseparable aspects of business planning.

Economic & Strategic Implications

Etihad’s decision to expand its Airbus widebody fleet carries significant economic, operational, and strategic implications. From a financial perspective, the investment demonstrates confidence in air travel’s post-pandemic recovery and the UAE’s ambition to remain a premier global aviation hub. Given the competitive environment among Middle Eastern carriers—especially regional powerhouses such as Emirates and Qatar Airways—Etihad’s fleet diversification ensures both competitiveness and adaptability. The airline can more precisely match aircraft capacity to route demand, thus optimizing load factors and minimizing unnecessary operating costs.

From a macroeconomic standpoint, the deal underscores the aviation sector’s broader role in supporting economic diversification under the UAE’s national growth agenda. Etihad’s partnership with Airbus not only strengthens bilateral industrial ties between the UAE and Europe but also fosters innovation, employment, and investment within the region’s aviation ecosystem. This development contributes to Abu Dhabi’s strategic goal of positioning itself as a center for high-technology industries, environmental innovation, and sustainable tourism.

Advancing the Future of Global Aviation

Beyond its immediate operational benefits, Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion signals a broader transformation across the global aviation industry. The airline’s emphasis on sustainability and efficiency mirrors the growing recognition that long-term competitiveness depends on reducing environmental impact while enhancing customer experience. As climate policy and carbon regulation evolve rapidly, airlines with modern, fuel-efficient fleets will have a distinct advantage in meeting regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for greener travel.

In addition, fleet modernization provides the foundation for technological integration, including advanced digital maintenance systems, data-driven operational optimization, and enhanced connectivity. The A350 and A330neo families are equipped with intelligent monitoring systems that enable predictive maintenance and optimize aircraft performance, further reducing downtime and cost inefficiencies. As such, Etihad’s investment serves as a model of forward-thinking fleet planning grounded in both technological sophistication and economic prudence.

Etihad Airways’ latest fleet expansion marks a defining moment in the airline’s strategic evolution and underscores its commitment to sustainable growth, innovation, and excellence in global aviation. By acquiring state-of-the-art Airbus A330neo, A350-1000, and A350F aircraft, the airline is not merely increasing its fleet size—it is shaping the operational and environmental blueprint for the next generation of air travel.

The decision reinforces Etihad’s reputation as an industry leader that harmonizes economic viability with ecological responsibility, technological progress with passenger comfort, and international collaboration with national ambition. As the world’s aviation industry moves toward a more sustainable and integrated future, Etihad Airways’ actions at the Dubai Airshow stand as a testament to the power of visionary investment and global partnership in defining the trajectory of modern aviation.",https://www.iadb.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/etihad_airways_order_a330neo_a350_and_a350f_aircraft_0-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 16:56:37.399724

The airlines agreed they will not claim that paying extra to fund climate protection projects or the use of alternative aviation fuels can directly neutralize or reduce emissions on an individual flight. In addition, the airlines committed to tighter substantiation, clearer disclosures, and more transparent CO₂ calculators, particularly as they relate to their use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). National consumer authorities will monitor implementation and may enforce against carriers that fall short.

Although the Commission’s action targets EU airlines, U.S. airlines should review their marketing in the EU accordingly. In addition, the EU's action provides important insight into how EU authorities view environmental marketing claims more generally. Companies in other sectors should review their environmental marketing claims in light of this action, particularly if they have programs that give consumers the option to pay extra fees to fund the use of alternative fuels or support projects that offset emissions.

Legal Framework & Enforcement Posture

The Commission’s announcement follows a coordinated review by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, a network of authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. The CPC Network can take action under the Consumer Protection Regulation to address cross-border issues at the EU level in coordination with the Commission.

In addition to announcing the commitments from the 21 airlines subject to the review, the Commission also published a table tracking each airline’s commitments and timelines; authorities will verify timely implementation and pursue enforcement, if needed. To ensure fair competition and a level playing field in the aviation industry, the Commission’s announcement states that the CPC Network will also assess the practices of other airlines operating in the Single Market, and, where necessary, require the same commitments.

The CPC's action stemmed from an alert filed by BEUC (representing consumer organizations across the EU) in June 2023, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Regulation, alleging that 17 European airlines misled consumers by claiming ""green fees"" would render their flights sustainable and, more broadly, by implying ""flying is sustainable."" The complaint alleged that these claims constitute infringements of Directive 2005/29/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive - UCPD).

The UCPD harmonizes national laws governing business-to-consumer practices in the internal market and prohibits unfair commercial practices (Article 5), misleading actions (Article 6), and misleading omissions (Article 7). The European Commission’s Guidance Notice on the interpretation and application of the UCPD, though not legally binding, is intended to clarify and facilitate its proper application, and includes guidance on which environmental claims may be considered misleading.

What the 21 Airlines Committed to Change

Clarify that a specific flight’s CO₂ emissions cannot be neutralized, offset, or directly reduced by optional passenger payments for climate projects or alternative fuels.

Use “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) terminology only with appropriate clarifications and substantiation.

Avoid vague “green” language or implicit environmental claims.

Provide more detail when stating future climate goals (e.g., net-zero): include timelines, achievable steps, and the types of emissions covered.

Display CO₂ calculations clearly and transparently.

Support claims with sufficient scientific evidence.

Why This Matters in Aviation and Beyond

Although this example targets airlines, it signals how EU enforcers expect environmental marketing to be framed across sectors:

Claims that payment of fees will render products/services “Carbon-Neutral” or “Sustainable” Require Rigorous Clarification and Substantiation. The CPC’s scrutiny of pay-to-offset schemes may serve as a warning to other industries that sell add-ons implying immediate neutrality.

SAF and similar “transition” claims need precise context. Claims about cleaner inputs (e.g., SAF) should avoid implying one-for-one emission reductions for a specific transaction and must be properly qualified.

Aspirational goals must be anchored in plans. Claims regarding net-zero or carbon-neutral goals should include timelines, milestones, scope clarity (Scopes 1–3), and methodologies.

CO₂ calculators may be perceived as marketing claims. If you publish route- or product-level emissions figures, expect scrutiny of assumptions, data sources, and presentation.

EU coordination is accelerating. This airline action follows earlier EU-level probes and national rulings that have tightened the bar on “sustainable flight” messaging.

Practical Next Steps For EU-facing Marketers

Inventory – and revise if appropriate – green claims and map each to evidence (testing or internationally recognized methodologies), consistent with UCPD guidance and the evolving landscape of green marketing law at the EU-level (e.g., the Empowering Consumers Directive and the pending Green Claims Directive) and member-state level.

Avoid using vague buzzwords (“eco-friendly,” “green,” “sustainable”) unless defined and substantiated, in alignment with EU law.

Train relevant internal teams (e.g., marketing, sustainability, and legal) on EU marketing laws, guidance, and prior decisions affecting green marketing claims and set up pre-clearance for sustainability messaging.

Continue to closely monitor the rapidly evolving legal and policy developments in green marketing, not just in the EU but in other jurisdictions as well. (see, e.g., Canada Issues Guidelines on Civil Greenwashing Claims One Year After Amendments to the Competition Act).

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are investing in the future of the communities we serve by partnering with Mountain Towns 2030 (MT2030).



Earlier this year, we became a major sponsor of the annual MT2030 Climate Summit to launch the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship, a program designed to remove financial barriers for community leaders eager to participate in the three-day event.

In the heart of America’s mountain towns — where alpine trails meet bluebird skies — communities are facing the growing challenges of climate change. These towns, often nestled in remote, high-altitude regions, are particularly vulnerable to environmental shifts and have become increasingly susceptible to droughts, wildfires, avalanches and ecological degradation.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are investing in the future of the communities we serve by partnering with Mountain Towns 2030 (MT2030), a nonprofit that empowers a movement of mountain communities committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Earlier this year, we became a major sponsor of the annual MT2030 Climate Summit to launch the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship, a program designed to remove financial barriers for community leaders eager to participate in the three-day event. Four scholarship recipients from California and Washington were selected to attend the October gathering, hosted in Breckenridge, Colo., and flown on Alaska Airlines. The group joined hundreds of industry professionals and stakeholders in conversations around complex climate challenges and solutions.

We hosted more than 600 attendees from 61 mountain communities and 37 ski resorts, with 118 speakers leading 49 sessions across a wide range of climate and sustainability topics. Our 2025 Summit was an overwhelming success, and we couldn’t have done it without Alaska Airlines’ partnership.”

Following the MT2030 Climate Summit, we caught up with scholarship recipient Michelle to hear her reflections on the experience and what it meant to her.

What do you do for your work? What challenges does your community face that you were looking for insight on at the MT2030 Climate Summit?

I do government relations and environmental affairs for Mammoth Mountain and June Mountain. Like many other communities, wildfire is a major threat to our area, and I was interested in seeing what others were doing and how, as a ski area, we could contribute to our community.

What was the most eye-opening moment or takeaway from the Summit?

It was great to see such a large group of like-minded individuals sharing their experiences and common goals. I participated in a Solutions Lab session, which was a presentation followed by an interactive exchange to explore actionable strategies and insights. I really enjoyed the TED talk-style presentations. The Summit gave me some ideas on ways to further develop and grow our mountains’ sustainability program.

What role do you think travelers play in shaping the future of climate-resilient communities?

I think travelers play a big role in the future of climate-resilient communities. Their sustainable demands and preferences can drive the investment of our communities and resorts. An example would be electric vehicles — the increase in visitors driving EVs requires the installation of more charging stations. Travelers can also create new challenges in our communities by over-utilizing resources or not traveling responsibly. Being mindful of your impact while exploring is critical.

What’s something you learned at the summit that mountain adventure travelers should be aware of and that you’re excited to bring home?

That communities are stronger when businesses and local governments work together toward common sustainability goals. The partnership can create innovative ideas and a more climate-resilient plan for the future.

After 15 years of research and development, the company has reached a hugely significant milestone in its journey.

The team confirmed that it has successfully produced its first round of jet fuel using ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia.

It sees LanzaJet take its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology from the lab to a commercial setting for the first time.

The fuel produced in Georgia is fully compatible with existing aircraft technology, meaning it can be 'dropped in' as a direct replacement for carbon-heavy jet fuels. This could go a long way towards shrinking the carbon footprints of airlines.

What's more, LanzaJet's achievement is the very first time that a non-oil-based renewable solution of this nature has reached commercial production levels, with most SAFs generally being made using a kind of bio-oil.

How LanzaJet is overcoming feedstock challenges

Industry analysts have been warning that SAF made using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) is approaching a plateau in terms of the levels of feedstock available. As such, LanzaJet's alcohol-based solution represents a sound alternative.

The firm's proprietary technology looks to bypass this bottleneck. The process LanzaJet uses harnesses some widely available ethanol feedstocks, including agricultural residues and municipal solid waste.

By shifting focus to ethanol, the technology has the potential to open pathways for waste sources and recycled carbon to contribute to the aviation energy mix.

Flyn van Ewijk, Regional Director for APAC at LanzaJet, says: ""Overnight we shared news that LanzaJet had made history: producing jet fuel from ethanol at the world's first commercial scale plant.

""This moment is not only hugely significant for the LanzaJet family – the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment and scale-up – but also for our industry as it marks the next wave of SAF technology to reach commercial readiness in nearly a decade.""

LanzaJet’s plan to scale sustainable aviation fuel

LanzaJet describes its work in Soperton as a ""first-of-its-kind"" integrated solution.

It incorporates Technip Energies’ Hummingbird Ethanol-to-Ethylene solution alongside oligomerisation technology jointly developed by LanzaTech and the US Department of Energy.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, has taken pains to emphasise the role collaboration has played in the company's recent achievements.

“Today proves what happens when you bring together innovation, resilience, ingenuity, and teamwork to think big and develop a new industry, overcome challenges, and enable global growth,” he says.

Scaling the use of sustainable aviation and alternative fuels forms a significant part of DHL’s Sustainability Roadmap.
Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said: “This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals.
Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, said: “This agreement between Phillips 66 and DHL demonstrates our shared commitment to SAF market leadership and credible action in the growing SAF industry.
Through our global renewable fuel business, we are committed to supporting DHL and our customers in achieving their decarbonization goals.”","Logistics giant DHL Group announced a new agreement with U.S.-based energy products manufacturer Phillips 66 for the purchase of more than 240,000 metric tons (314 million liters) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to be delivered to U.S. airports over three years.

The deal marks one of the largest SAF agreements by a U.S. producer to date, and is anticipated to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons compared to conventional jet fuel, according to DHL.

Scaling the use of sustainable aviation and alternative fuels forms a significant part of DHL’s Sustainability Roadmap. Launched in 2021, the roadmap included plans to invest €7 billion over ten years in measures to reduce its CO2 emissions, with a focus on the expansion of a zero-emissions fleet, alternative aviation fuels, and climate-neutral buildings. In addition to its 2050 net zero goal, DHL also has interim targets to increase the share of more sustainable fuels across all transportation modes to more than 30%, and to electrify two-thirds of last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030.

In addition to supporting DHL’s sustainability goals, the new agreement is expected to contribute significantly to the company’s carbon “insetting” GoGreen Plus service, which enables customers to reduce their Scope 3 GHG emissions using SAF.

Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said:

“This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals. By securing a reliable supply of SAF, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions – and those within our customers’ supply chains – but also setting a precedent for the logistics and air cargo industries in the U.S.”

Under the new agreement, Phillips 66 will deliver SAF to DHL Express from the energy company’s Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California. Phillips 66 announced in 2022 that it planned to convert its oil refinery in Rodeo to process only renewable feedstocks, with the facility no longer processing crude oil and instead using waste oils, fats, greases and vegetable oils instead to produce 800 million gallons per year (over 50,000 barrels per day) of renewable transportation fuels, including renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The company announced the completion of the conversion last year. The complex is now one of the largest renewable fuel facilities in the world, and has an SAF production capacity of 150 million gallons per year.

The SAF will be delivered primarily to Los Angeles International Airport, with future intended deliveries to other West Coast airports where DHL maintains operations.

Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, said:

Etihad has today also placed a direct order with Airbus for six additional A330neos, complementing the nine aircraft leased from Avolon and bringing its total A330neo fleet to 15 aircraft.

The new aircraft from Avolon’s orderbook are due for delivery in 2027 and 2028 and will be a key driver to reshape Etihad’s short-haul and medium-haul network and provide significant capacity growth to its Abu Dhabi hub. Etihad’s operating fleet stood at 115 aircraft as of 17 November, with a network of over 100 destinations worldwide.

Avolon was a launch customer for the A330neo programme in 2014 and has 87 A330neos in its owned and committed fleet. The A330neo is designed to fly up to 8,100 nautical miles / 15,000 kilometers non-stop and reduces fuel burn, CO2 emissions and operating cost by 25% compared to previous generation aircraft.

Andy Cronin, CEO of Avolon, commented:

“Etihad’s selection of the A330neo is a strong endorsement for the programme and reflects the high level of demand from airlines for widebody capacity. The scale of our orderbook, bolstered by our order for 75 A321neos and 15 A330neos in July, has enabled us to ensure Etihad has the capacity required for its expansion plans. We are delighted to increase our exposure to a top-tier carrier like Etihad as the Middle East continues to expand as an aviation hub.”

Antonoaldo Neves, CEO of Etihad Airways, commented:

“Avolon has been a valued partner in supporting the evolution of our fleet, and these additional A330neo and A320neo family aircraft give us the flexibility and efficiency we need for the next phase of our growth. The A330neo will play a key role in strengthening our medium-haul network, while the A320neo family supports our short-haul expansion and enhances connectivity through Abu Dhabi. We look forward to deepening our partnership with Avolon as we continue to build a modern, efficient fleet.”

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez.
The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).
Solutions from labs big and small Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects.
The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups.","“We’re here to talk about really substantive changes, and we want you to be a participant in that,” said Desirée Plata, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor of Climate and Energy in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, at Energizing@MIT: the MIT Energy Initiative’s (MITEI) Annual Research Conference that was held on Sept. 9-10.

Plata’s words resonated with the 150-plus participants from academia, industry, and government meeting in Cambridge for the conference, whose theme was “tackling emerging energy challenges.” Meeting such challenges and ultimately altering the trajectory of global climate outcomes requires partnerships, speakers agreed.

“We have to be humble and open,” said Giacomo Silvestri, chair of Eniverse Ventures at Eni, in a shared keynote address. “We cannot develop innovation just focusing on ourselves and our competencies … so we need to partner with startups, venture funds, universities like MIT and other public and private institutions.”

Added his Eni colleague, Annalisa Muccioli, head of research and technology, “The energy transition is a race we can win only by combining mature solutions ready to deploy, together with emerging technologies that still require acceleration and risk management.”

Research targets

In a conference that showcased a suite of research priorities MITEI has identified as central to ensuring a low-carbon energy future, participants shared both promising discoveries and strategies for advancing proven technologies in the face of shifting political winds and policy uncertainties.

One panel focused on grid resiliency — a topic that has moved from the periphery to the center of energy discourse as climate-driven disruptions, cyber threats, and the integration of renewables challenge legacy systems. A dramatic case in point: the April 2025 outage in Spain and Portugal that left millions without power for eight to 15 hours.

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez. While he pinpointed technical problems with reactive power and voltage control behind the system collapse, Duenas-Martinez also called out a lack of transmission capacity with Central Europe and out-of-date operating procedures, and recommended better preparation and communication among transmission systems and utility operators.

“You can’t plan for every single eventuality, which means we need to broaden the portfolio of extreme events we prepare for,” noted Jennifer Pearce, vice president at energy company Avangrid. “We are making the system smarter, stronger, and more resilient to better protect from a wide range of threats such as storms, flooding, and extreme heat events.” Pearce noted that Avangrid’s commitment to deliver safe, reliable power to its customers necessitates “meticulous emergency planning procedures.”

The resiliency of the electric grid under greatly increased demand is an important motivation behind MITEI’s September 2025 launch of the Data Center Power Forum, which was also announced during the annual research conference. The forum will include research projects, webinars, and other content focused on energy supply and storage, grid design and management, infrastructure, and public and economic policy related to data centers. The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).

Storage and transportation: Staggering challenges

Meeting climate goals to decarbonize the world by 2050 requires building around 300 terawatt-hours of storage, according to Asegun Henry, a professor in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering. “It’s an unbelievably enormous problem people have to wrap their minds around,” he said. Henry has been developing a high-temperature thermal energy storage system he has nicknamed “sun in a box.” His system uses liquid metal and graphite to hold electricity as heat and then convert it back to electricity, enabling storage anywhere from five to 500 hours.

“At the end of the day, storage provides a service, and the type of technology that you need is a function of the service that you value the most,” said Nestor Sepulveda, commercial lead for advanced energy investments and partnerships at Google. “I don't think there is one winner-takes-all type of market here.”

Another panel explored sustainable fuels that could help decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking. Randall Field, MITEI’s director of research, noted that sustainably produced drop-in fuels — fuels that are largely compatible with existing engines — “could eliminate potentially trillions of dollars of cost for fleet replacement and for infrastructure build-out, while also helping us to accelerate the rate of decarbonization of the transportation sectors.""

Erik G. Birkerts is the chief growth officer of LanzaJet, which produces a drop-in, high-energy-density aviation fuel derived from agricultural residue and other waste carbon sources. “The key to driving broad sustainable aviation fuel adoption is solving both the supply-side challenge through more production and the demand-side hurdle by reducing costs,” he said.

“We think a good policy framework [for sustainable fuels] would be something that is technology-neutral, does not exclude any pathways to produce, is based on life cycle accounting practices, and on market mechanisms,” said Veronica L. Robertson, energy products technology portfolio manager at ExxonMobil.

MITEI plans a major expansion of its research on sustainable fuels, announcing a two-year study, “The future of fuels: Pathways to sustainable transportation,” starting in early 2026. According to Field, the study will analyze and assess biofuels and e-fuels.

Solutions from labs big and small

Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects. A panel on carbon capture in power generation featured three takes on the topic: Devin Shaw, commercial director of decarbonization technologies at Shell, described post-combustion carbon capture in power plants using steam for heat recovery; Jan Marsh, a global program lead at Siemens Energy, discussed deploying novel materials to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air; and Jeffrey Goldmeer, senior director of technology strategy at GE Vernova, explained integrating carbon capture into gas-powered turbine systems.

During a panel on vehicle electrification, Brian Storey, vice president of energy and materials at the Toyota Research Institute, provided an overview of Toyota’s portfolio of projects for decarbonization, including solid-state batteries, flexible manufacturing lines, and grid-forming inverters to support EV charging infrastructure.

A session on MITEI seed fund projects revealed promising early-stage research inside MIT’s own labs. A new process for decarbonizing the production of ethylene was presented by Yogesh Surendranath, Donner Professor of Science in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Materials Science and Engineering assistant professor Aristide Gumyusenge also discussed the development of polymers essential for a new kind of sodium-ion battery.

Shepherding bold, new technologies like these from academic labs into the real world cannot succeed without ample support and deft management. A panel on paths to commercialization featured the work of Iwnetim Abate, Chipman Career Development Professor and assistant professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who has spun out a company, Addis Energy, based on a novel geothermal process for harvesting clean hydrogen and ammonia from subsurface, iron-rich rocks. Among his funders: ARPA-E and MIT’s own The Engine Ventures.

The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups. “A mere 4.2 percent of all the patents that are actually prosecuted in the world are ever commercialized, which seems like a shocking number,” said Andrew Inglis, an entrepreneur working with Proto Ventures to translate geothermal discoveries into businesses. “Can’t we do this better? Let’s do this better!”

Geopolitical hazards

Throughout the conference, participants often voiced concern about the impacts of competition between the United States and China. Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and an expert on China’s energy landscape, delivered the sobering news in her keynote address: “U.S. competitiveness in low-carbon technologies has eroded in nearly every category,” she said. “The Chinese are winning the clean tech race.”

China enjoys a 51 percent share in global wind turbine manufacture and 75 percent in solar modules. It also controls low-carbon supply chains that much of the world depends on. “China is getting so dominant that nobody can carve out a comparative advantage in anything,” said Gallagher. “China is just so big, and the scale is so huge that the Chinese can truly conquer markets and make it very hard for potential competitors to find a way in.”

And for the United States, the problem is “the seesaw of energy policy,” she says. “It’s incredibly difficult for the private sector to plan and to operate, given the lack of predictability and policy here.”

Nevertheless, Gallagher believes the United States still has a chance of at least regaining competitiveness, by setting up a stable, bipartisan energy policy, rebuilding domestic manufacturing and supply chains; providing consistent fiscal incentives; attracting and retaining global talent; and fostering international collaboration.

The conference shone a light on one such collaboration: a China-U.S. joint venture to manufacture lithium iron phosphate batteries for commercial vehicles in the United States. The venture brings together Eve Energy, a Chinese battery technology and manufacturing company; Daimler, a global commercial vehicle manufacturer; PACCAR Inc., a U.S.-based truck manufacturer; and Accelera, the zero-emissions business of Cummins Inc. “Manufacturing batteries in the U.S. makes the supply chain more robust and reduces geopolitical risks,” said Mike Gerty, of PACCAR.

While she acknowledged the obstacles confronting her colleagues in the room, Plata nevertheless concluded her remarks as a panel moderator with some optimism: “I hope you all leave this conference and look back on it in the future, saying I was in the room when they actually solved some of the challenges standing between now and the future that we all wish to manifest.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202510/mitei-annual-conference.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:03.968475

Platinum is required across all major SAF production pathways, including Power-to Liquid (PtL), which utilises the Fischer Tropsch process (FT), as well as the FT process itself.
While current platinum demand from SAF is modest, in the long term it is expected to grow significantly.
In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas).
The role of platinum Platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as a core pillar of decarbonisation in aviation, with the International Air Transport Association estimating that it could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Unlike petroleum-based kerosene, SAF is produced from sustainable, non-petroleum feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, or via synthetic e-fuels combining renewable electricity with captured CO₂.

Platinum is required across all major SAF production pathways, including Power-to Liquid (PtL), which utilises the Fischer Tropsch process (FT), as well as the FT process itself. While current platinum demand from SAF is modest, in the long term it is expected to grow significantly.

Originally developed by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, this year marks 100 years since the FT process was developed. Their research demonstrated that a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen could be transformed over suitable catalysts into liquid and solid hydrocarbons. Today FT is used in myriad industrial applications.

PtL is a synthetic jet fuel produced using renewable electricity, with water and CO₂ serving as the primary inputs. To create a climate-neutral carbon feedstock, green hydrogen and captured CO₂ (from the atmosphere or industrial sources) are used. These components are then combined through FT synthesis to form liquid hydrocarbons, which are subsequently refined into a kerosene-equivalent fuel.

In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas). This syngas is then processed through FT synthesis into liquid wax. FT has significant scalability potential for SAF production as it can utilise a wide range of feedstocks, including waste materials that would otherwise be discarded. This makes it a strong candidate for commercial scale SAF production, although supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are needed to accelerate its deployment.

The role of platinum

Platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis. Iron catalysts dominate biomass FT and do not use platinum.

However, cobalt catalysts are preferred in PtL FT and these use platinum as a promoter. Even at very low concentrations, platinum improves cobalt catalyst reduction, stability, and dispersion, resulting in higher efficiency and longer lifetimes.

Further, platinum has a significant role in isomerisation, which is needed in both the FT and the PtL FT SAF production pathways, where it functions as a catalyst to transform straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched isomers with superior cold-flow properties. Without this step, SAF would fail to meet the strict freezing point requirements necessary for safe, high-altitude flight.

WPIC expects annual SAF capacity additions to increase eight-fold from around 2 Mt in 2024 to approximately 16 Mt by 2050, while platinum demand from SAF production is expected to increase from negligible volumes to around 260 koz per annum by 2050. This platinum demand growth will be incremental overall, mitigating the expected decrease in petroleum platinum demand as global markets continue to make their energy transition from 2030 to 2050.",https://platinuminvestment.com/favicon-32x32.png?v=WGoYw5O7yP,N,,2025-11-18 13:56:51.988693

Over the past year, the Aviation team has demonstrated a commitment to innovation and collaboration across the SAF value chain, including its most recent agreement with DHL Express. Phillips 66’s integrated model — spanning refining, logistics and commercial operations — has been vital in supplying reliable, lower-carbon solutions for airlines worldwide.

“Our integrated model is a competitive advantage that enables resilience and value creation in the SAF market,” said Ronald Sanchez, Phillips 66 vice president of aviation. “Our people, capabilities and assets allow for feedstock optionality; our supply chain agility accounts for an evolving environment.”

Progress takes flight

Phillips 66’s SAF deal with DHL Express is one of the largest U.S. air cargo SAF agreements, supplying the logistics company with over 240,000 metric tons of SAF over three years. The SAF in this agreement is expected to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons compared to conventional jet fuel.

The announcement is the latest in a growing list of Phillips 66 customer milestones in the last calendar year, which also includes agreements with Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Qantas Airlines and United Airlines.

Each agreement represents important steps toward decarbonization and opportunities to offer dependable, lower-carbon solutions.

Scaling up: Experience and cross-industry collaboration

Serving a broad customer base, Phillips 66 Aviation benefits from the company’s integrated portfolio and global reach.

Phillips 66 Aviation advantages:

Deep industry experience — Nearly 100 years in aviation fuel supply.

Market presence — Supplies approximately 10% of U.S. jet fuel and one of the largest branded fixed base operator (FBO) customer base.

Leading SAF assets — Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in the U.S. has production capacity of 150 million gallons per year of neat SAF and Humber Refinery in the U.K., which is the country’s only commercial-scale producer of SAF through coprocessing.

Commercial operations — Global offices in Asia, Europe and North America with an operating network of over 80 countries.

Sanchez recently noted at the Argus North American Biofuels, LCFS & Carbon Markets Summit that there are still notable barriers to scaling SAF, stating that it will require collaboration to overcome them.

For example, Phillips 66 recently signed an agreement with Chooose to implement a SAF book-and-claim system. The system facilitates the allocation and tracking of environmental benefits from SAF when the fuel is not physically delivered to specific customers or locations. This agreement enables Phillips 66 to offer additional solutions for the aviation industry by streamlining SAF delivery and documentation, making operations more efficient and fostering collaboration.

“We’re working side by side with airlines, fuel producers, technology developers, policymakers and regulators — across the U.S. and internationally — to overcome the barriers to scaling SAF,” he said. “No single player can scale this alone. Supportive policies, regulatory certainty and reliable feedstock availability are essential to making SAF economically viable and competitive with conventional fuel.”

As the conversation and collaboration continues, Phillips 66 stands prepared to deliver energy solutions. Sanchez said, “With our refineries, midstream assets, research capabilities and commercial expertise, we are uniquely positioned to help shape the next 100 years of aviation.”",https://www.phillips66.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/BAYWAYSTILLS0060.png,N,,2025-11-18 11:56:59.380869

Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) confirmed its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for all passengers who depart from the country to another destination.

The tax is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet its one per cent SAF target for 2026, as well as the projected price premium of SAF and “other associated costs”.

Singapore’s air tax. How much will I have to pay?

The levy varies based on the distanceflyers are travelling, and has been categorised into four geographical bands.

Europe, along with Africa, Central and West Asia, the Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand, has been placed in band four.

This is subject to a S$6.40 (€4.24) tax per passenger for economy cabins (which includes Premium Economy seats) and a S$25.60 (€16.96) tax for premium cabins, which includes business class and first class.

The Americas have been placed in band five, and will be subject to a S$10.40 (€6.89) and S$41.60 (€27.57) charge, respectively.

Band two, which includes Northeast Asia, South Asia,Australiaand Papua New Guinea will be hit with a S$3.80 (€2.52) and S$11.20 (€7.42) charge.

Southeast Asia is the only area in band one, with passengers only having to pay S$1 (€0.66) or S$4 (€2.65) depending on their cabin class.

Flyers transiting through Singapore will not be stung by the charge.

What if I’m on a connecting flight?

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy is only applied on the “immediate next destination” after departing Singapore.

For example, if you’re flying from Singapore to Paris via a layover in Amsterdam, you will only have to pay the levy on the Singapore to Amsterdam part of the journey.

The airline will collect the SAF Levy and must display the tax as a “distinct line item” on the air ticket when sold.

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the levy.

Singapore’s sustainability efforts

Last year, CAAS released the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, outlining the country’s approach to sustainable growth in the aviation sector.

This plan aims to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030, and to achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

Director-General of CAAS Han Hok Juan says the new rules mark a major step in Singapore’s effort to build a “more sustainable and competitive” air hub.

“The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs, to get the best value for money and ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the fund.","In order to boost its decarbonisation efforts, Singapore is set to become the first country to ask a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy from air passengers. The measure will go into effect as of October 2026.

In the transition towards the goal of net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050, as set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), sustainable aviation fuel is considered an important asset. Made from waste products and plant material, SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to normal fossil jet fuels, according to Neste, a Finnish oil refining and marketing company.

At the moment, however, demand far surpasses supply, making SAF a costly subject. To make the decarbonation process of its aviation industry more feasible and to support Singapore’s goal of having 1% of all jet fuel used at the Changi and Seletar Airports come from SAF by 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a state-wide SAF levy.

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust”, said Han Kok Juan, director general of CAAS.

One levy, multiple factors

The levy will apply to all passengers departing from the country (those who are simply transiting will not be concerned) as of 1 October 2026. Tickets sold from 1 April 2026 onwards will be subject to the tax, the amount of which will depend on two factors.

Firstly, the cabin in which the passenger will be flying will determine part of the tax. Economy and Premium seats will be categorised as ‘Economy’, while Business and First Class seats will be considered as ‘Premium’. Secondly, the distance travelled by passengers will play a role. Destinations have been categorised by four geographical bands:

Southeast Asia

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand

The Americas

Following that categorisation, prices will range from S$1 (€0.66) for economy class passengers flying to Bangkok or S$10.40 (€6.89) for those travelling to New York. Levies for Premium travellers will be multiplied by four. Cargo will be taxed by the kilogram, while general and business aviation flights are to be charged on a per-aircraft basis.

The new levy will be paid directly by the passenger and will be displayed as a distinct line item on airline tickets. Thereafter, all levies will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS.

“The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs, to get the best value for money and ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the fund. CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators, and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation”, CAAS declared in a statement.

Whether or not passengers will end up paying the full levy themselves or not, remains to be seen, as it is possible that airlines will adapt their fares accordingly in order to remain competitive in the region.",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aviation-fuel.jpg#161580,N,,2025-11-18 10:57:17.317013

The company has successfully operated its commercial-scale LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, USA, producing jet fuel derived entirely from ethanol. This accomplishment marks the world’s first instance of a commercial facility generating jet fuel from ethanol feedstock and represents the first non-petroleum renewable aviation fuel solution fully compatible with today’s aircraft and existing fueling infrastructure.

This achievement is the result of 15 years of persistent scientific advancement, industry collaboration, investment, and progressive scaling efforts. It provides definitive proof that ethanol can be converted into jet fuel at commercial volumes, addressing a long-standing challenge in aviation’s journey toward lower-carbon operations. With the traditional HEFA bio-oil pathway nearing limits in both availability and qualification of feedstocks, LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology now opens the door for the next major wave of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development. The technology is suited to diverse regions across the world and offers a timely solution for an industry urgently seeking alternatives to fossil-based fuels.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, described the achievement as a powerful example of what becomes possible when innovation, dedication, resilience, and collaborative effort converge to build a new industrial model. He emphasized that the milestone is not only significant for LanzaJet and its investors but also a notable breakthrough for global aviation, offering renewed optimism for the future of sustainable flight. Samartzis added that LanzaJet’s journey has consistently been mission-driven—focused on scaling a new industry, creating economic and environmental value, and honoring its commitments despite challenges. According to him, the company now stands uniquely equipped with both technological expertise and operational experience to influence the trajectory of SAF production in the coming decade.

LanzaJet’s ATJ technology is one of the most impactful SAF innovations to reach commercial readiness in nearly ten years. It relies on globally abundant ethanol resources and can tap into additional ethanol produced from waste materials and recycled carbon. This broad feedstock flexibility gives nations an opportunity to strengthen agricultural sectors, foster new economic development, and boost domestic energy resilience. With ATJ, countries can also localize fuel supply chains, improving control over production and distribution.

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility is expected to serve as a foundational model for expanding SAF production internationally. It is the first fully integrated First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) plant utilizing multiple breakthrough technologies, including Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® Ethanol-to-Ethylene system and an Oligomerization solution developed jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet not only invested in but also engineered, constructed, integrated, and commissioned these systems to create the world’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet fuel production facility.

The ATJ process is capable of converting a wide range of sustainable feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, energy crops, and captured carbon into low-carbon jet fuel. When blended with Jet A-1, the fuel meets global certification standards and can seamlessly power existing aircraft without modifications. LanzaJet is already deploying its technology across multiple regions—including the U.S., Australia, India, Japan, the UK, the European Union, Colombia, the Middle East, and Kazakhstan.

Located in Treutlen County, less than 100 miles from Savannah, the Freedom Pines Fuels plant required an investment of more than $300 million. During construction, it supported over 300 jobs and has since created more than 65 direct and indirect ongoing positions. LanzaJet’s accomplishment builds on a history of pioneering achievements that began within LanzaTech in 2012, when the ethanol-to-SAF pathway was first explored. This early effort moved from laboratory experiments to pilot and demonstration facilities, eventually earning ASTM approval in 2016. The technology went on to power initial commercial test flights with Virgin Atlantic and All Nippon Airways in 2018 and 2019, respectively—laying the groundwork for this monumental commercial-scale breakthrough.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-18 10:58:06.778060

On April 10, 2023, Sinopec confirmed plans for a 400 kilometer green hydrogen pipeline from Ulanqab in Inner Mongolia to Beijing, with an initial throughput near 100,000 tonnes per year. On November 3, 2025, construction began on a separate 1,038 kilometer network in northern China that aims to connect renewable‑rich zones to demand centers around the capital.

China Pivots from Hydrogen Pilots to Pipelines

New national guidance for 2026 through 2030 directs provinces to channel surplus wind and solar into green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. The goal is to reduce curtailment and cut industrial emissions.

This policy track underpins the pipelines with clearer demand signals and grid coordination policy guidance for 2026–2030. As the green hydrogen supply chain matures globally, China’s pivot from pilots to pipes shows how electrons are converted into molecules that can be transported in global supply chain dynamics.

Key Facts on China’s New Hydrogen Backbone

First cross-provincial pipeline: 400 kilometers from Inner Mongolia to Beijing, planned initial capacity near 100,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year.

New regional network: about 1,038 kilometers in northern China with a full-build target near 1.6 million tonnes per year.

Policy signal: 2026–2030 guidance encourages surplus wind and solar to be converted into green hydrogen and related e-fuels to reduce curtailment.

Cost frame: order-of-magnitude transport costs near 0.10–0.24 dollars per kilogram per 1,000 kilometers depending on repurposed or new lines.

Energy equivalent: ≈ 56.6 TWh/year combined (LHV)—about 3.33 TWh from the 400 km line’s 100,000 t/yr plus ~53.3 TWh from the 1,038 km spine’s 1.6 Mt/yr.

Primary near-term users: refineries, chemicals, and steel in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cluster.

From Pilot Projects to a Hydrogen Backbone

The 400-kilometer Inner Mongolia to Beijing Line

Approval and Route

Sinopec’s project links Ulanqab’s wind and solar resources with the Beijing market through a 400 kilometer corridor. The route was profiled as China’s first cross‑provincial green hydrogen pipeline and established a template for future connections between renewable‑rich interiors and capital‑region demand, as profiled by Reuters.

Capacity and Phasing

The initial capacity target is about 100,000 tonnes per year, allowing for staged expansions as upstream electrolyzers scale and as downstream offtake grows. Electrolyzers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Matching electrolyzer ramp-up with pipeline utilization is essential, since pipe load factors determine delivered costs.

Schedule note: As of November 2025, no official completion or commissioning date for the 400 kilometer line has been published by authorities or the developer.

How Much Energy is 100K Tonnes of Hydrogen?

At 100,000 tonnes per year, the hydrogen energy content is roughly 3.33 terawatt-hours annually on a lower heating value basis, equal to about 3.33 billion kilowatt-hours. In simpler terms, this amount of energy is equivalent to about fifty million electric vehicle charges of 70 kilowatt-hours each or the chemical energy found in roughly 350 million liters of gasoline, illustrating how much energy a single cross-provincial pipeline can transport when operating continuously.

First Sinks and System Integration

Beijing’s refining and chemical hubs can absorb hydrogen sooner than sectors that require major equipment changes. Early displacement of fossil-based hydrogen in refining and chemical feedstocks provides an immediate emissions reduction while larger conversions progress. For a sector-level view of how heavy industry transitions in steps, use a primer on hard‑to‑abate industries and their roadmaps for hard‑to‑abate industries.

The 1,038-kilometer North China Spine

Nodes and Route Span

The new network connects northern renewables, including zones near Zhangjiakou, with demand clusters around Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan. It creates a backbone that can tie multiple production parks, storage sites, and offtakers into a single corridor. This approach is far more efficient than connecting many isolated projects. Recent investments expanded wind and solar capacity in Inner Mongolia, strengthening the case for long‑distance molecules and a large wind and solar base in Inner Mongolia.

Throughput Ambition and Timeline

At full buildout, the trunk line is planned to carry on the order of 1.6 million tonnes of hydrogen per year, far above the throughput of any single pilot. Construction began on November 3, 2025, which initiated detailed engineering, compressor siting, and interconnection works, according to industry reporting.

In energy terms, 1.6 million tonnes of hydrogen per year corresponds to approximately 53.3 terawatt-hours (LHV), which is equivalent to about 53.3 billion kilowatt-hours, roughly 760 million charges for 70 kWh electric vehicles, or the chemical energy found in around six billion liters of gasoline.

Schedule note: As of November 2025, a firm completion or commissioning date for the 1,038 kilometer network has not been publicly announced.

Regional Benefits and Risks

A spine condenses scattered pilot lessons into a single shared asset. Benefits include lower per-unit transport expenses at scale, fewer truck movements, and a clearer outlook for industrial decarbonization near the capital. Risks include underutilization if electrolyzer projects or offtake agreements lag. Policymaker direction for 2026 through 2030 increases the likelihood that supply and demand will scale in tandem.

The Economic Case for Pipelines Over Trucking

Cost and Distance Thresholds

For short- to mid-range distances on land, pipelines move large volumes with fewer losses and lower labor intensity than fleets of tube trailers. Repurposed gas lines can be especially economical, while new hydrogen pipelines remain competitive for distances under a few thousand kilometers, a pattern reflected in IRENA’s global trade analysis. Global buildouts in Europe are following similar patterns at the industrial-scale large European green hydrogen buildout.

New Versus Repurposed Lines

Repurposed lines can offer lower capital costs if materials and safety standards are met. New hydrogen-dedicated lines give operators immediate control over metallurgy, coatings, and design pressures. The International Energy Agency’s review summarizes how these choices interact with overall market creation, policy clarity, and utilization rates in its 2024 assessment, the International Energy Agency’s 2024 review.

Safety, Compression, and Blending Considerations

Hydrogen is a small molecule that requires specific pipeline materials and compressors to prevent embrittlement and leaks. Blending small shares of hydrogen into existing gas grids is one transition strategy, but hydrogen‑dedicated pipes are necessary for delivering high‑purity molecules for green steel or fuel cells.

The North China spine is purpose‑built for hydrogen, not a blend. Transporting hydrogen as ammonia or in liquid organic carriers (LOHC) is common for maritime routes but less practical for domestic trunk lines where high‑volume gas flow is needed. Green steel pathways are also advancing to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in direct‑reduced ironmaking green steel pathways.

Solving Curtailment by Converting Electrons to Molecules

China’s wind and solar buildout sometimes produces more electricity than local grids can absorb at a given moment. This forces operators to curtail, or waste, that generation. Converting a portion of those excess electrons into hydrogen creates a portable energy carrier that can be moved to where demand is stronger and stored for later use.

The new backbone pipelines give that strategy scale, since molecules can flow continuously from Inner Mongolia’s renewable parks to the Beijing region even when the grid is saturated. China’s clean‑power scaling has simultaneously driven down costs while expanding capacity for clean power scaling and costs.

The Policy Driving the “Electrons-to-Molecules” Strategy

The NEA’s 2026–2030 Push

National guidance for 2026 through 2030 asks provinces to channel surplus wind and solar into green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. The aim is practical: reduce curtailment while creating low‑emissions inputs for heavy industry and transport. This policy backdrop is crucial because it synchronizes electrolyzer deployment with pipeline interconnections and industrial offtake planning.

Where Curtailment Appears and Why Pipes Help

Inner Mongolia and surrounding provinces host large wind and solar bases that can outpace local demand during certain hours. Electrolyzers located near those bases can operate when prices are low, then send hydrogen along the 400 kilometer corridor toward end users near the capital. Long trunklines also make it easier to add new production nodes over time without rebuilding logistics entirely.

How Curtailment, Electrolyzers, and Pipes Connect

The pipeline acts as a “virtual transmission line” for molecules. This is often more economical than building new ultra‑high‑voltage power lines just to manage a few hours of surplus generation. Storing hydrogen near the electrolyzer and releasing it steadily into the pipe allows the pipeline to run at a high, stable load factor, a key factor in lowering the final delivered cost. The aim is to convert energy that would be wasted into a valuable commodity, not to replace the power grid, which must still balance supply and demand from a single province or a single hour of the day.

Electrolyzer Siting and Storage

Developers balance three variables when they place electrolyzers: access to cheap renewable electricity, water supply and treatment, and pipeline tie‑ins.

Storage options, such as above-ground tanks and underground caverns, can smooth hourly variations so that pipelines run with steadier, more efficient flows. This combination of local electrolyzers and storage is what allows the pipeline backbone to absorb the surpluses created by China’s massive wind and solar expansion.

Industrial Decarbonization where it Counts

Hydrogen delivered by pipe is most useful in applications where it is already part of the process. For this reason, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cluster, with its refineries, chemical complexes, and steelmakers, is central to the backbone’s development. Replacing fossil‑based hydrogen in these facilities cuts emissions without waiting for entirely new equipment classes.

First Sinks: Refining, Chemicals, and Steel

Refineries use hydrogen to remove sulfur and to upgrade fuels. Chemical plants rely on it for ammonia and methanol pathways. Steelmakers are piloting direct reduced iron routes that substitute hydrogen for the carbon-based reducing agents traditionally supplied by coal. Early examples show how these substitutions work in practice, including a large green steel pilot that defines a path for heavier industrial loads like large green steel pilots, such as a project that links renewables to metallurgical demand through green hydrogen ironmaking in Australia.

Refining and Chemicals

Given their existing hydrogen consumption, these sectors can seamlessly integrate cleaner molecules, as long as they meet the necessary purity and pressure standards. Over time, higher shares of green hydrogen can be introduced as supply grows and as equipment is upgraded. Contracts that lock in minimum volumes help improve pipeline utilization and reduce delivered cost volatility.

Steel and High‑Heat Loads

Steel requires high temperatures and reducing conditions. Projects that pair hydrogen with electric arc furnaces or with direct‑reduced iron units can significantly lower emissions relative to blast furnaces that rely on coal. The backbone enables pilot quantities to scale into routine supply, which is essential for consistent plant operation.

Cost Reality: Molecule Cost Versus End‑Product Price

Clean hydrogen often costs more at the molecule level than today’s fossil‑based alternative. However, when the cost is spread across complex products such as refined fuels or chemicals, the effect on final prices is usually modest. That is why policy, long‑term contracts, and high utilization work together; they stabilize the economics while industry converts equipment over multi‑year timelines.

Utilization Matters: Lessons from Early Projects

Early green hydrogen projects in China have shown that first‑year output can lag nameplate targets as operators adjust power supply, water treatment, compression, and maintenance schedules. Those lessons inform how backbone pipelines will be used. The more consistently the pipe runs near its design flow, the lower the transport cost per kilogram, and the stronger the business case for industrial offtakers. In road transport, hydrogen passenger vehicles serve limited but specific niches hydrogen passenger vehicles.

China’s 2030 Hydrogen Outlook: Economics, Policy, and High Energy Milestones

The success of China’s hydrogen backbone strategy will be measured by utilization rates, delivered cost to factories, and the pace of industrial conversions in the capital region.

Domestic Demand Versus Export Pull

Pipelines primarily serve domestic industry, yet export markets are still important because they influence investment and standards. Ammonia and synthetic fuels offer another route for moving clean energy over long distances; as such, domestic pipelines and maritime vectors should be viewed as complementary, not competing, systems.

Carbon‑to‑fuels pathways convert captured CO₂ into energy carriers for transport sectors’ carbon‑to‑fuels methods. Domestic ammonia and e-fuels also remain important complements to watch in this market.

Sensitivities: Load Factors, Delivered Cost, and Policy Follow‑Through

Three inputs dominate the economics: electrolyzer capacity factors, pipeline load factors, and electricity prices. Higher utilization lowers transport cost per kilogram and spreads fixed costs across more output. Policy follow‑through on permitting, water resource planning, and grid connections will determine how quickly new nodes can tie into the spine.

Sustainability: Why Hydrogen Outperforms Petrol

Green hydrogen from renewable electricity has near-zero operational CO₂ at the point of use and produces only water in fuel cells, while petrol releases CO₂ and other pollutants in combustion and adds upstream emissions from extraction, transport, and refining.

Piped supply reduces truck movements compared with tube-trailer logistics, improving traffic and noise footprints. Local air quality benefits when clean hydrogen displaces fossil-based hydrogen in refineries and when industrial combustion shifts to lower-emission processes.

Practical safety measures are still important, such as strict control of hydrogen leaks, responsible water use for electrolysis, and high safety standards. With those controls in place, delivering about 56.6 TWh per year of green hydrogen positions the region to cut greenhouse gases and particulate pollution at scale.

Energy per Tonne: Hydrogen versus Petrol

On a mass basis, hydrogen carries far more chemical energy than petrol. Using lower heating values, hydrogen is about 33.33 MWh per tonne (≈120 MJ/kg), while petrol is about 12.22 MWh per tonne (≈44 MJ/kg). This means that hydrogen contains approximately 2.7 times more energy than petrol when compared on a tonne-for-tonne basis.

When applied to the combined pipeline supply of approximately 56.6 TWh per year, equating that energy solely with petrol would necessitate approximately 4.63 million tonnes of petrol (roughly 6.2 billion liters at 0.75 kg per liter), compared to approximately 1.70 million tonnes of hydrogen. These comparisons are energy content only; real‑world outcomes also depend on device efficiency and logistics, but the mass‑based contrast is stark.

Milestones to Watch

2026 through 2027: phased electrolyzer additions near Inner Mongolia with first tie‑ins to the 400 kilometer link.

2027 through 2028: initial flows to refineries and chemical plants in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region and early steel trials that rely on continuous supply.

2029 through 2030: expansion of the North China spine with additional nodes and larger storage, plus maturing of long‑term offtake contracts.

A New Hydrogen Artery for Industrial Decarbonization

China’s hydrogen buildout is clearly pivoting from isolated pilots to integrated infrastructure. The 400-kilometer Inner Mongolia-to-Beijing link and the 1,038-kilometer North China spine create a crucial highway for clean molecules. This new backbone provides a practical, large-scale solution to renewable energy curtailment by converting surplus wind and solar into a transportable, stable energy carrier.

This pipeline infrastructure is a direct enabler of industrial decarbonization for the capital region. By providing a steady supply of green hydrogen to refineries, chemical plants, and steelmakers, the backbone allows heavy industry to substitute cleaner inputs. If developers maintain high utilization rates and policy remains aligned, these pipelines will turn climate ambition into daily operations, converting surplus electrons into the molecules that power a cleaner industrial future.

Key Questions on China’s Hydrogen Pipeline

What is the Purpose of the North China Hydrogen Spine?

The 1,038-km spine is a large-scale hydrogen pipeline network designed to transport green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions, like Inner Mongolia, to the industrial and urban demand centers around Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Its primary goals are to reduce renewable energy curtailment and provide clean fuel for industrial decarbonization.

Why use Pipelines instead of Trucking for Hydrogen?

While trucks are suitable for smaller, local delivery, pipelines are far more economical for moving large volumes of hydrogen over long distances. Pipelines offer lower transport costs per kilogram, higher throughput, and reduced labor intensity compared to a fleet of tube trailers.

How does this Pipeline Help with Energy Curtailment?

Curtailment happens when renewable sources like wind and solar produce more electricity than the grid can use, forcing operators to shut them down. These pipelines allow that surplus electricity to be used to power electrolyzers, converting the excess energy into green hydrogen, which can then be stored and transported to where it’s needed.

What Industries are the First Users of this Hydrogen?

The primary near-term users (or “first sinks”) are heavy industries in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cluster that already use hydrogen in their processes. This includes refineries (for removing sulfur), chemical plants (for making ammonia and methanol), and steelmakers who are piloting green hydrogen for cleaner iron production.",https://www.intelligentliving.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Chinas-56.6-TWhyr-Hydrogen-Pipeline-Network-A-1.7Mt-Backbone-for-Green-Industrial-Fuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 10:59:03.333091

Conclusion The updated guidance is more than a compliance document.","A new guidance document has clarified how aviation fuel suppliers should collect and report data for the ReFuelEU Aviation framework. The focus is on improving consistency, transparency, and accuracy in how suppliers document both conventional aviation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel. This update offers a clearer path for compliance and supports the broader transition toward cleaner aviation.

What the Guidance Covers

Clear Reporting Expectations

The document outlines who must report, what information needs to be submitted, and the timelines involved. Suppliers are expected to track the fuel they provide at Union airports between January and December each year and submit their reports by mid February of the following year. This structured cycle gives suppliers a predictable rhythm for data collection and verification.

Distinction Between Supply To and Supply At Airports

One of the most helpful clarifications is the difference between fuel delivered to an airport and fuel supplied at the airport for actual consumption. This avoids confusion and ensures that only fuel that is physically provided to aircraft is counted toward sustainability obligations.

Improved Traceability and Data Quality

The guidance emphasises robust documentation such as certificates of sustainability and fuel quality records. It also highlights how suppliers should distinguish between sustainable fuel that counts toward regulatory targets and fuel used for voluntary climate programmes.

Why This Matters

These updates build confidence in the accuracy of aviation fuel reporting. They also support a more efficient shift to sustainable fuels by reducing ambiguity. For sustainability professionals, this clarity helps streamline conversations with suppliers, regulators, and aviation partners.

Our consultancy can help organisations interpret these requirements and design reporting systems that align smoothly with operational realities and environmental goals. This enables teams to stay ahead of compliance needs while strengthening their sustainability position.

Conclusion

The updated guidance is more than a compliance document. It is a practical tool that simplifies reporting, strengthens traceability, and supports the aviation sector as it moves toward cleaner operations. Sustainability teams that act early will benefit from smoother reporting cycles and stronger environmental strategies.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-11-1.svg,N,,2025-11-18 09:56:19.075633

Currently, Emirates (EK) and Etihad Airways (EY) operate under a “soft requirement” that encourages them to use one percent of SAF by 2031, but the government now aims to move to a compulsory mandate.

Al Olama revealed the shift ahead of a meeting of the UAE government’s SAF & Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) Executive Committee held alongside Airbus at the Dubai Airshow.

Advertisement

According to Aviation Week, He said the earlier voluntary policy was introduced to measure the national airlines’ willingness and test market readiness.

The transition from voluntary to mandatory SAF use reflects a more assertive stance by the UAE government.

Al Olama said policymakers are now assessing how a mandate would affect airline operations and how added costs might ultimately be passed on to passengers.

The government is seeking a careful balance: promoting sustainability while protecting the financial health of its national carriers.

UAE’s Production Ambition

Despite its cautious policy rollout, the UAE remains deeply committed to rapidly scaling SAF production. Al Olama described the country as “ready to hit the ground running” and stressed its capacity to drive the global transition.

Part of that strategy involves a proposed SAF production plant in Hong Kong (HKG), in partnership with UK-based Chinook Hydrogen. If successful, Al Olama envisions it serving as a model for similar domestic facilities.

Domestically, the UAE is already making tangible progress. A SAF plant is under development in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ), backed by MENA Biofuels.

It aims to process used cooking oil and waste to produce certified SAF in quantities aligned with the country’s 2030 roadmap.

Phase I of the project, costing US$200 million, will yield 125 million litres annually — roughly 18 percent of the UAE’s 2030 target — and a second phase will double that production.

Cost Implications

Implementing a SAF mandate could raise the cost of airline operations, since SAF remains more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Al Olama acknowledged that the government is cautious about how these costs could affect ticket prices.

He emphasized that further studies are underway to understand and mitigate any financial burden on airlines — and by extension, passengers.

Beyond domestic goals, the UAE sees itself as a global leader in the sustainable aviation transition. By investing in SAF infrastructure and innovation, Al Olama argued that the country can influence international SAF adoption.

He described the UAE’s approach as pragmatic but ambitious — combining market incentives, production scale, and regulatory action.

Bottom Line

The UAE is poised to shift from a voluntary SAF policy to a mandatory mandate for its airlines, signaling a major step in its environmental strategy.

With a 1 percent voluntary target already in place for 2031, the government is now studying the economic and operational impact of making SAF use compulsory. At the same time, it is scaling up domestic production through a SAF plant in Fujairah and exploring international collaborations like a proposed facility in Hong Kong.

The move underscores the UAE’s ambition to lead globally in sustainable aviation, balancing green goals with economic realities

As small- and mid-sized aviation companies navigate the pressure to reduce emissions and align with decarbonization goals, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as a transformative force. At BrightPath Associates LLC, we believe that successful adoption of SAF is not just a technical challenge - it's a strategic leadership opportunity.

Why SAF Matters More Than Ever

The environmental impact of aviation cannot be ignored. Commercial air travel contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, and SAF offers a powerful lever for change. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by a substantial margin because it is produced from renewable feedstocks, such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or synthetic processes.

According to Markets and Markets, the U.S. SAF market is projected to grow from USD 0.86 billion in 2024 to USD 6.97 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.8%. This surge is driven by policy incentives, demand from airlines, and private-sector investment.

The State of SAF Adoption in the U.S.

Despite its promise, SAF currently represents just a tiny fraction of total jet fuel usage. In recent years, production has started to scale up, but adoption remains in its infancy. For example, according to the Iowa-based SAF pathway analysis, in 2022, U.S. SAF production was less than 0.1% of total jet fuel usage. However, the commitment is growing: under the U.S. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, the goal is to reach 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030.

Key challenges remain. The cost of producing SAF is significantly higher than conventional jet fuel, primarily because of expensive feedstocks and complex processing technologies. Moreover, blending limits for SAF pose technical and regulatory constraints: not all SAF types can be used at high blend ratios with existing engines.

Drivers Powering SAF Growth

1. Policy & Incentives

Several U.S. government initiatives strongly support SAF adoption. Tax credits, such as those under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), make SAF more commercially viable. State-level efforts also contribute. For instance, certain regions are forming public–private partnerships to scale SAF production and use.

2. Rising Production Capacity

Thanks to growing industry investment, domestic SAF production capacity is expanding rapidly. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects a sharp rise in production in the near term. By scaling up co-processing in existing refineries or building dedicated bio-refineries, more SAF will flow into the supply chain.

3. Airline Commitments

Airlines are increasingly embracing SAF as part of their sustainability goals. Many major U.S. carriers have already started blending SAF into their operations or entering long-term offtake agreements. This demand from the airline side is crucial, because without strong offtake, SAF producers may struggle to justify further investments.

4. Technology Innovation

SAF production is benefiting from technological advances in multiple pathways:

- HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) – processed from waste oils and non-food lipids.

- Power-to-Liquid (PtL) – using CO₂ and renewable electricity to create synthetic fuels.

- Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) – where biomass-derived alcohols are converted into jet fuel precursors.

These innovations not only improve sustainability but also unlock new feedstock options, helping scale SAF in a cost-effective way.

Strategic Implications for Small- to Mid-Sized Aviation Firms

For small and mid-sized aviation companies, navigating SAF adoption means more than just securing fuel — it’s about strategic leadership and talent alignment:

- Talent Gap in SAF & Sustainability: To scale SAF integration, aviation businesses need leadership that understands both the technical and regulatory dimensions. Roles such as Sustainability Directors, Vice Presidents of Environmental Strategy, and SAF Program Managers are increasingly critical. These leaders will oversee collaborations with fuel producers, manage offtake contracts, and align business strategy with sustainability targets.

- Partnership Ecosystems: Companies must build strategic partnerships — not just with fuel producers, but also with regulators, R&D firms, and sustainability organizations. These partnerships help navigate funding, innovation, and compliance challenges.

- Risk Management & Scenario Planning: SAF adoption brings uncertainties: feedstock availability, cost volatility, policy shifts. Leadership teams should adopt a data-driven, scenario-based approach to manage risk — using analytics to forecast SAF demand, cost implications, and long-term ROI.

- Brand & Market Positioning: Early adoption of SAF can become a differentiator. Small- to mid-sized aviation companies that position themselves as sustainability pioneers can attract not only environmentally-conscious customers, but also forward-thinking investors and talent.

Looking Ahead: A Call to Action

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. is no longer a speculative idea — it’s a fast-accelerating reality. But for many small- to mid-sized aviation companies, the path is not obvious. What will define success is not just who builds the fuel plants, but who leads within these companies.

SGD $1 for economy, SGD $4 for premium.
This is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aims to help Singapore achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.
The money collected from the levy will go into a statutory fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is more expensive than regular fuel.
Singapore intends to use sustainable fuel for 1 percent of all its fuel needs.","In a world first, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced that, starting from October 1, 2026, travellers flying out of Singapore will be charged a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Fee as part of their flight ticket. This only applies to outbound passengers and not transit passengers.

Don’t worry, the levy isn’t unreasonable, especially if you tend to travel on a budget. The amount charged depends on the distance flown and whether you’re in economy or a premium cabin (business and first class).

This means that if you typically fly economy or premium economy, your lowest levy will be just SGD $1 to fly within Southeast Asia, and the highest will be SGD $10.40 to fly to the Americas. That said, if you fly business or first class, you’ll pay four times more than economy travellers, which means SGD $4.00 to fly within Southeast Asia, and SGD $41.60 to fly to the Americas. This is because longer flights consume more fuel.

The bands and prices are as follows:

Band 1, Southeast Asia. SGD $1 for economy, SGD $4 for premium.

Band 2, Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea. SGD $2.80 for economy, SGD $11.20 for premium.

Band 3, Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, and New Zealand. SGD $6.40 for economy, SGD $25.60 for premium.

Band 4, Americas. SGD $10.40 for economy, SGD $41.60 for premium.

It’s still extra money out of your pocket, but take heart in the fact that you’re supporting meaningful change for the environment. Mr Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, said that the levy’s introduction “marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub”. This is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aims to help Singapore achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

The money collected from the levy will go into a statutory fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is more expensive than regular fuel. Singapore intends to use sustainable fuel for 1 percent of all its fuel needs.

LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels in Soperton Georgia is now fully online, becoming the first commercial facility on the planet to turn ethanol into drop in jet fuel. The two hundred million dollar plant completed final commissioning on 13 November 2025 and is designed to deliver nine million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and one million gallons of renewable diesel during its first year. Backed by investors such as Shell British Airways and Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, the project demonstrates real world confidence in clean aviation.

How the technology works

The process converts agricultural or waste based ethanol into synthetic paraffinic kerosene through dehydration oligomerisation and hydrogenation steps. Because it uses widely available ethanol, the technology can scale quickly without relying on limited lipids.

· Feedstock flexibility allows operators to switch between corn sugarcane and cellulosic ethanol as markets evolve.

· The finished fuel blends seamlessly at up to fifty percent with conventional Jet A without any engine modification.

· Lifecycle analysis indicates potential carbon savings above seventy percent compared with fossil jet fuel.

A regional ripple effect

A less obvious insight is the strategic location. Southeastern farmers already ship more than one billion bushels of corn annually. By providing a premium local outlet, the plant can stabilise seasonal grain prices and encourage adoption of regenerative cropping that lifts soil health. In turn, rural rail and

trucking networks gain steady high value freight flows, tightening the loop between agriculture and low carbon transport.

Conclusion

Freedom Pines proves that commercial scale ethanol to jet conversion is no longer theory but operating reality. As airlines line up multi year offtake agreements, the Georgia model offers a template cities and states can adapt to attract green investment, strengthen farm incomes and help aviation climb toward net zero.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-4-1.svg,N,,2025-11-18 07:56:45.765569

The oil and gas industry operates through highly complex systems in which upstream, midstream and downstream segments often follow distinct strategies and priorities. Upstream focuses on exploration and production efficiency, midstream prioritises secure and reliable supply routes, while downstream aims to enhance refining performance and reduce environmental impact. Aligning these three sectors towards a single goal — decarbonisation — remains one of the greatest challenges. Reducing emissions across exploration, transportation and refining requires technological innovation as well as cross-sector collaboration and consistent strategic alignment.

For these goals, the Oil & Gas Decarbonisation Congress (DECARBON) 2026 unites global industry leaders from the whole value chain to exchange practical insights and proven approaches that deliver measurable results. Throughout the Congress, companies across upstream, midstream and downstream share their experiences and innovations from P2X technologies and green hydrogen to AI-powered autonomous plants.

In the upstream-focused session, Kuwait Oil Company offers valuable perspectives on integrating energy transition strategies into exploration and production planning. Fayez Al-Mezel, Business Planning Specialist, delivers the presentation about the integration of energy transition into upstream strategies. He addresses key challenges such as capital-cost dispersion, technology readiness and infrastructure constraints. The speaker outlines mitigation measures, including modular pilot projects, standardised designs and verified data management. This approach demonstrates how strategic planning and transparent performance tracking translate decarbonisation ambitions into efficient, cost-competitive outcomes.

In the midstream discussion, LiveEO (Session Sponsor) highlights digital tools that enhance pipeline safety and sustainability. Nick Ferguson, Chief Evangelist, explains that satellite technology elevates pipeline safety. Drawing on a case study, he demonstrates that combining high-resolution satellite imagery with artificial intelligence enables the detection of 73% of previously unidentified threats and improves prediction accuracy by 80%, supporting proactive risk management and streamlined operations.

Kent participates in the dialogue dedicated to downstream decarbonisation, specifically low-carbon fuels and feedstock.

A.D. Banker helps agents navigate client options impacted by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While ACA changed the standard for how individuals apply for health coverage, it also created limitations for underwriting in ACA-compliant applications but ultimately helped make health insurance more accessible to everyone.

As agents assist clients through health insurance applications, it’s important to understand the key differences between ACA and Non-ACA health plans. Having this knowledge not only helps an agent find the right coverage for their clients but also builds trust and partnership.

Even though the ACA made health coverage far more accessible, there are still those that fall outside the ACA’s requirements. These policies are sold outside of the Health Insurance Marketplace and still use medical underwriting to determine eligibility and premiums, which is why A.D. Banker has created a comprehensive overview.

ACA-compliant plans follow the federal regulations established by the ACA. Non-ACA plans, on the other hand, often do not – which can affect everything from coverage and consumer protections to renewability and underwriting.

What Is the ReFuelEU Aviation Mandate?
Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, fuel suppliers serving EU airports must include a minimum share of SAF in their fuel mix.
Looking Ahead The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation officially came into force on 1 January 2024, with many of its key rules taking effect from 2025.
As sustainable aviation fuel takes off, it promises to make the skies cleaner without compromising your travel experience.","Travellers flying across Europe are on the verge of a greener era. The European Union (EU) has introduced a sweeping regulation called ReFuelEU Aviation, aimed at increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This landmark policy will gradually blend SAF into jet fuel, reducing aviation emissions. For people who care about sustainable travel, this means more eco‑friendly flights in the near future.

What Is the ReFuelEU Aviation Mandate?

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, fuel suppliers serving EU airports must include a minimum share of SAF in their fuel mix.

From 2025, at least 2% of the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports must be SAF.

By 2030, this share will rise to 6%, and the goal is to reach 70% SAF by 2050.

There is also a sub‑target for synthetic aviation fuels (sometimes called e‑fuels): starting at 1.2% in 2030, increasing up to 35% by 2050.

These mandates are part of the EU’s broader “Fit for 55” package, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.

Why This Matters for Travelers

Cleaner Flights: As SAF replaces more conventional jet fuel, flights will generate fewer CO₂ emissions over time. This supports a more sustainable aviation sector.

Transparent Environmental Labels: The regulation includes a new eco‑label for flights, helping passengers choose greener flights based on estimated emissions per passenger.

Long-Term Promise: The gradual rise in SAF blending means that within a few decades, a large portion of flights from EU airports could be powered by greener fuel.

What Counts as Sustainable Fuel?

The regulation defines eligible SAF under strict criteria. These include:

Advanced biofuels made from waste or residues (not food crops)

Synthetic aviation fuels made from renewable hydrogen (e-fuels)

Recycled-carbon fuels derived from waste materials, complying with EU sustainability rules.

Importantly, biofuels from food or feed crops (like palm or soy) are not included in the SAF mandate.

Challenges & Early Progress

In 2024, only 0.6% of aviation fuel supplied at EU airports was SAF, according to the first annual technical report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The low uptake is partly due to high production costs: SAF remains more expensive than traditional kerosene.

Some airlines and industry voices warn that supply may not scale fast enough to meet future targets.

Still, the regulation creates a stable policy framework for investment. Fuel suppliers now have clarity, which could accelerate SAF production.

What This Means for Future Travelers

More sustainable choices: As SAF becomes more common, more flights will operate with lower-carbon fuel.

Flight labels you can trust: The eco‑label gives passengers a way to compare the environmental footprint of different flights.

Growing innovation: The SAF push boosts research in synthetic and advanced biofuels — this could eventually lower costs and improve availability.

Long-haul greener travel: As SAF production scales, even long-distance flights could reduce emissions significantly — a welcome prospect for eco‑aware globetrotters.

Looking Ahead

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation officially came into force on 1 January 2024, with many of its key rules taking effect from 2025.

EU member states will designate authorities to enforce the law, collect data, and penalize non-compliance.

At the same time, revenues from any fines will be redirected into SAF research and innovation.

According to EASA’s market report, the SAF used in 2024 came mainly from recycled cooking oil (81%) and animal fats (17%).

Final Word

For global travelers, Europe’s SAF mandate represents more than just an industry policy shift — it’s a signal that the future of flying could be greener, more transparent, and more responsible. As sustainable aviation fuel takes off, it promises to make the skies cleaner without compromising your travel experience.

But even with the Trump administration receptive to the idea and the government again open, most farmers and bankers have concluded that any aid will be too little and too late to rescue the next planting season.

“I’m cash-flowing on what my anticipated yield is based on what I know today,” said Anne Schwagerl, who farms 1,100 acres in Minnesota with her husband and son. “I am not banking on the U.S. government to do it.”

The federal government reopened Wednesday after 43 days, which Trump administration officials had said was necessary before they could finish any farmer aid plan. But even if they work on it expeditiously, it could still take months before farmers receive any checks. That would be well after the crucial winter period when farmers talk to their bankers and make decisions about the next year.

Ms. Schwagerl said the American Relief Act, which was passed in December during the Biden administration, offered an example of how long it could take for funds to reach farmers. Applications for the act’s $30 billion in disaster assistance did not open until July, and Ms. Schwagerl received her payment in September, nearly nine months after the money was authorized.

Administration officials have floated the idea of an aid package, or possibly the first in a series of aid packages, of between $10 billion and $15 billion. Some members of Congress have said much more may be needed, but after a handshake trade agreement last month with China that should restart American soybean sales, the amount that farmers ultimately receive may be revised downward.

“We may need to have a bridge to next year, but how many lanes that bridge has is going to be determined by what the market does between now and then,” Stephen Vaden, the deputy secretary of agriculture, said on the “AgriTalk” radio show last month.

The rising global demand for alternative fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodiesel, and renewable marine fuel, as well as shifting product slates, cost pressures, and the risk of stranded assets are all affecting profitability for European refiners. Additional concerns include Capex cost pressures, volatility in feedstock quality, and the need for digitisation to achieve better asset reliability and energy efficiency. Honeywell UOP has a long history of helping operators meet these challenges, and today it continues to expand its technology offerings to improve product quality and diversity, while also creating modular solutions that allow for faster deployment and scalability.

Regulatory Pressures

Existing refineries often need substantial retrofits for their hydrotreaters, processors, and co-processing units to handle renewable or synthetic feedstocks and produce fuels that meet new standards, while the demand for conventional fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, nears its expected peak.

More than any other region, European refineries are operating in a fast-changing regulatory, economic, and technical environment. Among these, there are key policy frameworks that are raising both the risks and opportunities for operators:

European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

The ETS places a rising cost on CO₂ and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from stationary industrial sources (including refineries). The tightening of allowances, increasing carbon prices, and risk of carbon leakage all put pressure on margins. Refiners must find ways to reduce emissions intensity, both in process (such as fuel gas, steam, and hydrogen usage) and from feedstock, or face high compliance costs.

ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation

Part of the EU’s European Green Deal, known as the Fit for 55 Package, the ReFuelEU Aviation (Regulation (EU) 2023/2405) aims to increase the share of SAF sustainable aviation fuel at EU airports from a minimum of 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050, with an additional sub-target for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) of 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050.

FuelEU Maritime Regulation

Also part of the Fit for 55 Package, the FuelEU Maritime (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805) introduces a requirement for ships above 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports to use fuels with GHG intensity, on a Well-to-Wake (WtW) basis, which is gradually reduced, starting with a small percentage in 2025 and reaching much steeper cuts by 2050. In view of these challenges, maritime fleet operators are seeking alternatives with lower carbon intensity (CI) than conventional heavy fuel oils (HFO) to meet evolving policy requirements in the maritime sector. Failure to comply brings penalties, and fuel suppliers must ensure the availability of low-GHG and synthetic fuels, creating market opportunity for refiners to supply those fuels.

International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net-zero Framework

This year, the IMO committed to net zero GHG emissions from shipping by approximately 2050, requiring interim reductions. New regulatory instruments under discussion include GHG intensity targets, fuel standards, and low or zero-carbon fuel adoption. This puts pressure across global supply chains, including refining and fuel production. Refineries must anticipate demand for lower-CI marine fuels, synthetic fuels, and fuel blends that meet both ship engine requirements and lifecycle emissions criteria.

Ready-Now Technologies

Proven technologies are now available for European refiners, and the Honeywell UOP refining portfolio is continually evolving to help refinery operations transition to sutainable fuels. Worldwide, there are now 58 UOP Ecofining®-powered units in the operating, construction, or planning phases to efficiently convert waste bio-feedstocks into renewable diesel and SAF. This can help reduce GHG emissions relative to fossil fuels by up to 80%.¹

Key players in the refining industry are embracing the transformation. For example, energy leader ENI leveraged Ecofining² as part of a long-term strat­egy to grow its renewable fuels business by converting its Gela refinery in Italy into a biorefinery. With a processing capacity of more than 400,000 MT/year, it is pro­jected to produce almost a third of the expected European SAF demand in 2025.

Solution Pathways

As renewable fuel demand continues to grow, European refiners are exploring additional renewable feedstocks to help meet regulatory requirements, transition to cleaner energy, and reduce operating costs to maintain margins. Honeywell UOP continues to develop new process technologies to help achieve these goals.

Honeywell UOP technologies like Ecofining, Co-processing, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) Unicracking®, UOP eFining® (methanol-to-jet), Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ), and RTP (fast pyrolysis) processes enable the utilisation of a wide variety of feedstock sources for SAF, diesel, and other renewable fuels.

In particular, SAF can be produced with a variety of sustainable feedstocks, including vegetable oils and inedible fats, low carbon intensity alcohols, and even synthesised fuels derived from captured CO₂ and hydrogen (i.e. RFNBO). This represents an opportunity for oil and gas organisations pursuing their own decarbonisation journeys to support the aviation sector with fuels that can significantly reduce the environmental impact of flight.

Policies such as FuelEU Maritime and the IMO Net-Zero Framework also represent a significant opportunity for refiners to meet new alternative fuel demands for maritime fleet operators, who need to begin reducing carbon emissions by the end of the decade. Waste wood and plant residues from agriculture, forestry, and other industries, known as lignocellulosic biomass, represent a promising option for refiners as an abundant and relatively inexpensive renewable fuel feedstock. Solutions like RTP from Honeywell make these feedstocks more accessible to refiners by converting them into liquid intermediates like pyoil.

Honeywell UOP’s next-generation Biocrude Upgrading technology (Figure 1) offers an effective pathway for refiners to access these biomass sources to produce drop-in biomarine fuel, which can significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions from conventional fossil-based engines (Table 1).

Biocrude Upgrading technology also enables the production of SAF and renewable naphtha feed for gasoline production, giving refiners and project developers multiple options to monetise biocrude intermediates derived from lignocellulosic biomass.

Empowering refiners to Meet Compliance Targets

European refiners are navigating a complex landscape shaped by rising global demand for renewable fuels, evolving regulatory frameworks, and mounting cost and operational pressures. With tightening emissions standards under the EU ETS and ambitious mandates from ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, refiners must adapt quickly to avoid stranded assets and remain competitive.",,N,,2025-11-17 14:57:01.173713

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has teamed up with Swiss watch manufacturer Breitling for the creation of a new Breitling watch to mark the arrival and entry into service of the new SWISS Airbus A350. The new Navitimer B01 Chronograph 46 SWISS Limited Edition will be produced in just 350 examples, and will be available exclusively to travelers aboard SWISS long-haul flights from 1 December onwards. The new watch can also be pre-ordered for such flights online – also from 1 December – via Duty Free Shopping at swiss.com. The price: CHF 8,350 (excluding VAT) or 2,338,000 Miles & More miles.

A unique design

Breitling’s Navitimer pilots’ watches have proved highly popular since the company launched its first model back in 1952. The latest in the line has a diameter of 46 millimeters, making it the largest watch that Breitling has ever developed in collaboration with SWISS. The new watch’s dial makes deft use of the color palette of the new ‘SWISS Senses’ cabin product – deep black, warm brown and beige tones and fine burgundy accents – to provide an appealingly contrasting display, while further discreet design features like the aircraft-shaped second hand counterweight and the sapphire glass caseback whose shape is inspired by the Airbus A350’s engines pay subtle homage to both the new SWISS long-haul twinjet and the aviation world.

The back of the watch is engraved with the SWISS logo and the remark ‘One of 350’, to confirm the model’s limited-edition nature. A personal note will also be provided for the new watch’s owners by an accompanying certificate of authenticity which will be signed by the SWISS captain commanding the flight on which the watch is purchased.

“In a world in which every second often seems to count on the ground and in the air, this watch is an embodiment of constancy, craftsmanship and genuine exclusivity,” says SWISS Chief Commercial Officer Heike Birlenbach. “I am delighted that we will be offering our inflight guests this special timepiece to mark the introduction of the SWISS Airbus A350. Our new long-haul twinjet is a masterpiece of precision, quality and reliability – values that are crucial not just in aviation but also in the watchmaker’s craft. So our collaboration with Breitling and on their new Navitimer bridges two worlds with multiple commonalities.”

“Our partnership with SWISS has been underpinned by our shared values – our Swiss roots, our excellence and our pioneering spirit – for several years now,” adds Breitling Chief Marketing Officer Jancu Koenig. “The Navitimer has been an icon of the aviation world for more than 70 years. And with this new SWISS Limited Edition we’re continuing this tradition and interpreting it anew for the next air travel era.”

- BGN joins International Air Transport Association (IATA) as strategic partner, to drive SAF adoption forward

HOUSTON, Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BGN INT US LLC (""BGN""), an independent global energy and commodities group and a market leader in transition fuels has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF""), a Nasdaq-listed leader in advancing the decarbonization of the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""),. This planned partnership, based in Houston, will focus on developing and scaling the production, distribution and logistics of SAF and other renewable fuels including renewable naphtha and diesel.

Under the MOU, XCF and BGN intend to collaborate on renewable fuel production, marketing, and distribution for major airline carriers around the world. The framework agreement includes offtake and co-branded distribution agreements, as well as joint development of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the proposed strategic partnership seeks to promote the use of XCF's SAF within industry trade associations and OEM networks, and throughout the customer value chain.

""We are pleased to be partnering with Houston-based XCF in this exciting venture,"" said Cenan Ozmeral, President of BGN Int., LLC, based in Houston. ""BGN and XCF share a common goal to expand access to renewable fuels and accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Together, we aim to combine XCF's scalable production model with BGN's marketing and distribution network to create a seamless, efficient supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

""BGN's trading strength, risk management expertise, and integrated logistics network, will make SAF adoption practical and commercially viable for airlines seeking to meet tightening decarbonization targets. This is a major step, which we believe will have a significant impact on the aviation industry's ability to reduce emissions, in one of the hardest-to-abate transport sectors.""

Aligned with this partnership, BGN has joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the leading global trade association for the airline industry, deepening its ties with the sector and demonstrating its long-term commitment to being a top-tier supplier of SAF and renewable fuels.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""This collaboration represents a critical step in expanding the global reach of renewable fuels. Partnering with BGN would enable us to extend our footprint, streamline logistics, and accelerate commercialization on a global scale with a world-class partner, as we prepare to meet surging demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

""This MOU reflects a shared vision to advance a scalable, commercially viable framework for global renewable fuel production and distribution.""

The collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to building a robust global supply chain at a time when demand for SAF is expanding rapidly. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero emission targets. Meeting this demand would require the construction of up to 7,000 new facilities worldwide.

This MOU is non-binding, and execution remains subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

“With our hydrogen recycling systems, we make an important contribution to the circular economy in industrial processes,” said Michael Höfling, CEO of ReiCat.
“Projects like this demonstrate that hydrogen recycling is an indispensable complement to power-to-X,” added Höfling.
Speaking to gasworld earlier this year, ReiCat COO Sophia Höfling made the case for its hydrogen purification and recycling tech.
“Our recycling systems let companies recover up to 98% of their process gas, which is not used up but only contaminated in the process, cutting costs and emissions.”","German gas treatment specialist ReiCat has supplied its hydrogen recycling system to flavour and fragrance manufacturer Symrise.

The tech will enable the firm to clean up hydrogen that has picked up impurities during the production of ingredients for perfumes and nutritional and taste enhancers.

The system works by capturing the exhaust stream and purifying it in a complex multi-stage process before the hydrogen is cycled back into production.

“With our hydrogen recycling systems, we make an important contribution to the circular economy in industrial processes,” said Michael Höfling, CEO of ReiCat.

Symrise purchased its first system from ReiCat in 2017 to decarbonise its US site. The latest deal will see the tech installed at its facility in Granada, Spain.

“Projects like this demonstrate that hydrogen recycling is an indispensable complement to power-to-X,” added Höfling.

The Symrise Group plans to become entirely greenhouse gas neutral by 2045. Around 80% of its emissions are created during the production and transport of its substances.

This includes scent compositions for perfumes and colognes and taste and nutrition solutions for sauces, ready-made meals, and instant noodles.

In a 2024 corporate report, the company outlined plans to replace natural gas in its exhaust air incinerators with hydrogen once the infrastructure is available. It plans to use carbon capture and storage to reduce any emissions that cannot be avoided.

Speaking to gasworld earlier this year, ReiCat COO Sophia Höfling made the case for its hydrogen purification and recycling tech. “A gas might leave the plant at high purity, but by the time it reaches the end-user it could be contaminated in various ways,” she said.

The deal was announced during the Dubai Airshow 2025 and marks a significant step in flydubai’s upcoming move into long-haul operations.

The engine order supports flydubai’s broader growth strategy as the airline diversifies beyond its current all-737 fleet. Established in 2008, the Dubai-based carrier has expanded rapidly to serve more than 135 destinations across 57 countries, and is now preparing to add long-haul routes to its network.

GE’s GEnx-1B was selected for its strong track record in performance, durability, and fuel efficiency—key traits for carriers operating in the Gulf’s demanding hot-and-harsh environments.

More than two-thirds of 787s in service today are powered by GEnx engines, which have collectively logged over 62 million flight hours since entering service in 2011. Like all GE commercial engines, they are certified to operate on approved sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends.

Leadership Comments

Ghaith Al Ghaith, flydubai CEO, said the new engine deal reinforces the carrier’s long-term vision: “The performance and durability of our engines play an integral role in the success of our operations and expansion plans, especially as we prepare to welcome the Boeing 787 to our fleet. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with GE Aerospace as we embark on the next chapter of growth.”

Russell Stokes, President and CEO of Commercial Engines and Services at GE Aerospace, added: “We are honored by flydubai’s trust in GE Aerospace technology as the airline enters its next phase of growth. The GEnx engines will deliver the reliability and efficiency needed to power flydubai’s first widebody fleet.”

Expanding the Partnership

flydubai’s original order for 30 Dreamliners was placed at the 2023 Dubai Airshow, marking the airline’s first step into widebody operations after more than a decade of exclusively flying narrowbody Boeing jets. The arrival of the 787-9s will enable new long-haul destinations and additional capacity on high-demand markets.

Partnership seeks to tackle barriers to sustainable and equitable solutions, working towards the realization of the Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism and paving the way to a long-term offtake agreement for SAF

MoU represents a best-practice model for cross-border climate collaboration, in line with COP30 objectives and UNFCCC Principles.

Abra Group and Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil (Sumitomo), a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accelerate the identification of industry solutions for decarbonization in the air transport sector.

Under the MoU, Abra – engaged in Brazil via its subsidiary Gol Linhas Aéreas – and Sumitomo will jointly engage with stakeholders, including both the Brazilian and Japanese governments, for the realization of a Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. This will then pave the way for a long-term offtake agreement of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) between Abra and Sumitomo.

Global demand for SAF is expected to reach 400 million tons by 2050, with demand from developed economies with limited feedstock availability, such as Japan, Singapore, and the European Union, placing increasing pressure on the aviation industry to decarbonize. Brazil is well positioned to become a leading global SAF producer, supported by abundant feedstocks, a longstanding ethanol and biodiesel tradition and a strong commitment to renewable energy. However, securing financing for SAF projects – and ensuring Brazilians continued access to essential, affordable, aviation – remain key challenges. The JCM has the potential to bridge these gaps. JCM is Japan’s bilateral carbon offset scheme initiated in 2011, and allows Japan to collaborate with developing economies to accelerate emissions-reduction projects abroad while receiving a proportion of the resulting carbon credits to support its national climate targets.

The combined approach of Abra and Sumitomo provides mutual benefits, while also delivering direct advantages to the Brazilian and Japanese governments, SAF producers in Brazil, domestic airlines and airline customers from both countries.

Mr President,

Congratulations on your election as President of this Conference. I thank the Brazil Government, the City of Belem, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising COP30 this year. I also thank your team, Mr President, and the Brazilian Presidency, for your leadership in advancing discussions, and placing the focus of COP30 on the implementation of our global climate agenda.

Climate change continues to outpace the collective response of the global community. 2024 was the warmest year on record, and the first year to be more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial era. Ocean temperatures have soared to historic heights, and the biggest and most intense coral bleaching episode ever witnessed has spread to more than 80% of the world’s reefs, leading scientists to conclude that the world’s tropical coral reefs have almost certainly crossed a point of no return. This means that Earth has likely reached its first so-called “tipping point”. Storms, floods, heatwaves, and droughts are also becoming more frequent and more intense.

Overlaying this is a backdrop of intensifying geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Multilateral cooperation is being put to the test, and the Brazilian Presidency has responded with a call to collective action – the Global Mutirão. This call captures the spirit we need: many actors, working together, focused on real outcomes. Today, Singapore reaffirms our commitment to working with the global community to make collective progress towards our shared climate goals.

Mitigation Efforts

As a small low-lying island state, climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. This is why we were one of thirteen countries who submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by the 10 February 2025 deadline. Our 2035 NDC pledged to reduce our emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035. The 45 million tonnes target puts us on a linear trajectory to net zero in 2050.

Our 2035 NDC reflects our commitment to climate action. Given our circumstance as an alternative-energy disadvantaged island state, our ability to meet these goals depends on the maturity of mitigation technologies, and effective international collaboration.

Despite our limited land area, we have been pushing hard on solar, which remains our most viable domestic source of renewable energy. We have deployed more than 1.7 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar to date, quadrupling our solar deployment from 2020. We are on track to meet our target of at least 2GWp of solar deployment by 2030.

To further diversify our low-carbon energy mix, we are establishing a regulatory sandbox to explore biomethane as a low-carbon fuel. In September 2025, the Singapore Economic Development Board issued a closed call for proposals to demonstrate biomethane’s potential for power generation and industrial applications. We are also exploring the potential deployment of nuclear energy.

Singapore is also actively looking to import low-carbon electricity from our region. Last month, Singapore granted conditional approval to import 1GW of low-carbon electricity generated from hydropower from Sarawak, Malaysia. This brings us to about 8GW of potential cross-border electricity trading projects from our region, including from Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Australia.

Beyond power imports, Singapore is advancing the use of low-carbon fuels in the maritime and aviation – sectors central to our role as a global hub. Singapore is exploring methanol and ammonia as low-carbon fuels for the maritime sector. Our Energy Market Authority and Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) appointed a consortium led by Keppel Ltd to work on an end-to-end low-carbon ammonia solution on Jurong Island. If successful, Singapore will be one of the first countries in the world to directly combust ammonia for power generation and deploy ammonia bunkering for international shipping.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable, stable supply for Singapore and the region. From 1 Jan 2026, flights departing from Singapore will be required to use at least 1% of sustainable aviation fuel. Last month, CAAS announced that the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) has been formed to support the implementation of Singapore’s national sustainable aviation fuel policy.

Adaptation and Resilience Efforts

While we continue to advance mitigation and decarbonisation, Singapore is equally focused on stepping up our adaptation and resilience efforts. Over the next five years, we will develop Singapore’s inaugural National Adaptation Plan to address the physical risks and other impacts of climate change.

Coastal Resilience

30% of Singapore’s land is less than 5m above mean sea level. We are vulnerable to the impact of sea level rise, and have made plans to implement various coastal protection measures progressively over the coming decades. Our national water agency, PUB, completed the first coastal protection site study for the eastern coast of the City. The recommendations from the study, together with the reclamation of ‘Long Island’ – an offshore new island entirely reclaimed from the sea that will protect the entire East Coast area – will form a continuous line of defence to protect City-East Coast against rising sea levels.

The Government will also introduce a Coastal Protection Bill next year, to spell out the responsibilities of stakeholders involved in Coastal Protection, and to provide powers for enforcement and compliance with coastal protection standards. PUB will also launch a code of practice for coastal protection by the first half of 2026 to set standards for the design, construction and operation of coastal protection structures in Singapore.

Heat Resilience

Singapore’s Third National Climate Change Study projects that in the worst case scenario, by the end of this century annual average temperatures in Singapore could rise by up to 5°C, with a sharp increase in days experiencing high heat stress. As such, we are taking proactive steps to strengthen our resilience to heat.

Last year, the Government implemented a revised framework to protect outdoor workers from heat stress, aligning workplace safety measures with the three-tier national Heat Stress Advisory. This framework requires practical safeguards such as regular hydration, rest breaks in shaded areas, and heat acclimatisation, with enforcement through workplace inspections.

This year, Singapore launched a National Heatwave Response Plan, which sets out a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to manage extreme heat events and protect residents, particularly vulnerable groups. While Singapore has not yet experienced heatwaves of the intensity seen in other parts of the world, we are preparing early to manage these risks. Measures like these will ensure that Singapore remains ready to manage the impacts of a warming climate while safeguarding health and livelihoods.

Regional Cooperation

While we continue to push the limits of our domestic efforts, we recognise that our climate goals cannot be achieved in isolation. Southeast Asia is warming faster than the global average, with coastal cities and delta communities facing increasing flood and heat risks. Building regional resilience is therefore critical.

To this end, Singapore is working closely with our neighbours to deepen regional climate science and improve adaptation planning. Researchers from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Tropical Marine Science Institute are working with other ASEAN countries to study the impact of climate change on the region’s agriculture sector. The study will analyse data on the projected physical impacts of climate change on five agriculture crops: maize, rice, cassava, sugar cane and soya bean, and propose mitigating measures that ASEAN nations can take to address the impact of climate change on the five crops.

In January this year, The Heat Resilience & Performance Centre at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore was officially designated as the Global Heat Health Information Network Southeast Asia Hub, a recognition that underscores its leading role in advancing heat resilience. This designation highlights the Centre’s expertise in addressing the growing challenges of heat-related health risks in the region. With this appointment, the Centre will play a pivotal role in working with the region to shape strategies, research, and policies aimed at mitigating the impact of extreme heat on public health, demonstrating its commitment to building resilience in the face of climate change.

Singapore is also working closely with our partners to realise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG). By interconnecting national grids, the APG will enable low-carbon electricity to flow across borders, balance supply and demand, improve energy security, and advance a shared pathway toward net zero for Southeast Asia.

Last month, ASEAN Energy Ministers endorsed the ASEAN Submarine Power Cables Development Framework Terms of Reference (TOR). When finalised, the framework will support the conduct of subsea route surveys as well as the laying, maintenance, and protection of submarine power cables in Southeast Asia, all of which are crucial to realise the APG. We also welcome initiatives, such as the APG Financing Initiative co-developed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to lower financing hurdles and enhance the bankability of cross-border electricity trading projects in the region.

To complement these efforts, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Regional Cooperation Centre in Singapore, which celebrated its first anniversary this October, was established to deepen the IEA’s engagement in the region. Within its first year, the Centre has published numerous reports on clean energy technologies and strengthened its regional partnerships to advance energy transitions. Singapore and the IEA also co-hosted the 9th edition of the Singapore–IEA Regional Training Programme, which brought together more than 200 policymakers and industry leaders from the region to deepen exchanges on cross-border power trading and subsea interconnections.

Singapore has also been engaging our regional partners on technologies that will enable deep decarbonisation. One example is our efforts on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Earlier this year, Singapore signed MoUs with Malaysia and Indonesia on CCS. We are now working towards legally binding bilateral agreements to enable the cross-border transport and storage of carbon dioxide between our countries. Advancing the safe, scalable deployment of CCS solutions will serve as a key pathway for Singapore's hard-to-abate sectors.

Additionally, this year, CAAS launched the Asia-Pacific Sustainable Aviation Centre, to conduct sustainable aviation in the Asia-Pacific region in a pragmatic way that would achieve both development and sustainability goals. It will do so through policy research in areas such as cleaner aviation fuels, carbon accounting, and carbon market development, as well as facilitate collaboration across governments, industry and academia for joint studies and projects to advance sustainable aviation policies and plans for the Asia-Pacific region. The Centre will also support regional capability-building through technical assistance and training in areas of sustainable aviation policy development and implementation.

International Contributions

These regional partnerships demonstrate what multilateral collaboration can achieve. To bring them to scale and deliver real impact, Singapore places great emphasis on the next enabler of implementation – finance. The Baku-to-Belem Roadmap to 1.3 trillion recognises the urgent need to close the global climate finance gap. However, current finance flows fall far short of what is required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

As a trusted global financial hub, Singapore is doing its part voluntarily to help fill this gap. Our contributions focus on three pillars: capacity building, mobilising blended finance, and strengthening carbon markets.

Capacity Building

Strengthening institutional and technical capabilities is essential to achieving our global climate goals. That is why Singapore supports efforts to build institutional and technical capabilities, including through our contribution to the UNFCCC non-core budget to be earmarked towards the UNFCCC’s proposal for “Supporting Developing Countries in Implementing the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)”. By strengthening the implementation of the ETF across countries, we help to ensure accountability as developing countries strive to deliver positive climate outcomes. Only when all countries have the systems and capacity to act can global climate finance deliver, and keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.

Blended Finance

Two years ago, at COP28, Singapore Government announced Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P). FAST-P is a blended finance initiative which brings together international public, private and philanthropic partners to support Asia’s green and transition financing needs, and aims to raise US$5 billion. Last year, at COP29, the Singapore Government pledged up to US$500 million concessional capital to match dollar-for-dollar, concessional capital from other partners.

This year, Singapore has made further progress with FAST-P. The Green Investments Partnership has achieved its first closure of projects with US$510 million of committed capital. The capital will be deployed to support green and sustainable infrastructure projects in Southeast and South Asia across a strong pipeline of transactions. The pipeline of projects includes renewable energy and storage, electric vehicles, and water and waste management.

Carbon Markets

Another way in which Singapore aims to direct financing towards climate action is through carbon markets. Carbon markets are a potentially transformational pathway to mobilise private capital to unlock additional emissions reductions while simultaneously funding host countries’ economic development and decarbonisation efforts, as well as unlocking other sustainable development benefits. Singapore takes an ecosystem approach to carbon markets. We are working to boost demand-side confidence, unlock high-integrity supply, and develop the enablers for a high-quality carbon market.

To bolster demand, Singapore is exploring the development of energy transition credits as a novel carbon credit type and financing instrument for the phasing out of coal as a fuel source in Asia. These credits are generated from the emissions reductions attributed to the early retirement of coal plants and their replacement with cleaner energy sources. At COP 28, we convened the Transition Credits Coalition, or TRACTION, comprising over 30 global ecosystem players to identify system-wide barriers and solutions for energy transition credits to be utilised as a credible financing instrument to support the managed and equitable early retirement of coal plants. TRACTION has just released its final report at COP30, outlining practical solutions and identifying key areas for further action to help the industry operationalise and scale the use of energy transition credits.

In parallel, Singapore continues to prioritise nature-based solutions as a vital mitigation and finance pathway. In September this year, we committed to procuring 2.175 million tonnes of Article 6-aligned nature-based carbon credits from four projects in Ghana, Paraguay and Peru at an approximate value of S$76 million or US$58 million. These projects aim to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation, increase carbon sequestration of soil organic carbon stock in grasslands through sustainable management practices, and remove carbon emissions through the reforestation of degraded pastureland.

A well-functioning global carbon market requires more than just compliance credits. Therefore, Singapore is also working to strengthen demand in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). In June this year, the Governments of Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom announced the creation of The Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, a government-led initiative to strengthen voluntary demand for carbon credits. The Coalition comprises ten governments committed to advancing climate action through making clear how businesses can credibly use high-integrity carbon credits in addition to their corporate decarbonisation plans.1 Earlier this month, in São Paulo, the Coalition launched a set of Shared Principles on the voluntary use of high-integrity carbon credits by corporates, responding to calls from businesses for more cohesion and transparency, and stronger, clearer incentives to engage with carbon markets. The Shared Principles will give businesses the confidence they need to invest in carbon markets to support projects relating to sustainable agriculture, clean energy, as well as nature conservation and restoration.

At Singapore International Energy Week in October this year, we also published a VCM guidance to guide Singapore-based companies in their usage of carbon credits as part of a credible decarbonisation plan. This set of guidelines for Singapore-based companies go hand in hand with the Shared Principles. To demonstrate application of the key principles outlined within the VCM guidance, our government agency EnterpriseSG is in discussions with leading corporates in Asia to establish an industry-led buyers’ coalition to align and channel demand towards high-integrity carbon credits in the region and beyond.

To unlock high-integrity supply, Singapore has made international cooperation on Article 6 carbon credits a key focal point. This year, we signed Implementation Agreements (IAs) with eight additional countries – namely, Bhutan, Peru, Chile, Rwanda, Paraguay, Thailand, Vietnam and Mongolia. This brings the total number of IAs Singapore has signed to 10. We continue to work with the host countries to operationalise the IAs, with our latest call for applications being for the Singapore-Peru IA. We look forward to deepening collaboration with these partner countries to mobilise investment in high-quality, high-integrity carbon projects.

In addition to growing demand and supply, Singapore invests in enablers that will underpin a well-functioning carbon market. We are growing a carbon services and trading ecosystem to service and support global carbon markets. To-date, over 150 carbon services and trading firms have established a presence in Singapore. Most recently, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) expanded its global presence through the launch of its Asia Pacific Hub in Singapore, signalling confidence in our growing position as a trusted carbon services hub. As a global meta standard, ICVCM plays a vital role in strengthening integrity in carbon credits through their Core Carbon Principles, and helping scale the supply of high-quality carbon credits globally.

To strengthen the capacity of financial institutions to play a key enabling role in the carbon market value chain the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has introduced a Financial Sector Carbon Market Development Grant, amounting to S$15 million or US$11.5 million over three years till 2028. This will help support financial institutions to build capabilities for carbon-project financing, trading, insurance and related services; and help defray upfront costs associated with transaction structuring, financing, risk management, and trading of carbon credits.

Conclusion

To conclude, Singapore reaffirms our full support for the COP30 Presidency and the UNFCCC. A decade has passed since the global community adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015. Its vision remains as relevant as ever, but its promises can only be kept if we commit to collaborate and make collective progress towards our climate goals. As an ‘Implementation COP’, COP 30 must enable Parties to turn their commitments into concrete results. Singapore stands ready to work with all Parties to ensure that our collective efforts keep global climate targets within reach.",https://www.nccs.gov.sg/,N,,2025-11-17 10:58:13.912672

Strategic partnership between XCF Global and BGN to jointly develop global distribution and logistics infrastructure for SAF and other renewable fuels

Seeks to expand XCF's international reach into key markets including Europe and the Middle East through production, offtake, and co-branded distribution agreements

Advances global renewable fuel supply chains to meet rapidly rising demand for SAF

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a leader in advancing the decarbonization of the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding(""MOU"") with BGN INT US LLC (""BGN""), a global renewable fuels trading, marketing, and distribution company, to explore developing a global distribution and logistics partnership for SAF, renewable diesel (""RD""), and renewable naphtha (""RN"") (together, ""renewable fuel"").

Under the MOU, XCF and BGN intend to evaluate opportunities to collaborate on renewable fuel production, marketing, and distribution across multiple regions around the world, including Europe and the Middle East. The proposed framework includes offtake and co-branded distribution agreements, as well as joint development of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the proposed strategic partnership seeks to promote the use of XCF's SAF within industry trade associations and OEM networks, and throughout the customer value chain.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""This collaboration represents a critical step in expanding the global reach of renewable fuels. Partnering with BGN would enable us to extend our footprint, streamline logistics, and accelerate commercialization on a global scale with a world-class partner, as we prepare to meet surging demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

""This MOU reflects a shared vision to advance a scalable, commercially viable framework for global renewable fuel production and distribution.""

Cenan Ozmeral, President of BGN Int. US, LLC added:

""We are pleased to be partnering with US based XCF in this exciting venture. BGN and XCF share a common goal to expand access to renewable fuels and accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Together, we aim to combine XCF's scalable production model with BGN's marketing and distribution network to create a seamless, efficient supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

""BGN's trading strength, risk management expertise, and integrated logistics network, will make SAF adoption practical and commercially viable for airlines seeking to meet tightening decarbonization targets. This is a major step, which we believe will have a significant impact on the aviation industry's ability to reduce emissions, in one of the hardest-to-abate transport sectors.""

The collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to building a robust global supply chain at a time when demand for SAF is expanding rapidly. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero emission targets. Meeting this demand would require the construction of up to 7,000 new facilities worldwide. Analysts project that the global SAF market could exceed $25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050, underscoring one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition.

This MOU is non-binding, and execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Not for the technology – for the financing structures.

#Aviation is proving what every hard‑to‑abate sector soon learns: 
 
""Decarbonisation isn’t constrained by chemistry, it’s unlocked by finance.""

The SAF market has had to build an entire commercial architecture from scratch; Forging off-take agreements with #airlines, production incentives through mandates and credits, and shared technology risk between developers, investors, and end‑users. 

These mechanisms are now maturing into a #playbook for capital deployment in other carbon‑intensive sectors.

What’s remarkable is that aviation’s first‑mover status is de‑risking the path to net zero far beyond its own boundaries. The financing lessons emerging from #SAF are directly relevant to green hydrogen, #low‑carbon shipping fuels, and even carbon‑neutral steel production.

The Freedom Pines site is expected to produce at least 10 million gallons of ATJ aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually. SAF is designed as a drop-in fuel and to reduce the carbon footprint of jet emissions by 70%.

“This is an important milestone for LanzaJet and our investors, and it's a major win for global aviation – perhaps serving as a beacon of hope for the future,” Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said in a statement. “Our story at LanzaJet is one of impact – building a new industry, creating value, and delivering on our commitments regardless of obstacles in our way. We're now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.""

The technology is designed to work with a broad range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon, to deliver lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions as compared to conventional jet fuel. Upon blending with Jet A-1 fuel, a fully certified solution compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure is formed.

Freedom Pines is one of LanzaJet’s planned SAF production sites globally. The company recently contracted American firm Fluor Corp. to handle front-end engineering and design for its future SAF production hub in North Yorkshire, England.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/11/691b24d71c9b14b0b08d66d8-lanzajet.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-11-17 10:58:33.720218

From 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) charge for travellers departing the country.

The SAF levy will apply to all tickets or services sold from 1 April 2026, including cargo shipments and business flights.

Charges will vary based on the distance travelled by an air passenger and the cabin of travel, and will be categorised by four geographical bands.

Group one includes Southeast Asia; group two comprises Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea; Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand are in group three and group four includes the Americas.

For example, economy class passengers will pay S$1 (58 pence) for flights to Bangkok, S$2.80 (£1.65) for journeys to Tokyo, S$6.40 (£3.75) for flights to London and S$10.40 (£6) to New York.

Prices will be shown by airlines as a “distinct line item” on the air ticket sold.

The levy will not apply to passengers who are only transiting through Singapore.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a goal of net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050. Singapore said it is “committed to working towards that goal and will do so in a practical manner.”

Mr Han Kok Juan, director general of CAAS, said: “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.

“We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust”.

The news comes as a £500 levy for business travellers was proposed at Cop30, the climate summit, last week.

The governments of France, Spain and Kenya demanded “a special focus on premium flyers” with the proceeds of a levy going to “resilient investments and fair transitions”.

But the International Air Transport Association dismissed the idea from the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force as “crazy”.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/17/10/22/iStock-1766337179.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-17 10:58:38.188289

“If Germany wants to become greener in transport, it has to set the correct scene to allow for additional investment,” a third source told Fastmarkets.
Unclear policy guidance and delays in RED III transitioning to become national law could increase import flows of advanced biofuels from third countries, raising concerns about its legitimacy and creating competition within the German market, other sources said.
“Some countries are implementing [RED III] next year, while others are not and that affects us quite a lot,” he said.
But any delays next door in Belgium could hinder progress in the Netherlands because implementation would give the Belgians an “unfair competition advantage,” sources said.","Biofuel feedstocks traders have reported lower-than-usual trade over the past few weeks, with market participants holding off from actively trading first-quarter 2026 positions in the expectation of long-awaited clarity on policy changes. And Fastmarkets understands that biodiesel activity in Germany has also been quiet, given the uncertainty.

“It’s getting ridiculous,” a source based in Europe said. “The EU countries had so much time to implement RED III and now, when it is due on January 1, they keep delaying the final decisions, making trade nearly impossible.”

The original deadline for the implementation of RED III, which sets a target for Europe to increase the share of renewable energy in its overall energy mix to at least 42.5% by 2030, was set at the EU level and passed on May 21 this year. However, no member state met this deadline, and some then set out to implement by January 1, 2026.

“The timeframe to reach the January 1 implementation date is getting smaller and smaller,” a second source told Fastmarkets. “And the plan seems to be that it will be agreed early next year, with most of the regulations implemented retroactively.”

The source acknowledged that while not everything could be backdated if implementation was further delayed – pointing to the exclusion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and witness audits, neither of which will become valid until 2027 – “all the other regulations, especially the ban on [feedstock] double counting, could be introduced retroactively.”

Other market participants raised concerns about the prospect that RED III implementation could be delayed for another year, because the German market, which is a major biofuel-producing hub, would then remain in the same “poor condition” for longer.

“If Germany wants to become greener in transport, it has to set the correct scene to allow for additional investment,” a third source told Fastmarkets.

Unclear policy guidance and delays in RED III transitioning to become national law could increase import flows of advanced biofuels from third countries, raising concerns about its legitimacy and creating competition within the German market, other sources said.

“The option of double-counting advanced biofuels must be eliminated as quickly as possible, as proposed in the draft legislation. It is precisely this option that incentivizes fraudulent activity,” according to German waste biofuels association MVaK.

MVaK has consistently said the fraud prevention measures, which are part of the draft legislation and focus on the import of advanced biofuels, must be implemented as soon as possible, because “market participants must know immediately what obligations they have to fulfil under the greenhouse gas reduction quota in 2026 and what options are available to them.”

Calls for swift action

Earlier this week, Torsten Krawczyk, the chairman of the German Union for the Promotion of Oil and Protein Crops (UFOP), expressed concerns about the delays to RED III implementation and called for swift action, describing the delay in inter-ministerial coordination as “incomprehensible and irresponsible.”

UFOP has called on the German parliament and the second chamber for immediate action on sustainable certification for imported biofuels, feedstock use regulation, including catch crops and the cultivation of degraded land, as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

At a recent industry event in Sweden, Fastmarkets found a widespread lack of clarity about progress on the implementation of RED III and a biodiesel and feedstocks industry shrouded in uncertainty after the recent collapse of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) talks.

Joachim Elm, a feedstocks trader at Swedish energy firm ST1, which produces hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and SAF, said last month that a lack of clarity was problematic. “Some countries are implementing [RED III] next year, while others are not and that affects us quite a lot,” he said. “How do you supply feedstock in an uncertain and unsure regulatory environment? How do you know what type of feedstock you need to buy and if you can form partnerships or if you need to go to the spot market?”

In late July, the European Commission announced that it would take action against 26 member states for failing to communicate the measures they had adopted to implement the latest iteration of RED III.

While several member states have taken steps toward introducing the transport element of the directive, legislation implementing the whole framework remains limited, with many countries not yet even providing a definitive timeframe for the full adoption of RED III.

In the Netherlands, a debate on RED III and vote in the Senate are expected in early December, once the state secretary responds to questions from the Senate, making the Netherlands’ original target for transposition of January 1 as still achievable, Fastmarkets understands.

However, costs are generally higher compared with the fossil fuel status quo and delivering to early adopters isn't always straightforward. Therefore, creative market mechanisms are needed, unlocking green technologies for buyers across a wide range of sectors and geographies.

Renewable energy certificates

Renewable energy can provide the blueprint. While as of today, wind and solar technologies can be cheaper than fossil fuels on a $/MWh basis, cost reductions were only enabled by widespread deployment. This scale up was driven by Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) markets, which accounted for the ""green premium"" associated with low-carbon renewables. When RECs are sold, what's transferred is not the electricity produced but the attributes that make it clean energy. When companies buy RECs, they provide financial support for the renewable energy projects that produce them, boosting the business case.

According to IDTechEx's ""Sustainability for Data Centers"" report, some of the world's largest companies - including Amazon and Apple - already voluntarily purchase large amounts of renewable power attributes each year. But renewable electricity is only part of the battle when it comes to combatting the climate crisis. What about technologies that can address legacy emissions or non-power related CO2 sources?

Carbon credits for carbon dioxide removal

Reaching global net-zero by 2050 targets will require large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) beyond the planet's natural sinks to tackle residual emissions. For the highest quality, durable, carbon dioxide removals, voluntary corporate purchasers have again enabled green market creation. In the form of carbon credits, carbon dioxide removal offers a pathway to address scope 3 supply chain emissions and even achieve carbon negativity. This market has grown rapidly. In 2022, fewer than a million tonnes of credits were sold, but in 2025 a single deal can easily exceed 5 million tonnes. Microsoft has been an indisputably powerful driving force here, accounting for 80% of all durable carbon dioxide removal credit purchases.

Many carbon dioxide removal technologies have been monetized in the form of carbon credits, including direct air capture, enhanced rock weathering, and biochar. According to IDTechEx's carbon dioxide removal forecasting, over 100 million tonnes of durable, engineered carbon dioxide removal per year could be delivered by 2035.

Currently, most deals in the carbon dioxide removal space are pre-purchases. Instead of making an equity investment, these pre-purchasers are committing to buy a product early to bring it to market faster, despite the current high cost. This illustrates clear demand and creates market signals, spurring investment into first-of-a-kind CDR demonstration projects.

Environmental attributes certificates for green cement

Cement accounts for 8% of global CO2 emissions. Decarbonization of cement will require more than just electrification, due to underlying process CO2 emissions associated with limestone. There are many innovative solutions being developed, as analyzed in IDTechEx's ""Decarbonization of Cement 2025-2035"" research. These include new raw materials, new cement chemistries, and new cement production processes.

Driving factors such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the desire for greener data centers as AI booms are sparking commercial scale up for innovative green cement players. For example, in 2025 Microsoft announced it has signed an agreement with Sublime Systems (an electrochemical cement start-up) to buy up to 623,000 tonnes of low-carbon cement from Sublime's future facilities. One of the challenges faced by nascent green cement developers is that early offtakers won't always be physically located near pilot and demonstration facilities. To address this, the Microsoft-Sublime deal gives Microsoft not only the option to physically deploy cement when geographically possible, but Microsoft will also be able to purchase the environmental attribute certificates (EACs) of Sublime cement separately.

This chain of custody model, known as 'book and claim', learns key lessons from renewable energy markets and decouples the low carbon intensity of the cement from the physical unit. Alexis Olans Haass, Managing Director of EU Market Development, reported to IDTechEx that EACs ""ensure demand can materialize"", enabling flexibility for offtakers, and allowing green cement projects to come online that ""otherwise wouldn't have been built"".

The book and claim model is not limited to cement. Other decarbonization areas benefitting from this model include sustainable aviation fuel and green steel. Sublime Systems is hopeful that the groundwork built with Microsoft could lead to ""cross-pollination across industries that can benefit all.""

Outlook

Many technologies required for global decarbonization already exist. The challenge lies in how to open green markets to early adopters, laying the foundation for widespread uptake. From the scale-up of wind and solar over the past 50 years, the value of decoupling environmental benefits form physical geography is clear. CDR carbon credit markets have demonstrated how rapidly green markets can be scaled up through advanced market commitments and demand signals. While carbon credit and REC markets have not been free from controversy, new green markets focused on measurability and additionality can accelerate climate action globally.",https://idtxs3.imgix.net/si/50000/0C/00.png?w=1200&h=627&fit=fill&bg=ffffff&border=0,N,,2025-11-17 11:56:45.531515

“This joint initiative represents an important step towards global climate alignment, connecting Japan’s commitment to decarbonisation with Brazil’s unique capacity for SAF production and its need for affordable aviation connectivity.

Takamasa Ueda, senior director and head of energy innovation initiative, Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil, said: “In order to unlock and accelerate the development of SAF capacity globally, it is essential to take a creative approach to overcome the key challenges facing this emerging industry.

“Sumitomo is actively engaged in SAF market development worldwide, and strongly believes that Brazil, with its abundant feedstock resources, has tremendous potential to become a major SAF supply hub for the global market.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Abra-and-Sumitomo-pic-Biofuel-17-11-29422817-768x768.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:56:21.820783

US West Coast jet fuel production has been curtailed since October, after a fire at Chevron's 285,000 barrel-per-day El Segundo refinery in southern California forced the company to take multiple units offline.

About 60,000 metric tons (472,800 barrels) of the aviation fuel was loaded on Panamax tanker Hafnia Kallang between October 28 and 29 from the Jamnagar port, according to data from Kpler, LSEG and four trade sources.

Castleton Commodities chartered the ship, which is expected to arrive in Los Angeles in the first half of December, multiple shipbrokers said.

All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Castleton did not respond to requests for comment.

Chevron declined to comment on commercial matters, saying it expected to complete repairs to the El Segundo jet fuel production unit in early 2026.

US WEST COAST IMPORTS TO REMAIN ELEVATED

US West Coast jet fuel supply could remain tight until the El Segundo repairs are completed, two trade sources said.

""Chevron remains focused on supplying its customers around the world, including those supplied by the El Segundo refinery, and may utilise local or imported product to do so,"" the company said in a statement.

However, traders said it was unlikely that the U.S. West Coast would receive frequent imports from India, as shipments from Northeast Asia are cheaper.

Shipping costs for about 40,000 metric tons of refined fuels from South Korea to the US West Coast have held steady around $40 per ton since October, SSY pricing data showed.

Spot shipping rates between India and the U.S. West Coast are typically not readily available as the route is less common.

Last month, Northeast Asia-origin jet fuel exports to the U.S. West coast were at five-month highs of about 600,000 tons, Kpler shiptracking data showed.

AAPA director general Subhas Menon, who was speaking at the closing of the association’s 69th assembly of presidents, notes that demand remains “very buoyant” in the near term.

Menon says the sector has demonstrated “resilience” amid “persistent” challenges such geopolitics and supply chain issues, with passenger traffic up 10% in the first nine months of the year.

The AAPA says traffic will continue to grow in the new year, supported by “resilient economies and strong passenger and cargo demand”.

Its projections also indicate that in 2026, intra-Asia traffic is expect to see the largest growth, while sectors like North America-Asia are expected to see slower growth.

This is reflective of AAPA’s data comparing traffic growth in August and September, which shows North America-Asia traffic growth slowly down sharply. The “less buoyant” demand “reflects the impact of tariffs and policy changes”, the association notes.

The US-imposed tariffs, which are at risk of being escalated further, “could further exacerbate” supply chain “bottlenecks”, notes Menon.

“Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty,” Menon states.

This year’s assembly of presidents passed four resolutions, covering areas such as sustainability, supply chain and taxation.

It affirmed its “aspirational target” of 5% sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030 – set in 2023 – and called on governments to “establish policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production”.

On supply chain, AAPA member carriers called for “targeted investment incentives” in the MRO and manufacturing sectors.

The assembly also called on regulators to “refrain from imposing taxed or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance”.

Regulators should also “align practices” with global guidelines for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, with Menon noting that the lack of “harmonisation” of standards.

He adds: “Airlines are left to their own devices, and each airline is doing their own thing, which is very confusing for passengers.”

The government is now moving to the next phase of understanding what the impact of a SAF mandate would be on airlines and how additional costs would be passed on to consumers.
Although he stressed the UAE’s cautious approach to SAF, the country “really wants to hit the ground running” when it comes to adopting and producing SAF.
We have the soft power to drive this on a global scale,” Al Olama said.
“We are hoping it's going to be a major success, and if this project does come through, I see it as a blueprint that we can apply immediately in the UAE,” Al Olama said.","DUBAI—The UAE is working toward making the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandatory in the country as a key component of its SAF policy roadmap, says Sharif Al Olama, undersecretary for energy and petroleum affairs at the ministry of energy and infrastructure.

Today, the “soft requirement” is for carriers to uplift 1% SAF on a voluntary basis by 2031, but the government is working with Gulf carriers and other stakeholders to bring in a SAF mandate making it compulsory, Al Olama told Aviation Week prior to a meeting of the UAE government’s SAF & LCAF (Low Carbon Aviation Fuel) Executive Committee hosted by Airbus on Nov. 17 here at the Dubai Airshow.

“When we launched the [voluntary] policy, we wanted to test the water with our national airlines and test the environment to see the acceptance of utilizing SAF,” Al Olama said.

The government is now moving to the next phase of understanding what the impact of a SAF mandate would be on airlines and how additional costs would be passed on to consumers.

“We are very cautious when it comes to getting new policies or new mandatory requirements on board because we are aware that there can be some impact on the operations of our national airlines, so we really need to strike that balance,” Al Olama said.

Although he stressed the UAE’s cautious approach to SAF, the country “really wants to hit the ground running” when it comes to adopting and producing SAF. “Whenever we see there is a global need, the UAE takes the lead. We have the soft power to drive this on a global scale,” Al Olama said.

One initiative the UAE government is pursuing is a bid, alongside UK-based Chinook Hydrogen, to develop a SAF production plant at Hong Kong International Airport, he said.

“We are hoping it's going to be a major success, and if this project does come through, I see it as a blueprint that we can apply immediately in the UAE,” Al Olama said.

The UAE is “very pragmatic” when it comes to sustainability policy and planning, said Gabriel Sémelas, president for Africa and Middle East at Airbus.

“There is a great alignment between the government, the regulators, the local entities, all the technicians doing all the work required and industry,” Sémelas added. “I think this is unique.

This goal requires significant investment, government support, and collaboration across the industry, as the current pace of change, especially with SAF, is insufficient to meet the target on its own.

The future of aviation net zero by 2050 relies on a multi-pronged approach, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) setting the goal, but progress is slow. Key strategies include increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), developing new technologies like electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft, improving operational efficiencies, and using carbon offsets for remaining emissions. Challenges include limited SAF production, high costs, and the need for significant government support and industry-wide cooperation.

Replacing conventional jet fuel with SAFs is seen as a critical solution, with a goal of SAFs accounting for about 65% of total emissions reductions by 2050. It is also viable for the development and use of hydrogen-powered and electric aircraft for zero-emission flights. Improving flight paths, air traffic management, and airport operations are also solutions to reduce fuel burn and emissions. There is scope for utilizing credible offsetting schemes and carbon capture technologies to neutralize any remaining emissions that cannot be eliminated at the source.

The development and deployment of solutions like SAFs are not happening fast enough to meet the 2050 target, reports Indian Aerospace and Defence Bulletin and the IEA. The transition requires significant investment and government policy support, which are not yet happening at the anticipated pace and scale, notes the IATA. The climate impact of non-CO2 emissions from aviation also needs to be addressed, which adds another layer of complexity to the problem.

The global air transport sector is working towards achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Yes, decarbonizing a sector so heavily reliant on fossil fuels is a monumental challenge, but it also poses an opportunity as it allows us to reimagine the way we travel in the not-so-distant future: aircraft will be powered by new propulsion systems which reduce fuel use or rely on more electric architectures, while sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will need to fuel the majority of flights taking off around the world.

But the way to get there is difficult, requiring enormous efforts by all stakeholders. There is no silver bullet to get to net zero and different stakeholders and regions in the world will contribute in different ways. Some will lead through large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, while others will pioneer hydrogen, hybrid and electric propulsion systems. Together, these efforts are converging into one shared journey: transforming the vision of tomorrow’s flight into today’s reality.

At the heart of this transformation lies the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. Sustainable aviation fuel, which can be produced from feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, algae or even captured carbon, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the challenge is to scale it: this fuel currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel use. To meet 2050 targets, production must increase exponentially, requiring the creation of an entirely new energy ecosystem. That means new refineries and supply chains as well as harmonised regulations around the globe and investment and financial frameworks.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/11/17/1981296-aviatons-net-zero-future.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:06.083972

Jimmy Samartzis, chief executive of LanzaJet, said the milestone reflects years of work to build a new fuel pathway and deliver a technology with global potential. He added that the company is now positioned to support SAF development in countries seeking to strengthen domestic supply chains while reducing emissions from aviation.

The Freedom Pines facility integrates several first-of-a-kind technologies, including Technip Energies’ Hummingbird process for converting ethanol to ethylene and an oligomerisation system jointly developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet invested more than USD 300 million in building and operating the plant, which employed more than 300 workers during construction.

LanzaJet’s ATJ process can use a wide range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal waste and captured carbon. The resulting fuel, when blended with Jet A-1, is fully certified for use in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

The facility serves as a blueprint for future commercial deployment of the technology. LanzaJet said it is already working with partners in the United States, Australia, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Colombia, the European Union, the Middle East and Kazakhstan to scale SAF production.

The company’s work builds on earlier demonstrations dating back to 2012, when ethanol-to-jet technology first emerged from LanzaTech’s research programme.

A Shift from Offsets to SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels) Some airlines have already started making changes.","Big European airlines, like Lufthansa and Air France, are changing their tune about carbon offsetting for flights. About 21 of them have now agreed to stop making environmental claims that don't quite add up. This pledge, announced by the European Commission, is timed with Brazil's UN COP30 climate conference (10-21 Nov), really highlighting how serious the EU is about stopping greenwashing in the skies.

Cracking Down on Vague Promises

These promises are a result of talks among the airlines, the Commission, and groups watching out for consumers. Airlines are saying they'll quit saying things like a flight's CO2 can be totally ""neutralized"" just because passengers throw money at climate projects or SAF, or so-called sustainable aviation fuel.

Airlines will need to steer clear of general, unclear language and actually prove any future environmental claims with hard facts and timelines to prevent any more tricky marketing. They're being told to show CO2 numbers clearly, so passengers can see the climate footprint of their trips.

One Commission person said, ""This fits perfectly with what people are pushing for at COP30: real climate action. Aviation needs to be upfront, not just hype, so people can trust sustainable travel.""

The Full List of Committed Carriers

The Commission has shared the full list of the 21 European airlines involved, everything from your main flag carriers to the budget ones. They've all promised to get moving on these changes:

These airlines carry a huge amount of Europe's air traffic, and their collective agreement could totally change the way the industry talks about being green.

Roots in Consumer Complaints and Legal Precedents

These pledges come after a warning in June 2023 by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), calling out 17 airlines for claims that weren't really true. BEUC said that these airlines were tricking passengers into thinking their flights were eco-friendly when really, they were still adding to aviation's big carbon problem.

These airlines have been in trouble before too. Back in March 2024, a Dutch court ruled against KLM for ads that were ""vague"" and made sustainability seem better than it was. Air France was also rapped on the knuckles by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority in 2023 over Google ads that talked about eco-friendly travel. Lufthansa even had to take down some posters in Belgium way back in July 2022 after they implied that flying was good for the planet.

These decisions are pushing the industry to focus on real progress instead of just flashy marketing.

A Shift from Offsets to SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels)

Some airlines have already started making changes. Air France and KLM stopped doing carbon offsetting three years ago because people said they weren't really working and didn't reduce emissions directly. These schemes generally involved planting trees.

According to the Commission, ""An Air France-KLM person said the group is now buying SAF."" Sustainable Aviation Fuel, made from waste stuff or crops you don't eat, is a more direct way to reduce carbon, even though it's not easy to get enough of it. The industry is clearly moving towards real innovations, at least.

COP30 and a Path to Reality

With COP30 on the horizon, hosted in Brazil, the EU's move acts as a pertinent message that corporate responsibility should keep pace with government aims. The Commission's goal, to boost consumer choice via clearer rules, could speed up the aviation sector's 2050 net-zero target.

The announcement was met with approval, with environmental groups like BEUC calling it ""a long-overdue victory."" They stressed that successful enforcement is key, though. With these new commitments, perhaps Europe's skies will become less polluted by just ""talk,"" and more so with reality, even as offsets face regulatory uncertainty.",https://www.tourism-review.com/temp/aktualita-detail-facebook_tmb_15190.webp,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:41.749667

In 2025, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai took an important step in that direction by testing engines using sustainable aviation fuel – a first for the Chinese facility.
Every person in the MTU Maintenance Zhuhai extended family is different, he adds, and everyone needs a different approach.","Gert Wagner couldn’t have had a rougher start to his new role as President and CEO. Tasked with leading the team at MTU Maintenance Zhuhai, the aviation veteran found himself in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic.

""I remember when I arrived, the doors of the aircraft opened and I saw all these people in blue uniforms wearing masks,"" he tells The CEO Magazine. ""I felt like I was in an outbreak movie.""

It was a sobering introduction that took a little of the sheen off Wagner’s new role. He joined MTU Aero Engines, the leading German aerospace company listed in the German DAX, in 2005, and held several positions within the company until the move to China arose.

""Everybody was sick; we had something like a 60 percent absence rate, so it was very hard to run the company at first,"" he recalls. ""But once people came back, so did a big demand, and we’ve grown dramatically ever since. Now, we’re running at full speed and it’s a very exciting time.""

A global engine shop

Since those tenuous early days, Wagner has overseen the significant expansion of MTU Maintenance Zhuhai’s facilities. Just in March 2025, the team celebrated the opening of a second facility.

""That brings us close to being one of the biggest engine shops in the world, capacity-wise,"" he says.

In collaboration with

China Aviation Supplies

The company is streamlining services and supplies in the aviation industry. The company is streamlining services and supplies in the aviation industry.

In 2024, MTU had 500 shop visits. The recent expansions have given the firm the capacity for up to 710 shop visits in the future.

""We’re very confident about filling those shops,"" Wagner says.

""The market is there within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation alone. Boeing and Airbus are forecasting for the next 20 years their fleets to double, with 80 percent narrow-body aircraft.

""We have all major narrow-body engines in our facility, so now it’s up to us to convince our customers through our performance and our expertise to send their engines to us along with their faith and trust.""

And it’s trust that keeps aviation maintenance airborne. Quality and safety are paramount, so a company such as MTU Maintenance Zhuhai must make trust its currency. Fortunately, Wagner says that’s its strength.

""Everything is prepared for growth,"" he says. ""We have the right capacity, the right people on board; the market is there. I’m very confident.""

Key relationships

Filling those shops requires a world-class parts supply chain backed by a peerless global logistics network, with many services sourced locally. From endoscope supplier Everest VIT Beijing and tooling provider Dedienne Aerospace to aviation supplies firm China Aviation Supplies Co and surface treatment leader John Cockerill, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai has a stable of industry heavyweights in its corner.

""In the supply chain, the most important relationship you have in our business is with the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),"" Wagner says.

""I’ve been in this business for over 20 years and I know all the OEMs. I have personal relationships with them. That communication and networking are key, because when you have a problem, you have to know who to talk to. Suddenly, the market isn’t so big.""

Wagner says that in a high-pressure environment such as aeronautical engineering, fairness is still a factor.

""To keep long-term relationships going, you have to understand these OEMs have their limits,"" he says. ""You have to treat them fairly.""

Sustainability and leadership goals

That close collaboration with a diverse range of OEMs also gives MTU access to a broad spectrum of innovation – especially when it comes to sustainability.

""That’s a big topic for all the OEMs,"" Wagner says. ""They’re all developing concepts to reduce emissions and maybe one day become emission neutral, so the main thing we can do is prepare our customers for using sustainable aviation fuel.""

In 2025, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai took an important step in that direction by testing engines using sustainable aviation fuel – a first for the Chinese facility. ""We’re the first MRO shop in China able to offer this,"" he says.

""It’s a big achievement and a big step forward. It can change our industry.""

With so much at stake, from safety to innovation, Wagner says leadership in this industry is a surprisingly simple matter.

""For me, it’s down to two quotes. Jack Welch said, ‘It’s all about people,’ while Peter Drucker said, ‘A culture eats strategy for breakfast’. As a leader, you have to inject a healthy culture into your organization and you have to take care of your people. They make it happen, so you have to treat them well.""

Every person in the MTU Maintenance Zhuhai extended family is different, he adds, and everyone needs a different approach.

""There’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,"" he says. ""You have to gain trust and they have to believe you’re leading the organization in the right direction.""

Wagner’s trial by fire in the midst of the worst industry crisis since the September 11 attacks went a long way toward building that trust.

""It’s very different than right now, which is very comfortable. We have full order books and it’s all very positive, but that’s a different kind of leadership,"" he says.

""In a crisis, you have to lead from the top; you have to be there and demonstrate confidence so they can trust you. At the moment, I’m leading from the back, making sure everyone’s going in the right direction.

""Leadership is about adjusting to the situation and the people you deal with.""

Originally a mechanical engineer himself, Wagner says he loves being a part of such a high-tech industry.

""There’s nothing better,"" he says. ""We’re at the leading edge of technology and not on a small scale. Two of the most modern aircraft engines are here in our shop.

""Technology and people are such a fascinating combination and it’s why I love this business so much. It couldn’t be better.""",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17094306/Gert-Wagner_MTU-MAINTENANCE_Sharing.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:16.845737

Thanks to the Dubai Airports’ partnership with Airbus, visitors can also see a physical model of a hydrogen powerplant cell, part of the manufacturer’s research into zero-emission flight.
“It’s about a combination of many actions—electrification, biofuels, hydrogen and new operational efficiencies—each one moving the needle further.” The UAE’s potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another focus area.","DUBAI—Sustainability is in the spotlight at this year’s Dubai Airshow where Dubai Airports is unveiling its OneDXB Sustainability Showcase, which it says shows how one of the world’s busiest aviation hubs is steering the industry toward a greener future.

From cutting-edge energy initiatives and electrified ground operations to carbon-reduction strategies, the showcase underlines how efficiency and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.

The OneDXB Sustainability Alliance, which launched in September 2024, brings together seven founding partners—Dubai Airports, Emirates, flydubai, dnata, Dubai Duty Free, Emirates Flight Catering and Dubai Air Navigation Services. The goal is simple yet ambitious: to accelerate collective decarbonization efforts and set new sustainability benchmarks for the region and wider global aviation ecosystem.

“At DXB, we work with hundreds of partners, but the idea behind OneDXB is to create a focused alliance that collaborates on how we decarbonize in the short term and how we plan for future sustainable aviation strategies,” says Sven Deckers, Dubai Airports' head of sustainability.

With Dubai Airports in the midst of master-planning the next-generation mega-hub at Al Maktoum International (DWC), sustainability is being built into the project from the ground up. “As much as we need to look at how we decarbonize today, we must also think across the whole aviation ecosystem—10, 20, or 30 years ahead,” Deckers adds.

Integrated Sustainability in Action

OneDXB’s Sustainable Turnaround Showcase offers visitors a unique, integrated experience that brings together around 35 partners and 45 pieces of equipment in a compact, 20-min. walkthrough. “Rather than visiting 30 or 40 separate stands, delegates can see the full picture of sustainable aviation, from the airport operator to airlines, ground handlers, and service providers, all in one place,” Deckers says.

The showcase includes a flydubai aircraft positioned on site to demonstrate a fully electrified turnaround, illustrating how ground operations can dramatically cut emissions. From electric fire trucks and autonomous vehicles to solar-powered systems and dry-washing technology, the display reflects real-world progress as well as what’s coming next.

“It’s not about showing off,” Deckers says. “It’s about showing what can be done—and inviting others to join the conversation. So, we encourage visitors to come to our stand and see for themselves. This is the start of something big.”

Among the technologies being showcased are multiple alternative-fuel solutions, including biofuels and hydrogen. Dubai Airports is already deploying biofuel in its operations, while also exploring hydrogen-powered ground transport—including a fully licensed hydrogen bus here at the show. Thanks to the Dubai Airports’ partnership with Airbus, visitors can also see a physical model of a hydrogen powerplant cell, part of the manufacturer’s research into zero-emission flight.

“There’s no single solution to aviation’s net-zero goal,” Deckers says. “It’s about a combination of many actions—electrification, biofuels, hydrogen and new operational efficiencies—each one moving the needle further.”

The UAE’s potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another focus area. A truck on display demonstrates how used cooking oil collected across the UAE can be converted into SAF and biofuel. Meanwhile, research into power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels highlights how the region’s abundance of solar energy and desalination capacity could make it a future global hub for synthetic fuel production.

For Dubai Airports, the road to net zero involves a three-pillar approach: decarbonizing DXB through proven technologies such as solar panels, LED lighting

and HVAC optimization; trialing future solutions at DWC, which serves as an innovation testbed; and embedding sustainability into the design and operations of the upcoming DWC mega-hub.

“Unlike other major airports, the Dubai Airports setup gives us the unique opportunity to test in a live environment at DWC and design the airport of the future from scratch,” Deckers says.

“The future will be more sustainable, and we’re working today to define what that looks like.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:22.299826

Thankfully, scientists have found a sustainable way to cut that contribution by turning everyday trash into jet fuel.

A study published in Nature Sustainability shows that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel. The findings support that one day, food scraps and packaging could power commercial flights.

Researchers from the U.S. and China found that trash-based jet fuel could account for 62.5 billion liters annually, enough to cut global aviation pollution by 16%, as Anthropocene Magazine reported.

""There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,"" said research team member Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University.

In addition to waste, the Nature Sustainability study also noted that integrating green hydrogen into the process could remove even more carbon, while the biggest hurdle is improving the gasification process, which has been a ""technical challenge.""

For cities already struggling with landfill waste, this breakthrough could turn that problem into a climate solution.

This isn't the only recent advancement in sustainable aviation technology. Scientists at Chalmers University in Sweden presented hydrogen-powered aircraft designs that could reduce fuel consumption. Meanwhile, aviation company Eviation introduced Alice, the world's first all-electric commuter plane, last year.

Choosing low-impact travel options helps support this transition. While no single solution can fully replace dirty-energy-producing fuel just yet, innovations such as waste-based sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft are taking us in the right direction.

Despite persistent geopolitical and trade tensions, AAPA members registered robust international air traffic performance. International passenger traffic for Asia Pacific carriers rose 10% in the first nine months of 2025, while air cargo demand expanded 7%, outpacing global averages.

“Asia Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand,” said AAPA Director General Subhas Menon: “However, further escalation of tariffs could exacerbate these bottlenecks.”

The assembly brought together airline leaders, manufacturers, and industry partners to address key industry priorities, including supply chain resilience, the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and enhancing workforce resilience.

“Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty, much as it did during the pandemic,” Menon added.

Assembly Resolutions Passed

The Assembly of Presidents unanimously passed several resolutions addressing key industry priorities.

Aviation Sustainability

The assembly affirmed a collective target of 5% SAF utilisation by 2030, called on governments to support fuel suppliers by establishing policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production, and to adopt ICAO CORSIA-eligible fuel criteria. The resolution further urged states to implement ICAO-approved SAF accounting and registry systems, as well as support cost-effective production pathways, such as co-processing.

Supply Chain Strengthening

The assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities. It also supported the adoption of circular economy principles, including recycling and reuse of serviceable aircraft materials.

Aviation Safety

A resolution focused on lithium batteries was passed, calling on regulators to align practices with ICAO guidance for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, and to enhance data sharing and public outreach materials on the carriage and usage of lithium batteries by passengers.

Taxes and Charges

The assembly called on regulators to refrain from imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance, cautioning against measures that add an unnecessary financial burden on airlines or which impede sustainable air transport growth.

Outlook for 2026

AAPA expects international passenger traffic to continue expanding in line with long-term trends, supported by a growing services sector and rising regional connectivity. The outlook for air cargo demand remains broadly positive. Still, it is subject to uncertainties stemming from global trade policies and elevated costs, including those resulting from new US tariffs and limited SAF availability.

“AAPA airlines are optimistic,” said Menon. “Our focus in 2026 will be to advance aviation safety and sustainability across the Asia Pacific region, strengthen supply resilience in collaboration with regulators and suppliers, and promote air transport connectivity.”",https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-82-600x372.png,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:19.649003

PDO, which is majority state-owned, currently produces approximately 948,600 cubic meters of produced water daily—this highly saline, oil-contaminated water emerges alongside crude oil.
The partially treated water proceeds to evaporation ponds that concentrate and reduce the volume further.
This comprehensive system effectively removes the majority of oil, producing treated water that is suitable for various beneficial uses.
Several Omani start-ups, alongside international companies, are exploring opportunities to produce biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by cultivating select crops irrigated with treated produced water.","MUSCAT, NOV 16 — Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the Sultanate’s largest oil and gas producer, has taken a pioneering step to create value from the enormous volumes of produced water generated by its daily oilfield operations. The company has invited interested firms to register their interest in utilizing treated produced water for agricultural, industrial, and other commercial applications.

PDO, which is majority state-owned, currently produces approximately 948,600 cubic meters of produced water daily—this highly saline, oil-contaminated water emerges alongside crude oil. This volume is equivalent to filling about 380 Olympic-sized swimming pools every day and is expected to increase to 1.4 million cubic meters per day (around 560 Olympic-sized pools) by 2030.

To manage these vast quantities sustainably and maximize their value within Oman, PDO plans to invite local and international companies to submit techno-commercial proposals for the use of treated water from two major treatment facilities located at Nimr and Rima within its concession area. As an initial step, interested parties must prequalify by submitting their expressions of interest no later than December 21, 2025.

The Nimr Wetlands, established in 2010, are among the world’s largest constructed wetlands for treating produced water, with a current capacity of about 175,000 cubic meters per day. The Rima Water Treatment Plant has a treatment capacity of up to 65,000 cubic meters per day.

At both plants, produced water undergoes a multi-stage treatment process. First, oil is separated from the water, which then passes through extensive reed bed wetlands where plants and microbes naturally break down remaining contaminants. The partially treated water proceeds to evaporation ponds that concentrate and reduce the volume further. In some cases, an additional polishing step enhances water quality. This comprehensive system effectively removes the majority of oil, producing treated water that is suitable for various beneficial uses.

Recently, PDO has intensified efforts to identify market-driven solutions for expanding the beneficial reuse of treated produced water across sectors such as agriculture, wetland development, biodiversity enhancement, and other industrial, commercial, and mineral extraction activities.

At Nimr, a portion of treated water has been successfully used to irrigate crops like cotton, Ricinus (castor), and jojoba, which yield valuable downstream products such as biological oils for further processing. Native tree species such as eucalyptus are also thriving, indicating strong potential for scaling up agricultural operations in the area.

In addition, projects focused on extracting salts and minerals from the water have been pursued. Noteworthy initiatives include the Fahud Salt Making Project, the Qarn Alam Steam Hypersaline Project, and the use of surface water to support plantation schemes.

Several Omani start-ups, alongside international companies, are exploring opportunities to produce biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by cultivating select crops irrigated with treated produced water.

Another promising application involves supporting Oman’s 10-million-tree initiative and furthering carbon credit projects, especially in desert regions where water scarcity limits irrigation efforts. These endeavors align closely with PDO’s sustainability strategy, the Environment Authority’s goals to enhance greening, and Oman’s overall net-zero emissions target.

This initiative highlights PDO’s commitment to sustainable resource management and innovative value creation from by-products of its oil and gas operations, contributing to the country’s environmental and economic objectives.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced.
Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said.
For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.
All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS.","Airline passengers departing from Singapore will have to pay a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy ranging from S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 per ticket (US$32.04), depending on their travel destination and travel class.

In imposing this levy, Singapore will become the first country in the world to introduce a SAF tax on outbound flights.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced.

This means that if a ticket is bought before 1 April for a flight departing after 1 October, the levy will not apply. Likewise, if a ticket is bought after 1 April for a flight before 1 October, there will be no levy.

Geographical bands

All destinations from Singapore will be grouped into four geographical bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: the Americas.

Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said. Passengers in business or first class are set to pay up to four times more than those in economy class, based on industry norms for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabin classes.

Passengers travelling to Band 1 destinations will pay S$1 (US$0.77) if travelling in an economy cabin, which includes economy class and premium economy, and S$4 (US$3.08) for a premium cabin, which includes business class and first class.

Band 2 passengers will pay S$2.80 (US$2.16) and S$11.20 (US$8.62) for an economy cabin and a premium cabin, respectively.

Band 3 passengers will pay S$6.40 (US$4.93) and S$25.60 (US$19.71), and Band 4 passengers will pay S$10.40 (US$8.01) and S$41.60 (US$32.02) for an economy cabin and a premium cabin respectively.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights – such as private jets and chartered services – departing Singapore.

New entity to procure SAF

The announcement of the levy amounts comes after CAAS said last month that it had set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable and stable supply for Singapore and the region.

Levies collected from passengers will go into a fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel. The airline will collect the levy and must display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS. In turn, the fund will subsequently be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes, said CAAS, and would cover the associated administrative costs.

One percent target

The levy amounts, said CAAS, were calculated based on the volume of fuel needed to meet Singapore’s one per cent target for 2026, and the projected price of the fuel.

Singapore’s target is for sustainable aviation fuel to form one per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

The goal is to raise this target to three per cent to five per cent by 2030, depending on global developments and the availability of the green jet fuel, which is mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil.

CAAS said the levy amount will be fixed for as long as the target remains at one per cent. The amount will be relooked only when the current one per cent target is adjusted in future.

The levy will be applied on top of a total of $65.20 (US$50.21) in fees that departing passengers who start their trips at Changi Airport already pay. These fees will go up in stages from April 2027, reaching $79.20 (US$61) in April 2030 – a 21 per cent rise.

Passengers may not pay the whole levy

However, operating airlines may likely swallow some of the impact of the new levy being charged, to ensure that their flights from Singapore remain competitive.

Instead, airlines may well adjust their base fares to keep the overall cost of tickets competitive, thereby absorbing some, if not all, of the levy. It is also worth noting that in the case of frequent flyer award tickets and other complimentary ticket types, the SAF levy will still apply and is likely to be picked up in full by the passenger, as with any other tax or surcharge.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/singapore-airlines-plane-at-airport-gate.webp,N,,2025-11-16 14:56:13.250221
