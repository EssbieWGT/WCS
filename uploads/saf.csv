The reusable Boeing-built platform launched late on August 21, 2025, atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, kicking off its eighth mission in 15 years of operations.

The uncrewed vehicle separated from the rocket’s upper stage as planned and entered low Earth orbit, roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) above the surface. Mission details remain classified, but the US Space Force has confirmed that the spaceplane will test a mix of navigation, communications, and payload-handling technologies.

From rapid turnaround to rapid testing

The launch comes less than six months after the X-37B completed its seventh mission, which ended with a landing at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on March 7, 2025. That mission included a first-of-its-kind aerobraking maneuver that allowed the vehicle to change orbit while saving propellant.

This quick turnaround also highlights the X-37B’s growing role as an operationally ready testbed for new military and commercial space technologies.

Bigger payloads, more experiments

For this eighth flight, Boeing has added a redesigned service module that expands the spaceplane’s payload capacity. The upgrade allows the Space Force and its partners, including the US Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Innovation Unit, to run more complex experiments simultaneously.

Among the payloads are two key technologies. The first is a high-bandwidth laser communications system, part of the US Space Force’s push to link satellites and space assets through resilient, high-speed networks.

The second is a quantum inertial sensor, designed to deliver precise navigation data in GPS-denied environments. If proven reliable in orbit, the technology could eventually support missions in contested orbital zones or even deep-space exploration where GPS signals are unavailable.

A platform that keeps evolving

Since its debut, the X-37B has spent over 4,200 cumulative days in space, returning after every flight for inspection, upgrades, and mission planning. That reusability has made it a critical asset for testing and refining technologies faster than traditional satellite platforms allow.

Each successive mission has offered a glimpse into how the US Space Force sees the future of orbital operations: a mix of reusable platforms, rapid iteration, and resilient systems designed to survive and operate in increasingly contested space.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/08/The-Boeing-X-37B-space-plane.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:56:08.536173

Thứ hai, về giải pháp công nghệ, tàu bay được thiết kế nhẹ hơn, động cơ tiêu thụ ít nhiên liệu hơn hoặc sử dụng nhiên liệu thay thế. Về công nghệ, giống như xu hướng ô tô điện, ngành hàng không cũng đã thiết kế và thử nghiệm máy bay điện.

""Đến năm 2030, thế giới có máy bay điện từ 20-30 ghế đưa vào khai thác. Từ năm 2040, máy bay điện sẽ phổ biến hơn. Vietjet cũng đã làm việc với các đối tác nhằm bắt kịp xu hướng. Khi máy bay điện phổ biến, chúng tôi cũng tham gia"", ông Tô Việt Thắng cho biết.

Thứ ba, sử dụng hiệu quả hạ tầng, năng lượng sạch. Các sân bay sử dụng xe điện, năng lượng mặt trời, giảm sử dụng điều hòa để tiết kiệm năng lượng.

Thứ tư, nhiên liệu thay thế hay còn được gọi là nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, sẽ được sử dụng.

Ông Thắng cho hay nhiên liệu các hãng hàng không đang sử dụng có nguồn gốc từ dầu mỏ. Trái lại, nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững được sản xuất từ chế phẩm sinh học và không có nguồn gốc dầu mỏ, có tên gọi là SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Hiện nay, SAF được ngành hàng không thế giới quan tâm bởi nhiên liệu này có thể giúp giảm 80% lượng phát thải carbon trong suốt vòng đời của nhiên liệu. Vietjet cũng từng thử nghiệm sử dụng SAF cho 2 chuyến bay quốc tế đi Úc và Hàn Quốc vào năm 2024.

Trên thế giới, châu Âu đã ban hành chính sách yêu cầu các hãng hàng không khi bay vào không phận phải sử dụng tỷ lệ % nhiên liệu bền vững nhất định. Cụ thể, năm 2025 là 2%, năm 2030 là 6% và năm 2035 là 20%, tiếp tục nâng dần tỷ lệ và tiến tới đạt 70% vào năm 2050.

“Yêu cầu tỷ lệ sử dụng nhiên liệu bền vững tăng rất nhanh. Tuy nhiên, chi phí sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững đang cao gấp 2-3 lần so với nhiên liệu truyền thống, ảnh hưởng đến hiệu quả khai thác của hãng bay. Đây là rào cản lớn đối với mục tiêu phát triển bền vững của ngành hàng không”, đại diện Vietjet nói.

Nguồn cung SAF cũng là bài toán đang đặt ra cho các quốc gia trên thế giới và các hãng hàng không. Do đó, theo ông Thắng, doanh nghiệp đang làm việc với các đối tác để tiến hành nghiên cứu, hướng đến sản xuất nhiên liệu bền vững tại Việt Nam, nhằm giảm chi phí.

Cùng với đó, Vietjet kiến nghị với các cơ quan hữu trách hai vấn đề chính: Một là cần ban hành cơ chế chính sách phù hợp cho nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, như hỗ trợ chi phí nhập khẩu, hoặc các loại thuế liên quan.

Hai là cần có quỹ đầu tư trong nước để tiến hành nghiên cứu, sản xuất nhiên liệu sạch tại chỗ, cung cấp cho các hãng hàng không, giúp giảm chi phí khai thác.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/000003/2025/8/23/lanh-dao-vietjet-khi-may-bay-dien-pho-bien-chung-toi-cung-tham-gia-2029.jpeg?width=0&s=7iBj8mIJc-XfVrIT6z_BWg,N,,2025-08-24 05:56:30.990252

Jakarta (ANTARA) - PT Pertamina (Persero) menilai dukungan pemerintah melalui kebijakan strategis penting untuk menjamin pasokan minyak jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO) sebagai bahan baku avtur ramah lingkungan, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“Jadi kita tentu ingin bekerja sama dengan dukungan pemerintah bagaimana kebijakannya bahwa standardisasi SAF atau kewajiban penggunaan SAF ini nanti itu disesuaikan dengan kemampuan Indonesia,” kata Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis PT Pertamina (Persero) Agung Wicaksono, di Jakarta, Sabtu.

“Lalu bagaimana kemampuan Pertamina menyuplai ini, termasuk juga UCO-nya, karena ini juga banyak yang diekspor, kan? Jadi kami nanti butuh dukungan kebijakan pemerintah untuk bisa menjamin pasokannya,” katanya lagi.

Adapun SAF dari Pertamina (PertaminaSAF) merupakan avtur yang diolah dari bahan baku minyak jelantah, yang saat ini diproduksi oleh salah satu unit operasi PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI), yakni Kilang Cilacap.

Avtur yang mengandung campuran minyak jelantah itu, kata dia, telah melewati serangkaian pengujian kualitas yang ketat di laboratorium KPI Unit Cilacap dan juga di laboratorium eksternal independen Lemigas.

Produksi Pertamina SAF pun, katanya lagi, dilakukan dengan teknologi co-processing, menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih buatan anak bangsa.

“Ini merupakan produk karya anak bangsa, kita bangga. Produk dari minyak jelantah yang banyak kita temui di masyarakat, kemudian diolah di kilang Pertamina di Cilacap, yang akan menjadi green refinery,” ujar Agung.

Selain itu, Pertamina sendiri juga telah melakukan penerbangan komersial perdana maskapai Pelita Air menggunakan PertaminaSAF dengan rute Jakarta-Denpasar pada Rabu (20/8).

“Saat ini fokusnya di bandara internasional dulu, yaitu Jakarta dan Bali, karena 90 persen penerbangan internasional itu dari dua bandar udara itu,” kata Agung.

Lebih lanjut, mantan Deputi Bidang Pendanaan dan Investasi Otoritas Ibu Kota Nusantara (OIKN) itu mengatakan perusahaan berkomitmen untuk memperluas produksi bahan bakar pesawat terbarukan tersebut, sembari dengan melibatkan peran masyarakat.

“Sudah ada 35 SPBU, tempat pengumpulan minyak jelantah. Jadi masyarakat bisa tuang minyak jelantah dan menjadi rupiah. Ini berarti circular economy,” ujar Agung pula.

John Knight, Director Test & Experimental Engineering, ET&S, afferma: “Con oltre 2000 ore di test alle spalle, il Flying Test Bed è stato per noi un cavallo di battaglia negli ultimi 20 anni, aiutandoci a superare i limiti dell’engine development.
Mentre salutiamo con affetto la nostra Queen of the Skies, continuiamo a innovare nei test con una combinazione di flying test beds, ground testing and advanced digital modelling”.

“Dal 2005, questo velivolo modificato in modo unico, in grado di operare con cinque motori, è stato fondamentale per lo sviluppo di propulsori di nuova generazione come il Trent 1000 e il Pearl 10X.

Ha fatto la storia nel 2021 volando con un Trent 1000 alimentato interamente con 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel e ha svolto un ruolo chiave nella successiva certificazione del suo durability enhancement package, che più che raddoppierà il time on wing.

La sua ultima missione, completata nel luglio 2025, ha supportato l’Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, segnando un passo significativo verso la fornitura di motori più efficienti e sostenibili”, afferma Rolls-Royce.

John Knight, Director Test & Experimental Engineering, ET&S, afferma: “Con oltre 2000 ore di test alle spalle, il Flying Test Bed è stato per noi un cavallo di battaglia negli ultimi 20 anni, aiutandoci a superare i limiti dell’engine development. Mentre salutiamo con affetto la nostra Queen of the Skies, continuiamo a innovare nei test con una combinazione di flying test beds, ground testing and advanced digital modelling”.

“Un FTB test con una particolarità ha avuto luogo nel 2021, quando è stato utilizzato per testare un motore Trent 1000 alimentato con 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, mentre gli altri tre motori RB211 operavano con “standard” jet fuel. Il volo di tre ore e 54 minuti dall’aeroporto di Tucson, in Arizona, sorvolando Texas e Nuovo Messico ha confermato l’assenza di problemi tecnici e faceva parte del nostro programma più ampio, ora completato, per verificare che i nostri motori in produzione siano compatibili con 100% SAF.

In particolare, questo test è stato un fattore chiave per il primo first transatlantic flight al mondo di Virgin Atlantic nel 2023 utilizzando 100% SAF con un Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Questo ha reso Rolls-Royce il primo jet engine manufacturer a confermare pubblicamente che tutti i nostri in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets sono compatibili con 100% SAF ed è stato un traguardo importante sia per Rolls-Royce che per l’industria aeronautica in generale. Ha inoltre fornito un’ulteriore dimostrazione del nostro impegno a diventare una net zero company entro il 2050 e a supportare i nostri clienti nel fare lo stesso”, prosegue Rolls-Royce.

All’epoca, Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety, Rolls-Royce plc, ha dichiarato: “Questo è un traguardo importante, non solo per Rolls-Royce, ma anche per l’industria aerospaziale civile in generale. Ci auguriamo che il successo di questi test fornisca un livello di convalida tecnica che supporti coloro che intendono investire nella produzione di velivoli 100% SAF in futuro”.

“Da carbon/titanium fan blades a low-emission combustion systems, l’FTB è stato determinante nella convalida delle UltraFan technologies in condizioni reali.

Nel 2014, un set di composite carbon/titanium (CTi) fan blades, progettate per gli Advance and UltraFan engine designs, ha volato con successo per la prima volta, incorporate nell’FTB, segnando un’altra importante pietra miliare per il programma.

Più di recente, l’FTB ha permesso a Rolls-Royce di completare l’ultima fase di test di volo per il suo Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys). Le informazioni raccolte supportano direttamente lo sviluppo di UltraFan, riducendo i rischi e migliorando la maturità dei futuri combustion systems.

Testando queste tecnologie critiche in volo, l’FTB garantisce che i sistemi siano pronti per la prossima generazione di motori”, continua Rolls-Royce.

“La test configuration più evidente dell’FTB è stata quella del Pearl 10X. Questo motore è il terzo e più potente membro della market-leading Pearl engine family per il business aviation market, ed è stato ottimizzato per equipaggiare esclusivamente il nuovo velivolo di punta di Dassault, il Falcon 10X.

Per completare il suo rigoroso flight test programme, i nostri team hanno dovuto progettare un pilone su misura per consentirgli di essere posizionato sull’ala di destra dell’FTB, insieme a due RB211. Sull’ala sinistra erano presenti un terzo RB211 e un Trent 1000, conferendo all’FTB la sua esclusiva e accattivante configurazione a cinque motori.

Mentre il cockpit ospitava gli engine controls per tutti e cinque i motori, i piloti si concentravano sugli RB211 e sul Trent 1000, mentre un Pearl 10X engine operator sedeva sull’engineering deck accanto al flight test engineer e controllava il motore, mantenendo costantemente una continua headset communication con il cockpit.

Questo testing programme ha dimostrato l’incredibile flessibilità del velivolo, nonché l’ingegnosità del personale e dei nostri partner nell’operare la configurazione”, conclude Rolls-Royce.

Final Thoughts Alaska Airlines added milestones to its Atmos Rewards program in 2025.","In 2025, Alaska Airlines got into the game of rewarding travelers with perks along their elite status journey. Rather than waiting until you reach the next tier to gain benefits, you can receive additional perks in between.

Dubbed “milestones,” these perks are available starting at 10,000 status points. That’s a relatively achievable threshold, and travelers don’t need to qualify for any levels of elite status before they can get extra benefits.

The best part about milestones is their customization, letting you choose the perk you like — or 2 perks you like, depending on which milestone you’ve reached.

Here’s everything you need to know about this new benefit for Alaska Airlines flyers and the options you can choose from this year.

What Are Alaska Atmos Rewards Milestones?

Alaska Airlines announced milestones along with its other loyalty program changes for 2025. Milestones are perks that you can choose, starting at 10,000 status points and available at 7 different thresholds as you earn more status points throughout the year.

Choosing milestones in your Alaska Airlines Atmos Rewards account is free after you’ve qualified for them. However, you need to make your selection within 120 days.

Hot Tip:

Different perks have different expiration periods. However, if you choose to get elite status for a day, you would have up to a year to use the perk. According to a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, it would be valid for 14 days from activation.

How To Earn Alaska Airlines Status Points

Qualifying for milestones requires earning status points. Luckily, you can earn status points from more than just flying. Ways to collect status points include spending on a credit card, travel, shopping, and more.

These are the same status points that count toward earning Alaska Airlines’ elite status tiers, though you don’t need to reach any level of elite status to qualify for milestones. That’s because you need just 10,000 status points in a year to make your first milestone choice, though you need 20,000 status points to reach the lowest level of elite status: Atmos Silver.

Here are some of the ways to earn status points with Alaska Airlines:

Since Alaska awards status points on flights according to flight distance, fare type, and where you purchased the ticket, you can check your earnings against this chart here.

Alaska Airlines Atmos Rewards Milestone Choices

You have options at each milestone. Some milestones provide just 1 choice, while others provide 2. Once you make a selection, your choice is final, so ensure you’re happy with it before confirming it.

Options include bonus points, complimentary passes for inflight Wi-Fi, gifting elite status to others, and additional perks you may like. Here are the current choices at each milestone threshold:

Which Milestone Perk Should You Choose?

The value you assign to a milestone option is subjective, but it’s worth comparing them to see what you’re getting or giving up by not choosing a different item.

For reference, we value Alaska Airlines points at 1.6 cents each. That makes 750 bonus points worth $12, while 15,000 points are worth $240. The same math applies to a discount on Atmos Rewards Unlocked, for which you can redeem points toward experiences and events. Getting a discount of 10,000 or 25,000 points on these redemptions is worth $160 or $400, respectively.

Inflight Wi-Fi costs $8 on most of Alaska’s flights, while onboard meals cost between $8 and $12.50 if you don’t get a complimentary meal. A single-day visit to an Alaska Lounge costs $65.

Then there are choices that are harder to value. What’s the value you assign to moving into first class on a flight? Is it the cost difference of the ticket against the economy-class pricing, the cost of the food and drinks you consume, or some other number in between? The dollar value attached to upgrade awards may vary from person to person and flight to flight.

That same logic will apply to gifting or sampling elite status for a single trip. For an idea of the value differences, check out our comparison of Alaska Airlines Atmos Platinum and Titanium status.

Then there are the milestones you probably shouldn’t choose. You can get rental car upgrades rather easily by holding the right credit card and matching your status across various programs. And you should consider the lounge membership discount carefully before choosing this option. It’s just a $100 discount on a membership that covers 9 lounges for a cost of $595 — so $495 with the discount.

If you’re flying long-distance with Alaska Airlines in first class (paid or booked with points), with Alaska Airlines’ partners, or on military travel, you can access these lounges before departing without paying. You can also access the lounge if you have elite status with a Oneworld airline and are traveling beyond the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. However, that restriction doesn’t apply to those whose elite status comes from airlines other than Alaska and American Airlines, so British Airways Club members, for example, can access the lounges for free when flying in a premium cabin with a Oneworld airline regardless of destination.

As you consider the value of your options, consider both the tangible and intangible to see what value you’ll get from a benefit. Make sure to choose a perk that you’ll use and that you’ll be happy with. Remember that all choices are final.

Hot Tip:

There are other airport lounges you can visit. Memberships like Priority Pass can give you lounge access regardless of what airline you’re flying with that day. Check out our list of the best credit cards for gaining airport lounge access.

Final Thoughts

Alaska Airlines added milestones to its Atmos Rewards program in 2025. Similar to what we’ve seen with other airline and hotel loyalty programs, guests can earn choice benefits after certain thresholds are met during the year. Some options are clearly better than others, and it’s important that you clearly understand the perk and its value before making a selection, given that all choices are final.",https://upgradedpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Alaska-Airlines-planes-at-Santa-Rosa-STS-airport.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 02:56:16.634393

“PertaminaSAF adalah sebuah langkah besar dalam dunia aviasi di Indonesia. Penerbangan spesial ini sekaligus menjadi bukti kalau KPI bisa menjadi pelopor energi hijau di Indonesia. Produk ini membuktikan bahwa kita memiliki kapabilitas dalam memproduksi produk bahan bakar pesawat masa depan,” ungkap Taufik dalam keterangannya, Sabtu (23/8/2025).

Ia menambahkan, PertaminaSAF merupakan produk berkualitas dan ramah lingkungan yang diproduksi oleh salah satu unit operasi KPI, yakni Kilang Cilacap. Produk ini telah melewati serangkaian pengujian kualitas yang ketat di laboratorium KPI Unit Cilacap dan juga di laboratorium eksternal independen Lemigas.

""Ke depan, PertaminaSAF juga akan diujicobakan untuk diproduksi di Kilang Dumai dan Kilang Balongan,"" kata Taufik.

Produksi Pertamina SAF dilakukan dengan teknologi co-processing, menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih buatan anak bangsa. Hasilnya, PertaminaSAF dinyatakan memenuhi standar internasional ASTM D1655 dan DefStan 91-091.

Menurut Taufik, kualitas PertaminaSAF tidak kalah jika dibandingkan dengan produk serupa yang digunakan di negara lain. PertaminaSAF merupakan upaya konkret dalam percepatan pengurangan emisi karbon sebab kandungan karbon di dalamnya lebih rendah 81 persen dibanding avtur berbahan fosil.

""PertaminaSAF adalah bioavtur sustainable pertama yang memiliki sertifikat internasional sustainability ISCC CORSIA berbahan baku campuran UCO atau minyak jelantah yang diproduksi di Indonesia,"" kata Taufik.

Keunggulan lain, titik beku (freezing point) PertaminaSAF melampaui standar internasional. Taufik mengatakan, menurut standar internasional, spesifikasi titik beku avtur pada ketinggian yang jelajah pesawat komersial yakni minus 47 derajat celcius. Sementara di ketinggian yang sama, titik beku PertaminaSAF, bisa lebih rendah dari spesifikasi tersebut.

“PertaminaSAF tidak akan membeku di kondisi ekstrem, sehingga aman digunakan selama penerbangan. Aspek keselamatan yang sesuai bahkan melebihi standar internasional menjadikan produk ini memiliki nilai tambah yang semakin tinggi,” tutur Taufik.

Pemerintahan Presiden Prabowo Subianto punya cita-cita besar untuk membangun ekosistem hilirisasi rumput laut. Industri ini diproyeksikan mampu mendatangkan manfaat ekonomi sangat besar, hingga mencapai ratusan miliar dolar Amerika Serikat (AS).

Wakil Menteri Pendidikan Tinggi, Sains, dan Teknologi (Diktisaintek) Stella Christie mulanya bicara tentang pentingnya riset sebagai motor pertumbuhan ekonomi bangsa. Ia juga menekankan, manfaat riset bukan hanya sekadar omon-omon belaka bagi perkembangan negara, salah satunya dalam hal pengembangan industri rumput laut

""Bukan sekadar omon-omon bahwa Indonesia harus penelitian, tetapi nilai ekonominya bisa terasa, baik dalam jangka pendek, maupun dalam jangka panjang. Seperti rumput laut yang harus dibangun dari sekarang,"" kata Stella, dalam acara Pesta Rakyat Untuk Indonesia 2025 di Gedung Smesco, Jakarta Selatan, Sabtu (23/8/2025).

Indonesia merupakan penghasil rumput laut tropis terbesar di dunia. Stella mengatakan, saat ini pasaran rumput laut di dunia mencapai US$ 12 miliar. Namun demikian, Indonesia belum mendapatkan porsi yang banyak dari pasaran dunia tersebut karena belum mengoptimalkan risetnya.

Stella mengingatkan, ratusan miliar dolar AS itu akan hadir apabila industri tersebut benar-benar dibangun. Rumput laut tidak hanya bisa diekspor dalam bentuk mentahan, tetapi juga bisa diolah menjadi nori, bahkan hingga sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""Targetnya suatu saat, ini panjang waktunya, mungkin 10 tahunan, SAF targetnya itu 4 miliar liter di Indonesia. Artinya 10% dari jet fuel demand di dunia, itu akan ratusan miliar dolar AS pasarannya untuk Indonesia. Membuka lapangan pekerjaan yang sangat besar,"" ujar dia.

Namun Stella mengingatkan kembali, apabila ekosistem tidak segera dibangun, bisa-bisa potensi tersebut lenyap begitu saja. Hal ini mengingat negara penghasil produk olahan rumput laut bukan hanya Indonesia.

""Ratusan miliar dolar AS, kalau dibangun. Kalau tidak dibangun, hilang itu ratusan miliar dolar AS. Hilang lapangan pekerjaan yang bisa kita capai. Riset tidak terlepas dari kalian semua,"" ujarnya.

Stella menekankan bahwa riset tidak terlepas dari kehidupan masyarakat. Ia juga mengajak masyarakat bersama-sama mengubah persepsi bahwa riset itu bukan mahal, lambat, ataupun menghasilkan tulisan yang tidak dibaca, tetapi justru efisien, cepat, dan bermanfaat.

""Bahwa riset bukanlah biaya atau beban yang sia-sia. Riset adalah investasi,"" ujar dia.

Selaras dengan hal ini, Kemendiktisaintek sedang bekerja sama dengan Universitas Mataram sebagai perguruan tinggi yang memiliki banyak peneliti andal terkait komoditas rumput laut atau seaweed. Rencananya, perguruan tinggi tersebut akan dijadikan sebagai pusat risetnya.

Untuk merealisasikannya, Kemendiktisaintek juga bekerja sama dengan University of California (UC) Berkeley, Beijing Institute of Genomics dari China, dan industri terkait dalam proses penelitiannya.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Delta's bet on Wheels Up is a high-conviction play on the democratization of private aviation.","The airline industry is undergoing a seismic shift. As traditional carriers grapple with margin pressures and shifting consumer preferences, a new frontier is emerging: private aviation. Delta Air Lines, long a leader in commercial aviation, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation through its strategic investment in Wheels Up, a private jet provider. This partnership isn't just a diversification play—it's a calculated bet on the future of premium travel, leveraging Delta's operational expertise, 20 million SkyMiles members, and a growing demand for high-net-worth (HNWI) mobility.

The Case for Consolidation and Premiumization

The airline sector in 2025 is defined by two overlapping trends: consolidation and premiumization. Full-service carriers (FSCs) and low-cost carriers (LCCs) are blurring their business models, with FSCs adopting cost-cutting measures and LCCs adding premium features to compete. Meanwhile, the private aviation market is booming, driven by a 12% annual increase in business jet deliveries and a 3% rise in global private jet departures in Q1 2025. This growth is fueled by HNWIs—particularly a younger, tech-savvy cohort—who prioritize flexibility, wellness, and sustainability over traditional luxury.

Delta's partnership with Wheels Up taps into this demand. By integrating Wheels Up into its ecosystem, Delta is not only expanding its revenue streams but also redefining access to private aviation. The collaboration allows SkyMiles members to earn one million miles for using Wheels Up, incentivizing 20 million frequent flyers to explore private travel. This is a masterstroke: Delta's sales teams, which manage 45,000 corporate accounts, now serve as a direct pipeline to Wheels Up's hybrid aviation model.

Wheels Up's Restructuring: A Blueprint for Profitability

Wheels Up's financials tell a story of disciplined restructuring. In Q2 2025, the company reduced its net loss by 15% to $82.3 million and trimmed its Adjusted EBITDA loss by 22%. While revenue dipped 3% to $189.6 million, the company's Adjusted Contribution Margin improved by 12.2%, and it maintained a 98% flight completion rate. These metrics underscore Wheels Up's progress in stabilizing its operations.

The company's cost-cutting measures—targeting $50 million in annual savings—will accelerate profitability by 2026. Simultaneously, Wheels Up is modernizing its fleet, shifting toward premium aircraft like the Phenom 300 and Challenger models. By 2025, these planes will comprise 44% of its fleet, enhancing customer appeal and unit economics. Delta's supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) further aligns the partnership with ESG trends, a critical factor for HNWIs who increasingly demand eco-conscious travel options.

The Hybrid Model: Democratizing Private Aviation

Wheels Up's most compelling innovation is its hybrid aviation experience. Customers can now combine Delta's commercial flights with private jet segments, creating seamless, flexible itineraries. For example, a Delta One passenger flying to Athens can add a private jet leg to Capri or Montenegro—all through a unified platform. This model addresses a key pain point: the high cost and complexity of private travel. By offering a “best of both worlds” solution, Wheels Up is democratizing access to private aviation, targeting not just ultra-HNWIs but also high-income professionals seeking occasional luxury.

The data supports this strategy. The Knight Frank Wealth Report notes that demand for super-midsize and large cabin jets has surged among HNWIs, with 23.3% and 7.4% of sales in 2025, respectively. Delta's integration with Wheels Up positions it to capture this demand, leveraging its global network to offer international private jet access. For instance, the U.S. accounts for 69.1% of global private jet departures, with California and Texas as growth hubs—markets where Delta's brand strength and customer base are unparalleled.

Investment Implications: A High-Conviction Play

For investors, the Delta-Wheels Up partnership represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector poised for long-term growth. Wheels Up's restructuring, combined with Delta's operational rigor and customer access, creates a flywheel effect: improved unit economics, expanded market reach, and enhanced customer retention. The company's liquidity—$262 million in gross bookings and $200 million in available funds—provides a buffer as it scales.

Moreover, the private aviation market is projected to grow to $40 billion by 2025, nearly double its 2021 valuation. Delta's early-mover advantage in integrating private and commercial travel could lock in market share as demand accelerates. The airline's ability to monetize SkyMiles through Wheels Up promotions adds another revenue stream, with potential for cross-subsidization between its commercial and private segments.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is without risk. Wheels Up's path to profitability remains uncertain, and the private aviation market is still niche compared to commercial aviation. Regulatory hurdles, supply chain bottlenecks, and competition from rivals like Flexjet and JetBlue's JetBlue Private Jets could test the partnership's resilience. Additionally, the success of the hybrid model hinges on Delta's ability to convert SkyMiles members into Wheels Up users—a behavioral shift that requires sustained marketing and value delivery.

However, these risks are mitigated by Delta's operational expertise and the structural tailwinds of the private aviation sector. The company's commitment to Wheels Up—evidenced by CEO Ed Bastian's public endorsements—signals a long-term vision, not a short-term experiment.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future of Travel

Delta's partnership with Wheels Up is more than a strategic pivot—it's a reimagining of premium travel. By combining Delta's scale, loyalty program, and global network with Wheels Up's innovative hybrid model, the duo is addressing the unmet needs of HNWIs and high-income professionals. As the private aviation market matures and becomes more accessible, this partnership is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the $40 billion opportunity.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Delta's bet on Wheels Up is a high-conviction play on the democratization of private aviation. With restructuring progress, fleet modernization, and a growing demand for premium mobility, this is a long-term investment in the future of travel. The question isn't whether private aviation will grow—it's who will lead the charge. Delta and Wheels Up are already ahead of the curve.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 18:56:21.155368

Gevo Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer, Agiri Oluwagbemileke Yusuf, sold 57,651 shares of Gevo stock on August 20, 2025, at a weighted average price of $1.6295 per share, totaling $93,942 [1]. This sale comes amidst the company's positive Q2 2025 earnings report, which featured a net income of $2.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $17 million. The financial results were driven by successful low-carbon ethanol and carbon capture acquisitions.

Gevo's CEO remains optimistic about the company's future growth prospects, particularly in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and carbon credit sales sectors. The company aims to meet the growing global demand for renewable fuels, a segment that is expected to expand significantly in the coming years.

Separately, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has made significant strides in the renewable energy sector. The company's Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification, allowing it to produce SAF from used cooking oil [2]. This certification is a significant milestone for the Indian aviation industry, which is committed to reducing emissions by blending SAF with conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF).

The Panipat refinery's SAF production will start at 35,000 tonnes per annum, enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027. The certification process ensures that the fuel meets environmental and social standards, setting a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

As the aviation industry continues to adapt to stricter emission standards, companies like Gevo and IOC are at the forefront of innovation, developing sustainable solutions to meet the evolving energy dynamics.

Thandasherry accepted the dare and built a small solar boat in the following months.
At the outset, Thandesherry worked on a few other smaller solar boat projects, mainly for fishing, “but we could not scale the business in the segment”.
I am building boats which are better and cheaper for my customers.
The CEO claims that a Navalt boat needs only 17 kW of power, while a traditional steel boat requires 45 kW of energy.","Whether it’s the shikaras traversing the calm backwaters of Alleppey (Alappuzha), carrying tourists past the coconut groves and quaint fishing villages, or ferries enabling daily commute between townships, or the fishing rafts braving the rough waters of the Arabian Sea to bring food and livelihood, boats are an inseparable part of hustle and leisure in Kerala.

Even as these vessels are woven into the very fabric of life in this southern state, what is hardly talked about is the spiralling cost of running them.

At a time when exports to the US present fresh challenges, Kerala fishermen are battling the changing dynamics of geopolitics and climate change on one hand and the increasing cost of fuel on the other.

The impact is especially severe on fishing communities, as every segment of boat operators is struggling to improve margins amid the rising fuel prices.

As per Kochi-based ex-naval architect Sandith Thandasherry, ferry operators in Kerala are currently spending as much as INR 10,000 daily on diesel per boat, which is significantly impacting their margins.

“My aim has been to solve this problem,” said Thandasherry, who is building solar and electric boats precisely for this cause — to reduce this yearly operational cost by INR 35 Lakh.

His startup, Navalt, is helping coastal communities earn better livelihoods while driving a major shift in water transportation.

Interestingly, Thandasherry is trying to make waves in the boat manufacturing industry at a time when the decarbonisation push has largely been centred around road mobility, with electric vehicles (EVs) taking the spotlight.

With EV adoption no longer a major headache for roads, the aviation sector is clearly witnessing early efforts around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), although large-scale adoption remains a daring effort due to the complexities of the sector. Water transport, on the other hand, continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Navalt is trying to control a portion of this damage with its solar-electric boats. So, what has truly driven Thandasherry’s interest in solving this real-world problem that has remained overlooked for decades?

A Dare That Led To Navalt

Growing up in Kerala, Thandasherry’s tryst with building boats and ships began in his schooldays, as his family kept encouraging him to pursue naval architecture and engineering.

After his graduation in naval architecture from IIT Madras in 1999, he worked as a naval architect for seven years. During this time, he was part of various shipbuilding projects across Japan and South Korea.

“But unlike what you may think, building solar boats was never part of the plan,” the founder and chief executive of Navalt told Inc42.

Armed with the experience in building ships and an MBA from INSEAD, Thandasherry started giving wings to his entrepreneurial dreams in 2008 by establishing his first venture, Navgathi Marine Design and Construction — a consulting firm that was focussed on making boats efficient and sustainable.

But, within a year, destiny charted a new course for him. Call it a stroke of luck, Thandasherry met a client who showed him a solar boat, which couldn’t evade the seasoned naval engineer’s sharp technical eyes.

He was quick to identify flaws in the design and other inefficiencies, triggering his client just enough to throw him a challenge to build a better solar boat for him.

Thandasherry accepted the dare and built a small solar boat in the following months. This sparked the idea of building boats powered by solar and electric.

At the outset, Thandesherry worked on a few other smaller solar boat projects, mainly for fishing, “but we could not scale the business in the segment”.

This did not stop him. He knew his way forward and decided to build large solar ferries and passenger boats.

He took almost three years to build the tech from scratch and officially launched the first solar and solar-electric passenger boat in 2017, under the parent company Navalt.

Besides its flagship passenger boat named Aditya, the startup today offers fast boats (named Barracuda) to the defence sector, yachts (Vanora), fishing boats (Srav), and roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) boats (Kraken) for carrying heavy vehicles.

Earlier this year, it started exporting its passenger boats, Apollo, to the Maldives. In India, its boats are operational in Kochi in Kerala, Bathinda in Punjab, and Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, just to name a few states.

What’s Under The Hood

The primary objective for the founder has been to help boat and ferry operators achieve better unit economics.

“If I start selling ‘green’ as the value proposition, nobody cares in India. I am building boats which are better and cheaper for my customers. A greener alternative comes as a bonus,” said Thandasherry.

But it was never about technology alone, as the design aspect has always been deeply ingrained in Navalt’s thesis.

Explaining the way Navalt is married to design with efficiency, the CEO said that a locally built 75-seater steel boat weighs around 75 tonnes, but its Aditya weighs just 17 tonnes, thanks to glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and aluminium.

Besides, the Kochi-based startup has used the computational fluid dynamics technique in its design to reduce the drag of its vessels. The result — reduced energy requirements.

The CEO claims that a Navalt boat needs only 17 kW of power, while a traditional steel boat requires 45 kW of energy.

The boat manufacturer also boasts that the sun powers 70% of the total energy its boats need in a day, and only 30% requirements are met by lithium-ion battery-powered electricity.

“Overall, this cuts running costs by 35X,” the founder said.

However, the upfront cost of these boats is higher compared to fossil-fuel-driven ferries. For instance, Navalt’s Aditya, a 75-seater passenger boat, costs around INR 3.5 Cr, while its diesel counterpart is priced at INR 1.5 Cr.

“But customers recognise the unit economics benefits in the long haul,” he said.

Inside Navalt’s Boatonomic

Since its inception, Navalt has delivered a total of 35 orders. In the first year of its sales, its top line stood at a mere INR 1.7 Cr.

Its revenue stood at INR 17 Cr in FY24 compared to INR 16 Cr in FY23.

Navalt had an order book of 25 boats worth INR 75 Cr in FY25. It managed to deliver 12 boats during the year, clocking a revenue of INR 25 Cr. Despite occasional financial hiccups, the startup has managed to maintain profitability over the last five years.

The Kerala government is Navalt’s biggest customer in terms of order volume. The company has so far delivered 15 orders to the state government. But, this entails a challenge — state-owned entities and government undertakings are infamous for taking more time to make payments, throwing Navalt in rough waters.

For the ongoing fiscal year, Navalt’s order book stands at 37. This order value translates to INR 90 Cr, up 20% YoY.

To keep its boat afloat (pun intended), Navalt raised its first institutional round last month from Banayan Tree Private Equity. The founder did not disclose the total amount of funding Navalt has raised so far.

Fathoming Navalt’s Knots

According to Thandasherry, selling boats is not all plain sailing. Scaling it is a bigger challenge since geographical expansion is difficult, and so is the transportation of large boats to the hinterlands.

“Boat-making business demands a scale where manufacturers should have at least 20 shipbuilding or assembly yards around the country to serve every location,” the founder said, adding that Navalt may take some time to achieve that kind of scale.

Amid turbulent tides, Navalt is moving ahead with resilience.

Last year, the startup ventured into offering electric propulsion systems to other boat builders in India under the brand name Greenship, expanding its offerings and revenue stream. “In the new business, we are getting volume, and it is easier to scale,” shared Thandasherry.

Navalt’s Greenship propulsion system found its first client in Goa, where it launched the state’s first solar boat, making it the first-ever project where the startup’s propulsion system was plugged into a boat built in a different shipyard.

The startup now has more ambitious plans built on its cleantech moat. Aces up its sleeves are the hydrogen fuel cell technology and a propeller that runs on wind. This gives a third alternative to its customers to save money.

Besides, to address the working capital woes, the solar and electric boat builder wants to shift its dependency from government-led projects to acquiring orders from private players and imports.

“Currently, 70% of our orders come from the government, and the rest are private players. Going forward, we want to reverse this ratio,” the founder said.

The research, led by Professors Hong Yang and Yuanhui Zhang from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, presents a scalable solution that tackles both food waste and fossil fuel dependence. Their findings, published in Science Advances, mark the first SAF production from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

Zhang noted that while there is already ongoing industry activity around SAF production in North America, it largely relies on feedstocks that compete with the food supply, such as soybean oil.

He highlighted that the United States consumes approximately 40 million tons of jet fuel annually, with SAF currently accounting for only about 1 percent. However, he emphasized that this figure could potentially rise to 10 percent–20 percent if biowaste were more widely utilized.

SAF, unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, is produced from renewable resources including biomass, food waste, sewage sludge, and algae. Zhang’s lab has spent nearly three decades developing biocrude oil using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that accelerates the natural formation of crude oil from millions of years to just 30 minutes.

The team sourced food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, selecting salad dressing due to its uniformity, high energy content, and ease of processing. The waste was converted into biocrude using HTL and then refined into SAF through catalytic upgrading using nanocatalysts developed in Yang’s lab.

Yang explained that molybdenum carbide is a favorable catalyst for the process due to its outer shell electrons, which interact with biocrude molecules to effectively remove oxygen. He further underscored that there is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.

Siying Yu, a graduate student at Illinois and the study’s first author, explained that the catalysts must be fine-tuned by incorporating iron atoms and other elements to generate fuel molecules with molecular weights similar to those found in conventional jet fuel.

The research team at Illinois aims to further improve their catalyst design to process a wider variety of bio feedstocks, including algae, sewage, and fermentation products. The technology may also apply to SAF production from oleochemicals and crop-based materials. The study included contributors from multiple departments and institutions, including Washington State University.",https://cdn.gccbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/23191654/food-waste-into-aviation-fuel.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 17:56:38.693315

BINTULU, Aug 23: Sarawak is drafting a new law to mandate the collection of agricultural waste, including oil palm kernels, to be processed into animal feed and biogas as part of efforts to strengthen the State’s circular economy.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg revealed that the Attorney-General’s Chambers is currently drafting the legal framework, which is expected to be ready by the end of this year, to give Sarawak authority to gather agriculture by-products at scale.

“Our aim is to ensure that oil palm kernel waste can be turned into something valuables such as nutritious animal feed when mixed with napier grass, as well as biomass that generates biogas and even Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF),” he said when officiating the Sarawak Agrofest 2025 at the Bintulu Old Airport today.

Abang Johari stressed that while Sarawak has already overtaken Sabah to become Malaysia’s largest oil palm producer, the State has yet to fully exploit the potential of its kernel industry.

With the right mechanisms and economies of scale, he said, the waste could become a new source of income while reducing the Sarawak’s reliance on imported feed.

“Cattle fed with enriched feed in feedlots grow faster and healthier compared to open grazing. At the same time, biomass from palm kernels can be processed into biogas, and biogas into biofuel, including aviation fuel. This is how we diversify income streams and add value within the circular economy,” he explained.

The Premier also noted that Sarawak has vast land resources for cattle development but faces a shortage of expertise, particularly veterinarians.

To address this, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Sarawak has established a veterinary discipline, while the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) is working to boost manpower in the sector.

He pointed out that cattle farming in Sarawak must differ from the traditional Australian model of open grazing, with the State instead moving towards feedlot systems that rely on locally produced feed.

“NCR landowners who have developed oil palm plantations can also diversify into feedlot and feedstock industries. But to succeed, there must be legal backing and scale in order for us to collect waste effectively and turn it into valuable products,” he said.

Abang Johari added that Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development Minister Dato Sri Dr Stephen Rundi Utom has visited Brazil to study the latest technologies in livestock and feed development that could be adopted in Sarawak.

Emphasising the broader vision, the Premier said the State’s strategy is not only about boosting food security but also about positioning Sarawak as a producer of next-generation fuels.

“Airlines worldwide are required to use SAF. From our oil palm industry, we can produce this fuel and earn income, making our economy more sustainable. That is the Sarawak way—creating value from resources through innovation,” he said.

Union Unite stated six months ago – on February 23 – Mr Starmer was speaking at the Scottish Labour conference when he promised to make £200 million available from the National Wealth Fund for Grangemouth.

Unite added, despite the refinery, the last one in Scotland, ceasing production in April and hundreds of jobs being shed at the complex, including at the chemicals plant and among contractors based at the site, not one penny of the promised investment has been spent.

Now, in response to what they see as the UK government’s inaction, workers and Unite at Grangemouth have posted an open letter which they are encouraging all affected workers and members of the local community to sign.

The letter states: “As the number of job losses grows each week – there is still absolutely no evidence of any of the £200 million being spent at Grangemouth. Money that was pledged for the revival of Scotland’s industrial cluster. “It’s as clear as ever the fight for the future of Grangmeouth falls to us, politicians may be forgetting what they said but we haven’t. Sign the petition today and demand that Keir Starmer show us the money.”

Unite stated it has produced a detailed and fully costed plan about how the refinery could be transitioned to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The government is promoting the use of SAF to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Unite senior representative at Grangemouth Chris Hamilton said: “Workers and members of the community feel abandoned by a government that has promised to help but has so far totally failed to deliver.

The incident, while disruptive, offered a stark but instructive glimpse into how energy infrastructure must adapt to climate-driven volatility—and how crisis management strategies can shape investor perceptions in an era of escalating environmental risks.

Operational Resilience: From Emergency Response to Long-Term Adaptation

BP's immediate response to the flooding demonstrated a layered approach to risk mitigation. The refinery's emergency protocols included controlled shutdowns of processing units, emergency flaring to relieve pressure, and the deployment of containment booms to prevent water contamination. Specialized equipment was used to remove water from critical zones, while wastewater management systems—retention ponds, containment berms, and stormwater diversion—prevented discharges into natural waterways. These actions, combined with 24/7 coordination with regulators and local authorities, minimized environmental harm and ensured operational safety.

The refinery's phased restart, prioritizing system stability, underscored BP's commitment to operational continuity. By resuming full capacity within a week, the company mitigated regional fuel supply disruptions and stabilized markets. However, the incident also exposed vulnerabilities. The Whiting Refinery had already faced a six-month shutdown in 2024 due to a hydrogen leak and has incurred regulatory penalties in recent years. These recurring challenges have eroded refining margins and raised questions about the long-term viability of aging infrastructure in a climate of increasing extreme weather events.

Environmental Safeguards and Investor Sentiment

BP's environmental safeguards during the crisis were critical in managing reputational and regulatory risks. Air quality monitoring during flaring ensured emissions remained below harmful thresholds, while transparent communication with the public reinforced trust. Yet, these efforts were not enough to fully restore investor confidence.

BP's shares, trading at 419.5 GBX in August 2025, remained 70% below their estimated intrinsic value of 1,381.44 GBX, reflecting broader concerns about refining reliability and ESG performance. The company's underlying replacement cost (RC) profits had declined by 36% in 2024, and ESG downgrades from MSCI and Sustainalytics had increased financing costs. While BP's refining availability reached 96.4% in Q2 2025, the Whiting incident highlighted the fragility of its refining segment, particularly as diesel and jet fuel inventories remain low, squeezing margins.

Strategic Investments in Climate Resilience

BP's response to the 2025 crisis also revealed its long-term adaptation strategy. The refinery has invested in elevated electrical equipment, reinforced containment areas, and advanced weather monitoring systems with predictive modeling. These measures align with industry trends to harden infrastructure against climate risks. Additionally, BP's transformation of the Gelsenkirchen refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel signals a pivot toward the energy transition, though such projects require sustained capital and operational discipline.

For investors, the key question is whether these investments will offset recurring operational risks. While BP has cut structural costs by $1.7 billion since 2023, its refining segment remains under pressure. shows BP trailing its peers, amplifying concerns about its ability to compete in a decarbonizing energy landscape.

Investment Implications and the Path Forward

The Whiting Refinery incident underscores a critical truth: in the energy transition era, resilience is not just about avoiding disasters but about demonstrating the capacity to recover swiftly and sustainably. For BP, this means balancing short-term operational reliability with long-term decarbonization goals.

Investors should monitor two key metrics:

1. Refining Availability Trends: Sustained improvements in uptime will signal progress in addressing infrastructure vulnerabilities.

2. Energy Transition Execution: Success in projects like Gelsenkirchen's sustainable aviation fuel conversion will determine BP's ability to align with net-zero targets.

While BP's stock appears undervalued relative to intrinsic value models, its path to recovery hinges on credible climate resilience and ESG improvements. For risk-tolerant investors, the company's strategic investments in infrastructure hardening and low-carbon technologies could offer long-term upside. However, those prioritizing stability may prefer peers with stronger refining margins and ESG ratings.

In the end, the Whiting Refinery's story is a microcosm of the energy sector's broader challenge: navigating the dual pressures of climate adaptation and decarbonization. For BP, the next phase of its journey will test whether its crisis management strategies can evolve into a blueprint for sustainable resilience.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 15:56:15.082938

Passengers may still carry one power bank in their hand luggage, but strict new rules will apply to how it’s stored and used during the flight. The Emirates power bank ban of 2025 follows a growing global concern over lithium battery safety.

The new regulations of the Emirates power bank ban:

Following a comprehensive safety review, Emirates announced the ban to reduce risks linked to lithium-ion batteries. The key restrictions are:

Only one power bank is allowed per passenger, with a capacity under 100 watt-hours (Wh).

Power banks cannot be used to charge personal devices during the flight.

Charging power banks from the aircraft’s outlets is prohibited.

The capacity rating must be visible on the device.

Power banks must be stored in the seat pocket or under the seat, not in overhead bins.

Power banks remain banned from checked baggage (existing rule).

Why Is Emirates Banning In-Flight Power Bank Use?

The use of lithium-ion battery power banks has surged in recent years, but so have incidents of overheating and fires. The main risk comes from thermal runaway — a chain reaction where heat builds uncontrollably inside the battery, potentially causing fire, explosion, or toxic gas release.

While most modern smartphones have safeguards against overcharging, many basic or low-cost power banks lack these protections. By banning in-flight use and restricting charging, Emirates aims to minimise the chance of battery-related incidents in the air.

What This Means for Passengers

Long-haul travellers who rely on power banks mid-flight will need to fully charge devices before boarding or use the aircraft’s built-in USB and AC power points. Before flying, check your power bank’s watt-hour rating to ensure it meets the 100 Wh limit, and make sure the label is visible.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/800_businessclass3.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 15:56:22.392401

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg, in officiating the launch of Sarawak Agrofest 2025 here today, announced the establishment of the Sarawak Artificial Intelligence Centre (SAIC).

The centre will spearhead research and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in farming and other sectors.

“Agriculture is no longer just about manual labour or traditional methods. With SAIC, we will harness AI to analyse soil composition, identify optimal fertilisers, and match them with local land conditions to maximise yields,” he said.

Citing a successful transformation in Kuala Rajang, Abang Johari noted that 800 hectares of idle land, left barren for over 50 years, were revived for paddy cultivation.

With the aid of technology, these lands now produce up to eight metric tonnes per hectare annually.

“With land and technology, we no longer need to rely on imports. This transformation proves that AI can unlock our soil’s hidden potential and make Sarawak a significant rice producer,” he said.

To further support productivity, the Premier revealed that the Sarawak government is investing RM1 billion in irrigation systems and boosting mechanisation in farming.

In Gedong, for example, mechanised practices raised yields from just 1.2 metric tonnes per season to eight tonnes annually, boosting household incomes by eightfold in 24 months.

Abang Johari also outlined Sarawak’s shift toward a circular agro-economy, where palm kernel biomass is being converted into animal feed, biofuel, and even sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

With Sarawak recently overtaking Sabah as Malaysia’s largest palm oil producer, he said these innovations will reduce imports and open new revenue streams.

Looking ahead, Abang Johari shared several broader economic visions, including renaming Universiti Putra Malaysia Sarawak (UPMS) to boost research; launching Sarawak’s own airline to expand export potential; and introducing free university education from 2026, as part of the government’s commitment to reinvest Sarawak’s wealth into human capital development.

“This is not a ‘Mat Jenin’ dream. With clear policies, methods, and political stability under Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), we are determined to transform agriculture into a lucrative profession powered by knowledge and innovation,” he said.

Abang Johari also highlighted that Sarawak’s annual revenue has grown from RM6 billion to RM14 billion, enabling reinvestment into education and rural development.

“This is the future of Sarawak: strong ideas, stability, and sustainable growth that benefit our people,” he added.

Secara teknis, bioavtur yang diproduksi di RU IV Cilacap telah memenuhi standar kualitas nasional melalui Surat Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi Nomor 70 Tahun 2025, serta standar internasional ASTM D1655 dan Defstan 91-091, syarat penting agar bahan bakar tersebut dapat dipakai aman pada pesawat terbang.

Untuk memastikan pasokan bahan baku yang stabil, Pertamina merangkul masyarakat lewat program pengumpulan minyak jelantah. Saat ini 35 titik pengumpulan telah didirikan di lokasi-lokasi strategis, memberi kemudahan bagi warga mengelola limbah rumah tangga sekaligus menerima saldo rupiah sebagai insentif.

Dadan mengatakan transisi energi bersih di Indonesia bukan sekadar wacana, melainkan rangkaian langkah praktis, mulai dari pemanfaatan potensi bioenergi, integrasi teknologi kilang, dan partisipasi masyarakat dalam pasokan.

Namun, masih ada pekerjaan rumah, terutama pada pengembangan bioetanol dan penguatan kerja sama lintas lembaga.

""Pertamina bersama seluruh stakeholders sudah membuktikan kita ini raja untuk biodiesel di dunia. Tidak ada yang mengalahkan untuk yang ini. Tapi kita masih punya tantangan untuk yang bioetanol. Banyak pekerjaan sudah dilakukan, memang kami mengajak bahwa tidak bisa hanya sektor hilir yang bertanggung jawab,"" tuturnya.

Pengembangan SAF ini bukan lompatan tanpa jejak. Sejak 2021, kolaborasi Pertamina dengan Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) telah menghasilkan bahan bakar dengan campuran bioavtur hingga 2,4% (J2,4) melalui mekanisme coprocessing di TDHT 1 RU IV Cilacap.

Uji coba pertama dilakukan pada bulan Oktober 2021 menggunakan pesawat teregistrasi militer Dirgantara Indonesia, CN235-200 FTB, rute Bandung-Jakarta.

Dua tahun kemudian, pada Oktober 2023, pengujian dilanjutkan untuk pesawat komersial dengan uji terbang Boeing 737-800 milik Garuda rute Jakarta-Solo-Jakarta, sebuah rangkaian yang memperkuat bukti kesiapan penggunaan bahan bakar hijau pada armada pesawat.

Direktur Utama KPI, Taufik Aditiyawarman mengatakan penerbangan ini bukan sekadar perjalanan udara biasa, melainkan tanda transisi energi yang semakin nyata di Indonesia.

""Pertamina SAF adalah sebuah langkah besar dalam dunia aviasi di Indonesia. Penerbangan spesial ini sekaligus menjadi bukti kalau KPI bisa menjadi pelopor energi hijau di Indonesia. Produk ini membuktikan bahwa kita memiliki kapabilitas dalam memproduksi produk bahan bakar pesawat masa depan,"" ungkap Taufik.

Ia menambahkan, Pertamina SAF merupakan produk berkualitas dan ramah lingkungan yang diproduksi oleh salah satu unit operasi KPI, yakni Kilang Cilacap. Produk ini telah melewati serangkaian pengujian kualitas yang ketat di laboratorium KPI Unit Cilacap dan juga di laboratorium eksternal independen Lemigas.

""Ke depan, Pertamina SAF juga akan diujicobakan untuk diproduksi di Kilang Dumai dan Kilang Balongan,"" tambah Taufik.

Produksi Pertamina SAF dilakukan dengan teknologi co-processing, menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih buatan anak bangsa. Hasilnya, Pertamina SAF dinyatakan memenuhi standar internasional ASTM D1655 dan DefStan 91-091.

Menurut Taufik, kualitas Pertamina SAF tidak kalah jika dibandingkan dengan produk serupa yang digunakan di negara lain. Pertamina SAF merupakan upaya konkret dalam percepatan pengurangan emisi karbon sebab kandungan karbon di dalamnya lebih rendah 81% dibanding avtur berbahan fosil.

""Pertamina SAF adalah bioavtur sustainable pertama yang memiliki sertifikat internasional sustainability ISCC CORSIA berbahan baku campuran UCO atau minyak jelantah yang diproduksi di Indonesia,"" kata Taufik.

Keunggulan lain, titik beku (freezing point) Pertamina SAF melampaui standar internasional. Taufik mengatakan, menurut standar internasional, spesifikasi titik beku avtur pada ketinggian yang jelajah pesawat komersial yakni minus 47 derajat celcius. Sementara di ketinggian yang sama, titik beku Pertamina SAF, bisa lebih rendah dari spesifikasi tersebut.

""Pertamina SAF tidak akan membeku di kondisi ekstrem, sehingga aman digunakan selama penerbangan. Aspek keselamatan yang sesuai bahkan melebihi standar internasional menjadikan produk ini memiliki nilai tambah yang semakin tinggi,"" tutur Taufik.",https://awsimages.detik.net.id/api/wm/2025/08/22/pertama-di-indonesia-minyak-jelantah-jadi-bahan-bakar-pesawat-1755834927165_169.jpeg?wid=54&w=650&v=1&t=jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 17:56:57.348066

Extreme weather events cause food price hikes and social unrest. Airlines are ignoring sustainable aviation fuel, but does it matter?

Forests are going from carbon sinks to carbon sources

By absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere for photosynthesis during the day and releasing excess CO2 into the air at night, vegetation (in forests, grasslands, mangroves, peatlands, swamps, etc.) has played a crucial role in keeping the atmospheric CO2 level just right for humans since the last Ice Age.

CO2 makes up only 0.04% of the air around us, but even at such a low concentration it has, for the last 12,000 years, kept the global temperature at an average of about 15oC, which has allowed humans to thrive over most of the world’s land surface. To use the now well-worn metaphor, atmospheric CO2 acts like a blanket around the Earth to stop us freezing to death. Without it, most of the incoming sun’s energy would be radiated back in to space and the average global temperature would be about -21oC – much too cold for humans. But the amount needs to be just right. Too little CO2 in the atmosphere and it gets too cold for humans, too much and it gets too hot for human comfort, health and, eventually, survival. Just for comparison, the global difference between an ice age and a period between ice ages has averaged about 5oC.

Over the last 200 or so years, humans have been pumping more and more CO2 into the atmosphere, principally as a result of burning fossil fuels and releasing the carbon in them that has been buried deep underground for the last 300 million years. Thankfully, vegetation has been doing humans a great service by removing about 30% of that additional fossil fuel-generated CO2. Forests, in particular, have played a highly significant part in this removal process and are often referred to as “net carbon sinks” because they absorb more CO2 from the air during the day than they release into it at night.

Over recent decades, however, the ability of the world’s forests to absorb CO2 has declined and CO2 emissions from them have increased. The inevitable outcome has been a reduction of the net carbon sink created by forests. The histogram below shows that 20 years ago forests had a net effect of removing around 8 Gt CO2/year, but that it has been steadily decreasing since then and in 2023 and 2024 it was about only 2 Gt CO2/year. The result has been an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, increased and accelerated global warming, more extreme weather events, some of which are also more extreme, and increased harm to humans and damage to food and water security, infrastructure and the environment itself.

The principal cause of forests’ declining sink effect during the 21st century has been humans (see histogram below). Half the decline in the size of the sink has been due to the clearing of forests for agriculture, but logging has also been a significant problem. The area of forest cleared for mining, human settlements and infrastructure has overall been very small, but it has had devastating effects on many local ecosystems and communities, particularly Indigenous populations.

The situation changed in 2023 and 2024 when extreme fires all around the world and across many latitudes caused a 75% reduction in forests’ ability to absorb CO2 and a 2-3 fold increase in the CO2 produced by trees.

The good news is that globally forests still act as a net carbon sink, but the bad news is that the effect is weakening and some forests, such as the Bolivian Amazon and the Canadian boreal forests, are now net sources of carbon.

What do we need to do to protect the ability of forests to continue to function as a net carbon sink and protect Earth’s Goldilocks temperature? Same old, same old:

Stop logging native forests and let naturally regenerating secondary forests stand longer. Middle-aged secondary forests and tropical and sub-tropical primary forests are particularly good at absorbing CO2;

Reduce fire risk through prescribed burns, thinning, fire-resilient reforestation, etc.;

Sustainably manage working forests;

Support the Indigenous people who have over time proven themselves good at protecting forests;

Reduce the overconsumption of food, timber, minerals etc. and align supply chains with forest protection; and one other thing … what can it be?

… oh yes, reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

(For completeness, I’ll also mention that when the Earth warms due to more CO2 in the atmosphere, the area covered by ice diminishes and the land and water surface area grows. Ice, being highly reflective, reflects much of the sun’s energy that hits it back into space, but land and sea absorb much more of that incoming energy than ice. So, as the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rises, not only does Earth get a thicker blanket, it also replaces a mirror with a red brick pavement.)

Extreme weather events, food prices and social upheavals

Since 2022, there have been multiple examples of extreme weather events (higher temperatures, floods, droughts, hail and cyclones, sometimes followed by opportunist pests) affecting an agricultural area and causing a rapid rise in the price of food. Sometimes several crops have been damaged and sometimes one in particular; sometimes the damage has been mainly local, sometimes global, sometimes temporary and sometimes long-term. For instance:

Heat waves in East Asia in 2024 caused increases in the price of Korean cabbage by 70% and Japanese rice by 50%;

Droughts in California and Arizona in 2022 contributed to an 80% rise in US vegetable prices, and in Southern Europe in 2022/23 droughts caused a 50% rise in the price of Spanish olive oil, which constitutes 40% of world supply;

Following a drought in 2023, heat waves in February 2024 in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which together supply nearly 60% of the world’s cocoa, caused cocoa prices to increase globally by 300% by April;

And who could forget that floods in Queensland in 2022 caused the price of lettuce to rise by 300%?

Climate-driven food price spikes can have serious social consequences such as increased food insecurity, particularly in low-income families; less healthy food choices exacerbating health problems such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer, with flow-on consequences for people’s mental health and the health system; and increased inflation leading to higher interest rates that put further pressure on already stressed household budgets. All of these can have electoral consequences and there is evidence of food price inflation contributing to social upheaval and revolutions, for instance in France in 1789, Russia in 1917 and North Africa in 2011 (the ‘Arab Spring’).

The obvious sensible response to these climate-driven food price surges is to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to lower the risk of global warming and extreme weather events. As there is little hope of that happening in the foreseeable future, action is needed to better prepare societies to respond to the increasingly likely failures of essential crop. For instance:

Timely information about the next year’s weather and the possible effects on crops and prices allows producers to change crops and/or planting schedules;

Better understanding of climate change, combined with government incentives, could help farmers make long-term changes to crop selections and agricultural methods;

Depending on local circumstances, implementation or abandonment of irrigation schemes;

Social security programs that strengthen the capacity of vulnerable groups to prepare for, and respond to, climate-driven food price shocks; and

Multidisciplinary research and planning to identify the complex local and global interactions of the environment, farming, food and transport systems, trade, socio-economic factors, prices and political systems.

Sustainable aviation fuel fails to take off

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a kerosene-like fuel that is not produced from fossil fuels. SAF might be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, used cooking oil, household waste, alcohol or biomass, for example. Although SAF does not come from fossil fuels, when it’s burnt in the plane’s engines it still produces about the same CO2 emissions as standard aviation fuel. SAF can currently constitute up to 50% of a plane’s fuel.

On 21 July, Bloomberg Green Daily published the graph below that compares the International Air Transport Association’s target for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (as a percentage of all aviation fuels) in 2030 with the actual usage since 2020. The disparity between aspiration and achievement is disappointingly similar to that seen in many other industries.

International Airlines Group, a large European company that owns various airlines including British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, led the way in 2024 with 1.9% of its fuel use provided by SAF, but even then its emissions from fuel combustion rose by 5% during the year. Generally speaking, European airlines are performing better than those from the US, although that isn’t saying much. SAF made up 0.22% of the fuel used by Qantas.

Globally, the use of SAF is expected to increase from 0.3% to 0.7% this year, but air travel is expected to increase by 6%, so emissions are going to increase again.

That all said, SAF is highly unlikely to be a either a significant or a long-term contributor to solving the aviation industry’s (admittedly hard-to-abate) emissions problem. A new generation of planes that use different sources of energy (e.g., batteries, hydrogen and hybrid) is urgently needed, but that’s a story for another day.

Overall, though, the industry does not seem to be trying very hard to make the transition.

The catalyst is designed for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), an essential process for fuel cells and other clean energy technologies.

The findings are published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science Catalysis.

The new catalyst was made by forming a thin layer of iron polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) around carbon nanotubes. This method allowed more iron to be incorporated into the material than in earlier approaches, while still keeping the same type of active sites that drive the reaction.

When tested in an acidic solution, the catalyst showed efficient performance in converting oxygen, with measurements indicating strong electron transfer and favorable reaction steps. The researchers traced this effect to the close interaction between the FePPc shell and the nanotubes.

Just as important as performance is durability. In long-term testing, the catalyst kept around 80% of its initial activity after one day, whereas a similar material without the polymerized shell lost most of its activity in just a few hours.

The team discovered that the material changes as it works. Thin layers of FePPc gradually peel off, which exposes fresh active sites. At the same time, some of the peeled fragments continue to settle on the nanotubes, helping the reaction for a time. However, the process eventually reaches a limit as dissolved iron particles collect into stable clusters, which reduces the catalyst's effectiveness.

""Our results show that the apparent stability of the catalyst is linked to a balance between renewal of active sites and gradual processes of deactivation,"" explained Hao Li, a Distinguished Professor Hao Li at Tohoku University's Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR).

The pilot will use Liquid Sun’s low-temperature electrolysis technology, developed from research at Tampere University, to turn biogenic carbon dioxide emissions and renewable hydrogen into aviation fuel.
Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun, said the project is designed to speed up the move to cleaner fuels: “This is an opportunity for Finland to take a leading role in the sustainable aviation fuel market.
Using these sources can strengthen energy security and support the country’s electricity grid while advancing aviation fuel production.
Supplying renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen will be a key part of aviation fuel production.” ABB is also contributing through its H2 Springboard programme.","Finnish technology company Liquid Sun has launched a pilot project to produce sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) in partnership with Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia. The project aims to create a complete system for producing synthetic fuel in Finland, positioning the country as a potential leader in this emerging sector, reports The Stat Trade Times.

The pilot will use Liquid Sun’s low-temperature electrolysis technology, developed from research at Tampere University, to turn biogenic carbon dioxide emissions and renewable hydrogen into aviation fuel. Such emissions in Finland mainly come from the forest industry and biogas plants.

A pre-commercial production unit in Espoo is expected to start operating by autumn 2025. The facility will be the first of its kind in Finland and will focus on testing production methods, validating results, and building capacity for future large-scale supply.

Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun, said the project is designed to speed up the move to cleaner fuels: “This is an opportunity for Finland to take a leading role in the sustainable aviation fuel market. Success depends on working together across the fuel production chain.”

The European Union introduced a mandate in early 2025 requiring airlines to gradually increase the use of renewable fuel, reaching 70% by 2050, with half of it from synthetic fuels. The rules apply to airports with more than 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of cargo per year, including Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi in Finland.

Henri Hansson, Senior Vice President at Finavia, said the airport operator is committed to supporting cleaner aviation: “We want to work closely with our partners to make air travel more sustainable and to test new technologies at our airports.”

Finland produces about 20 million tonnes of biogenic carbon dioxide annually through its forest industry, with additional supply from biogas plants. Using these sources can strengthen energy security and support the country’s electricity grid while advancing aviation fuel production.

Riku Aho, Vice President at Finnair, highlighted the importance of the initiative: “Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to reduce emissions. We want to help Finland build its expertise in synthetic fuel production while also moving closer to carbon neutrality.”

Fortum, one of the project partners, is building a renewable hydrogen plant. Vice President Satu Sipola said: “Our goal is to support the shift to carbon neutrality. Supplying renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen will be a key part of aviation fuel production.”

ABB is also contributing through its H2 Springboard programme. Simo Säynevirta, who leads the initiative, said: “This project shows how collaboration can drive progress in hydrogen technology and sustainable fuel development.”

Keinänen of Liquid Sun added that the pilot project could give Finland an edge: “There is strong global competition to develop efficient synthetic fuels. Finland’s conditions are favourable, and this pilot will help us validate solutions quickly and on a meaningful scale.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-2.png,N,,2025-08-23 10:56:11.173395

""Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10–20% from biowaste alone.""

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang's lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers utilized HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang's lab.

""Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,"" Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogeneous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

""We also have to fine-tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition"" said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they'd like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be applicable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

""There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed."" Yang said. ""I'm optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.""

In this interview, he speaks about his scientific journey, groundbreaking research, and vision for Africa’s role in shaping the future of energy and safety.

* Can we meet you?

I’m Abdulwasiu Muhammed Raji. I completed my Primary education at Air Force Nursery and Primary School, Ilorin and Secondary School Education was at Kanta Unity College Argungu, Kebbi State. I earned a BSc degree from the prestigious Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria and an MSc in Polymer Technology from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). I am a Nigerian scientist and PhD candidate at INSA France, researching sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), combustion kinetics, and fire-safe materials. My work develops low-emission fuel blends and eco-friendly flame retardants for applications in aerospace, energy, and public safety.

Before moving to France, I served as a lecturer at Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), Lagos, since 2014, where I taught and mentored over 1000 students in materials science, foam technology, and materials testing. I remain committed to building scientific capacity in Nigeria through education, mentorship, and collaborative research.

My research has been published in Journal of Cellular Plastics, eXPRESS Polymer Letters, Fuel, Sustainable Energy & Fuels, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, and others. I also serve as a peer reviewer for over 10 local and international journals across Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, and ACS publishers, and I’m a member of TRAN, PIN, AIAA, ASTM International, and the International Association for Fire Safety Science.

I am passionate about using science to solve real-world problems and bridge innovation between Africa and the global research community.

* What inspired your journey into researching safer and greener materials?

My journey began during my undergraduate studies in Textile Science & Technology (now known as Polymer and Textile Engineering) at ABU, Zaria, where I first became fascinated to how materials influence safety and performance in everyday life. That interest deepened during my MSc in Polymer Technology at Universiti Teknologi, Malaysia, where I led research on eco-friendly flame-retardant systems for polyurethane foams. I saw firsthand how traditional flame retardants, while effective, often posed environmental and health risks. This pushed me toward greener, safer alternatives.

Later, as a lecturer at Yaba College of Technology, I realised the importance of transferring that knowledge to the next generation, especially in contexts like Nigeria, where fire safety, material performance and material sustainability are pressing issues. Today, in my PhD at INSA France, my work focuses on sustainable aviation fuel and advanced combustion analysis. Across all stages of my career, the motivation has remained the same: to create materials that protect people, preserve the environment, and perform under real-world conditions.

* Many people hear flame retardant or biofuel and think of complex chemistry. How would you explain the real-world impact of your research to the average person?

I always say this: my research is about making everyday life safer and cleaner without people needing to think about it.

When I worked on flame-retardant materials during my MSc and academic career at YABATECH, the goal was simple: to develop foams used in furniture, insulation, or transport that don’t easily ‘catch’ fire, and when they do, release less smoke and toxic gas. That kind of material can save lives during a fire without harming the environment.

Now, in my PhD at INSA France, I focus on sustainable aviation fuel, i.e., biofuel made from plants and waste oil that can power aeroplanes but with far less pollution than traditional petroleum jet fuel. My job is to test and model this fuel, so it burns efficiently and safely.

In short, my work helps create materials that protect people from fire hazard and reduce the emission harming our planet, all while supporting industries such as aviation and construction.

* Your work spans fire safety, sustainable aviation fuel, and biomass. What unites these seemingly different areas of study?

At first glance, these fields may seem different. However, they are all connected by one central theme: how materials behave under heat, and how we can harness or control that behaviour for safety, sustainability, and performance.

From my early research on flame-retardant foams during my MSc in Malaysia, to my work as a lecturer at YABATECH, and now in my PhD at INSA France, I have always focused on thermal behaviour, whether it is preventing materials from burning, or optimising how biofuel combusts to reduce emission.

Even in my biomass research, I studied how some African tropical woods in Gabon and Nigeria transfer and store heat, to turn them into efficient, clean energy sources.

So, what unites these areas is a deep understanding of materials behaviour when heated, using science to make fuel cleaner, materials safer, and energy systems more sustainable for real-world use.

* In fire safety, what makes your flame-retardant formulation different from conventional ones, especially in terms of health and the environment?

Traditional flame retardant, especially halogenated compounds containing chlorine and bromine, releases toxic fume with persistent pollutants during fire or degradation, posing long-term risks to both human health and the environment.

What sets my formulation apart is the use of a halogen-free intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system made from ammonium polyphosphate, sepiolite nanoclay, and melamine. Sepiolite is a naturally occurring, non-toxic clay that acts as a carbonising agent, improving char stability during combustion. This structure not only slows the fire but also reduces smoke and heat release.

From our study, a specific IFR composition (16 phr, 1:2:1 ratio) achieved a high Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) and earned a UL-94 V-0 rating, indicating excellent flame resistance. SEM analysis also showed a more stable and compact cell structure, which helps maintain insulation performance.

In short, my formulation offers superior fire protection without the environmental trade-off of conventional systems, making them ideal for safe, sustainable insulation and foam application.

* Why is your research particularly significant for developing countries like Nigeria?

My research directly addresses two critical challenges facing Nigeria: fire safety in buildings and transport, and access to cleaner, affordable energy alternatives.

In fire safety, many materials used in homes, public transport, and informal buildings in Nigeria lack proper flame retardancy, increasing the risk of deadly fires. My work on eco-friendly flame-retardant polyurethane foams provides a safer, low-smoke alternative that can be used in insulation and furniture, especially in densely populated areas.

In energy, my current PhD research on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and thermal analysis of biomass explores ways to reduce dependence on fossil fuel by using locally available feedstock such as plant oil from Jatropha, and agricultural waste (these are in abundant in major cities of Lagos, Kano, Sokoto, and Port Harcourt). This opens opportunities for local biofuel industries, job creation, and energy diversification.

Overall, my research is not just lab-based; it is practical, scalable, and deeply relevant to Nigeria’s development needs in safety, sustainability, and self-reliance.

* What has been the most rewarding recognition or milestone in your scientific career so far?

One of the most rewarding moments in my scientific journey was being honoured with the Pro-Chancellor Award and named the Best Master’s Student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), conferred during the UTM 65th convocation in May 2022. It was deeply meaningful to be internationally recognised not just for academic excellence, but also for research leadership and impact in the area of eco-friendly flame-retardant materials. Also, the school of graduate studies at UTM honoured me with a certificate of recognition for my contribution to research excellence in my faculty.

That recognition affirmed my commitment to solving real-world problems through science, and it came while conducting research on sustainable, halogen-free fire safety systems, which laid the foundation for my PhD work.

In addition, I won the 2022 PTDF PhD scholarship on my first attempt to further my research in France. This marked another important milestone, along with publishing in high-impact journals such as Fuel, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review, Sustainable Energy & Fuel, Energy & Fuels, and mentoring students at YABATECH. Together, these experiences represent the impact I aim to continue making through both research and mentorship.

* You’ve worked in both Nigeria and France. How have these experiences shaped your scientific perspective?

Working in Nigeria gave me a deep appreciation for practical problem-solving, especially in environments where resources are limited, but the need for innovation is urgent. As a lecturer at Yaba College of Technology, I learned how to teach and conduct research with impact in mind, focusing on materials that are affordable, scalable, and suited to local challenges.

In France, I have been exposed to cutting-edge research infrastructure, advanced combustion labs, and international collaboration. My PhD at INSA France has deepened my expertise in sustainable aviation fuel and thermal analysis, and taught me how to apply rigorous, data-driven methodologies to global energy challenges.

Together, these experiences have shaped me into a scientist who values both local relevance and global standards. I now approach research with a dual lens: how can it meet international quality, and how can it serve the realities of my home country, Nigeria.

* Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is being called the “jet fuel of the future.” How does your work contribute to making cleaner skies a reality?

My research directly supports the global transition to cleaner skies by advancing our understanding of how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) behaves under real engine conditions. While the aviation industry is embracing SAF such as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), there is still limited data on how they perform thermally and during combustion compared to traditional Jet A-1 fuel.

In my current PhD work at INSA France, I have analysed the thermal stability, combustion efficiency, and chemical composition of pure Jet A-1, pure HEFA-SAF, and their blends using TGA, DSC, and GC-MS techniques. My findings show that HEFA-SAF is significantly more thermally stable and burns cleaner, with higher paraffinic content and lower soot-producing components than conventional jet fuel.

Most importantly, I identified specific blends (30/70% Jet A-1/HEFA-SAF) that offer an optimal balance between thermal resilience, energy efficiency, and ignition reliability. This contributes directly to refining international fuel standards such as ASTM D7566 and provides practical insights for commercial SAF integration.

In short, my work helps bridge the gap between lab research and flight-ready solutions, contributing to lower emission, safer fuel use, and a more sustainable future for aviation.

* What are the biggest challenges in developing biojet fuel, and what breakthroughs have you personally achieved?

One of the biggest challenges in developing biojet fuel is balancing combustion efficiency, ignition reliability, and thermal stability, while ensuring compatibility with existing jet engines. Many biofuels, though cleaner, struggle with low ignition indices, variability in feedstock quality, and sometimes do not meet the stringent standards of ASTM D7566 for aviation fuel certification.

Another challenge is the lack of comprehensive data on how blended fuel behaves under real-world thermal and combustion conditions. Without this, adoption by airlines and engine manufacturers remains slow.

In my PhD research at INSA France, I addressed these gaps by conducting detailed analyses of Jet A-1, HEFA-SAF, and their blends using TGA, DSC, and GC-MS. I discovered that pure HEFA-SAF offers superior thermal stability and cleaner combustion but has some limitations in ignition performance.

My key breakthrough was identifying a blend ratio (30/70% Jet A-1/HEFA-SAF) that optimises both thermal resilience and energy efficiency, while maintaining system compatibility. These findings not only contribute to refining SAF performance benchmarks but also support more informed SAF blending strategies for commercial aviation, especially in contexts where fuel safety and emission are top priorities.

* From your lab experiments to international conferences, how has the global scientific community responded to your SAF findings?

The response from the global scientific community has been very encouraging. My work on HEFA-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and its thermal and combustion behaviour has been well received because it addresses a critical knowledge gap in fuel performance and optimisation, particularly the balance between thermal stability, combustion efficiency, and engine compatibility.

I have presented these findings at respected international conferences such as the ISGC (International Symposium on Green Chemistry) in France and the International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS) in Canada, where my results on blend optimisation sparked meaningful discussions about real-world SAF deployment strategies. Moreover, my work has been published in leading journals such as Fuel, Sustainable Energy & Fuel and Energy & Fuels, and I have been invited to peer review manuscripts in the same field, a strong recognition of my expertise. Also, I have received multiple invitations as a speaker for different conferences. The growing interest from researchers, journal editors, and potential collaborators shows that my findings are contributing to shaping SAF research directions globally, particularly in the push for low-emission, drop-in aviation fuel.

* Beyond the lab, how do you see your research influencing aviation policy or environmental regulation?

My research goes beyond the lab bench; it contributes directly to the evidence base needed for smarter, more sustainable aviation policy. By rigorously analysing the thermal stability, combustion efficiency, and emission behaviour of HEFA-based SAF and its blends, I provide data that can support refinement to international fuel certification standards such as ASTM D7566, which governs SAF usage in commercial aviation.

For regulators and policymakers, one of the major barriers to SAF adoption is the lack of comprehensive, real-world performance data. My work fills that gap by identifying blend ratios such as 30/70% Jet A-1/HEFA-SAF, that not only meet technical requirements but also offer practical solutions for lower emission and better fuel system compatibility.

In the long term, I see my research informing CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) compliance strategies and helping shape emission benchmarks and fuel subsidy policies, especially as more countries, including developing nations, work toward net-zero aviation goals.

* How could your biomass research help address energy poverty in African countries?

My biomass research is directly aligned with addressing energy poverty in Africa by exploring how locally available plant-based resources, such as tropical hardwoods and agricultural waste, can be transformed into efficient, affordable, and cleaner energy sources.

In a recent collaborative work with researchers at the Institut de Recherches Technologiques (IRT), Libreville, Gabon, I investigated the thermal property of tropical woods of Gabon origin and how their thermal conductivity, diffusivity, and energy content can be optimised for use in rural heating and power systems. This kind of data is critical for developing biomass cookstoves, briquettes, and small-scale combustion systems that are not only fuel-efficient but also reduce harmful smoke emission.

In regions where millions still rely on unsafe and polluting fuel for cooking and heating, my research provides a scientific foundation for scaling sustainable biomass energy technologies, using resources that are abundant, renewable, and locally sourced. Ultimately, this contributes to energy access, improved public health, and economic resilience in underserved communities.

* What challenges have you faced conducting cross-continental research, and how did you overcome them?

Conducting research across Nigeria, Malaysia, and now France has been incredibly rewarding, but it is not without challenges. One of the biggest challenges has been adapting to different scientific cultures, laboratory standards, and academic expectations. For example, during my MSc at Universiti Teknologi, Malaysia, I had to quickly learn new research protocols, advanced instrumentation, and international publication standards, all while navigating a new cultural and academic environment.

In France, the challenge shifted to high-level technical modeling, SAF certification frameworks, and managing language barriers and collaborative dynamics in a multinational lab.

Another ongoing challenge has been aligning research relevance, ensuring that my work, while globally competitive, remains applicable to the needs of Nigeria and other developing countries.

I overcame these obstacles through adaptability, proactive mentorship-seeking, and cross-cultural communication skills. I also maintained strong academic discipline, which led to recognitions such as the Pro-Chancellor Award in Malaysia and continued research success in France, so far, I have seven first-author publications as a PhD candidate.

These experiences have made me a resilient, globally minded researcher, capable of bridging innovation across continents.

* Collaboration seems central to your career. What partnerships or mentorship roles have been most meaningful to you?

Collaboration has truly shaped my scientific growth. One of the most meaningful experiences was working with the Enhanced Polymer Research Lab during my MSc at Universiti Teknologi, Malaysia, where we developed eco-friendly flame-retardant systems. That project laid the groundwork for my understanding of research that is both scientifically rigorous and environmentally responsible.

At INSA France, my current PhD has deepened that collaboration, working alongside combustion scientists, thermal analysts, and fuel specialists from across Europe, such as the Institut de Chimie des Milieux et Matériaux de Poitiers (IC2MP) at the Université de Poitiers, France, to advance research in sustainable aviation fuel. Co-authoring publications with other researchers in Malaysia, the United States of America, Gabon, and Nigeria, and presenting at international conferences has strengthened not just the science but also the relationships.

Equally important to me is mentorship. As a lecturer at YABATECH in Lagos, Nigeria, I mentored over 1000 students in materials science. Seeing former students pursue postgraduate research and international scholarships has been incredibly fulfilling. I also continue to mentor younger researchers virtually, particularly those from Africa, in research writing, publishing, and career development.

These partnerships, both in the lab and the classroom, reflect my belief that science moves forward when knowledge is shared, across borders and generations.

* Some people think sustainability and industrial innovation are at odds. How do you balance both in your work?

I see sustainability and industrial innovation not as conflicting goals, but as two sides of responsible scientific progress. The key is to design solutions that meet real-world industrial needs without compromising the environment or public health.

In my research on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), for example, I work closely with ASTM-certified standards to ensure that cleaner fuel such as HEFA-SAF not only reduce emission, but also perform reliably in existing jet engines, which is critical for real-world aviation use. That is sustainability with industrial compatibility.

Similarly, in my previous work on flame-retardant materials, I developed halogen-free, intumescent systems that are safer to produce and use, while still meeting UL-94 V-0 fire safety standards, a benchmark in the manufacturing and construction industries.

My approach is always to find that intersection where scientific innovation, environmental responsibility, and industry performance converge. That is where real, lasting impact happens.

* What is the biggest misconception about green energy or fire safety materials today that you would like to correct?

One major misconception is that green energy and eco-friendly fire safety materials are less effective than conventional alternatives, that you are trading performance for sustainability. In reality, that is no longer true.

In my work on halogen-free flame-retardant foams, for example, we achieved a UL-94 V-0 rating and a 23% improvement in oxygen index, proving that eco-friendly systems can meet and even exceed industrial fire safety standards without toxic byproducts.

Similarly, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), many assume they are too weak or unstable for real-world flight. But my research has shown that certain HEFA-SAF blends, such as 50/50% and 30/70% Jet A-1/HEFA-SAF, offer enhanced thermal stability and cleaner combustion, making them viable for today’s aircraft.

So, the idea that “green means compromise” is outdated. Through careful research and innovation, we can build solutions that are both high-performing and environmentally responsible, and that is the future I and others are working toward.

* Looking ahead, what is your long-term vision for Africa’s role in shaping global energy and safety innovation?

My long-term vision is for Africa to move from being a passive consumer of global technologies to becoming a recognised driver of innovation in both sustainable energy and public safety solutions.

Africa is rich in biomass resources, human talent, and entrepreneurial energy, all the raw ingredients for leading in areas such as bioenergy, green materials, and localised safety engineering. However, we need to strengthen research infrastructure, cross-border collaboration, and policy alignment to unlock that potential.

I see my work as part of that transformation. Whether it is through my research on sustainable aviation fuel, flame-retardant materials, or biomass energy systems, my goal is to build bridges between global scientific networks and African institutions. I want to mentor researchers, co-develop homegrown technologies, and contribute to shaping evidence-based policies that prioritise both sustainability and safety.

Africa has a vital role to play, not just in adapting to the future, but in defining it.

Union officials at Grangemouth have accused the prime minister of ""failing to deliver"" on a £200m promise to invest in the future of the industrial site.

The refinery, owned by Petroineos, ceased processing crude oil in April, leading to the direct loss of about 400 jobs and many others in the supply chain.

While a fuel distribution hub and a vast petrochemical plant remain, the Unite union says a funding package announced in February to support a transition to green energy projects has yet to materialise.

The UK government said it was working to develop ""sustainable, long term proposals"" for the site.

Sir Keir Starmer pledged the funding for Grangemouth from the National Wealth Fund at the Scottish Labour conference, telling delegates it was an ""investment in Scotland's industrial future"".

But the union claimed ""not a penny"" of the promised cash had been spent so far.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""It is little wonder workers are turning away from Labour in their droves when they fail to protect British jobs and critical infrastructure.

""Promises made to the workers of Grangemouth have been broken. Unite produced a clear plan for the site to be transformed, to back workers and create the promised green jobs.

""The government failure to act shows there is absolutely no plan for a jobs transition.""

The UK and Scottish governments jointly funded a £1.5m feasibility study called Project Willow which looked at alternative uses for the Grangemouth site.

Unite said it had produced a detailed and fully costed plan for how the refinery could be transitioned to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Grangemouth worker and senior union representative Chris Hamilton said his colleagues and members of the community felt abandoned by the lack of progress.

""Each month more and more people leave the site through redundancy with empty promises ringing in their ears,"" he said.

""This government may have forgotten what it promised - but we haven't. It must follow through with its promises at pace and do all it can to secure a sustainable future for Grangemouth.""

In June, the UK government's energy minister, Michael Shanks, said there would be announcements ""soon"" on the future of Grangemouth.

Shanks, who is also the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, said the government was exploring a range of ""exciting and viable"" projects to secure a long-term transition for the site.

China’s CNAF to Invest in Private Chinese SAF Plant

(Reuters) China National Aviation Fuel Co. (CNAF) said on Aug. 18 it had agreed to acquire a stake in a sustainable aviation fuel plant controlled by private biofuel producer Henan Junheng Industry Group Biotech Co.

This marks CNAF’s second such investment in a privately controlled green jet fuel maker. CNAF is China’s dominant distributor of aviation fuel.

CNAF announced the signing of the investment agreement on its official WeChat platform but did not give any financial details.

Central China-based Junheng is one of China’s first commercial SAF refiners, processing used cooking oil (UCO) into the low-carbon fuel.

China is the world’s largest UCO producer.

Junheng is expanding its 400,000 tonnes-per-year SAF plant in the city of Puyang, Henan province, to reach 1 million tonnes per year around June 2026.

Last month, CNAF became a strategic investor in an east China-based SAF plant controlled by Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, by agreeing to acquire a 10% stake at about 261 million yuan (US$36.35 million), according to a Jiaao stock filing.

China, the world’s second-largest aviation fuel market, has yet to announce a national mandate for the use of SAF. It began a pilot scheme last September for the first use of SAF in a dozen flights departing from domestic airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengzhou and Ningbo. That was expanded in March to all domestic flights departing these airports.

By integrating their offerings, the duo gives storage companies access to customized VPP programming.

“The collaboration provides a turnkey solution that significantly reduces time to market by lowering technical and operational barriers to entry in grid services, such as time-consuming Measurement & Verification processes and data sharing challenges,” the release said.

Initial partners include solar developer Solridge, solar and battery installer Haven Energy and a major residential storage manufacturer, according to the news release.

US Defense Department to Buy Cobalt for up to $500MM

(Reuters) The U.S. is seeking to procure cobalt worth up to $500 million for defense stockpiles amid the country’s move to boost its critical mineral supplies.

Companies have been scrambling to source rare earths after China imposed restrictions, leading to a 75% drop in rare earth magnet exports from the country in June and causing some auto companies to suspend production.

U.S. President Donald Trump in March invoked emergency powers to boost domestic production of critical minerals as part of a broad effort to offset China’s near-total control of the sector.

According to the tender document published by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency on Aug. 20, they are looking for offers for alloy-grade cobalt of about 7,480 tonnes over the next five years.

Cobalt, mostly imported by the U.S., is used in batteries, a component in nickel superalloys for high temperature sections of jet engines and industrial gas turbines, among others.

However, the defense department was seeking offers from only three companies—units of Vale SA in Canada, Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining and Norway’s Glencore Nikkelverk. The document also said the purchase amount can range from between $2 million and $500 million in the five-year period.

Fluence Starts Production at New Facility in Houston

Fluence Energy on Aug. 21 said it has started producing thermal management systems for its battery energy storage systems at its new manufacturing facility in Houston.

The company said the facility, in partnership with Bergstrom, will play a role in its strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-scale battery energy storage system in the U.S. Systems produced at the Houston site include HVAC and chiller equipment, Fluence said in a news release.

“There’s broad recognition of the enormous value batteries bring to the electricity grid—to address increased power demand, maintain reliability, and lower costs,"" said John Zahurancik, president of Fluence Americas. “With this Houston facility and our broader network of U.S. manufacturing plants, U.S.-made battery energy storage is playing a growing role in domestic power production and energy security.”

Virginia-headquartered Fluence said it has more than 22,000 MWh of battery energy storage capacity deployed or contracted across more than 90 projects in the U.S.

Viridi Installs BESS at Denver Public Library

Viridi, in partnership with construction and energy services company McKinstry, on Aug. 20 said it has installed a fail-safe battery energy storage system at the Denver Public Library, calling it a first-of-a-kind solar and storage project.

The company said its behind-the-meter RPSLinkEX system captures excess solar energy for use during non-solar hours, while reducing peak demand and providing backup power during outages. The system is fully integrated into the library’s existing infrastructure and monitored through Viridi’s ViSTA Dashboard.

Geronimo Starts Construction on 125-MW Solar Plant in Michigan

Construction has commenced for the 125-megawatt (MW) Jackson County solar project in Michigan, developer Geronimo Power (formerly National Grid Renewables) said Aug. 18.

The solar facility is expected to generate enough electricity to power an estimated 33,600 homes annually when it begins operations in 2026, the company said. It will be the latest in the Geronimo’s MiSolar Portfolio, which also includes the 20-MW Bingham Solar facility in Clinton County and the 20-MW Temperance Solar facility in Monroe County.

All three serve the Midwestern Independent System Operator (MISO) market. The solar facilities will lift Geronimo’s capacity in the MISO region to nearly 1 gigawatt, the company said.

Silicon Ranch to Build 100-MW Solar Farm Supporting Meta

Solar developer Silicon Ranch has partnered with Central Electric Power Cooperative to build a 100-MW solar farm to support Meta’s first data center in South Carolina, according to a news release Aug. 19.

Located in Orangeburg County, the solar farm will be Silicon and Central’s fourth project together and the 18th infrastructure project between Meta and Silicon, the solar developer said.

Working with system balancing authority Santee Cooper, Silicon said it will fund, own and operate the solar farm. Electricity produced will be purchased by Central to benefit its member cooperatives. The cooperatives, the release said, includes Aiken Electric, which serves the Meta facility being constructed near Graniteville, South Carolina.

Both the data center and the solar farm are expected to start operations in 2027, according to the release.

China’s Solar Industry Association Calls for End to Price Wars

(Reuters) China’s solar industry association on Aug. 22 called for solar manufacturers to stop selling components below cost and advocated for “survival of the fittest” market competition—but stopped short of calling for capacity closures to address oversupply in the industry.

In a statement following multi-day consultations with the solar industry and a raft of government stakeholders, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association said in a statement on its WeChat account that companies should schedule their production on the basis of market supply and demand and strictly adhere to China’s price law—a nod to the prevailing practices of expanding production to try to maintain market share while undercutting competitors, leading to surging overcapacity.

The statement also called on solar companies to maintain safety and quality standards and abide by intellectual property rules and asked power-generating firms to reduce the weighting that they give to component prices in the bidding process.

Speaking at the PHDCCI Global Summit on Sustainability 2025, Bhatia said both sectors are expected to grow significantly over the next five to ten years.
This facility will process municipal solid waste to produce four tonnes of gas per day,” Bhatia said.
To overcome the “chicken-and-egg” challenge between infrastructure development and vehicle adoption, Bhatia said IGL and other gas companies plan to set up 50 LNG stations along the golden quadrilateral.
“Growth is inevitable, but the real challenge is in ensuring that growth doesn’t come at the cost of environmental degradation or social exclusion.","Compressed Biogas (CBG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) are emerging as major growth areas for city gas companies in India, according to Sanjeev Bhatia, Executive Director of Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL). Speaking at the PHDCCI Global Summit on Sustainability 2025, Bhatia said both sectors are expected to grow significantly over the next five to ten years.

During a session focused on hard-to-abate sectors, Bhatia noted that while India aims to increase the share of natural gas in its energy mix from 6.5% to 15% by 2030, domestic production is not keeping pace with growing demand. This gap, he explained, highlights the importance of alternative fuels like CBG.

“The government has already directed city gas distributors to invest in CBG plants. IGL has been assigned to establish at least 10 such facilities, with one plant in Narela, Delhi, scheduled to start operations by October. This facility will process municipal solid waste to produce four tonnes of gas per day,” Bhatia said.

Highlighting LNG’s potential in the transportation sector, Bhatia drew a comparison between India’s current fleet of 700 LNG-powered trucks and China’s six lakh. “Even a partial shift from diesel to LNG in heavy vehicles could reduce emissions by 30%,” he said.

To overcome the “chicken-and-egg” challenge between infrastructure development and vehicle adoption, Bhatia said IGL and other gas companies plan to set up 50 LNG stations along the golden quadrilateral. These efforts are being coupled with industry outreach to encourage cement, steel, and fertiliser companies to convert 10–20% of their fleets to LNG.

“CBG and LNG are natural progressions from CNG, and we expect both to become critical components of the clean energy ecosystem in the coming decade,” he added, while pointing out that hydrogen blending remains commercially unviable at present.

Also speaking at the summit, Ashish Khanna, Director General of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), said India’s leadership in the solar sector is now globally recognised. “India is the only G20 nation to have achieved its 50% renewable energy capacity target ahead of schedule. With 116 GW of solar power already installed, this success is the result of strong political commitment, robust policy support, financial innovation, and a capable private sector,” he said.

Karthikeyan K, Vice President at Invest India, underscored the urgency of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement, and oil and gas. “Growth is inevitable, but the real challenge is in ensuring that growth doesn’t come at the cost of environmental degradation or social exclusion. We must focus on green manufacturing and decisive decarbonisation—not as ideals, but as necessities,” he said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/biogas-icon.png,N,,2025-08-23 08:56:52.878088

Policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, farmers, and citizens walked the full value chain: from feedstock cultivation to biofuel-powered engines, witnessing firsthand how technology, policy, and public engagement converge to drive India’s green energy future.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Praj’s Founder Chairman and widely known as “The Ethanol Man of India,” presented BioVerse™ as more than a demonstration; it’s a movement where innovation, research, end-use applications, and public literacy intersect.

Hon’ble. Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shri Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the Experience Gallery, showcasing biofuels as a tool for energy self-reliance, rural prosperity, and emissions reduction. His presence reinforced the event’s message: scaling bioenergy is as much a national imperative as it is a technical challenge.

What made Praj BioVerse™ exceptional was its focus on tangible, real-world demonstrations. “The Experience Gallery” offered an end-to-end walkthrough: feedstock-to-fuel displays, co-product pathways, process modules, and operational applications.

Stakeholders across the ecosystem played visible roles — Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI) led feedstock research and intercropping techniques; Praj displayed its indigenously developed technologies for biofuels and value added co-products; Toyota Motor Corporation and Hero MotoCorp showcased flex fuel vehicles; and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) showcased vehicle and fuel standards. Vehicle preparedness for higher ethanol blends was on full display, with Toyota showcasing 2 popular flex car models and Hero Motorcorp flex-fuel models ready to run on E10 to E100.

Together, they transformed policy and innovation into certified, high-performance solutions that are safe, reliable, and ready for real-world adoption.

The vehicles showcased, Hero HF Deluxe Flex Fuel, for example, is a powerful endorsement of ethanol as a mainstream fuel while retaining its impressive 70 kmpl mileage. In other words, switching to ethanol does not mean sacrificing performance, efficiency, or reliability. Instead, it demonstrates that ethanol-blend technology is ready for mass adoption, proving that cleaner fuels can ride shoulder-to-shoulder with petrol without compromise.

Some of the most striking moments went beyond transportation fuels where Hon. Minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated Kirloskar Oil Engines demonstrated a 100% ethanol genset for industrial and agricultural applications, highlighting bioenergy’s potential across sectors, from infrastructure to mobile towers. Display of 100% Bio-IBA based engines was also an attraction of the experience gallery. It is interesting to note that the non-mobility sector accounts for about 4000 cr litre of fossil fuels potentially can be replaced either by ethanol or by Bio-IBA.

Compressed Biogas kits for tractors and India’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) flight powered by locally produced SAF signalled ambitions far beyond conventional ethanol blending.

The farming community remained central to the story. The rise from single-digit ethanol blend a decade ago to 20% blend today links to forex savings, farmer payments, and feedstock strategies.

Bioenergy is not just a transport story—it’s an industrial, agricultural, and decentralised energy solution. With government, research institutes, manufacturers, and end-users collaborating, India is emerging as India’s hub for Biofuels innovation and application.

Recent debates around E20 blends raised questions on supply, pricing, and vehicle compatibility. Praj BioVerseTM experience gallery addressed these doubts, proving the success story must continue, extending beyond mobility to agriculture, industry, and decentralised energy.

While India has made remarkable strides in ethanol adoption, challenges remain: differential pricing, calorific value–based pricing, and lessons from global players like Brazil and Thailand. The conversation is shifting from availability to sustainability, efficiency, and long-term strategy.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Praj-BioVerse.jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 09:56:25.659404

EBay upgrades seller experience tools with AI

Marketplace eBay announced at its annual seller event, Open25, that it’s rolling out additional AI-based seller experience tools.

It announced that it’s launching a tool it calls Offers in Messaging, which allows buyers and sellers to simultaneously negotiate inside a thread, while also having visibility of previous offers in messages. So, for instance, if a buyer asks about flaws in an item and the seller discloses a stain or tear in a garment, the seller can see how that impacts the buyer’s offer. It aims to make price negotiating easier and quicker, allowing the seller to use eBay’s generative AI tools to pre-write messages back to potential buyers.

Another AI-powered tool that sellers will benefit from is automated feedback. Previously, eBay has asked customers to leave feedback for sellers that they transact with. Now, by leveraging automation, the company will evaluate whether the service was complete and the parcel was delivered on time. If the buyer doesn’t report any issues, eBay will automatically give the seller positive feedback if the buyer chooses not to share a review. The company called it “a simple way to ensure sellers’ reliability and professionalism are reflected publicly, even when buyers stay quiet.”

In recent months, eBay has made its ambitions with AI clear, introducing incremental upgrades to buyer and seller experiences. The company said these tools are just the latest iteration on that mission.

“Each of these features, from AI-assisted messaging to automatic feedback, represents a step forward in eBay’s mission to help sellers thrive. To support the 2.4 billion listings on our marketplace, we’re building tools that reduce effort, increase transparency, and put sellers in control of their business and success—all in service of our mission to empower economic opportunity for all,” eBay wrote in a statement.

Overhaul secures Series C, acquires FreightVerify

Supply chain risk management provider Overhaul announced this week that it has secured $105 million in Series C funding, just after noting that it has agreed to acquire FreightVerify.

Overhaul leverages AI and machine learning to help clients track potential disruptions and thefts for cargo. It also works to provide preemptive solutions, real-time cargo tracking and predictive analytics that can help clients keep their cargo safe, even as instances of cargo theft continue to rise.

The Austin, Tex.-based company plans to use its newly minted funding to upgrade its AI capabilities, pursue further acquisitions and speed up product innovation, it said.

Holger Staude, managing partner of Springcoast Partners, said the firm is excited to continue its investment in the company.

“Overhaul is building the system of record for global, high-value supply chains. The company’s proprietary data assets, operational depth, and commitment to solving real-world logistics challenges set it apart in a consolidating market,” Staude said in a statement.

As part of its penchant for upward movement, Overhaul also announced this week that it has acquired FreightVerify, which will enable it to carry out item-level tracking of individual products for its customers. The idea is that the two companies will be able to create an advanced platform that further allows clients to take action on potential red flags before any consequences come about. FreightVerify has already tracked about 100 million shipments.

Barry Conlon, co-founder and CEO of Overhaul, said the acquisition is a natural extension of Overhaul’s business.

“The market has evolved, and the next generation of supply chain solutions needs to address not only in-transit risk but also connect to the impact on inventory outcomes and customer experience,” Conlon said in a statement. “Our approach ensures any delayed shipment can be linked to its contents to proactively prevent and act against downstream issues that would disrupt factories, stores and customer orders. This acquisition doubles down on Overhaul’s commitment to delivering actionable solutions.”

Serve Robotics acquires Vayu Robotics

Serve Robotics, which builds delivery robots that operate via sidewalk, announced this week that it has acquired Vayu Robotics, which, like Serve, does offer delivery robots as a service. Unlike Serve, though, Vayu also offers its clients a mobility-focused foundation model and AI-enabled sensors to aid the continued growth of physical AI.

Serve did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.

Serve expects that, by combining the two companies’ specialties, it can upgrade its robots’ capabilities; enhance its training capabilities to help its robots learn at a quicker, more accurate clip, supported by real-world and synthetic data and more. The company noted that, by unlocking these additional capabilities, it expects it can potentially expand into other delivery use cases—that is to say, instead of only operating on sidewalks, Serve robots may start operating in bike lines or on the shoulders of roads. Doing so would allow the company to expand into a wider variety of industries.

Ali Kashani, CEO and co-founder of Serve, said the companies’ fusion has the potential to drive future technology enhancements forward.

“With this acquisition, Serve solidifies its leadership position, not just in current robotic delivery operations, but in shaping the future of autonomous robotic navigation. This step marks a significant milestone in Serve’s roadmap toward wide-scale deployment of autonomous robots on sidewalks across the nation, aligning with industry predictions of rapid robot adoption,” said Kashani said in a statement. “Autonomy is critical to our long-term goal of bringing delivery costs down to $1, and these new capabilities will help us move faster.”

The Road Ahead: Critical Years for Ammonia Ammonia is at a crossroads.
There is no denying the potential: ammonia could offer a viable, scalable, and ultimately cost-effective low-carbon fuel for shipping.","In the realm of low-carbon shipping, ammonia has remained a consistent part of the conversation. Alongside methanol, it is often seen as one of the leading contenders to help the maritime industry decarbonize.

Many in the industry believe ammonia could ultimately be the cheaper option for low-carbon fuel. However, its path to mainstream adoption is far from straightforward (especially compared to other options).

Ammonia comes with a unique set of challenges. Chief among them its toxicity and lower flammability compared to alternatives. These characteristics mean the fuel is less mature and less commercially ready than methanol, which is already gaining traction.

Despite these disadvantages, there is precedent for overcoming these market obstacles. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), for example, once faced similar barriers when compared to traditional fuel oil. Yet today it stands as the fastest-growing sector in marine fuels.

Ammonia’s Barriers from Pilot to Proof of Concept

Ammonia currently remains in its pilot phase of development. Much of the industry is still working on proving its viability at scale.

The good news is that 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for ammonia. Several new commercial vessels designed to run on ammonia are scheduled to begin operations. Learning from these projects will be invaluable for the wider market.

Currently, there are about 40 ships on the order book for ammonia. The majority of these vessels are dual-fuel LPG/ammonia carriers.

These orders show clear momentum, but they also underscore just how early the market remains. Ammonia’s transition from pilot trials to first-generation adoption is still in progress, and the industry is watching closely.

Bunkering and Infrastructure Challenges

One of the key bottlenecks holding back ammonia today is bunkering. Ports around the world are still conducting trials to determine the safest and most efficient methods for transferring ammonia.

Thus far, 12 bunkering trials have been completed. While certainly promising, that number is relatively small compared to what will be needed for full-scale adoption.

Again, this situation is reminiscent of LNG’s early days when concerns over handling and storage made it seem like a risky option. Today, LNG infrastructure is established globally. If ammonia can replicate that learning curve, the same kind of breakthrough could occur. But it will take time, investment, and standardization before bunkering becomes routine.

Engine Development: Limited Options So Far

Another critical piece of the puzzle is engine technology. Only Wärtsilä has released a commercial ammonia engine, which entered the market two years ago. WinGD is expected to bring out its own model soon, but its release has already slipped behind schedule.

Without multiple engine providers offering reliable options, shipowners face uncertainty about committing to ammonia long term. Broader adoption hinges on expanding the supply of engines that can run on ammonia safely and efficiently.

The Road Ahead: Critical Years for Ammonia

Ammonia is at a crossroads. Until the industry can scale up engine availability, port bunkering operations, and green ammonia production, it will remain largely a concept fuel. The next few years will be decisive.

If methanol continues to mature at a faster pace, ammonia risks losing momentum and investor confidence. To stay competitive, ammonia must push past its early-phase hurdles and move toward first-generation scale-up.

There is no denying the potential: ammonia could offer a viable, scalable, and ultimately cost-effective low-carbon fuel for shipping. But realizing that promise depends on what happens between now and the late 2020s.

For now, the maritime world is watching closely. The technology, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks built in the next three to five years will determine whether ammonia becomes a cornerstone of shipping’s decarbonization journey or another unrealized renewable solution.

We urge EPA to ensure that small refinery exemptions do not undermine the market for farmers and clean fuel producers.""","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Though biofuels industry groups question whether small refineries that received exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard on Friday really deserved them, those groups expressed cautious optimism on the proposal put forward by the Trump administration.

-Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor:

""With more than 140 granted refinery exemptions, today's decision alone does not give farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need. It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand. We appreciate EPA's commitment to issue a rule that ensures promised homegrown biofuel gallons reach the marketplace and upholds the administration's commitment to American energy dominance.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued decisions involving 175 petitions for 2016 to 2024. EPA granted full exemptions to 63 petitions, partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and deemed seven ineligible.

-Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper:

""While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced 'disproportionate economic hardship' due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency's intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

""In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA's new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship. According to EPA's previous analysis, all refiners--both small and large -- recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to 'economic hardship.' In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance--not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.""

-Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association:

""We must get RFS refinery waiver uncertainty out of the market and today's action by EPA takes a big step forward. While we can quibble with the justification of the SREs granted, the EPA was spot-on in reissuing the same retired RFS credits back to the refiners who received an exemption. This is consistent with past actions when the shoe was on the other foot and is in line with the overall goals of the RFS. One absolutely vital question remains: how or if the SREs from 2023 to 2025 will be reallocated. That is a two-billion-gallon uncertainty hanging over the market and the pending RFS blending rule for 2026 and 2027.

""The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment. Full and complete reallocation of the 2023 and newer SREs is the vital point. In the end, that will determine whether the EPA upholds President Trump's commitment to the RFS and to American farmers. If true reallocation does not occur, then EPA is effectively reducing the already low RFS-blending levels for 2025. IRFA was heartened by EPA's announcement today that it will propose reallocating the exempted volumes.

We now anxiously await EPA's reallocation proposal, at which time we will be commenting in the strongest possible terms that reallocation of every SRE gallon must occur and we will implore the EPA to end the SRE uncertainty before finalizing the 2026-2027 RFS rule.""

-Clean Fuels Alliance America Vice President of Federal Affairs Kurt Kovarik:

""EPA's course correction on RFS small-refinery exemptions creates fresh uncertainty for America's farmers and biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) producers. We look forward to working with the agency to ensure today's decision does not unwind the strong signal of support issued in June through robust RFS volumes meant to drive growth and recognize investment in domestic fuels and American agriculture.

""EPA's announcement conflicts with its consistent finding that small refiners are not facing disproportionate economic hardships from RFS compliance. Refunding retired RINs has the potential to undercut current markets for domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF as well as for American oilseed crops and other feedstocks. This announcement comes just as farmers begin planning to harvest the year's soybean crop, which is expected to achieve a record-setting yield. We urge EPA to ensure that small refinery exemptions do not undermine the market for farmers and clean fuel producers.""

-American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings:

""EPA appears to be carefully trying to balance the recent caselaw and the RFS statute when it comes to their new methodology for small-refinery exemptions. The good news is that EPA is proposing to reallocate any and all small-refinery exemptions they grant for 2023 and beyond, which is how the SRE program should be implemented. EPA will issue a supplemental proposal on how they intend to reallocate exempted gallons for 2023 and beyond, and their reallocation methodology will be incorporated into the final 'Set 2' rule later this year which also covers the 2026 and 2027 renewable volume obligations.

""The agency argues they're not going to reallocate for exempted gallons granted to small refineries for the 2016 through 2022 RFS compliance years because those RINs are expired and it will not have an impact on blending. That may be true and we will carefully monitor how the D6 RIN market reacts to this news. In the past, SREs led to depressed RIN values which discourages blending of E15 and higher blends. Overall, however, the approach proposed by EPA looks reasonable.""

-Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association:

""We are grateful to see EPA take action addressing the extensive backlog of small-refinery exemptions. ABFA is also pleased that the agency plans to prepare a supplemental proposed rule for the reallocation of the exempted volumes for those years where compliance is yet to be demonstrated as well as how to account for exemptions in future years.

""Exemptions have a significant impact on the value of Renewable Identification Numbers. When RIN values drop, the entire advanced biofuels market is destabilized and put at risk, significantly impacting consumers downstream. ABFA looks forward to reviewing the proposed rule for reallocation and forecasting adjustments that can strengthen the market for all parties""

-Devin Mogler, president and CEO of the National Oilseed Processors Association:

""The EPA inherited a messy situation and we appreciate the agency's commitment to ending the years-long SRE litigation and restoring stability to the RFS. NOPA is confident the agency understands that strong RVOs will have profoundly positive impacts on U.S. farmers and rural America. We urge the EPA to build on this progress and quickly finalize the RVOs in a way that delivers these positive impacts, by finalizing a re-allocation policy that fully accounts for gallons lost due to SREs in 2023 to 2025 and any projected SREs for future years, expanding volumes for the biomass-based diesel category to at least 5.25 billion gallons and ensuring domestic feedstocks and fuels are prioritized. These measures are essential to ensuring the program strengthens domestic markets and keeps investment and jobs in rural America.""

Rapid scaling of carbon monetization, CDR credit sales, and SaaS solutions signals potential for much higher recurring, high-margin income than current expectations.

Standardized plant designs and growing SAF demand enable accelerated geographic expansion, securing long-term market share in a favorable regulatory and industry environment.

Heavy reliance on government incentives, high execution and financing risks, and a shrinking addressable market threaten profitability and long-term growth prospects.

Catalysts

About Gevo

Operates as a carbon abatement company.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

While analyst consensus expects up to $60 million of annual adjusted EBITDA from Gevo North Dakota via carbon abatement and 45Z tax credits, the company's unexpected speed in delivering positive net income and adjusted EBITDA signals that near-term EBITDA contribution and margin expansion could substantially exceed consensus, especially as carbon business and tax credit monetization scale faster than anticipated.

Analysts broadly agree on $30 million per year in long-term carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credit sales from current volumes, yet Gevo's large-scale CCUS capacity, first-in-class PURO certification, and imminent third-party sequestration deals point toward a much larger and accelerating CDR revenue stream, with potential to deliver recurring, high-margin income well beyond current models as voluntary and compliance carbon markets expand.

Gevo's modular ATJ30 and ATJ60 plant designs, now being rapidly standardized, unlock the prospect of rapid geographic scaling across more than 180 brownfield ethanol sites; this could trigger exponential increases in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, securing long-term volume growth and market share as global SAF mandates and blending requirements ramp up.

The Verity SaaS platform, already monetizing compliance and traceability for major partners like LANXESS and five ethanol plants, positions Gevo to capture recurring, software-based revenue at higher margins by becoming a mission-critical enabler for regenerative agriculture and carbon intensity tracking as industry-wide climate compliance requirements intensify.

With the US shutting down refineries and jet fuel demand forecast to rise over two billion gallons yearly, Gevo's cost-competitive, low-carbon, domestically sourced SAF is poised to command price premiums and tap into a vast, reliable addressable market-driving robust, durable top-line revenue and margin growth as both industry and policy tailwinds accelerate.

Gevo Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

This narrative explores a more optimistic perspective on Gevo compared to the consensus, based on a Fair Value that aligns with the bullish cohort of analysts.

The bullish analysts are assuming Gevo's revenue will grow by 39.8% annually over the next 3 years.

Even the bullish analysts are not forecasting that Gevo will become profitable in next 3 years. To represent the Analyst Price Target as a Future PE Valuation we will estimate Gevo's profit margin will increase from -72.8% to the average US Oil and Gas industry of 15.0% in 3 years.

If Gevo's profit margin were to converge on the industry average, you could expect earnings to reach $32.9 million (and earnings per share of $0.14) by about August 2028, up from $-58.3 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the price target of the more bullish analyst cohort, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 127.5x on those 2028 earnings, up from -6.5x today. This future PE is greater than the current PE for the US Oil and Gas industry at 12.9x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to grow by 1.18% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 7.43%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Gevo Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The long-term acceleration of electric vehicle adoption may structurally reduce demand for liquid biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels, which could shrink Gevo's future addressable market and put downward pressure on revenues as airlines and freight sectors transition to direct electrification or improved battery technologies.

Execution risk remains high for Gevo's commercial plant rollouts, with acknowledged multi-year timelines and heavy dependency on securing external financing, particularly for large projects like ATJ60 that require over $1.6 billion and depend on regulatory and customer factors, creating long-term uncertainty in revenue realization and consistency in profitability.

Gevo's reliance on government incentives such as clean fuel production tax credits and carbon dioxide removal markets exposes it to significant regulatory risk; with credits like 45Z scheduled to expire in 2029 and potential policy changes or retroactive law amendments, future net income and margins could be negatively impacted if incentives are reduced or eliminated.

As seen historically and referenced in the text, high capital intensity, ongoing need for plant expansion, and external project financing may create ongoing share dilution risk, which would undermine per-share earnings growth even if company-wide EBITDA continues to expand.

Gevo operates in an environment of volatile feedstock prices (such as corn), uncertain development in large-scale carbon credit markets, and increasing regulatory and ESG obligations; volatility in input costs and compliance expenses could pressure gross margins and delay sustained profitability over the long term.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The assumed bullish price target for Gevo is $14.0, which is the highest price target estimate amongst analysts. This valuation is based on what can be assumed as the expectations of Gevo's future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors from analysts on the bullish end of the spectrum.

However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $14.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $1.15.

In order for you to agree with the bullish analysts, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $219.1 million, earnings will come to $32.9 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 127.5x, assuming you use a discount rate of 7.4%.

Given the current share price of $1.61, the bullish analyst price target of $14.0 is 88.5% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

Crédit Agricole CIB strengthens its position in energy transition and e-mobility financing.

Crédit Agricole CIB has joined a €325 million (US $355 million) senior debt financing package to support Zenobē’s rapid expansion across continental Europe. The UK-headquartered battery storage and e-mobility specialist will use the funds to deploy up to 1,000 electric buses and trucks, along with supporting charging networks.

Founded in 2017, Zenobē has grown from a UK start-up into an international player in fleet electrification, with operations in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and expanding markets across Europe and North America. The company already commands nearly 28% of the UK’s electric bus market and has secured contracts in the Benelux region, Finland, and Spain.

The financing—backed by KKR and Infracapital—comes at a critical moment as Europe pushes to decarbonize transport. Diesel and petrol vehicles remain a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and the new fleet will provide cities with more sustainable and reliable public transport options.

Matthew Norman, Global Head of Infrastructure & Advisory at Crédit Agricole CIB, said: “Congratulations to all teams involved on closing this landmark electric fleet financing transaction with Zenobē. This deal strengthens the Bank’s position in the energy transition space and builds our credentials in the rapidly growing e-mobility sector. We look forward to leveraging this success for future global opportunities.”

Tom Wellingham, Director for Infrastructure EMEA, added: “Zenobē is a leading business in the low carbon mobility space and one we have watched with great admiration as it has built its market leading position. We are delighted to support Zenobē in deploying their unique offering in continental Europe and look forward to building on this relationship for further opportunities globally.”

The deal builds on Crédit Agricole CIB’s earlier role as Mandated Lead Arranger for Zenobē’s UK grid-scale battery storage project. “The new €325m debt facility will fund the expansion of its electric bus fleets-as-a-service offering in Europe, showcasing the Bank’s ability to partner with our infrastructure fund clients, KKR and Infracapital, to drive energy transition across new market thematics,” said Henry Manson, Director of Infrastructure Coverage.

Zenobē’s European expansion marks one of the most significant private financing initiatives in electric fleet deployment to date, reinforcing both the company’s market leadership and the growing role of infrastructure banks in the global energy transition.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Credit-Agricole-CIB-Backs-Zenobe-with-355-M-Financing-to-Roll-out-1000-Electric-Vehicles-across-Europe.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 07:57:47.771306

Fortescue Zero is a green technology and engineering mining company, with a focus on developing and deploying Real Zero solutions in heavy industry, mobility and motor sports.

The company says it is working to accelerate commercial decarbonisation in the mining industry.

The history of Fortescue zero

The company was founded in 2003, based in Western Australia the company set out to become a global green technology, energy and metals company.

It was forged under its flagship mine site, Cloudbreak, which was followed by the second mine Christmas Creek a year later.

The two sites make the company's Chichester Hub that has an annual production capacity of 100 million tonnes.

Later, the company opened two more mines, Solomon in 2012 and Eliwanna in 2020, with another production capacity of around 100 million tonnes a year.

The two hubs are connected by 760 kilometres of rail.

In 2020, the company also created the Integrated Operation Centre which brings together the supply chain.

The company says it delivers enhanced safety, productivity, efficiency and commercial benefits and aims to use it to underpin the use of future technology like AI and robotics.

The year also saw the creation of Fortescue Future Industries which focuses on developing green electrons, green hydrogen and green technology at scale to replace fossil fuels.

Fortescue Zero’s sustainable goals

By 2030, the company aims to have its Australian iron ore operations running on green energy and achieving zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions, using no fossil fuels at all across its operations.

By 2040, the company hopes to reach net zero across its whole value chain.

Fortescue Zero says although sustainability is deeply integrated into the company it is still focusing on improving its sustainability.

It says that it implements various initiatives across the company to take a precautionary approach to environmental management, continuing to inversion initiatives and technologies that minimise its impact on the environment.

Dino Otranto, CEO of Fortescue Metals, says: “There are new and better ways of operating, through lower cost, more efficient technologies.

“Fortescue is seizing these opportunities rather than foisting the problem on the next generation.

“The fossil fuel era is winding down and Fortescue intends to be at the forefront of what comes next.”

Fortescue zero sustainable solutions

In 2022, the company acquired Williams Advanced Engineering and announced the world's first zero emissions Infinity Train.

The train runs on regenerative batteries, using gravitational energy to recharge its battery electric systems.

The company also has developed heavy industry power systems powered by Elysia and cloud-based batteries.

Elysia is built to extend battery life, enhance safety and unlock range, power and faster charging.

The power systems built are specifically designed for the Mining, Construction, Rail and Automotive markets providing haul trucks, dozers and grader power systems that are all electrically charged rather than using fossil based fuels.

Along with creating machinery, the company also has engineering based in Formula E.

Fortescue Zero says it creates several solutions for tier one motorsports partners such as power systems, fast charging systems as well as providing consultation services to discuss new technologies to work towards decarbonisation.

In 2024, Fortescue announced a partnership with OCP Group to make a green energy hub in Morocco that aims to supply green hydrogen, ammonia and fertilises to Morocco, Europe and even international markets.

American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings said at the organization’s annual meeting this week that the odds seem to favor passage of legislation before the end of the year. “The board asked me to give odds for our likelihood of getting the bipartisan National Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act across the finish line this year. And I told them I thought it was better than 50 percent,” said Jennings. “Congressman Dusty Johnson bested me and he said it’s north of 70%. And that’s really encouraging to hear.”

Small refinery exemptions are back in the news this week with the Trump administration expected to possibly make an announcement today on the fate of nearly 200 pending SRE requests. Jennings hopes the roller coaster saga of exemptions over the past two presidential administrations will finally find some middle ground.

“It’s a really challenging job and they’re not going to make everyone happy. And we know that they’re likely to approve some, they’re likely to deny some. The refiners are gonna complain, and we might too,” said Jennings. “The good news is that the second Trump administration is taking the approach we were hoping for all along for the future…For 2026 and 2027 when, and there will be some, when the Trump EPA allows refinery exemptions, the gallons of renewable fuel those small refineries were supposed to blend will be reallocated to other refiners. In other words, the RVOs remain whole. And that’s exactly the way we wanted it done.”

Contact us Develop your energy tax credit strategy with professional guidance.","Tax credit transferability remains a powerful cash planning strategy for developers and investors. Introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), project owners can sell their tax clean energy credits for cash — making it easier to access capital and plan strategically.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) rolled back certain energy incentives, tax credit transferability remains largely intact, creating a clear runway to transact credits for the next several years and keeping this powerful tax planning strategy firmly in play.

What is tax credit transferability?

Enacted under the IRA, Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code allows entities that generate certain federal clean energy tax credits to sell them to unrelated parties for cash. This is especially beneficial for developers who lack sufficient tax liabilities to use the credits themselves. It’s also an attractive alternative to historical tax equity structures that typically lock investors into partnerships for a number of years.

On the buy side of the transfer market, taxpaying C corporations can’t seem to get enough of the savings afforded by transferable credits. Due to the way Section 6418 was drafted, individuals with passive activity tax liabilities can also benefit from credit purchases; however, C corporation buyers have dominated the market.

Paying less than face value for a credit (sometimes as much as 15%), and not being taxed on the savings, seems like one of those too-good-to-be-true opportunities. But these savings are real, and corporations have flocked to the transfer market to lighten their tax bills and improve cash flow.

What the OBBBA changed — and didn’t change

Despite early drafts of the OBBBA proposing rollbacks to tax credit transferability, the final legislation preserved Section 6418’s framework, albeit with some restrictions.

Most notably, credits now cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities, aligning with broader national security and trade policy goals.

Additionally, the OBBBA chipped away at some of the underlying credits eligible for transfer. The most significant of these changes relates to wind and solar projects, which have been highly transacted in the market.

These projects are now facing a loss of eligibility due to the OBBBA’s accelerated termination date. Namely, projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must now be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for investment and production tax credits under Sections 48E and 45Y, respectively. Projects that start before this date are not subject to the accelerated deadline but must still be placed in service within four years after the year construction begins to meet the continuity safe harbor.

In conjunction with the accelerated termination for wind and solar credits, the IRS further tightened compliance and documentation standards, particularly around the beginning of construction safe harbor provisions.

These changes will force many wind and solar developers to accelerate project plans to preserve tax credit eligibility.

Manufacturing credits are becoming buyer favorites

Two of the newly created credits under the IRA — Sections 45X and 45Z — directly benefit certain clean energy manufacturing activities. They’re also becoming favorites among buyers since they can generate a steady stream of credits, can be transacted in tranches on a quarterly basis, and are viewed as less risky than other credits because they’re generally not subject to recapture.

Section 45X: The tax code’s ultimate manufacturing incentive

Effective January 1, 2023, the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit has been a golden goose of sorts for clean energy manufacturers in the United States.

Applicable to a wide range of clean energy components — from solar equipment to critical minerals — Section 45X has developed a unique position in the market due to the large credits it can generate and the flexibility it can give buyers from a transferability perspective.

Additionally, it’s safer risk profile in the eyes of many buyers has often led to higher market pricing when compared to other transferable credits.

The OBBBA left Section 45X largely intact, although it did accelerate the phaseout of wind energy components. On the flipside, a new qualified mineral was added: metallurgical coal.

Perhaps the biggest change relates to the new prohibited foreign entity rules effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025. The new provisions will require many manufacturers to evaluate their supply chains to avoid tripping the “material assistance” rules, although further guidance is needed to define their meaning and scope.

Section 45Z: A new era for clean fuel tax credits

Effective January 1, 2025, Section 45Z introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit, an incentive aimed at decarbonizing the transportation sector. The credit rewards producers of transportation fuels — both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and non-SAF fuels — based on their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

The OBBBA extended Section 45Z through December 31, 2029, originally slated for termination at the end of 2027 under the IRA.

Section 45Z consolidates and replaces several pre-IRA fuel credits and is expected to bring a surge of new production tax credits to the marketplace. Moreover, it’s expected to gain popularity with buyers due to its flexibility in terms of timing and cash flows.

How CLA can help with tax credit transactions

The 175 SRE petitions the agency issued decisions for were filed by 38 refineries and span RFS compliance years 2016-2024. In consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy, the EPA said it reviewed all information submitted by each individual refinery in support of its petition. The agency said it also evaluated each SRE petition consistent with the Clean Air Act and case law.

After reviewing all information, the EPA said it granted full exemptions to 63 petitions, granted partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and determined 7 petitions to be ineligible. In a document detailing its SRE decisions, the EPA clarified that 82 of the 175 petitions were not previously adjudicated, meaning the agency had not previously issued a decision to approve to deny those 82 petitions. The remaining 93 SRE petitions had previously been ruled on by the agency but were subject to legal challenges and ultimately remanded to the agency for reconsideration.

According to the EPA, its online data dashboard also reflects the status of 34 SRE petitions for 2016-2018 that were previously approved by the agency and challenged via lawsuits. “We are not adjudicating these petitions in this document; instead, we rely on our prior actions to determine their status,” the EPA said in a document outlining its SRE decisions.

Changes made in EPA’s online data dashboard reflect status changes for both the 175 SRE petitions the agency ruled on Aug. 22 and the agency’s decision articulate the status of the 34 legally challenged SRE petitions, as referenced above.

New changes to the SRE data dashboard, as reflected on Aug. 22, include the approval of two SRE petitions for 2016, with one SRE petition approved for 2017. For RFS compliance year 2018, the dashboard indicates 29 full approvals, three partial approvals, and six denials. For compliance year 2019, the dashboard shows 25 full approvals and four partial approvals. Only seven SRE petitions received full approvals for RFS compliance year 2020, with 17 partial approvals and six denials. For 2021, the dashboard reflects 15 full approvals and six partial approvals. The EPA had previously listed four SRE petitions for 2021 as being denied, but as of Aug. 22 only one denial is listed on the agency’s SRE data dashboard. The EPA also declared two 2021 petitions as ineligible, with two petitions currently listed as pending. For 2022, the EPA issued six full approvals and 14 partial approvals. The EPA previously listed five 2022 petitions as being denied, but now only lists three SRE petitions as denied. In addition, one 2022 petition was declared ineligible. For compliance year 2023, the dashboard shows six full approvals and 14 partial approvals, with one SRE petition declared ineligible, while for 2025, the agency issued four full approvals, 18 partial approvals, five denials and declared three SRE petitions ineligible. The EPA did not act on the 11 SRE petitions currently pending for compliance year 2025.

Overall, 293 SRE petitions have been filed for compliance year 2016-2025, with 146 fully approved, 77 partially approved, 36 denied, 13 declared ineligible, eight withdrawn and 13 pending.

The number of full and partial denials for 2016-2024 effectively waives RFS blending requirements for 8.49 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel, equating to an estimated 9.37 billion renewable identification numbers (RINs). For 2024 alone, the approved SRE petitions account for 730 million RINs, or approximately 3.39% of the year’s total RVO, which was estimated at 21.54 billion RINs.

The agency said its actions reaffirm a policy set during the first Trump administration in the 2020 renewable volume obligation (RVO) rulemaking to grant a 50% exemption where a small refinery has demonstrated it has faced a partial hardship. Under the DOE’s 2011 small refinery study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship.

“With today’s action, EPA is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences,” the agency said in an announcement.

The EPA also reaffirmed a policy to return RINs that were previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. Because RINs have a two-year window for use, the EPA said 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

In addition, the EPA said it will “in the near future” submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the White House Office of Management and Budget on proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. The EPA said it will also provide updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. “The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025 – 2027 in Set 2,” the agency said. “The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.”

The Renewable Fuels Association said it continues to question whether these SREs are truly justified, but noted the EPA’s approve for implementing these exemptions appears reasonable and should not disrupt the market place or reduce actual renewable fuel consumption.

“While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

“In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA’s new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship,” Cooper added. “According to EPA’s previous analysis, all refiners—both small and large—recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to ‘economic hardship.’ In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance—not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.”

Growth Energy is calling on EPA to reallocate waived RVOs. “With more than 140 granted refinery exemptions, today's decision alone does not give farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need,"" said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand. We appreciate EPA’s commitment to issue a rule that ensures promised homegrown biofuel gallons reach the marketplace and upholds the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol also called EPA’s approach “reasonable.”

“EPA appears to be carefully trying to balance the recent caselaw and the RFS statute when it comes to their new methodology for small refinery exemptions,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “The good news is that EPA is proposing to reallocate any and all small refinery exemptions they grant for 2023 and beyond, which is how the SRE program should be implemented. EPA will issue a supplemental proposal on how they intend to reallocate exempted gallons for 2023 and beyond, and their reallocation methodology will be incorporated into the final ‘Set 2’ rule later this year which also covers the 2026 and 2027 renewable volume obligations.

“The agency argues they’re not going to reallocate for exempted gallons granted to small refineries for the 2016 through 2022 RFS compliance years because those RINs are expired and it will not have an impact on blending,” Jennings continued. “That may be true, and we will carefully monitor how the D6 RIN market reacts to this news. In the past, SREs led to depressed RIN values which discourages blending of E15 and higher blends. Overall, however, the approach proposed by EPA looks reasonable.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America expressed wariness of the agency’s award to the refiners of more than 1.4 billion RINs from compliance years 2023 and 2024 to be used for the delayed compliance deadline for 2024. “EPA’s course correction on RFS small refinery exemptions creates fresh uncertainty for America’s farmers and biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF producers,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. “We look forward to working with the agency to ensure today’s decision does not unwind the strong signal of support issued in June through robust RFS volumes meant to drive growth and recognize investment in domestic fuels and American agriculture.”

Clean Fuel stressed that in the recently proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027 and draft regulatory impact analysis, EPA reiterated that its analyses consistently show “all obligated parties—including small refiners—fully recover the costs of RFS compliance” through fuel sales.

“EPA’s announcement conflicts with its consistent finding that small refiners are not facing disproportionate economic hardships from RFS compliance,” Kovarik continued. “Refunding retired RINs has the potential to undercut current markets for domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF as well as for American oilseed crops and other feedstocks. This announcement comes just as farmers begin planning to harvest the year’s soybean crop, which is expected to achieve a record-setting yield. We urge EPA to ensure that small refinery exemptions do not undermine the market for farmers and clean fuel producers.”

The Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) has spoken out in support of EPA’s plan to reallocate waived volumes. “We are grateful to see EPA take action addressing the extensive backlog of small refinery exemptions,” said Michael McAdams, president of the ABFA. “ABFA is also pleased that the agency plans to prepare a supplemental proposed rule for the reallocation of the exempted volumes for those years where compliance is yet to be demonstrated as well as how to account for exemptions in future years.

“Exemptions have a significant impact on the value of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs),” McAdams continued. “When RIN values drop, the entire advanced biofuels market is destabilized and put at risk, significantly impacting consumers downstream. ABFA looks forward to reviewing the proposed rule for reallocation and forecasting adjustments that can strengthen the market for all parties""

“A ban on landfilling wind turbine blades will help accelerate the development of sustainable recycling technologies.
This is alongside some countries aiming to introduce strict requirements for wind turbine recycling.
When wind turbine blades are decommissioned, they normally end up in landfill.
Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I and Siemens Gamesa UK, says: ""Seeing the first recyclable blades being installed in UK waters is a major landmark moment.","The standard lifespan of an onshore windfarm is 20-25 years.

Around 90% of a wind farm being can be recycled, but the blades are sometimes seen as a challenge.

WindEurope is calling for a Europe-wide ban on landfilling turbine blades by 2025.

Giles Dickson, CEO at WindEurope, says: “Wind energy is a green technology. Sustainability is part of our DNA.

“That’s why we are constantly striving to further reduce our impact on the environment.

“A ban on landfilling wind turbine blades will help accelerate the development of sustainable recycling technologies. Austria, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands already have a landfill ban in place.

“But we call upon the European Commission to propose a harmonised European approach”

RWE has partnered with Siemens Gamesa to support the first large-scale installation of recyclable blades at a UK offshore windfarm.

How will the project work?

The rotor blades will be made from innovative resin.

The aim is that when the blade has come to the end of its operating life, the materials can be separated and as a result be recycled.

This could also be used in vehicle components and consumer goods like bicycles, helmets and suitcases.

RWE’s Sofia Offshore Wind Farm is now being fitted with 150 recycled blades across half of its 100 wind turbines.

“Deploying recyclable blades at this scale is an indicator of RWE’s drive to deliver sustainability across its renewables fleet.

“By working with partners like Siemens Gamesa, we are setting a new sustainability benchmark for renewables development and helping significantly improve the circularity of offshore wind technology.”

What is Siemen Gamesa's new technology?

Siemens says it is aiming to improve the circularity of windfarms due to the number of installations and turbine size increasing.

This is alongside some countries aiming to introduce strict requirements for wind turbine recycling.

The company says it is committed to producing 100% recyclable turbines by 2040.

When wind turbine blades are decommissioned, they normally end up in landfill.

Siemens Gamesa has pioneered RecyclableBlade technology so the blades can be reused in other industries.

It says the change was simple with and only required the introduction of its new resin.

Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I and Siemens Gamesa UK, says: ""Seeing the first recyclable blades being installed in UK waters is a major landmark moment. This is a great example of how we can share knowledge and work together to deliver on both energy security and a net zero future.

“Our Hull factory is at the cutting edge of blade technology development & manufacturing.

“As a global leader in energy technology, we’re proud to be partnering with RWE on Sofia, one of the largest offshore wind farms in the world.”

RWE's sustainability goals

Within a year, RWE says halved its emissions from the plants it operates, aiming to continue this journey through building more wind and solar assets to make climate-friendly energy systems a reality.

By 2030, the company aims to have more than a 70% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with the end goal of achieving net zero by 2040.

Kunal Chandra, Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer at RWE, said on LinkedIn: “Sustainability in infrastructure and products starts with being smart right at the design phase and this is exactly what we have done with our partner Siemens Energy by installing recyclable blades in our Sofia Windfarm.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/bec6d2b3c7c84c86d99d0b9aed69e231:f2a89b056fb45b990b885be2f53073bc/sofia-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 14:56:17.177617

“The fact that the calls for change are coming from within the aviation sector and from the employees themselves and even some senior leaders is very promising,” said Deborah McNamara, executive director of ClimateVoice, a non-profit that supports employee-led climate action.","Staff at major aviation companies, including Air France, KLM, Airbus and Lufthansa, are among hundreds of industry insiders calling on their leaders to undertake dramatically more ambitious action on climate.

The demands, organized by a pressure group known as Call Aviation to Action (CAA), include several that are at odds with the industry’s position on climate change, such as setting absolute emissions reduction targets. Hitting such targets would likely require limiting service, another strategy at odds with current plans.

“Call Aviation to Action started because we discovered that there are many, many people in the industry who are really concerned about climate change, but also very committed to aviation, and who were not able to speak up,” said Karel Bockstael, an aviation consultant and former vice president of sustainability at KLM who initiated the project with four other aviation professionals.

The industry’s existing net-zero ambition rests in part on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a 2016 agreement that requires participating airlines to cap emissions at 85 percent of 2019 levels. Any subsequent growth must be offset by purchasing CORSIA-approved carbon credits.

Around 30 airlines have also committed to near-term goals with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), or had those goals validated by the organization. To align with warming of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the SBTi requires airlines to reduce emissions intensity by 30 percent and 50 percent in 2030 and 2035, respectively.

Fossil fuels ‘until the end of time’

Neither standard is sufficient if the industry is to stay within planetary boundaries, say the 443 people who have signed the CAA’s statement since it was issued in May.

Bockstael argued that CORSIA is flawed because many offset projects have failed to deliver claimed climate benefits. “It will support the fossil kerosene solution until the end of time,” he said. “If we do that then the growth will go on and at some point the availability of the offsets will not be enough.”

He praised the intent of the SBTi aviation standard, which requires that the industry as a whole stay within a total carbon budget identified as consistent with 1.5 degrees of warming. But CAA says the standard is undermined by overly optimistic assumptions about efficiency improvements and the idea that fossil jet fuel can be eliminated by 2050.

The organization argues instead that airlines should set a carbon budget for the industry — acknowledging a fair distribution of the budget across populations — then bring their goals in line with it. Signatories are also asking companies to lobby for regulation that “takes all players in our industry along in what is needed to respect the boundaries we are currently transgressing,” be more realistic about future technology gains and better manage demand, particularly in regions that have a larger share of historic emissions.

Insider influence

Environmental groups have long made similar demands, but the CAA is notable for its insider approach. Among the signatories are professionals working in supply chain, business development and strategy, as well as several pilots. Likely because of Bockstael’s connections, that includes more than 40 employees of KLM and Air France, Europe’s largest airline group.

“At KLM, we are doing everything we can to make flying cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient, step by step,” a company spokesperson told Trellis. “Making aviation more sustainable takes time, and progress isn’t as fast as we would like. But that doesn’t mean we’re standing still.” The airline is investing more than $8 billion in more efficient aircraft, the spokesperson added, and is one of the world’s largest purchasers of sustainable aviation fuel.

“The fact that the calls for change are coming from within the aviation sector and from the employees themselves and even some senior leaders is very promising,” said Deborah McNamara, executive director of ClimateVoice, a non-profit that supports employee-led climate action. “They’re the people who know what it’s like to work in this industry and who shape it.”

Circularity Fuels has developed the Ouro reactor, a compact system that converts raw biogas from cow manure into synthesis gas, a key building block for sustainable jet fuel.

From Waste Lagoons to Flight Paths

The process begins with manure decomposing in farm lagoons, releasing methane and carbon dioxide. The Ouro reactor captures this raw biogas and transforms it directly into synthesis gas, which can then be refined into aviation-grade fuel through the Fischer–Tropsch process, a well-established industrial method. Crucially, Circularity Fuels says the reactor can operate without combustion and handle contaminants that would typically disable other reformers, eliminating the need for costly pre-treatment.

Company founder and CEO Dr Stephen Beaton believes the approach could turn farms into producers of renewable energy. “Farmers in the US and around the world are sitting on an untapped gold mine,” he said. “We are enabling them to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need.”

A Cheaper Path to Sustainable Fuel

The company claims the Ouro reactor is 100 times cheaper than conventional syngas systems. This makes it financially viable on a much smaller scale. The technology can connect to existing power grids. It can also be deployed directly on farms. It could allow the fuel production chain to begin at the source of the waste.

The potential supply is vast. The US livestock industry generates nearly half a billion tonnes of manure each year. Yet less than 6% currently feeds into biogas production. Circularity Fuels says wider adoption of its technology could unlock a significant portion of that untapped resource.

Meeting Aviation’s Sustainability Targets

Airlines are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions by incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). At present, SAF accounts for barely 1% of global jet fuel consumption. Circularity Fuels suggests that if its technology were rolled out across US farms, landfills, and wastewater plants, it could generate up to 42 million gallons of fuel per day. It is enough to cover around 70% of America’s aviation demand.

The company is planning to stage a full demonstration at a California dairy farm later this year, converting manure-derived biogas all the way through to jet fuel. If successful, the Ouro reactor could offer a scalable route to both cleaner skies and new revenue streams for farmers, positioning waste as a critical part of the future energy mix.",https://orbitaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ouro-reactor.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:56:37.240023

This innovative technology, backed by the NEDO Green Innovation Fund, marks a major step in the chemical industry’s shift toward alternative, more sustainable feedstocks. The company plans to accelerate demonstration efforts with the goal of commercializing the process and offering it for licensing by the early 2030s.

Propylene, a fundamental building block in the chemical industry, is currently produced in Japan primarily from naphtha, a fossil fuel derivative. Ethanol, however, offers a renewable alternative, as it can be derived from biomass sources such as sugarcane, corn, and even non-edible materials like pulp. Recent advances have also made large-scale ethanol production from combustible waste more feasible, further strengthening its potential as a sustainable feedstock.

Sumitomo Chemical’s new process stands out by enabling the direct, single-step production of propylene from ethanol—eliminating the need for intermediates like ethylene, which are commonly involved in other methods. This streamlined approach not only promises to reduce production costs but also produces hydrogen as a by-product. When bioethanol is used, the hydrogen generated is also bio-based, adding further environmental value.

The company will continue collecting the technical data required to scale up the process and is preparing to promote polypropylene made from propylene produced via this new method. Commercialization and technology licensing are targeted for early next decade.

As part of its broader strategy, Sumitomo Chemical is reorienting its petrochemical operations to emphasize technologies that support environmental sustainability. Structural reforms are underway in both domestic and international markets, alongside increased efforts in technology licensing and catalyst sales, including for the ethanol-to-propylene process.

Looking ahead, Sumitomo Chemical plans to establish a green transformation (GX) solutions business beyond 2030. This new model will focus on building a circular value chain in collaboration with raw material providers and brand owners, while also monetizing carbon reduction efforts achieved through its technologies.

US exempts small refiners from biofuel quotas: Update

Updates throughout New York, 22 August (Argus) — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today fully or partially granted the majority of small refiners' requests for waivers from federal biofuel blend mandates, while limiting the windfall for newly exempt refiners. The agency fully accepted 63 petitions, offered 50pc relief in response to 77 petitions, denied 28 requests, and determined that 7 were ineligible. Program data shows 13 petitions still pending, mostly from the 2025 compliance year. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those that do. Refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d can request hardship exemptions from the mandates, which they have long cast as financially onerous. President Donald Trump's administration had an unprecedented backlog of requests to decide after courts took issue with former president Joe Biden's reasoning for mass denials. While the number of exemptions frustrated biofuel and farm advocates, small refiners that lobbied officials for retroactive compensation were denied more sweeping relief. EPA said on Friday that it would return already-surrendered RINs to newly exempt companies but that only credits from 2023 and later could be used for future compliance. Returned older credits, effectively worthless, ""are not expected to impact demand for biofuels"", the agency said. Because the older credits have no value, EPA does not plan to force oil companies to blend more biofuels to account for those exemptions. But EPA signaled a different approach for more recent years, saying that it planned to account for actual exemptions in 2023 and 2024 and expected exemptions in 2025 when setting future biofuel quotas. The agency said it would ""in the near future"" submit a proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget that will clarify its plan. EPA had already signaled that it would estimate future exemptions when setting biofuel mandates, but accounting for actual exemptions from active compliance years in addition would be a major shift that could increase costs for larger oil companies, if implemented. Program data show that affected small refiners have to submit about 1.4bn fewer RINs across 2023 and 2024 following Friday's exemptions — but companies without exemptions could have to make up that lost volume in the future depending on EPA's pending proposal. The total mandates in those years were 20.9bn RINs and 21.5bn RINs respectively. EPA said Friday it aimed to ensure stability in the often-volatile RIN market, noting that replacing expired credits with active ones would have flooded the market with 3bn more RINs. Current-year D6 ethanol credits rose 4pc and D4 biomass-based diesel credits rose 3pc on Friday, as traders saw EPA's solution to older-vintage credits as limiting supply increases. Biofuel groups, while frustrated that most eligible refiners won at least some relief, expressed cautious optimism about EPA's plan. Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper said Friday's exemptions ""should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use"". But companies will eagerly await more details about EPA's proposal to account for 2023 and 2024 waivers, which could come as soon as next week. EPA has signaled that it wants to finalize new biofuel mandates before November, but that timeline appears ambitious if the agency has to first take comment on a proposal that could drastically shift its formula for setting those mandates. Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biomass-based diesel producers, said that the new plan ""will delay the finalization of the 2026 and 2027 rule"". In a draft regulation earlier this year, EPA proposed record-high biofuel blending for those years. Court fights await Legal challenges are virtually guaranteed. The agency said that its decisions had ""nationwide scope or effect"" — an effort to steer litigation toward one federal circuit court rather than a hodgepodge of regional courts that might issue conflicting rulings. Small refiners denied full relief are likely to challenge the Trump administration's reasoning. EPA said it almost entirely relied on recommendations from the Department of Energy (DOE), which scores individual applications for ""disproportionate economic hardship"" and considers factors like a refiner's output of diesel compared to gasoline and its local market's acceptance of renewables. While EPA is legally required to consult with DOE, the new policy of largely deferring to that department's recommendations would be a major change from recent years. A 2022 study from the US Government Accountability Office concluded that DOE's methodology was ""critically flawed"", and EPA officials at the time told the watchdog agency that DOE's analysis no longer provided useful information. Accepting DOE scores appears to have led to some counterintuitive results, though specific details from applications are kept confidential. Par Pacific's 18,000 b/d Wyoming refinery earned full exemptions for three straight years before losing relief the next. Ergon's 23,000 b/d facility in West Virginia won partial exemptions for 2021 and 2024, but not the years in between. And EPA offered at least some relief to Suncor's 36,000 b/d Commerce City East refinery over six straight years — while denying any relief for four of those years to Suncor's 67,000 b/d Commerce City West refinery at the same Colorado site. ""Not a lot of rhyme or reason to it"", a refining source told Argus . The unpredictability of the exemptions — with essentially all refiners receiving different answers depending on the year — could also make it hard for EPA to estimate future waivers when finalizing biofuel quotas. The agency has received some exemption petitions for 2025 but has yet to decide any for that year or beyond. Large oil refiners will also hotly oppose any effort from EPA to raise their biofuel blending to compensate for their smaller competitors winning exemptions. While some oil companies joined with farm groups this year to push for higher biofuel mandates, the industry has more recently expressed frustration with Trump-backed biofuel policies that they say are boosting feedstock and fuel costs. ""It is inexplicable that EPA is even considering adding more mandated biofuels on top of the largest and most expensive [Renewable Fuel Standard] mandate ever proposed by reallocating exempted volumes"", the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers said.

Brazil updates Cop 30 forest fund plan

Sao Paulo, 22 August (Argus) — Brazil has advanced its Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) initiative, a fund to preserve global tropical forests that will be launched at the UN Cop 30 summit, adding new governance and financing structures. Under the updated plan, TFFF will act through two distinct entities: the Tropical Forest Investment Fund (TFIF), a legally independent investment vehicle, and TFFF itself, hosted initially by the World Bank. The TFIF will blend sponsor capital — 20pc from sovereign and philanthropic sources and 80pc raised via bond issuance to institutional investors. Returns from this portfolio will fund annual payments to participating countries, starting at $4/ha of preserved forest. Payments are subject to an inflation adjustment, capped at 2pc/yr. It aims to raise $25bn in sponsor capital and an additional $100bn in senior market debt. TFIF will ""exclude investments that cause significant environmental impact"", such as those in activities related coal, peat, oil and natural gas. The updated plan also adds that funded countries must maintain deforestation rates below 0.5pc and will face steep payment discounts for forest loss or degradation. Each hectare (ha) deforested could reduce payments by up to 200ha worth of funding, depending on severity. It also includes a canopy coverage threshold of 20–30pc within specific mapping for countries to apply to the fund. That threshold is subject to updated degradation and deforestation discount ratios. It also highlights that TFFF will not generate or issue carbon or biodiversity credits, nor will it replace other existing forest finance initiatives such as REDD+. Instead, it is ""designed to complement, not duplicate, existing programs"". Finally, the TFFF has reduced its repayment term to 30 years — adding a 10-year grace period — and will require that at least 20pc of payments be allocated to indigenous peoples and local communities. Brazil plans to launch TFFF during Cop 30, which it will host in November in northern Para state. Deforestation is one of Brazil's flagship issues for the summit. The TFFF working group expects to conclude the details of the fund's financial model by September. It then expects initial pledges from sponsor countries to begin after the World Bank board's meeting from 13-18 October. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization countries — Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela — will sign a joint declaration in favor of TFFF on Friday, Brazil's government said. Brazil is working to eliminate deforestation — both legal and illegal — by 2030, to meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris climate agreement.

Incentive to book German Rehden gas storage decreases

London, 22 August (Argus) — The financial incentive to book capacity at the largest German gas storage site Rehden for the remainder of this storage year continues to decrease. Available injection capacity at Sefe's Rehden storage site in combination with maintenance in October have rendered bookings at the storage site unattractive, with a worse outlook each day that passes without additional bookings. Sefe has offered a doubled injection rate of 1.75 GWh/d since 16 July from 882 MWh/d in previous auctions. As of today, the firm had only sold 13.96TWh of capacity out of 44.68TWh of technical capacity. As a result of the increased injection rate on offer, Sefe can only sell 24.6TWh or 55pc of the site's technical capacity. The boosted injection rate did contribute to further bookings at first, but has not done so in recent auctions. It would take 64 days to completely fill a bundle, and given maintenance on 6-24 October at the storage site, if firms were to book capacity today and inject at the increased firm injection rate from Saturday, it would only fill the bundle by 8 November. Factoring in injection days in each month, the average THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.35/MWh. Market participants have indicated that a €1.80-2/MWh spread is needed for them to profitably book and make use of Rehden space. And every day that capacity is not booked brings the required injection period further into November, reducing the incentive. The THE November first-quarter 2026 spread is narrower than that of earlier months, closing at -€0.305/MWh at the last close, much tighter than the THE balance-of-August first-quarter 2026 spread of -€1.87/MWh. But if Sefe were to offer additional injection capacity, this would improve the incentive to book space at the site. Sefe could offer 3.11 GWh/d of injection capacity — which would further reduce the storage capacity it can offer — and still fill the site to 45pc of capacity, in line with Germany's national storage law. This would allow firms to fill a bundle in 36 days, before the start of October maintenance. If a firm were to book capacity today and inject at this rate from Saturday, it would fill the storage space by 28 September. Considering these injection days, the THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.81/MWh, bringing it within the profitable margin. Other storage sites currently more attractive Storage capacity at other storage sites in Germany is currently more attractive to book than at Rehden, when only considering injection rates. Space at the Etzel ESE (Uniper Energy Storage), Epe-L (RWE), Nuttermoor H-5 (EWE), Jemgum H (EWE) and Nuttermoor H-4 (EWE) storage sites is currently more attractive to book than Rehden based on their firm injection rates ( see table ). All these storage sites, where a total of 7.32TWh of capacity is available, currently offer higher firm injection rates per GWh of capacity than Rehden. This does not take into account additional or interruptible injection capacity that might be on offer at the sites. That said, EWE was unable to sell any capacity at Nuttermoor H-4 in an auction on Thursday, the firm told Argus today. The firm had offered 1.36TWh of gas for the remainder of the storage year.

The agreement focuses on using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and adopting wider environmental performance measures.

SAF adoption and carbon-cutting plans

Sustainable aviation fuel is a liquid fuel alternative produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues or non-food crops.

It can replace traditional jet fuel with fewer lifecycle carbon emissions.

Lufthansa Cargo, which already uses SAF in its operations, agrees to supply the fuel for SHEIN shipments, backed by documentation known as 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates.

These certificates record the emissions saved when SAF replaces fossil-based aviation fuel and are verified by third-party standards.

The MoU outlines plans for SAF-based offsetting solutions to be in place within six months.

Both companies agree to treat SAF not as a final fix but as one part of a broader carbon reduction strategy.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network.”

This includes the potential for lower-carbon energy sources, alongside operational measures aimed at improving overall transport efficiency.

Lufthansa Cargo brings its experience in SAF procurement and deployment to the table, sharing knowledge with SHEIN as both sides commit to a joint learning approach.

For SHEIN, which does not operate its own aircraft but uses third-party air freight to move products between suppliers and global markets, the partnership opens new avenues to cut emissions across supply routes.

Transparency and traceability take centre stage

A key part of the agreement lies in the focus on data. Both companies agree to collaborate on environmental reporting and data sharing to improve traceability in emissions tracking.

This will include analysis of operational efficiency, such as how fuel use relates to freight volumes and flight routing.

By combining their data, the two organisations aim to uncover patterns that could inform emissions reductions across logistics.

The MoU also signals an intent to explore shared methodologies for assessing sustainability performance, particularly in relation to fleet efficiency and process quality.

“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” says Ashwin Bhat, CEO at Lufthansa Cargo.

“It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business.”

“Together with all stakeholders within the supply chain, we are driving the development of more sustainable global supply chains in line with our purpose: Enabling Global Business.""

The companies have also committed to exploring how better traceability tools can support measurable improvements in sustainability, looking into fleet-wide performance metrics and quality assurance within air transport systems.

Broader goals but no binding targets

While the MoU signals intent, it does not include binding commitments or legally enforced emissions targets. Instead, it sets a framework for pilot projects and trial initiatives that could feed into wider efforts across the logistics sector.

It leaves the door open for the expansion of SAF use, dependent on feasibility and the evolving supply of fuel sources.

The focus is on enabling practical steps that can be tested and refined over time.

“While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency and exploring other low-carbon solutions,” says Ethan.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/89bcaea1738e91114836a871c9cd9626:a216ebbcf408aafac09e8a7040710442/shein-lufthansa-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:56:50.407471

By pioneering the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), these industry giants aim to revolutionize the way goods are transported. While the adoption of SAF presents a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions in the air cargo sector, challenges around availability and scalability persist. This groundbreaking partnership not only sets a new standard for eco-conscious logistics but also signals a pivotal shift towards greener practices in global supply chains.

The Potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The collaboration between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo marks a significant milestone in the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within the air freight industry. As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, SAF presents a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of air cargo operations. Despite the current challenges surrounding the availability and scalability of SAF, the partnership between these two industry leaders showcases a proactive approach towards embracing greener practices in logistics. By piloting the integration of SAF into Shein's supply chain, the companies are not only setting a new standard for sustainability but also paving the way for other players to follow suit in reducing their carbon footprint.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that SAF accounted for just 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production in 2024, highlighting the nascent stage of this eco-friendly alternative. However, the potential impact of SAF on reducing carbon emissions is substantial, with studies showing that it can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 85 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. As Shein ships thousands of tonnes of cargo daily, even a single flight powered by SAF could lead to a significant reduction in emissions for that journey. This initiative not only aligns with the companies' environmental goals but also sets a precedent for the industry to embrace sustainable practices in air freight operations.

Addressing Environmental Challenges in Air Cargo

The environmental impact of air cargo transportation has long been a concern due to its high carbon footprint compared to other modes of shipping. According to Freightos, air freight shipments generate significantly more pollution than ocean freight shipments, underscoring the urgency for sustainable alternatives in the logistics sector. Shein, a major player in the fast-fashion industry, heavily relies on air cargo for its product deliveries, contributing to substantial upstream transportation emissions. Despite efforts to shift towards land or sea routes where feasible, the company's reliance on air freight remains a critical aspect of its business model, necessitating innovative solutions to reduce its carbon emissions effectively.

The partnership between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo not only focuses on integrating SAF into air freight operations but also emphasizes the importance of offsetting carbon emissions through supporting the growth of the SAF market. By purchasing SAF offsets and obtaining ""Proof of Sustainability"" certificates, the companies are demonstrating their commitment to environmental stewardship. This holistic approach to addressing environmental challenges in air cargo signifies a strategic shift towards more sustainable practices in the global supply chain landscape.

The memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo extends beyond just implementing SAF in air freight operations; it also aims to catalyze broader change within the industry. By collaborating on environmental and traceability initiatives, the companies are not only setting a precedent for eco-conscious logistics but also creating a ripple effect that could influence other e-commerce players and cargo operators to explore similar sustainable measures. The strategic decision to work towards long-term collaboration underscores a shared commitment to driving positive environmental impact and fostering innovation in supply chain sustainability.

The partnership's focus on building the market for SAF and encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices sends a clear signal to the industry that sustainability is no longer a choice but a necessity. As Shein leverages its reliance on air cargo to advocate for SAF's potential, it sets a precedent for other major brands and retailers to prioritize eco-friendly transportation solutions. The demand signals generated by this collaboration have the potential to accelerate the transition towards greener logistics practices, ultimately reshaping the way goods are transported globally.

Mills in Savannah and Riceboro will shut down by the end of next month, as will the company's Savannah packaging facility. The combined changes will result in a net reduction of International Paper's annual containerboard capacity by about 1 million tons.

The company will offer severance packages along with outplacement assistance for eligible employees, said Tom Hamic, president of International Paper's North America Packing Solutions business.

""We understand how deeply these decisions affect our employees, their loved ones, and the surrounding communities,"" he said. ""We are committed to supporting both our employees and customers as we navigate this transition.""

""These mill closures will undoubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,"" added Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns, R-Newington.

The pulp and paper industry has been buffeted by a long-term reduction in demand for its products. The number of mills in Georgia has fallen from 18 at the height of production in 1977 to just nine with Thursday's closure announcements, Marshall Thomas, president of Albany-based F&W Forest Services, told an audience of political and ag business leaders at the annual Ag Issues Summit at the Georgia National Fairgrounds in Perry.

Thomas said Georgia lawmakers are working to increase demand for timber products, including a state Senate study committee that began meeting last year to explore developing sustainable aviation fuel from biomass, which has become popular in Europe.

""Why aren't we doing this?"" he said. ""The world wants green stuff ... and we've got some of the greatest forestry in the world.""

Thomas said another way to increase demand for timber is being worked on at the federal level. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's renewable fuel standard is aimed at increasing the use of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it bans the use of commercially produced trees in producing those fuels.

""If we could get that relaxed to include trees, it would go a long way,"" he said.

""I, along with each member of our delegation in the House, remain committed to working tirelessly with our state leaders, federal partners and timber producers to navigate this difficult transition, secure new employment opportunities for the hundreds of citizens impacted by the closures and safeguard the long-term strength and viability of Georgia’s timber industry,"" Burns added.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/sports/savannah-paper-mill.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-08-22 13:56:45.322218

In 2025, a confluence of rising fuel costs, operational delays, and the relentless push for sustainability has created a landscape where risk and opportunity are inextricably linked. For investors, the challenge lies in discerning which companies are weathering these headwinds with resilience—and which are being swept away by them.

The Fuel Efficiency Paradox

Fuel remains the second-largest operating expense for airlines, and its volatility continues to test the mettle of even the most seasoned operators. U.S. airlines, for instance, saw fuel costs per gallon rise 4.2% in January 2025 compared to December 2024, despite a 5.1% drop in total fuel expenditure. This apparent contradiction is a testament to the industry's progress in fuel efficiency: consumption fell by 8.9% year-over-year, driven by newer aircraft and route optimization. Yet, the cost per gallon has climbed steadily since January 2020, from $1.98 to $2.42, squeezing margins.

The broader logistics sector faces similar pressures. Air freight demand surged 6.1% year-over-year in January 2025, fueled by Red Sea disruptions and e-commerce growth. However, capacity expansion lagged behind, with carriers adding only 4–5% more cargo space compared to demand's 6–10% rise. This imbalance has driven up freight rates, creating a double-edged sword: higher revenue for carriers but increased costs for shippers.

Operational Delays: A Hidden Tax on Value

Operational delays, whether due to supply chain bottlenecks or regulatory hurdles, are another drag on performance. For traditional airlines, delays in aircraft deliveries—particularly for next-gen models like the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo—have forced carriers to operate older, less efficient fleets longer than planned. Delta Air Lines, for example, has had to absorb higher maintenance costs and fuel burn while awaiting new aircraft, a situation that has weighed on its stock despite its strong brand and customer loyalty.

The eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) sector, meanwhile, is grappling with a different kind of delay. Archer Aviation, a key player in urban air mobility, is in the final phase of FAA certification for its Midnight eVTOL. Only 15% of compliance documents have been approved to date, and any further delays could erode investor confidence. The stock's 5.69% drop in August 2025 following a high-volume test flight underscores the market's sensitivity to regulatory progress.

The Tailwinds of Innovation

Yet, for every headwind, there is a potential tailwind. The push for sustainability is reshaping the industry in ways that could redefine competitive advantage. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), for instance, is gaining traction despite its higher cost. Airlines like Delta and United are investing in SAF partnerships, betting that regulatory incentives and consumer demand for green travel will offset the premium.

Technology is another area of opportunity. Southwest Airlines' recent $750 million accelerated share repurchase program is a case in point. The airline's disciplined approach to fleet modernization—retiring older 737-700s and acquiring more efficient 737-8s—has improved fuel efficiency and reduced costs. Its 47% hedging coverage for 2025 fuel needs further insulates it from price shocks, a strategy that has bolstered investor confidence.

The Investor's Dilemma: Risk vs. Reward

For investors, the key is to identify companies that are not just surviving but thriving in this environment. Delta's recent pilot labor agreements, while costly, have stabilized its workforce and positioned it for long-term growth. Similarly, Southwest's ability to balance cost discipline with customer experience investments—such as enhanced in-flight Wi-Fi—has made it a standout in a crowded market.

The eVTOL sector, though riskier, offers high-reward potential. Archer Aviation's partnerships with Abu Dhabi Aviation and Ethiopian Airlines signal international demand, but success hinges on timely FAA certification. Investors with a higher risk tolerance may find value in early-stage players like Archer, provided they monitor regulatory progress closely.

A Call for Strategic Patience

The aviation and logistics sectors are at a crossroads. While fuel efficiency gains and technological innovation are creating new avenues for growth, they also require significant upfront investment. For companies like Delta and Southwest, the path to profitability lies in balancing these costs with operational discipline. For eVTOL pioneers, the stakes are even higher: regulatory approval is the difference between a moonshot and a market leader.

Investors must weigh these dynamics carefully. Short-term volatility is inevitable, but long-term success will belong to those who can navigate the headwinds with agility—and who recognize that the greatest opportunities often lie in the most challenging skies.

In the end, the aviation and logistics sectors are not just about flying higher—they're about flying smarter. And for those who can see the forest for the trees, the rewards could be substantial.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 11:57:07.593914

35 billion gallons of SAF to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050.
For all that to happen, the farmers and ethanol plants will need to comply with the 45ZCF-GREET model that has been adopted by the U.S. Treasury.
That is because the gasoline manufacturers are making more per gallon of ethanol sold than the farmers who raise the grain.","I recently attended a Sustainable Aviation Fuel conference, which was at the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum near Ashland, Nebraska.

Overwhelmingly, the message from presenters, in my opinion, was, “this is great fuel technology; we just can’t afford it yet. We need big government funds.” Most concerning was the person who called for the meeting and kicked it off, U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, of Nebraska, who plans to champion the authorization of more tax credits to make this happen.

To put this into context, supporters suggested that 27 million gallons of SAF would be generated in 2025, a measly portion of what the entire airline travel industry uses at 126 billion gallons per year. Let me cut right to the chase, despite how they try to position this, it requires the farmer and ethanol plants to increase costs and comply with emission standards that allow the airline industry to offset these savings for their own emissions.

No matter how you shake this moving target, that is what is planned. Let’s not forget that this plan is 100% driven by tax credits, something only the wealthy care about, not the farmer who will be selling corn for $2 a bushel this year.

We can’t blame just one agency for this situation. From the Department of Energy website, you will find this rhetoric:

The SAF Grand Challenge is the result of DOE, DOT, and USDA launching a government-wide Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will attempt to reduce the cost, enhance energy security, and expand the production and use of SAF while meeting the following goals:

A minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to conventional fuel.

3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF by 2030.

35 billion gallons of SAF to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050.

For all that to happen, the farmers and ethanol plants will need to comply with the 45ZCF-GREET model that has been adopted by the U.S. Treasury. I don’t even know how many times presenters at this conference referenced that, “We are waiting on Treasury to give us guidance on this.”

Once again looking at the Department of Energy website, I encourage all of you that think this is good for the farmer to look at closely should you choose to comply:

45ZCF-GREET is available at: https://www.energy.gov/eere/GREET. The 45ZCF GREET model was developed as a specific version of the GREET model to determine emissions rates that also meet three key parameters: (1) user-friendliness and consistency, (2) technical robustness of the pathways represented, and (3) consistency with the requirements of section 45Z. The model includes transportation fuel production pathways that are of sufficient methodological certainty to be appropriate for determining eligibility for the 45Z tax credit.

At the end of the day, the story is the same as the Renewable Fuel Standard. The concept is correct, but requires government involvement. In the same week that our national debt blows past $38 trillion, we are talking about spending massive amounts for subsidies.

The gut punch, which is still not brought to light in these discussions, is the fact that the petroleum industry still controls distribution of all fuel. Why is no one talking about the fact that E-15 is selling at the pump for 50 cents less than 100% gasoline? That is because the gasoline manufacturers are making more per gallon of ethanol sold than the farmers who raise the grain.

If the farmer does not regain leverage in the marketplace and come up with a distribution system that does not including the Prince of Saudi Arabia, we will continue to lose farmers. No farmers, no food, no fuel. Share that with your friends, neighbors and policy-makers before it’s too late.

The fast fashion giant has agreed alongside the cargo airline to explore the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), alongside wider measures that promote a shift toward lower-emission operations across air transport.

The MoU lays out a framework for collaboration, including a plan to adopt SAF-based offsetting solutions for SHEIN’s shipments within the next six months. Other objectives include using lower-carbon energy sources for transport and improving transparency around environmental performance.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network.”

SAF's rising prominence in logistics

Sustainable aviation fuel is a liquid fuel made from renewable feedstocks. It serves as a direct substitute for conventional jet fuel but with lower lifecycle carbon emissions.

Lufthansa Cargo has committed to supplying SHEIN with SAF and will back this with certified documentation in the form of 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates built on third-party verified standards, recording the emissions saved when SAF is used instead of fossil-based aviation fuel.

The freight carrier is also contributing its experience in SAF procurement and deployment, sharing knowledge with SHEIN as part of a joint learning approach.

Both organisations have agreed to treat SAF not as a standalone solution, but as a single element of a wider carbon reduction effort across transport.

Ethan adds: ""While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

The partnership reflects SHEIN’s intent to deal with emissions across its transport operations. While SHEIN is a digital retailer without its own air fleet, it relies heavily on air freight to deliver goods quickly from manufacturers to different markets.

Partnership includes data and traceability

Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat underlines the broader purpose behind the agreement.

“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” he says. “It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business.”

“Together with all stakeholders within the supply chain, we are driving the development of more sustainable global supply chains in line with our purpose: Enabling Global Business.""

Beyond SAF, the agreement includes cooperation on environmental reporting and operational data sharing.

The two companies have committed to exploring shared approaches to traceability, looking at how data can support measurable improvements in emissions and sustainability performance. This includes assessments of fleet efficiency and process quality – two areas that sit at the centre of the collaboration.

They will also examine knowledge-sharing initiatives, aiming to raise standards around sustainability reporting and low-carbon innovation in global logistics.

While SHEIN and Lufthansa Cargo's MoU does not set out mandatory emissions targets or binding commitments, it signals intent to trial new approaches and apply lessons from early projects across broader logistics operations.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/236d64dd59283b707117fc45e4b2d201:1c87732e137062893472dfa78bb66414/shein-lufthansa.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:57:14.576637

The pressure is on for the aviation sector. Alongside power generation and heavy industry, air travel is one of the most prominent targets for governments pursuing ambitious

net-zero objectives.

But it’s not realistic to cut out carbon emissions from aircraft quickly. The lifecycle of a commercial airliner is around 30 years. So, despite significant progress, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is not enough in itself to have the substantial impact on emissions needed.

That’s why any pragmatic approach to speeding up the decarbonisation of air travel depends on tackling other aviation emissions, which brings the focus to airports. Airport operators are now on the front line of the decarbonisation of the industry.

But, because of the complexity involved, collaboration is indispensable if airports are to lead the way in decarbonising the aviation industry.

COMPLEXITY DEMANDS COLLABORATION

Most airports are similar in size to a small town, but with vastly higher numbers of people constantly passing through. That means airport emissions are both significant and highly fragmented, involving everything from exhaust gases produced by ground service equipment (GSE) to luggage conveyor belts and HVAC systems for terminal buildings. Removing carbon from the airport equation is no simple undertaking.

Because the sources of airport emissions are so diverse, there can be no ‘magic bullet’, no one action that allows airport operators to dispense with the problem.

In other words, despite reducing airport emissions being aviation’s most immediate route towards net zero, it is by no means a straightforward task.

The size of the challenge and the different options open to airport operators means that delivering decarbonisation quickly and at scale is unlikely to be easy for airports acting in isolation.

This is where collaboration is nothing short of vital. Collaboration means different approaches can be tested at different airports without any one operator footing the bill alone.

It means airports can gain insights from the experiences of others, moving directly to an optimal approach to decarbonising a particular source of emissions without the time and costs involved in pursuing a test and learn phase first.

TULIPS – LESSONS FROM EUROPE

There is precedent for such an approach. The TULIPS consortium, of which Egis is a member, began in 2022 with €25 million in EU funding.

Centred on Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the project is intended to deliver a roadmap to achieving zero waste and zero airport emissions by 2030, and net zero for aviation as-a-whole by 2050.

These goals are reflected in the project’s main ambitions of:

Accelerating emission reductions

Demonstrating, measuring and prescribing innovative technologies and concepts that can support the ongoing transition towards sustainable airport operations

Developing sustainability roadmaps based on evidence from seven focus areas with a total of 17 demonstrations.

These 17 demonstrator projects are taking place at airports across Europe. They involve the testing of intermodal transport services, including for freight transport and public transport connections to and within airports, as well as zero-emissions airside operations and circular airport buildings.

They also include work to develop mitigation measures airside for ultrafine particulates (UFPs) and the sequestering of carbon with biochar on airport land.

The co-ordinated nature of the project means airports across Europe will have easy access to an evidence base covering the decarbonisation approaches that are open to them.

As a result, we can expect the decarbonisation of European airports to be considerably easier and less costly for airport operators to deliver than would otherwise have been case.

The burden testing different approaches is shared across operators, rather than duplicated across them. This doesn’t just simplify adoption, it also has the potential to influence policy change and feeds into scientific articles, supporting an evidence-based approach.

A MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH FOR THE UK

There can be little doubt as to the promise collaboration holds for the decarbonisation of airports in the UK. Yet this remains an ambitious challenge for the sector.

Private operators already collaborate through industry groups, however, there is an opportunity to go further. To deliver more cost-effective and timely decarbonisation initiatives, together.

A framework that allows UK airports to maintain commercial competition while collaborating to deliver the rapid decarbonisation of airport operations would be immensely valuable but would likely require the support of government.

A WAY FORWARD?

Airports offer the most immediate avenue for the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Yet the sheer variety of sources of emissions means achieving meaningful change is a complex undertaking. That demands collaboration if it is to be delivered quickly and cost-effectively.

While there are legitimate reasons why collaboration between airport operators might be restricted, we believe a co-ordinated approach offers significant promise.

Greater knowledge sharing, of both successes and setbacks, benefits the entire industry. It accelerates innovation and supports the widespread adoption of solutions needed to navigate the complexities of decarbonisation.

In 1996, farmers at the West Central Cooperative in Ralston were looking for new markets for their unused soybean oil. The co-op built a biodiesel plant, converting the soybean oil into biodiesel fuel under the brand name SoyPOWER. After its initial success, the group opened one of the world’s largest continuous-flow plants for processing soybean oil into biodiesel fuel and launched Renewable Energy Group in 2003. The company acquired several biorefineries across the country, including one in Newton. In 2012, the company went public and reached $1 billion in annual revenue. In 2017, REG produced its 2 billionth gallon of biomass-based diesel. Then in 2022, REG was acquired by Chevron for $3.15 billion, becoming Chevron Renewable Energy Group.

Today, Chevron REG researchers are settling into the company’s newest facility, the Ames Technology Center. In June, a grand opening was celebrated for the 45,000-square-foot center, which is adjacent to two Chevron REG office buildings. Among the nine biorefineries owned globally by Chevron, two are in Iowa, one in Mason City and one in Newton.

There are 275 employees working at the Chevron REG Ames campus, where they focus on developing technology that can produce lower-carbon fuels by using renewable sources, like fats and oils. Parent company Chevron is investing more than $8 billion to create a higher return on converting byproduct fats and oils, known as feedstocks, into biodiesel and renewable diesel. In the new Ames facility, 25 employees focus on scaling and commercializing biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable natural gas and other biofuels. The company recently expanded renewable diesel production at its Geismar, La., facility, from 90 million gallons to 340 million gallons per year. That kind of production increase is the result, in part, of the research done in Ames.

“The mission of the lab and the folks who are associated with the work being done here is to accelerate the development of technologies and technical capabilities to deliver higher returns for our lower-carbon transportation fuels, specifically, biodiesel and renewable diesel,” said Martin Haverly, director of research and development and innovation at Chevron REG in Ames.

Ames lab

The Ames center is one of two Chevron technology centers in the country. The other is Chevron’s Richmond Technology Center in Richmond, Calif., where more than 170 doctoral-level scientists research automotive engines at the 1.2 million-square-foot facility.

In Ames, the new building has 27,000 square feet of lab space. Ames Chevron REG researchers previously worked in a 4,000-square-foot lab, making the new space a 575% increase in space for workers. The new facility has a 40%-50% utilization rate, leaving room for growth and expansion, Haverly said.

“We’re well positioned for whatever is going to come, and also the future that we create through the innovations coming out of this building,” he said.

At the lab, researchers work on several scientific processes that involve identifying the materials within the biofuels and improving the catalytic process used to create the fuels. Renewable diesel is a low-carbon fuel that, through a catalytic process utilizing heat, pressure and hydrogen, known as hydrotreating, can convert feedstocks into a hydrocarbon fuel that is chemically similar to traditional diesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Chevron REG researchers are working on ways to improve that catalytic process.

At the Ames lab, safety comes first. The building is outfitted with automated control systems for gas monitoring, chemical spill detection, alarm systems and more. The larger space gives researchers more room for more advanced experiments. The previous building had 11-foot-high ceilings, while the new center has 22- to 27-foot-high ceilings, allowing scientists to complete distillation, which can separate liquids and remove unwanted components to improve the quality of biodiesel. The new building has wide hallways to easily transport experiments and projects.

“When we talk about things like separations, one of the primary separation techniques that we use is distillation. And distillation is typically done in columns; we use these really tall vessels. Now we’re able to install an actual distillation column in here and run it,” he said. “The distillation process is one that has led to the creation of new products.”

Something as simple as a higher ceiling could translate into research breakthroughs for Chevron REG.

“We weren’t able to do it before, and that type of work is critical, because we’re really pushing the envelope always in the industry,” Haverly said. “We’ve been an industry leader for renewable fuels for a long time. High-quality fuels typically means more and more separation. That’s something that we’ve pioneered. We’re the first group to really lean in on distillation of biodiesel.”

The facility also has a hydrogen generator. Chevron REG researchers use hydrogen as a catalyst to react with feedstock to make a specific hydrocarbon fuel, he said.

“It’s a huge advancement, because [without the generator] instead we would have to have large stores of hydrogen, like large tubes and vessels of hydrogen, and those have a lot of potential energy. They could light on fire. It’s under high pressure, all those things. Instead, we only generate hydrogen when we need it,” he said.

Researchers now have warehouse space so they can stagger experiments.

“If something isn’t being used, we’ve got the warehouse to park it in,” Haverly said. “We only built the building as large as it needed to be to support actual work, rather than sometimes you see technology centers that are quite large, but that’s because there’s a lot of idle assets.”

Partnerships

Chevron REG’s Louisiana renewable diesel plant’s capacity increase was made possible partly because of the company’s partnership with ISU. Chevron REG and ISU worked together to create the ISU BioCentury Research Farm, a hydrotreater pilot plant dedicated to biomass production and processing. This hydrotreater pilot plant relies on the expertise of both organizations to better understand how various biomass feedstocks can play a role in the production of renewable fuels with a specific focus on renewable diesel. Research at the hydrotreater pilot plant supports the Louisiana plant by helping to evaluate new low-carbon feedstocks and improve production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

“We were reliant on Iowa State University all the way back in the very beginning for lab space, for research and development capabilities,” Haverly said. “I would say that our past and our future is really intertwined with Iowa State in that way.”

The company has worked with the ISU Center for Industrial Research and Service on occasion, and has employed ISU students.

“We’re constantly working with Iowa State on the feedstock side, that’s a really critical thing for the future of renewable fuels industry as a whole,” he said. “Iowa State being a huge ag school, with the agronomy department, and then also with the chemical engineering and mechanical engineering departments, even with some of the political science and business school connections, all the different value chain drivers, and we’ve got, honestly, too many different points of connection with them, to mention all of them.”

Not ethanol

Chevron REG researches and produces biofuels, not ethanol, an important distinction, Haverly said. Ethanol, he pointed out, is produced through the fermentation of the starch in corn. The ethanol molecule is a light alcohol and goes into gasoline engines. Biofuels, typically used in heavy-duty transportation, use different feedstock, technologies and processes than what is used in the production of ethanol.

“Ethanol can’t go into diesel engines because it’s got a really high flash point, it will burn too quickly,” he said. “What we produce using those lipids or fats and greases, which is a totally different starting point than the starch that ethanol is produced from, that becomes this biodiesel and renewable diesel via a totally different process.”

While ethanol comes from corn, biodiesel and renewable diesel aremade from fats, oils and greases, like soybean oil.

“In the late 1990s, the soybean oil was not worth very much,” he said. “We’ve added value to things like used cooking oil, which, not that long ago, was just dumped in landfills as well. Now, used cooking oil trades for more than soybean oil was.”

Biofuels policy

According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Iowa is the top state for renewable fuels production. The state has 42 ethanol refineries capable of producing 4.7 billion gallons annually – including 34 million gallons of annual cellulosic ethanol production capacity. It also boasts 10 biodiesel facilities with the capacity to produce 416 million gallons annually.

Haverly said there is strong support for biofuels in Iowa, but consistency is important.

“We see really strong support for our industry in the state of Iowa,” he said. “We’re really grateful to the administration for that, and for our congressmen and women for their support. But consistent policy support is critical to the growth.”

When REG first started, there was little policy on the biofuels industry, he said.

“There was nothing to support via policy, so we’re used to demonstrating to policymakers globally that this thing is real, it’s growing and it needs more support,” he said. “That’s where coming together through partnerships across the value chain is going to continue to drive that policy support, where we can get that to be really durable and long term. That’s where we can really accelerate growth.”

In California, diesel fuel is 75% biodiesel or renewable diesel. That level of biofuel integration into diesel is possible in other states, Haverly said. In Iowa, biofuel blends range from 6% to 20%.

“[Seventy-five percent] is a testament to strong and consistent policy support,” he said. “Here in Iowa, you’ll see that biodiesel sticker, B6 to B20 and we’re really excited about that. The fact that we have production here in the state, that fuel is ending up in people’s fuel tanks right here – it’s pretty exciting.”",https://www.businessrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/USA2023008_CREG_Shoot_Ames_Iowa_HQ_3646.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:57:33.644846

The Challenges With Hydrogen Hydrogen is extremely flammable.","California-based aerospace startup JetZero is advancing its ambition to reshape commercial aviation with the announcement of a new partnership focused on hydrogen propulsion. The company revealed it is teaming up with SHZ Advanced Technologies to develop liquid hydrogen storage and distribution solutions tailored for JetZero’s blended-wing airliner.

The move underscores growing industry interest in moving away from conventional jet fuel. Solutions such as electric air taxis or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are already taking form, with JetZero betting that hydrogen will be the way forward. By aligning with SHZ, the company aims to demonstrate the viability of its zero-emissions flying wing.

Looking At The Clean, Super Efficient Blended Wing

Key to JetZero's goal of creating the airliner of tomorrow is the blended-wing design. This design does away with the ""tube"" part of a traditional airliner, opting to instead make the entire aircraft one large wing. By blending the wings and fuselage into a single lifting surface, the design is expected to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency while also offering more internal space for fuel tanks or passenger amenities.

The interior efficiency is especially critical when introducing liquid hydrogen, as hydrogen fuel requires bulkier, cryogenically cooled storage compared to traditional jet fuel. Exit configurations could prove an obstacle to fitting more seats, and passenger comfort is also a consideration, given the increased forces that travelers in a blended-wing aircraft would feel. As such, using some of this added space for hydrogen storage makes both concepts more viable.

While the concept is bold, it fits within a broader wave of experimental designs being pursued globally as aviation confronts its decarbonization challenge. The combination of new airframe architectures with alternative propulsion may be necessary to achieve net-zero emissions targets by mid-century. Designing aircraft to include new propulsion technology would also likely be significantly easier than attempting to retrofit older designs.

The Challenges With Hydrogen

Hydrogen is extremely flammable. As such, liquid hydrogen must be stored at extremely low temperatures, requiring complex systems of sensors, fuel transfers, and safety protocols; far more complicated than storing jet fuel. Partnering with SHZ reflects a recognition that solving these engineering hurdles is critical to proving the viability of its concept, with SHZ's expertise in cryogenic systems permitting design teams to develop more advanced and effective storage tanks.

Beyond the tanks themselves, integration into the aircraft is equally important. The systems must be designed to distribute fuel efficiently while ensuring redundancy and reliability. Any solution involving hydrogen must also comply with stringent aviation safety regulations, adding further complexity to the engineering effort. By focusing on these issues early in its development cycle, JetZero is attempting to position itself ahead of competitors exploring similar technologies.

This partnership does not resolve the broader question of ground infrastructure. Even if JetZero’s aircraft is technically viable, widespread adoption of hydrogen-powered commercial aviation will require airports to invest in refueling and storage facilities, a step that will require significant time and funding.

Where JetZero Is Moving In The Future

JetZero has set ambitious goals, aiming to roll out a demonstrator aircraft by the end of the decade. Governments around the world are beginning to put pressure on the aviation industry to lower carbon emissions, so this new hydrogen-powered aircraft is a promising response to the demands. As such, it has the potential to shape short or medium-haul flying in the next several years.

The collaboration with SHZ is one of several partnerships JetZero is pursuing. By leveraging outside experience in hydrogen storage, the company can focus on integrating these solutions into its unique aircraft architecture while continuing to raise awareness and funding. This also means less research and work has to be performed in-house.

There are numerous ideas for alternative fuels currently on the drawing boards, with SAF and electric motors being the two front-runners. SAF is already flying with some airlines, while manufacturers are working with partners to develop ground infrastructure for electric planes. While hydrogen as a concept hasn't been developed to the same extent, it does hold huge promise for an industry that is looking for new options.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jetzero_envpan_blue_still2-600w.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:57:40.695077

The aviation sector faces a particular challenge to decarbonise in the face of global warming.

But the Government said the development and deployment of SAFs will play a crucial role in 'helping us reach our decarbonisation goals, which will enable our aviation industry to operate and develop in a sustainable manner.'

To assist in the development of the Roadmap, the Department of Transport established the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Task Force in December of 2023.

The global approach to decarbonisation of the aviation industry is based on the International Civil Aviation Organisation ‘basket of measures’ which identifies four pillars from which reductions are to be realised.

Business Bulletin

These are aircraft technology improvements, operational improvements, increased development and use of SAFs, and a global market-based measure known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.

SAFs are a ‘drop in’ fuel which means that they can be blended into fossil-based aviation fuels and can be used in existing aircraft without modification.

They are considered sustainable because they have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuels.

The Roadmap sets out four SAF Policy Pathways to advance: supporting production, market certainty, collaboration and supporting uptake.

It was described by Government, as representing an important first step in developing Ireland’s national SAF policy.

The Department said in a statement that it identifies a number of actions which will be built upon in future iterations, and setting a path for future SAF policy development.

Minister O'Brien said: “I am delighted to officially launch Ireland’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap. Publication of this Roadmap represents the realisation of a clear commitment in our Programme for Government.

NEIL HARRIS, Professor of Atmospheric Informatics, Cranfield University, provides an overview.

Reductions in the formation of contrail cirrus resulting from aviation are being seriously considered to mitigate the growing impact of aviation emissions on climate change (eg RAeS-IATA workshop: Contrails: From modification and avoidance to management, March 2025(3,4). This could be achieved by changing either the flight patterns or the type of fuel burnt.

The regions where contrail cirrus form are limited by the prevalent weather patterns, and the majority of the climate impact comes from a small fraction of flights. For current flight patterns, climate metrics can be integrated into flight planning and so give a way to judge whether it is worth changing flight route. Given the discussion about which metric is most appropriate(4), the involvement of the aviation industry and regulators would help develop more appropriate metrics. The key point here is to maximise possible contrail cirrus avoidance while minimising the climate impact of cases where more fuel is consumed as a consequence.

Changes in flight patterns could be implemented in the near term(3). Implementation relies on models using meteorological predictions (especially of water vapour and temperature at flight levels), engine characteristics, etc which are used to estimate the contrail cirrus formation along particular flight routes. The accuracy of the predictions and the models is improving and the effectiveness is well characterised.

The success of this approach will depend on how decisions are made within the operational aviation system. So understanding the opportunities and constraints within the system is critical to ensuring the success of any contrail reduction system. This has been one of the aims of the several field trials already performed involving airlines, air traffic control organisations and others, and it is important to build on that experience.

Research on how fuel composition could be changed to reduce contrail cirrus persistence shows that lower sulphur or aromatic content in the fuel generally reduces contrail cirrus formation, and that the specific aromatic compound is important. This work has been principally focused on the composition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) but it also applies to the formulation of kerosene which superficially has the potential to be more of a ‘drop in’ solution. However, significant challenges exist with this approach too(4).

Who influences decisions about climate-friendly flights?

The decision-making processes and responsibilities are critical for either approach being implemented in routine operations. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the aviation industry as it relates to making changes in flights to reduce climate impact. The dark arrows illustrate the main physical processes which affect reductions in climate impact. The light arrows illustrate the institutions which have influence to effect reductions.

Much work has been expended looking at whether different approaches to contrail cirrus avoidance work physically. It is also important to consider how the overall operational system could work with minimal changes to the current flight system, building on the reported experience from contrail avoidance trials. Success will require the involvement or support of all the main decision-makers indicated by light blue arrows in Figure 1. So what is their interest?

Pilots

(Collins Aerospace)

The people making the final decision on changes to flight routes are the pilots as they are in charge of the aircraft during flight. The British Airline Pilots’ Association has recommended that any excess fuel available in flight due to, for example, having to wait for a landing spot could be used to avoid regions where contrail cirrus is likely to form. Such a policy could provide significant benefits for flights in and out of the UK. This, coupled with giving airlines more freedom to plan their own routes rather than be limited to air traffic corridors, could provide significant benefits for flights in and out of the UK. This approach would require willing co-operation of the pilots and a simple information system that does not put the pilots under pressure and safety at risk.

Air Traffic Control

(NATS)

ATC is responsible for the efficient and safe running of the overall flight system before and during flight. While they currently have no environmental mandate, they are participating in contrail avoidance tests. Working within the current system, they could develop operational tools to provide guidance to pilots and flight planners on the existence of regions where contrail cirrus is likely to form. ATC already include some meteorological data in their software systems, which could be increased considerably. In principle, air traffic controllers could either calculate contrail cirrus zones themselves (involving an increase in the meteorological data use) or use zones from other providers, including the meteorological agencies. Ready access to such information would allow ATC to inform pilots in real time. As with the pilots, any system should be simple for the air traffic controllers to use.

Airline flight planners

(CAA)

Airline flight planners are critical pre-flight. Different airlines have different in-house and contracted systems which take into account factors, such as cost (fuel burn, staff, charges and fines) and weather conditions. In principle, a climate measure could be added as an additional factor, and some companies (eg Flightkeys and Satavia) are actively developing operational systems. These systems are not yet used in routine flight operations but are being widely tested and embedded to increase confidence in their quality and reliability. The choice of methods to compare the climate impacts of CO2 and contrail cirrus is critical here. It seems likely that a certification system will be required as well.

Airlines

Ultimately airlines have the most influence in this part of the aviation sector. They are most aware of passenger preferences, they choose the aircraft, engines and fuel, as well as control how their planners are managed. While these are all indirect means of influencing decisions made about individual flights, the airlines have the major influence in setting the rules for other parts of the system and their active involvement in contrail cirrus reduction is essential.

Fuel suppliers

(airBP)

Fuel suppliers will be deciding if they want to offer other fuels, whether SAF or alternative kerosenes. This in turn will depend on the business case, the airport capabilities and government regulations. Given that contrail cirrus only form in certain meteorological conditions, two or more fuel supply systems may be advantageous at an airport in a region where contrail cirrus is prevalent, although this would come at additional cost.

Airports

(London Gatwick Airport)

The airports only have a small influence on making changes to flight routes through the availability of take-off and landing slots. They do have a major influence on the availability of fuels through providing the infrastructure required for operations.

Engine manufacturers

(Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)

Engine manufacturers are not directly involved in the short-term decision-making involved in reducing contrail cirrus. They are indirectly involved through their central, enabling role in testing and certification of fuel. For example, engine manufacturers must be confident that any changes in fuel do not impair engine safety.

Engine manufacturers make decisions about the likely long-term needs for aircraft. They can have important influences on future options and are the only ones that could reduce NOx emissions. Even early decisions on engine design will take their time to have a major climate impact due to the need for development, certification and investment. These processes would have to be significantly speeded up for aviation to decarbonise on a significant scale by 2050.

Aircraft manufacturers

(Airbus)

Aircraft manufacturers can influence the altitudes at which new aircraft fly most fuel efficiently. So it may be possible to reduce the overlap between flight altitudes and the ice super-saturated regions (ISSR) where contrail cirrus can form. As with the introduction of new engine designs, considerable development, certification and available investment capital could have a significant impact by 2050.

Governance and governments

(WikiCommons)

Any large change of the type considered here requires public and political will, coupled with effective policies. Internal flights are regulated at national level and so could be subject to national governance. However, the majority of fuel burnt (60%) is international and flights are regulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialised agency of the United Nations. Its scheme to reduce its climate impact is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) which currently relies to a large extent on future offsetting of CO2 emissions and the widespread introduction of SAF. CORSIA provides a mechanism for international discussion, agreement and improvements over time. It, therefore, acts as a backstop for regional and national action and pressure, including incentives for developing a more sustainable aviation. CORSIA does not currently apply to contrail cirrus but could, in principle, be expanded to do so.

Implementing climate-friendly flight routes

There are two ways to integrate climate information into the existing decision-making system: (i) focus on regions where contrail cirrus is most likely to form; and (ii) develop systems which are widely applied but which do not affect flights where no contrail cirrus is likely to form. The latter approach may be the better end goal as it is simpler for all concerned to have one operational system which could be covered by ICAO through CORSIA. In the short term, system development and testing are more likely to be regional as with the field trials that have already taken place. This is true for contrail cirrus reduction or for the introduction of lower contrail cirrus fuels, though the airports involved would have to be able to supply more than one type of aviation fuel.

Reduced contrail cirrus flights

Pre-flight planning involves airlines, flight planners and ATC. Once a flight is under way, the responsibility lies with the pilots supported by ATC and, in some cases, the flight planners. Given that excess fuel is used on many routes (1% on long-haul flights(6) and 10-15% on short-haul flights in Europe(7)), agency could be given to pilots to use the excess fuel to avoid contrail formation. That would require simple tools to know how to do that and would have to be subject to the usual safety and ATC requirements. ATC could support the pilots in making the decisions by, for example, identifying regions where contrail cirrus is likely to form. It seems unlikely that decision-making would be the responsibility of ATC but it would play an essential role in supporting it, especially for short-haul flights, while ensuring a safe and efficient system.

The question then arises as to what governance would provide motivation to the different players in the aviation industry. Options include ensuring that there is a market cost of a climate impact (tax or incentive) or it could be through regulation. Either way, it needs to be included in business decisions made in flight planning. It is not obvious that the overall financial cost would be large, given the coincidence of key regions for contrail cirrus formation with areas of delays to flights (eg Western Europe) and the relatively small number of flights likely to be involved in re-routing. Algorithms calculating the impact should be certified to show they reach an appropriate agreed standard. The odds of success of individual flight routings will increase through improved meteorology or in the metrics used – and this possibility needs to be encouraged in the certification of the algorithms.

From a global climate perspective, the measure of success would be a reduction in the overall climate forcing from contrail cirrus. In busy regions, a regional approach could be taken so that cumulative effect of all flight changes is monitored (otherwise all aircraft would want to fly in the same airspace!) This would require the central involvement of ATC. Climate forcing cannot be measured directly and the measure of success would be a reduction of the contrail cirrus coverage. Satellite-based detection systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are suitable for this, especially when complemented by ground-based observations. The climate forcing would have to be calculated (as it is for all other greenhouse gases) and compared with any increases in the amount of CO2 and NOx emitted as a result of the flight route changes.

Implementing changes in aviation fuel

(United)

Changes in the formulation of aviation fuel could also achieve reductions in contrail cirrus from the current aircraft fleet. This requires changes in the trace components of the fuel. Work on the formulation of SAF indicates that reductions in the sulphur content or in the aromatic content could be successful. This work should be broadened to include the current aviation kerosene(4). If successful and if it could be implemented reasonably quickly, it would lead to an immediate climate benefit as the introduction of SAF is likely to be gradual due to the need to expand its production and supply.

Since contrail cirrus is formed on a minority of flights, any special fuel (whether SAF or adapted kerosene) could be made preferentially available at those airports with the greatest odds of arrivals/departures forming contrail cirrus. The number of such airports could be limited to start with if they are part of designated pairing systems where two airports agree to form a sustainable aviation corridor. Such a system would be complex, and possibly costly, to introduce given current airport fuel systems which tend to have just one fuel. Segregated fuel systems at the airport could be avoided if benefits are produced with mixed fuels for all flights from that airport. That would depend on the systems and related infrastructure at individual airports.

Summary

Reducing contrail cirrus formation is the only way for aviation to achieve a quick climate win aside from the existing, but unproven, carbon offset schemes. This could be achieved in the short term through flight modification or, more slowly, through changes in fuel formulation. Contrail cirrus management systems should improve as predictions of contrail cirrus improve and as more experience is gained and built on. The fundamental target is a net climate gain and, whichever commonly accepted metrics are used, contrail cirrus management offers that. In this analysis major remaining research challenges include:

(a) developing incentive schemes for airlines to include climate impact in their flight planning;

(b) identifying a structure to clarify who makes decisions to adjust flight plans;

(c) improving predictions of persistent contrail cirrus used in flight planning;

(d) researching what fuel improvements could lead to reductions in cirrus persistence;

(e) improving how CO2 and NOx emissions are compared with those of contrail cirrus to provide a basis for decisions on flight changes;

(f) developing a certification system to guarantee the quality of the climate impact schemes used.

There are solid arguments for action to be taken now in implementing contrail cirrus management schemes while work continues on solving these remaining research challenges. Doing so would reduce the climate change in the coming years compared to business-as-usual operations. The implementation of a contrail cirrus avoidance scheme is quickly reversible if it does not work, so the downside risk is small. As argued in [3], the North Atlantic is a good region to do this: the potential reduction in contrail cirrus is large and one ATC (NATS) can take the lead. This offers the best way for aviation to minimise its impact on our climate and environment in the coming decades.

Airbus estimates that by 2030, SAF will need to be sourced mainly from biomass.

Indonesia could produce up to 500 million tonnes annually - five times the company’s projected requirements.

Large volumes of unused palm fruit bunches in Sumatra and Kalimantan, along with rice straw in Java that is often discarded or burned, could provide key feedstocks.

However, Meika highlighted challenges including the difficulty of collecting biomass from smallholder farmers in areas with poor infrastructure, regulatory gaps and limited research on processing biomass into aviation fuel at scale.

Indonesia has seen rising biomass exports and domestic use, particularly of wood pellets and chips.

Environmental groups caution that the expansion of biomass could come at a cost. Auriga Nusantara, an environmental watchdog, reported that about 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared for biomass production between 2020 and 2024, with potential threats to endangered species such as orangutans if monoculture plantations expand.

As climate change intensifies, air turbulence is projected to worsen, posing risks to passenger safety and increasing fuel consumption. Clear-air turbulence, particularly dangerous due to its invisibility, is on the rise because of shifting jet stream patterns. Scientists are exploring improved forecasting and route optimization, while airlines consider stricter seatbelt policies and cleaner fuels to mitigate the impact.

Why turbulence matters

Beyond making people uneasy, turbulence is also the leading cause of in-flight weather accidents, according to official data.

The numbers remain relatively small: there were 207 reported injuries on US commercial flights between 2009 and 2024. But high-profile incidents have thrust the issue into the spotlight.

These include an Air Europa flight last year, in which 40 passengers were hurt, and a Singapore Airlines flight where one elderly passenger died and dozens were injured.

""Typically injuries (are) to unbelted passengers or cabin crew rather than structural damage,"" John Abraham, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas told AFP.

""Modern aircraft withstand turbulence, so the main risk is occupant injury, not loss of the plane.""

Still, planes must be inspected after ""severe"" encounters with turbulence -- about 1.5 times the normal force of Earth's gravity -- which occur some 5,000 times a year over the US, said Robert Sharman, a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

Turbulence also increases fuel consumption when pilots must leave optimal altitudes, alter routes or change speeds, Abraham added.

How climate change is making it worse

Mohamed Foudad, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading in the UK, explained there are three main types of turbulence: convective, mountain wave and clear-air turbulence (CAT).

Convective turbulence is linked to rising or sinking air currents from clouds or thunderstorms that can be detected visually or by onboard radar, while mountain wave turbulence occurs over mountain ranges.

CAT, by contrast, is invisible - and therefore the most dangerous.

It generally arises from jet streams: fast-moving westerly winds in the upper atmosphere at the same altitude as commercial jets, about 10-12 kilometers up.

With climate change, the tropics are warming faster at cruising altitude than higher latitudes.

That increases the temperature difference between the higher- and lower-latitudes, driving up jet stream velocity and wind shear -- volatile shifts in vertical air currents that trigger CAT.

Foudad and colleagues published a paper last year in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres analyzing data from 1980 to 2021.

""We find a clear, positive trend -- an increase in turbulence frequency over many regions, including the North Atlantic, North America, East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa,"" he told AFP, with increases ranging from 60 to 155 percent.

Further analysis attributed the rising turbulence in certain regions to increased greenhouse gas emissions.

What happens next?

A 2023 paper led by Isabel Smith at the University of Reading found that for every degree Celsius of near-surface warming, winters would see an increase of about nine percent in moderate CAT in the North Atlantic, and summers a rise of 14 percent.

Winter has historically been the roughest season for turbulence, but warming is now amplifying CAT in summer and autumn, closing the gap.

Jet stream disruption is not the only concern: climate change is also fueling stronger storms.

""Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms under future scenarios, and turbulence encounters near thunderstorms are a major component of turbulence accidents,"" Sharman told AFP.

In terms of mitigation strategies, Foudad is working on two studies: optimizing flight routes to avoid turbulence hotspots and improving forecasting accuracy.

Some airlines are moving towards strategies involving passengers wearing seatbelts more often, such as ending cabin service earlier.

Promising technologies are also being tested, says Sharman, including onboard LIDAR, which beams lasers into the atmosphere to detect subtle shifts in air density and wind speed.

Ultimately, cutting greenhouse gas emissions will be essential, Foudad added.

Aviation is responsible for about 3.5 percent of human-caused warming. Airlines are exploring cleaner fuels to help reduce the industry's footprint, though progress has been ""disappointingly slow,"" according to the International Air Transport Association.

Biofuel markets brace for Trump waiver decisions

Biofuel markets brace for Trump waiver decisions

New York, 21 August (Argus) — US biofuel and crop feedstock markets were volatile today as traders awaited answers on how federal regulators will decide which refiners are exempt from biofuel blending mandates. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires oil refiners and importers to blend minimum amounts of biofuels into the US fuel supply or buy credits from those that do. But refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d of crude can request full exemptions, potentially saving themselves tens of millions of dollars in compliance costs. President Donald Trump's administration told federal courts this week in various pending cases that it ""has now developed a new approach for reviewing small refinery exemptions"" and is planning to ""issue decisions"". The administration is expected to provide some clarity on its small refinery exemption policy on Friday, three sources said. A fourth was told by an official that some policy signal was coming ""soon"". EPA did not respond to a request for comment. But it is unclear how officials will clarify their policy, which could take the form of a proposal, a memo describing the new approach, or separate rulings on the dozens of pending exemption requests stretching back ten years. Federal courts took issue with President Joe Biden's en masse denials of exemption requests, leaving the Trump administration with an unprecedented backlog to resolve. The issue is politically and legally thorny for EPA, pitting two lobbies Trump has pledged to support — oil refiners and farmers — against one other. Public data on small refinery exemptions updated Thursday showed nine new requests but no decisions over the last month. The September CBOT US soybean oil contract rose nearly 5pc Thursday to settle at a two-week high of 53.64¢/lb, outpacing gains in crude futures as traders bet on potentially higher biofuel demand if exemptions end up being less generous than they were during Trump's first term. Upward pressure from a higher bean oil-heating oil spread lifted the price of D4 biomass-based diesel and D6 ethanol Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits. Current-year D4 RINs traded as high as 114¢/RIN, while D6s traded up to 106.25¢/RIN over the busy trading session. Thorny questions remain It is unlikely that the Trump administration will be able to immediately clarify its approach to all aspects of this complicated corner of the federal biofuel program. Exemption requests made as recently as last week give the Department of Energy little time to review applications and consult with EPA, as is required by law. And the bulk of potentially eligible refiners have not yet applied for exemptions from this year's blend mandates, since EPA has historically asked applicants to provide at least three quarters of financial data for the relevant compliance year. Other open questions include whether EPA will require oil companies that remain in the program to blend more biofuels to make up for their exempt competitors and whether EPA will compensate newly exempt companies for past compliance. EPA's separate plan to halve RIN credits in future years for foreign biofuels also complicates the agency's enforcement — since refiners making up for old exemptions might have to bring to market more volume to meet the same mandate if some biofuels start earning fewer program credits than previously. Legal challenges are highly likely no matter what the administration decides. Oil refiners in particular have expressed increasing frustration with the Trump administration's approach to biofuel policy, which they say is increasing feedstock and fuel costs. EPA has signaled it wants to finalize new biofuel blend mandates for the next two years before November, an ambitious timeline given the amount of questions still unanswered about the program's future.

Rising capacity investments, shifting wood fiber supply, and evolving trade policies are creating a turbulent market environment. At the center of this transformation is China, whose rapidly expanding integrated pulp industry is reshaping cost curves and trade flows worldwide. Understanding these dynamics is essential for producers, buyers, and investors to navigate the next phase of industry evolution.

China's Overcapacity and Margin Compression

China's pulp and paper sector has grown rapidly over the past decade, especially in virgin cartonboard production. In just five years, capacity has more than doubled, but operating rates remain low, hovering around 60%, levels at which most Western companies could not survive at.

This imbalance between supply and demand has led to significant margin compression, with many producers operating below sustainable profitability thresholds. The industry is now seeing some of its largest players report financial struggles, highlighting the current market's vulnerability.

China's Push Toward Integration

To manage the risks of volatile price fluctuations in pulp, and to increase global competitiveness, Chinese producers are investing in integrated pulp lines. By producing pulp in-house, they gain greater control over costs and reduce exposure to global market swings. Much of this marginal wood supply comes from Southeast Asia, where lower costs support competitive production.

While integration can improve cost resilience, it raises important long-term questions about fiber sustainability. China's heavy dependence on external wood sources makes its integrated strategy tightly linked to Southeast Asian forestry practices and policies.

Global Impacts of Chinese Expansion

China’s expansion could lead to several consequences that impact global trade and competitiveness. These include:

Oversupply risks: With Latin America also adding large pulp projects, structural oversupply looms. This could keep prices close to all-time lows for some time.

Packaging prices collapsing: Packaging grade prices have been sliding steadily, with signs they may bottom out.

Rising Chinese exports: As domestic markets struggle to absorb new volumes, China is pushing more products abroad, raising pressure on mid-cost regions where Chinese producers can undercut prices.

Trade disruption from tariffs: US tariffs are reshaping import patterns and are set to add more supply to global trade. This is expected to particularly hurt Nordic producers. With Finnish wood costs under strain, the ability to compete against cheaper Southeast Asian alternatives is uncertain. This raises the question of whether Finnish wood can compete with cheap Vietnamese wood.

Looking Ahead

The global pulp market is poised for continued volatility as supply races ahead of demand growth. Several scenarios are possible:

Prolonged oversupply pushing weaker players out of the market.

Selective competitiveness where integrated mills dominate while non-integrated producers struggle.

Trade realignment as China increases exports and traditional exporters lose ground.

For global producers, the key to navigating this turbulence will be robust scenario planning, close monitoring of fiber dynamics, and clear strategies for differentiation—whether through sustainability, specialty products, or supply chain positioning.

The escalating global burden of municipal solid waste (MSW), projected to reach 3.88 billion tons annually by 2050, calls for innovative valorization strategies to mitigate environmental impacts and promote a circular bioeconomy. This thesis investigates the conversion of MSW into two high-value products: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) bioplastics. Chapter one presents comprehensive physicochemical characterization and pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis of MSW feedstocks. The physicochemical results reveal that densification enhances handling and storage properties, while pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis indicates that plastic-rich MSW streams produce bio-oils with favorable hydrocarbon profiles suitable for SAF production, potentially contributing to decarbonization efforts in the aviation sector. Chapter two explores microbial conversion of the pyrolytic bio-oil aqueous fraction (BAF) by Haloferax mediterranei archaea for PHA biosynthesis. Results show that low BAF concentrations (0.1%) support moderate PHA production (0.133 ± 0.04 mg/mL on Day 4), while higher concentrations highlight the need for detoxification or other strategies to mitigate the effects of inhibitory compounds. This work explores valorizing an underutilized byproduct of MSW pyrolysis to produce a biodegradable alternative to conventional plastics, whose global production is projected to exceed 1,000 million tons by 2050. By integrating thermochemical and microbial pathways, this study demonstrates MSW’s potential as an abundant, low-cost feedstock for sustainable materials and fuels, contributing actionable insights for advancing waste-to-resource innovations within circular bioeconomy frameworks.",,N,,2025-08-22 01:56:15.470878

The Paradox of Progress

The aviation industry stands at a crossroads. On one hand, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the single most viable pathway to decarbonize commercial aviation in the near- to medium-term.

On the other hand, the challenges surrounding its adoption are complex, deeply entrenched, and global in scale. Adoption is happening — SAF volumes are rising, airlines are making commitments, and governments are introducing policies — yet the pace is far from sufficient to meet net zero targets by 2050.

In this article, I want to go beyond the headlines of SAF being “the solution” and unpack the very real barriers that define its adoption journey. These challenges span economics, policy, feedstock availability, technology, infrastructure, and consumer acceptance. They are not reasons to abandon SAF, but rather the very landscape we must navigate if we are to unlock its full potential.

1. Policy and Regulatory Challenges

1.1 Fragmented Global Policy Frameworks

One of the foremost obstacles to SAF adoption is the lack of a unified global framework. Unlike the automotive sector, where electrification benefits from relatively coordinated incentives, SAF policies are fragmented across regions:

Europe is pursuing binding mandates under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, requiring airlines to blend increasing percentages of SAF starting in 2025.

The United States relies on financial incentives like the Blender’s Tax Credit and the Inflation Reduction Act, offering economic rewards rather than obligations.

Asia, home to some of the fastest-growing aviation markets, remains largely unregulated in this space, with SAF adoption driven more by corporate ambition than policy enforcement.

This patchwork creates an uneven playing field, discouraging airlines and fuel producers from committing to large-scale investments that rely on policy certainty.

1.2 Regulatory Certainty vs. Investment Cycles

Developing an SAF refinery or investing in advanced feedstock production requires timelines of 5–10 years. Yet policy frameworks often shift with election cycles or political priorities. This mismatch between regulatory timelines and investment cycles introduces risk, slowing adoption.

2. Economic and Financing Barriers

2.1 The Cost Premium Problem

At present, SAF is two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Airlines operate in a notoriously low-margin industry, and absorbing this cost without passing it to consumers is unsustainable. Corporate travel programs and voluntary “green fares” have helped bridge the gap, but the scale remains tiny compared to global jet fuel demand.

2.2 Financing Challenges for Refineries

Banks and institutional investors are wary of funding multi-billion-dollar SAF plants when offtake agreements are limited, feedstock supply is uncertain, and policy frameworks lack durability. Without innovative financing mechanisms — such as green bonds, blended finance, or long-term airline commitments — the capital bottleneck persists.

2.3 Price Volatility of Feedstocks

Waste oils, fats, and agricultural residues — the backbone of today’s SAF production — are commodities subject to price volatility. Competing uses for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and oleochemicals can drive feedstock costs higher, making SAF economics even harder.

3. Feedstock Constraints

3.1 Limited Supply of Waste Oils and Fats

Used cooking oil (UCO), tallow, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and other waste streams form the foundation of SAF today. But global supply is finite, scattered, and highly competitive. Even with aggressive collection, these streams cannot fully meet aviation’s future demand.

3.2 Competing Uses for Feedstock

The renewable diesel sector, particularly in North America and Europe, is growing rapidly and often pays a premium for the same waste-based oils SAF producers need. This “feedstock tug-of-war” reduces availability and raises costs.

3.3 Land-Use and Sustainability Risks

Turning to purpose-grown crops like palm or soybean oil risks indirect land-use change (ILUC), deforestation, and food-vs-fuel debates. Public backlash and regulatory scrutiny limit these pathways, even if they offer short-term volume expansion.

4. Technology and Certification Challenges

4.1 Slow Technology Approvals

Every SAF pathway must go through ASTM certification to be blended into jet fuel. While seven pathways are currently approved, each new one takes years of testing and validation. This slows innovation and locks producers into limited feedstock-technology combinations.

4.2 Infrastructure Readiness

Most airports are not yet equipped with dedicated SAF pipelines, storage tanks, or blending infrastructure. This means SAF often needs to be transported by truck over long distances, adding costs and emissions.

4.3 Refinery Conversion Complexity

Converting existing fossil refineries to SAF-compatible operations is technically feasible but capital-intensive, requiring years of engineering and construction. For many oil majors, the business case remains unproven.

5. Airline Adoption Challenges

5.1 Cost Pass-Through Dilemmas

Airlines face a delicate balancing act: adopting SAF boosts their ESG credentials but risks alienating price-sensitive customers if ticket prices rise. In markets like Southeast Asia, where low-cost carriers dominate, this challenge is even sharper.

5.2 Voluntary vs. Mandatory Commitments

While several airlines (e.g., Lufthansa, United, Singapore Airlines) have made bold SAF pledges, most commitments are voluntary and subject to financial pressure. Without mandates, uptake remains limited to marketing-friendly pilots rather than industry-wide adoption.

6. Global Supply Chain and Logistics

6.1 Geographic Imbalances

Feedstock is often abundant in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa, but refining capacity is concentrated in Europe and North America. This creates long shipping routes, eroding both economics and sustainability gains.

6.2 Traceability and Fraud Risks

The SAF industry relies on trust that feedstocks are truly waste-based and sustainable. Yet instances of fraud — such as virgin oils being disguised as waste — undermine confidence. Robust digital traceability systems are still in development and not uniformly applied.

6.3 Cross-Border Complexity

Every shipment of SAF or its feedstocks must comply with varying sustainability standards, customs regulations, and emissions accounting frameworks. This complexity slows down adoption and adds compliance costs.

7. Consumer and Public Perception

7.1 Awareness Gaps

The average passenger is only vaguely aware of SAF. Unlike electric cars, where consumers can see and feel the shift, SAF is invisible — it powers the same aircraft in the same way. Communicating its value proposition is a challenge.

7.2 Willingness to Pay

Surveys show mixed results: while many passengers say they care about climate change, fewer are willing to pay higher ticket prices for SAF-powered flights. Bridging this intention-action gap is critical.

8. Case Studies of Adoption Challenges

8.1 Europe’s Mandates and Airline Pushback

Airlines in Europe have warned that ambitious SAF blending mandates will raise ticket prices and reduce competitiveness, especially on long-haul routes where alternatives are limited.

8.2 United States: Incentive-Driven but Fragmented

While incentives have spurred investment, uncertainty about tax credit renewals creates hesitation. Airlines and producers are left guessing about long-term economics.

8.3 Asia: Ambition vs. Reality

Despite bold climate commitments, most Asian countries lack binding SAF mandates. Adoption is limited to flagship demonstrations rather than systemic change.

Conclusion: Framing the Road Ahead

The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not a simple story of linear progress. It is a story of competing pressures — cost vs. sustainability, policy vs. politics, ambition vs. reality.

But here’s the critical insight: the very existence of these challenges signals the industry’s transformation is underway. SAF is no longer an academic debate; it is a commercial reality wrestling with the same obstacles any major industrial transition faces.

Understanding these challenges is the first step. The next — and the focus of Article 8 — is to chart the pathways to overcome them. Because the future of aviation depends not just on acknowledging the hurdles, but on building the solutions to clear them.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEfsVpPUpYBtg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZjBJJ0vHQAQ-/0/1755587060147?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=H9ogp3EIuucpkCeka6mmYos0G3QiuoRzyDaKQKHA3J8,N,,2025-08-22 00:56:30.992135

The goal of the pilot is to create a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland. The EU’s renewable fuel blending mandate for aviation opens up a significant opportunity for Finland to become a leading producer of synthetic fuels in the future.

The Finnish company Liquid Sun is starting a globally unique pilot project to produce renewable eSAF from biogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Originating from the University of Tampere, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis technology (LTE) that refines carbon dioxide emissions and renewable electricity-based hydrogen into eSAF jet fuel. For this pilot, Liquid Sun has secured Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia as partners. In Finland, biogenic CO2 emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The experimental e-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational in the autumn of 2025. This is the first pre-commercial phase production pilot, with the aim of creating a functioning synthetic fuel production ecosystem and value chain in Finland. In this joint project, companies will openly collaborate to develop eSAF production, carry out validations, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes that can secure domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in the future.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the emerging eSAF market over the next few years. To achieve this goal, it is critical to involve industrial partners across the eSAF value chain who share a common ambition and the will to accelerate the transition towards sustainable fuels,” commented Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

At the beginning of 2025, the EU’s aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation up to 2050. From 2030 onwards, the mandate will also cover fully synthetic fuels produced from carbon dioxide. By 2050, the blending mandate will rise to 70%, half of which must be eSAF. The mandate applies to airports with at least 800 000 passengers or 100 000 tpy of cargo. In Finland, this includes Helsinki Airport and Rovaniemi Airport.

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland now has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels. The Finnish forest industry generates 20 million tpy of biogenic CO2, with additional volumes coming from biogas plants. These emission sources enable decentralised eSAF production, which increases energy security and balances the national electricity grid.

“Aviation is one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, and its energy transition will require new kinds of innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to help develop Finland’s potential in synthetic jet fuel production while also advancing aviation’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Head of Energy Transition at Finnair.

“Fortum’s mission is to help society achieve carbon neutrality and enable our customers to decarbonise their processes. For jet fuel production, we are pleased to provide renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen – with our pilot hydrogen production plant currently under construction,” added Satu Sipola, Head of Fortum’s Hydrogen Business.

“ABB’s H2 Springboard programme aims to strengthen Finland’s hydrogen economy ecosystem and accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions.

The latest revision of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favors green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.
“European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,” said Alan Gelder.
Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%.
Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost.","High costs have kept green hydrogen projects from taking off, but new regulations in the European Union’s (EU) refining sector offers a solution to launching this carbon friendly technology at scale, according to a new Horizons report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Isn’t it ironic? How Europe’s oil refiners could offer a route to scale up green hydrogen”, European refiners are set to require ~0.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 to comply with EU regulations, replacing about 30% of current CO2-emitting hydrogen production. Refining represents one of the largest hydrogen opportunities globally, which, alongside ammonia and methanol production, accounts for 98% of current demand.

The latest revision of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favors green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.

“European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,” said Alan Gelder. “Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector.”

The report finds that of the 6 Mtpa of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

Refiners demonstrate strongest market appetite

Recent EU Hydrogen Bank auction results reveal refineries’ commitment to green hydrogen adoption, with the sector showing the highest willingness to pay premium prices at an average levelised cost of hydrogen of US$9.23/kg – demonstrating their requirement to meet regulatory mandates. This compares favorably with Wood Mackenzie’s asset-level modeling of refinery-targeted projects, which produces costs of US$7.04 to US$8.30/kg.

The encouraging market signals extend beyond pricing. Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%. However, progress remains uneven across the bloc, with slow national adoption of RED III legislation hampering project development in many member states.

Long-term growth lies in transport fuels

While refinery decarbonization offers the strongest near-term investment case, the marine and aviation sectors present massive long-term growth opportunities for green hydrogen derivatives. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation framework alone requires sustainable aviation fuel to power 6% of the jet pool by 2030, with 1.2% coming from green hydrogen-based e-fuels.

By 2050, sustainable aviation fuel mandates could require 8 million tonnes of green hydrogen – representing a compound annual growth rate of over 15% for this sector alone. Similarly, Europe’s FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the International Maritime Organization’s Net Zero Framework are driving interest in hydrogen-derived marine fuels.

“The opportunities for low-carbon hydrogen have come full circle,” said Murray Douglas, Vice President of Hydrogen Research at Wood Mackenzie. “The traditional sectors of refining, ammonia and methanol are showing the most progress, ahead of the many other new demand sectors being touted for hydrogen. Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost. But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries’ offtake.”

Douglas added: “Marine and aviation hold much of the long-term potential for hydrogen derivatives, as these sectors are the most challenging to electrify. The challenge lies in competing fuels, the costs of production and the final shape of the policies providing support.”

Policy gaps remain key barrier

Despite the progress, significant hurdles remain. Current EU policy requires RFNBOs to account for only 1% of transport sector energy use by 2030 – a modest target that reflects the challenges in expanding supply. Member states have been slow to transpose RED III into national legislation, creating regulatory uncertainty that has slowed project development across most of the EU.

The report concludes that while European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry, success depends on continued cost reductions and stronger policy support to fully kick-start demand across the continent.

The conference launched with a leadership “Fireside Chat,” setting the stage for the Homefield Advantage theme by spotlighting the top issues and opportunities facing the industry. ACE CEO Brian Jennings, ACE CMO Ron Lamberty, and ACE Board President representing Golden Grain Energy, Dave Sovereign, who is also an Iowa farmer and fuel retailer, began with the implications of a projected record corn crop, underscoring the need for near-term demand drivers—like year-round E15, strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volumes, and export growth—while also exploring longer-term opportunities through low-carbon farming practices and the 45Z tax credit.

“Year-round E15 is the single most impactful step Congress can take right now to strengthen the farm economy by driving greater demand for ethanol,” Jennings said. “At the same time, the Administration can do its part by finalizing robust RFS volumes and making sure those volumes aren’t undercut by excessive refinery exemptions—reallocating any that are granted. Expanding ethanol demand is a better long-term solution for managing a surplus corn crop than short-term government assistance.”

“From the RFS to expanding exports, we have the tools to keep American ethanol competitive at home and abroad,” Sovereign said. “As a grower and a plant board member, I see firsthand the difference these policies make in our communities.”

“Low-carbon farming and tax incentives like 45Z can transform ethanol’s long-term value,” Lamberty said. “We’re working to ensure both producers and farmers get full credit for the carbon reductions they deliver.”

Following the Fireside Chat, attendees listened to a series of general session panels covering:

• The Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (45Z), what it means for ethanol producers, and what steps are needed now to position for eligibility and success.

• A global perspective on ethanol trade and market development, with a focus on overcoming tariff, policy, and regulatory hurdles to expand international demand.

• Advancing ethanol opportunities into new markets such as chemical value chains and ensuring farmer premiums and carbon intensity accountability endure past 45Z.

At Thursday’s luncheon, U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson (R-SD) delivered a keynote address.

“We’ve been working together a long time on E15; it’s the biggest no-brainer policy in the history of American government,” Congressman Johnson said. “I’m proud to partner with you to unlock more opportunities for homegrown American fuel.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2014/07/ACELogo_14062440720707.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 19:56:31.287415

The first delivery is part of a series of SAFc trades by the company aimed at expanding the corporate buyers’ market access to SAFc and leveraging the firm’s expertise and global sourcing network.

SAFc is an established market-based mechanism decoupling the environmental attribute of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from the physical product through a ‘book and claim’ system and has become an important tool to reduce the environmental impact of essential business travel and air freight. Aviation accounts for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions and as corporate sustainability ambitions grow, so does the need to address these emissions. SAF has emerged as a trusted solution to decarbonize the aviation industry as it can reduce life cycle CO2e emissions by up to 80%, according to IATA. Corporate investment in SAFc supports the global SAF production scale-up, therefore reducing long-term costs and ensuring future SAF supply availability.

Due to its accessibility, SAFc is often used by corporates to claim the environmental attributes of SAF against their business travel or air freight emissions. Purchasing SAFc supports the replacement of fossil kerosene with SAF which has less life-cycle emissions and therefore offers a readily implementable, transparent and scalable solution for corporates looking to address their Scope 3 emissions.

STX Group’s global presence and industry expertise allows the sourcing of high quality SAFc at competitive prices. The SAFc traded by STX Group is always on a third-party public registry, meets stringent additionality guidelines and is always third-party certified. Furthermore, no large minimum purchase volumes are required, providing SAFc access to any corporate.

“We are thrilled to play a role in shaping the SAFc industry by bringing more liquidity to the market.

According to Freightos, air freight shipments creates 20 to 30 times as much pollution as ocean freight shipments.
Last year, by shifting some of its shorter routes to trucking rather than air cargo, it saved about 502,000 tonnes of CO2e.
That said, the company’s cargo emissions were staggeringly large,” Pucker said.
Lufthansa Cargo reportedly told the Loadstar that a binding contract focused on SAFs has not yet been signed.","Fast-fashion giant Shein and logistics player Lufthansa Cargo announced Wednesday that they have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) meant to help them “explore a range of initiatives to drive the adoption of sustainable solutions for air freight.”

The MoU includes a plan to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage on Lufthansa Cargo flights carrying Shein products. Ethan Shen, Shein’s general manager of global fulfillment, said the two companies will work in tandem on integrating SAF into Shein’s supply chain.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network,” Shen said in a statement, noting that the company sees the move as “part of a broader decarbonization strategy.”

Today, SAF is not easily accessible in mass quantities; the International Air Transport Association (IATA) noted that SAF accounted for 0.3 percent of all jet fuel production globally last year. The organization expects SAF to hit 0.7 percent of all jet fuel production by the end of this year.

According to Reuters, 2024 Cargo Facts Consulting data showed that Shein ships about 5,000 tonnes of cargo daily.

Arif Gasilov, sustainability and ESG strategy partner at consultancy Gasilov Group, said that while Shein and Lufthansa Cargo’s pilot could see decreased emissions for one-off flights, it’s unlikely that a will significantly impact Shein’s at-large emissions in the immediate near term, in part because of availability challenges.

“In 2024 global production [of SAF] was about one million tonnes, which is only around 0.3 percent of total jet fuel use. That means SAF is still a drop in the bucket, but on the flights where it is used it can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by roughly 80 to 85 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. For a company like Shein, which ships more than 5,000 tonnes of air cargo per day, running even a single Boeing 777 freighter on SAF would dramatically cut emissions on that flight, but it would barely move the needle on their overall footprint until supply grows,” Gasilov told Sourcing Journal.

Air cargo is widely considered one of the least environmentally friendly ways to ship goods. According to Freightos, air freight shipments creates 20 to 30 times as much pollution as ocean freight shipments.

Shein ships much of its product to customers using air freight, though its 2024 impact report noted that it plans to “promote the greater use of land, sea or multimodal routes, thereby reducing the need for air freight” in the future. Last year, by shifting some of its shorter routes to trucking rather than air cargo, it saved about 502,000 tonnes of CO2e.

Still, that same impact report showed that in 2024 the company’s upstream transportation and distribution emissions accounted for more than 8.5 million tonnes of CO2e, up 13.7 percent from 2023. Its fuel and energy-related activities spiked 106 percent, as compared with 2023.

Ken Pucker, professor of the practice at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said that Shein’s latest pilot doesn’t change the fact that it relies heavily on air cargo to support its business.

“Good that Shein is exploring low carbon transportation options. That said, the company’s cargo emissions were staggeringly large,” Pucker said. “Their air shipment-based delivery model is profligate and damaging.”

In addition to the SAF pilot, the MoU between Lufthansa Cargo and Shein will see the e-tailer offsetting carbon emissions by supporting the growth of the SAF market. In return for the offsets purchased, Lufthansa Cargo will issue what it calls “Proof of Sustainability” certificates that indicate the SAF quantities used. Betsey Rafeld, senior client engagement manager at Carbon Direct, said purchasing SAF offsets may be a viable option for some markets because of the difficulty of accessing SAF in certain geographic regions; she noted that the U.S. and Europe lead regular adoption.

“Because SAF is relatively limited geographically, the use of SAF Scope 3 certificates is critical to enable buyers globally to interact with the market even if they are not able to physically utilize a flight running on SAF,” Rafeld explained, noting that the impact such certificates could have would be determined by how large an investment Shein decides to make.

Gasilov said that because Shein has built its business model around the use of air cargo for shipping, it could help convince major brands and retailers of SAF’s potential, in turn building up the demand for the alternative fuel. Like many other sustainability initiatives, including the rise of next-generation materials, demand signals help producers make strides toward production at scale. Still, as Rafeld said, without contracts in place, movement can be slow going and difficult.

“[This partnership] puts pressure on other large e-commerce players to explore similar steps and helps build the market for SAF,” Gasilov said.

Lufthansa Cargo reportedly told the Loadstar that a binding contract focused on SAFs has not yet been signed. In the announcement about the MoU, the companies noted that they plan to engage in a “long-term collaboration,” both on SAF and on other environmental and traceability-related initiatives. Rafeld said that a contract outlining the requirements of the partnership could procure more meaningful results.

“Airlines and cargo operators really rely on corporate fliers like Shein to pay the green premium for SAF, so these kinds of partnerships and demand signals are important to support the growth of SAF globally. Ultimately, however, the real impacts are realized when these exploratory relationships become firm deals and completed offtakes,” she said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires oil refiners and importers to blend minimum amounts of biofuels into the US fuel supply or buy credits from those that do. But refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d of crude can request full exemptions, potentially saving themselves tens of millions of dollars in compliance costs. President Donald Trump's administration told federal courts this week in various pending cases that it ""has now developed a new approach for reviewing small refinery exemptions"" and is planning to ""issue decisions"".

The administration is expected to provide some clarity on its small refinery exemption policy on Friday, three sources said. A fourth was told by an official that some policy signal was coming ""soon"". EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

But it is unclear how officials will clarify their policy, which could take the form of a proposal, a memo describing the new approach, or separate rulings on the dozens of pending exemption requests stretching back ten years. Federal courts took issue with President Joe Biden's en masse denials of exemption requests, leaving the Trump administration with an unprecedented backlog to resolve. The issue is politically and legally thorny for EPA, pitting two lobbies Trump has pledged to support — oil refiners and farmers — against one other.

Public data on small refinery exemptions updated Thursday showed nine new requests but no decisions over the last month.

The September CBOT US soybean oil contract rose nearly 5pc Thursday to settle at a two-week high of 53.64¢/lb, outpacing gains in crude futures as traders bet on potentially higher biofuel demand if exemptions end up being less generous than they were during Trump's first term. Upward pressure from a higher bean oil-heating oil spread lifted the price of D4 biomass-based diesel and D6 ethanol Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits. Current-year D4 RINs traded as high as 114¢/RIN, while D6s traded up to 106.25¢/RIN over the busy trading session.

Thorny questions remain

It is unlikely that the Trump administration will be able to immediately clarify its approach to all aspects of this complicated corner of the federal biofuel program. Exemption requests made as recently as last week give the Department of Energy little time to review applications and consult with EPA, as is required by law. And the bulk of potentially eligible refiners have not yet applied for exemptions from this year's blend mandates, since EPA has historically asked applicants to provide at least three quarters of financial data for the relevant compliance year.

Other open questions include whether EPA will require oil companies that remain in the program to blend more biofuels to make up for their exempt competitors and whether EPA will compensate newly exempt companies for past compliance. EPA's separate plan to halve RIN credits in future years for foreign biofuels also complicates the agency's enforcement — since refiners making up for old exemptions might have to bring to market more volume to meet the same mandate if some biofuels start earning fewer program credits than previously.

Legal challenges are highly likely no matter what the administration decides. Oil refiners in particular have expressed increasing frustration with the Trump administration's approach to biofuel policy, which they say is increasing feedstock and fuel costs.

Source: Circularity Fuels via Business Wire","U.S. startup Circularity Fuels has developed an electrical conversion unit capable of directly transforming biogas into electricity. biogas generated on dairy farms dairy farms into synthesis gas, an essential component for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This technology allows decentralized production with a capital cost 100 times lower than traditional methane reformers.

The Ouro reactor and waste transformation

On Ouroreactor, designed by Circularity, operates with standard electrical connection and does not require the usual costly pretreatment of biogas. Its innovative system allows direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide contained in the manure, avoiding their release into the atmosphere and generating feedstock ready to be converted into PBS by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

The company has validated this operation on a California dairy farm, marking the first case of electric reforming of raw biogas from a covered lagoon digester.

Distributed jet fuel production

One of the main challenges in the adoption of renewable fuels has been infrastructure. Circularity proposes a distributed solution: by enabling the generation of liquid fuel directly on farms, dependence on gas grids is eliminated.

This fuel can be transported by road or rail, and can be easily integrated into existing logistics channels.

With more than 20,000 farms in the United States producing untapped biogas, the possibility of converting this waste into fuel represents a new source of revenue for the agricultural sector.

Impact on aviation and commercial deployment

Airlines face regulatory mandates to incorporate PBS, but currently only a fraction of what is needed is produced. Circularity estimates that, if its technology is implemented at all viable waste sites in the country, it could meet up to 70% of the nation’s demand for jet fuel.

The company will present its technology at the SAF Global Summit in London and plans a full demonstration of biogas production to SAF on a farm later this year. Initial commercial deployment is planned for 2026.

The company’s founder, Dr. Stephen Beaton, former head of the U.S. Air Force Petroleum Office laboratory, stresses that this technology democratizes the production of renewable fuelsby allowing livestock farms to become energy centers.

With catalysts adapted from the automotive automotive industryThe Ouro reactor maintains stable operation even in the presence of contaminants typical of agricultural biogas.

For this pilot, Liquid Sun has partnered with Finnair, ABB, Fortum and Finavia.
This is the first precommercial production pilot of its kind, aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland.
“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market,” said Pasi Keinänen, the CEO of Liquid Sun.

Originating from research at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis (LTE) technology that converts CO2 emissions and renewable hydrogen into eSAF.

For this pilot, Liquid Sun has partnered with Finnair, ABB, Fortum and Finavia.

In Finland, biogenic CO2 emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The pilot electro-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational this fall.

This is the first precommercial production pilot of its kind, aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland.

In this collaborative project, the companies will jointly develop eSAF production, conduct validation, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes to secure the future supply of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market,” said Pasi Keinänen, the CEO of Liquid Sun. “To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels.”

At the beginning of 2025, the EU aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation through 2050.

From 2030, the mandate will expand to include fully synthetic fuels made from CO2.

By 2050, the blending requirement will rise to 70 percent, of which half must be eSAF.

The mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of cargo annually.

In Finland, this includes Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi airports.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel,” said Henri Hansson, an executive with Finavia. “This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders, and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations.”

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels.

The Finnish forest industry alone generates 20 million tons of biogenic CO2 annually, with additional emissions from biogas plants.

These diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, which in turn strengthens energy security and balances electricity grid load nationwide.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require new innovation and collaboration across the value chain,” said Riku Aho, Finnair’s vice president of energy transition. “We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon-neutrality goals.”

Satu Sipola, the vice president of hydrogen and project execution at Fortum, added, “Fortum’s target is to help societies to reach carbon neutrality and our customers to decarbonize their processes. For aviation fuel production, we are pleased to offer renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen from the pilot plant we are currently building.”

Simo Säynevirta, ABB’s head of the H2 Springboard ecosystem, said, “The goal of ABB Oy’s H2 Springboard program is to promote the development of Finland’s hydrogen-economy ecosystem and to accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration for developing pioneering solutions.”

Keinänen with Liquid Sun concluded, “There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. We believe rapid piloting and validation is the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_d8ba81cf7524412a9951dd12bea9135e~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_915,h_610,al_c,q_85/80995f_d8ba81cf7524412a9951dd12bea9135e~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-08-21 17:56:38.191734

With corn prices potentially falling below $4 a bushel, Nebraska Corn Board Chairman Brandon Hunnicutt emphasized the challenges faced by local farmers.
In addition to low prices and an abundance of corn, Hunnicutt expressed concerns about the rising costs of fertilizer.
""Right now, fertilizer prices are really high with the combination of corn prices being very low.
Nebraska ethanol plants currently consume nearly 750 million bushels of corn annually, but Hunnicutt says they aim to increase that number.","The Nebraska Corn Board, in collaboration with the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and other organizations, convened to discuss pressing issues as the harvest season approaches. With corn prices potentially falling below $4 a bushel, Nebraska Corn Board Chairman Brandon Hunnicutt emphasized the challenges faced by local farmers.

""One thing to be aware of is just...if you if you know a farmer and they do look a little down, try to talk to make sure everything's okay, because these are challenging times,"" said Hunnicutt.

In addition to low prices and an abundance of corn, Hunnicutt expressed concerns about the rising costs of fertilizer. The NCGA reported that fertilizer is expected to account for 36% of a corn farmer's operating costs, with some fertilizers, like ammonium nitrate, increasing in cost by 37% since the beginning of the year due to tariffs and supply chain issues.

""Right now, fertilizer prices are really high with the combination of corn prices being very low. So it's hard for the farmer to try to figure out what to do next year, you know, when we're past this year,"" said Hunnicutt.

The corn board is in discussions with suppliers about prices, and the NCGA has sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, urging action on what they describe as prices approaching 'disastrous levels'.

Meanwhile, Hunnicutt highlighted efforts to innovate within the ethanol industry. ""We're looking at how we can expand ethanol usage, not just in our state, but throughout the nation, throughout the world,"" he said.

Topics such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and year-round nationwide E-15 were addressed. Concerns were raised about the reduction of the $1.75 tax credit for sustainable aviation fuels to $1 under the ""one big beautiful bill,"" which could impact producers.

""We were disappointed that they did that just because, you know, anything we could do to help prop up sustainable aviation fuel, much like we did on the ethanol industry back 40 years ago, 30 years ago, to really get it thriving on its own,"" said Hunnicutt.

Expanding the ethanol market overseas, particularly in Japan, and exploring the maritime fuel industry as a potential market were also discussed, as the maritime fuel industry uses hundreds of millions of tons of fuel annually, but very little ethanol. ""One of the biggest uses of fuel is the marine industry, especially when we talk to large cargo ships. There are bigger, bigger market than SAF will ever be,"" said Hunnicutt.

Research on the maritime industry is underway, and discussions with California about introducing E-15 to their market continue. Nebraska ethanol plants currently consume nearly 750 million bushels of corn annually, but Hunnicutt says they aim to increase that number.

Thomas said Georgia lawmakers are working to increase demand for timber products, including a state Senate study committee that began meeting last year to explore developing sustainable aviation fuel from biomass, which has become popular in Europe.

“Why aren’t we doing this?” he said. “The world wants green stuff … and we’ve got some of the greatest forestry in the world.”

Thomas said another way to increase demand for timber is being worked on at the federal level. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s renewable fuel standard is aimed at increasing the use of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it bans the use of commercially produced trees in producing those fuels.

“If we could get that relaxed to include trees, it would go a long way,” he said.

“I, along with each member of our delegation in the House, remain committed to working tirelessly with our state leaders, federal partners and timber producers to navigate this difficult transition, secure new employment opportunities for the hundreds of citizens impacted by the closures and safeguard the long-term strength and viability of Georgia’s timber industry,” Burns added.",https://capitol-beat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cropped-square-logo-2-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 13:56:27.602891

Aircraft Leasing Ireland (ALI), the Ibec group that represents the aircraft leasing sector in Ireland, welcomes today’s publication of Ireland’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can make a meaningful near-term impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lessors are already funding research into SAF and other technologies that can support aviation in its drive to net zero by 2050. Today’s roadmap is a welcome set of concrete, coordinated actions that Government can take to deliver more progress.

Ireland faces several significant barriers to the adoption of SAF and targeted measures like those in the roadmap are needed to accelerate its uptake. Coordinated cross-Government action and alignment with EU policy will be critical to shaping effective SAF policy frameworks and unlocking investment. These measures should be embedded in the government’s revised National Aviation Policy to ensure Ireland meets its obligations under ReFuelEU (an EU legislative programme designed to promote increased use of SAF).

Zippy Duvall tells Brownfield “I’m beginning to hear in the last few weeks, especially in the southeast part of the country starting with the Bootheel of Missouri south, it’s time for the USDA and President Trump to start talking about that.”

Duvall tells Brownfield farmers have mixed feelings about more ad-hoc assistance; while farmers would rather have demand from open, international markets to sell their commodities, it’s also a tough farm economy.

Duvall says it’s getting close to time for Farm Bureau to meet with the USDA to discuss possible trade aid.

“Time is of the essence. The quicker we can do it, the quicker that relief can get to farmers and the easier it will be for them to go to the bank this winter,” he says.

Ag Secretary Brooke Rollins has previously said the Trump administration and USDA plan to help farmers from the potential economic fallouts of trade tariffs using similar strategies from the first Trump administration.

I explained to him if the markets didn’t move with this bumper crop out here, we would have everything full with cheap prices. And going into winter with everyone going to the bank to line-up their credit for a spring crop, it would be difficult for many farmers. He really wasn’t aware of that.”

Harbour-Friendly Ships and Quieter Construction

Transportation is one of the largest sectors worldwide, which is why technologies to advance sustainability and efficiency are more prevalent than ever. IDTechEx's portfolios of Electric Vehicles and Robotics & Autonomy Research Reports cover what the future of travel could look like - with fewer emissions, lower carbon footprints, and healthier environments.

Battery electric vehicles are no longer a new phenomenon, but the expansion of electrification across not only cars, but micro vehicles, trucks, ships, and construction vehicles, suggests there is much more to be expected from the EV sector going forward.

Considerate construction sites

The quiet hums of diggers and forklifts could replace the once jarring sounds of heavy engines on construction sites in the future with the rise of battery powered vehicles, especially in built-up areas. Diesel engine construction vehicles not only create recurrent fuel costs and air pollution but can create a disturbance amongst the community, meaning the future wellbeing of workers and the wider community will also be enhanced as the future of construction steers towards being increasingly environmentally friendly. From a safety perspective, construction sites may become easier to communicate across, with workers better able to hear instruction over quieter noise levels.

Building companies could incur fewer costs and reduce total costs of ownership by making larger initial investments in electric machinery, and cutting out the need for the continuous purchasing of fuel down the line. Battery types will also come into play, as power density for machinery doesn't need to be as great as with passenger vehicles. The requirement for steady power over longer periods means there is greater versatility in battery solutions, potentially simplifying electrification and creating a greater incentive to make the switch. IDTechEx's report, ""Electric Vehicles in Construction 2024-2044: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"", covers developments being made within the sector that will create this new future of construction.

City navigation with micro EVs and long-haul trucks

Nimble navigation around large cities could be allowed with micro EVs, with ease of movement between traffic jams and amongst the busyness of densely populated areas. Due to smaller battery and motor requirements than with cars, micro EVs are poised as good candidates for early electrification, with lower costs. Electric scooters, mopeds, and three-wheelers are all examples of these small yet efficient vehicles, that could change the future of moving around cities. IDTechEx's report, ""Micro EVs 2026-2046: Electric Two-Wheelers, Three-Wheelers, and Microcars"", explores expected uptake over the next two decades.

Figure 2. Source: IDTechEx.

On a larger scale, trucks rack up a much greater annual mileage than cars and other vehicles, with some doing long haul deliveries across countries. Unlike passenger cars, trucks are a capital good for firms and businesses, with lifecycles of approximately 10 years. Making the initial investments into deploying electric trucks could therefore be more profitable in the long run, as they are likely to cost less to refuel over their lifetime.

The reduced noise of large engines on highways and service stations may also be appreciated for not only other road users, but the truck drivers themselves, making driving more pleasant. Along with the reduction in emissions, electric trucks could boast not only operational and financial benefits, but environmental benefits. Visit IDTechEx's report, ""Electric and Fuel Cell Trucks 2025-2045: Technologies, Markets, Forecasts"", for more details.

Making waves with electrification

Seaside and port towns of the future may be home to even more tranquillity and the peaceful sightings of ships, unaccompanied by the large vibration of engines.

Hybrid ships, functioning with both an engine and a battery, could turn off their engines miles out from shore, and eradicate the need for them to be running while a ship is stationary in port, so that air quality can improve, and surrounding areas don't need observe fuel emissions. The electrification of ships can also allow for greater speed and efficiency during travel. For leisure boats, less maintenance may be required, while passengers can benefit from increased performance and responsiveness, enhancing the overall experience.

The reductions in emissions offered by electric ships could be beneficial all over the world, with most goods being transported by sea at some time during their journey, meaning electric ships could lead to cleaner ocean air everywhere.

Electric ships could also act as microgrids for local power operations, benefitting communities with their large batteries and electrical capabilities by taking on excess power and returning the favour when a balance is needed. In this way, ships can also rely on local power sources to recharge for their next journey, without the need for large amounts of fuel. IDTechEx's reports, ""Electric Boats & Ships 2024-2044"" and ""Electric Vehicles: Land, Sea, and Air 2025-2045"" cover the waves being made within the marine transportation sector.

Fast fuelling hydrogen stations

Driving with only water vapour as a tailpipe emission could make road users feel good about not contributing to harmful emissions and improving local air quality. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) provide a zero-emission solution to travelling, for cars, buses, trucks, and other road vehicles. For consumers opting to buy these cars, there may be a feeling of doing right by the environment, while OEMs benefit from meeting emission reduction targets. With the possibility of refuelling at hydrogen pumps taking as little as 5 minutes, FCEVs can also offer increased convenience, without waiting around for batteries to charge.

FCEVs also have the edge on energy density over battery electric cars. FCEVs therefore provide improved range, more comparable to ICE cars, but without the harmful emissions. IDTechEx's report, ""Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles 2025-2045: Markets, Technologies, Forecasts"" covers the technologies behind FCEVs that allow them to use hydrogen as a fuel, including the most commonly adopted proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).

Fuel cells travelling sky-high

The possibility for planes to be fitted with fuel cells alongside the closer implementation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could lead to flying becoming a more environmentally friendly form of travel. Some major aircraft manufacturers are already looking to the future where planes could be fitted with hydrogen fuel cells to incur the same emission-free benefits that are currently possible on the road. Passengers travelling for leisure or work won't have to be concerned with the responsibility of a hefty carbon footprint, knowing that water vapour is the only emission produced while flying.

The costs and availability of resources, however, mean that in the near future, SAF is likely to be the first sustainable and most feasible option. SAF is already being combined with regular jet fuel to reduce the overall carbon footprint of air travel, as it is responsible for less production emissions. IDTechEx's report, ""Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts"", explores a number of possibilities for the future of sustainable air travel, with predictions on the uptake of fuel cells and SAF in planes.
