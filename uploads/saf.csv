The scale of the challenge – and opportunity – is immense. According to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons – about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 – 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits – by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

“Global demand for SAF is shifting from ‘if’ to ‘how fast,’” said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. “Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume. These dynamics underscore the value of XCF’s early-mover advantage and modular design, which we’re now extending globally through partnerships such as with New Rise Australia, a venture that is expected to develop three SAF sites across the continent to meet Australia’s growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.”

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers – mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement – but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

A group of European countries has come together to accelerate the use of synthetic aviation fuels. Austria Finland France Germany Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal and Spain have joined a new coalition designed to strengthen the transition toward cleaner flight operations. This announcement was made during the Transport Council in Brussels.

Why Synthetic Aviation Fuels Matter

This initiative builds on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan and highlights the rising importance of synthetic aviation fuels in lowering emissions from aviation. Current regulations expect these fuels to supply 1.2 percent of aviation fuel by 2030 and reach 35 percent by 2050. Across Europe more than forty projects are already awaiting major investment decisions. The momentum indicates that strong financial support will be essential to scale production and position Europe as a leader in this technology.

Support from EU Leadership

According to the Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism this coalition signals a clear commitment to reducing aviation emissions. Member States plan to mobilise significant funding with a goal of reaching at least 500 million euros for large scale projects. This is expected to encourage private investment and speed up the deployment of synthetic fuels at airports.

How the Coalition Will Work

Participating countries will provide financial backing for double sided auctions designed for synthetic fuel producers. These auctions will help secure long term revenue for producers while giving buyers access to competitive contracts. The first auction is expected in 2026 and the coalition will begin coordinating efforts immediately. It also remains open for additional countries that want to join.

Conclusion

The creation of this coalition marks a meaningful step toward cleaner aviation in Europe. It reflects a growing confidence in synthetic fuels and shows how coordinated action can guide the market toward real progress. Such developments also encourage expert partners across the sustainability space to prepare for new opportunities in aviation transformation.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-41.svg,N,,2025-12-05 08:56:25.226350

The Airbus A220 replaces its older Airbus A318 and A319.","Aircraft manufacturer Airbus describes the A220 as purpose-built for efficiency. It is a small, single-aisle aircraft that seats between 100-160 passengers in a bright and comfortable cabin. The seats are wider and offer more personal space, so it is also popular with passengers. Why does the Airbus A220 have such a loyal pilot following? Let's find out in this guide.

The Airbus A220 has new-generation engines that offer superior efficiency, with 25% lower fuel burn, CO2 emissions, and noise. It uses advanced materials, the latest technology, and state-of-the-art aerodynamics. There are two variants of the Airbus A220 — the A220-100 and the A220-300. The aircraft is a fusion of performance and technology that reduces its environmental footprint.

In The Airspace Cabin

The cabin is large and airy compared to a similar-sized aircraft, and the configuration is either 3-2 or 2-2 premium seating. The seats are ergonomic, slim-lined, and wider than the comparable Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 seats, with more legroom. The overhead lockers are 60% larger than usual, and this speeds up boarding and turnaround times and allows passengers to have their baggage close by during the flight.

The new Airbus Airspace cabin is used on both types and offers superior passenger comfort. The Airspace cabin was designed to enhance the passenger experience in its modern aircraft family and prioritizes comfort and design. The sidewalls were redesigned to make it more spacious. Airbus's Airspace cabin is a concept designed to improve passenger comfort, space, and brand consistency across its modern aircraft family, including the A350, A320neo, A330neo, and A220.

There are integrated state-of-the-art inflight entertainment systems and high-speed connectivity. Air quality has improved, and the cabin is quieter and has better pressurization. Panoramic windows flood the cabin with light, and there is customizable LED mood lighting for ambiance and to reduce jet lag. The lavatories have also been upgraded to be touchless and with antimicrobial surfaces.

A Little Background

Before it was launched as the Airbus A220, it was the Bombardier CSeries jetliner that was launched in 2008. Bombardier had success with its previous Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) but wanted to develop the CSeries further. The original aim of the aircraft was to fill the 100–150-seat market and be a quiet, fuel-efficient regional jet. They also had success with their Learjet, Challenger, and Global business jets. They hoped that this new aircraft would replace the Boeing 717, the Boeing 737NG, the Airbus A320, and the Embraer E190.

The project, along with delays on train orders and design issues with their business jet program, left Bombardier with financial and commercial difficulties. Sales of the CSeries were slow, so Airbus, which already held a stake in the company, acquired the CSeries program and the Bombardier facility at Mirabel, Quebec. Bombardier exited the commercial aviation industry and the trains to further concentrate on business jets. They had also had a dispute with Boeing in the process.

The CSeries was rebranded in 2018 by Airbus with the official A220 name and became part of the Airbus family. At this time, Airbus had a 50.01% stake in the company and took full control in 2020. The Airbus A220-100 (formerly the CS100) first entered service in July 2016, with Swiss International Airlines, while the A220-300 (formerly the CS300) entered service with airBaltic in December of the same year.

Why Airlines Like The Airbus A220

The Airbus A220-100 has a range of 3,600 nautical miles and can seat 135 passengers. The slightly larger A220-300 has a 3,400 nautical mile range and has a slightly longer fuselage that can seat up to 160 passengers. It can be used for regional flights or on short to medium-haul routes, and it can be used on short runways and regional airports with ease. It can fly a variety of missions, including challenging airports like London City Airport. Furthermore, it is the only aircraft in production in its class that can perform steep approaches and long-haul routes.

Airlines can offer a wide range of routes using this aircraft, as it has the same range as larger single-aisle aircraft. Airlines can more easily change their schedules to meet demand and operate new routes without the risks normally involved. They can also operate the aircraft when fuel prices are volatile, which improves things economically. The Airbus A220 has 25% lower operating costs per seat than previous-generation aircraft.

The aircraft is more fuel-efficient, further reducing operating costs. It is a versatile and profitable aircraft for the airlines. It maximizes profitability, is lean, economical, and efficient with significant savings for operators. There is also 99% commonality on the Airbus A220 type. Therefore, less training is needed and there are fewer maintenance costs when operating this variant. However, it is not compatible with the Airbus A320, for example, and needs a different type rating.

The Technical Bit

The Airbus A220 is built using lightweight materials, which also make it more fuel-efficient. The wings are made of a carbon composite material, and the fuselage is made of aluminum-lithium. These materials also allow for a longer service life. The aircraft has Pratt and Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines that produce 23,300 pounds of thrust. The benefit is 16% better fuel efficiency and 50% less noise, as well as optimized performance and enhanced reliability.

The A220 is fitted with the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics suite. It has five 15.1-inch touchscreen displays and an advanced Flight Management System (FMS). There is a Synthetic Vision System (SVS) with an optional Head Up Display (HUD). It uses fly-by-wire technology with side stick controls and, overall, reduces pilot workload. The cockpit has Airbus A350-style displays and electronic checklists that simplify procedures. Hand flying is smooth and precise. The aircraft’s fly-by-wire, control laws, human factor-centered design, and ergonomics have contributed to making the Airbus A220 a game changer.

Aircraft Specifications:

Data from Airbus

A larger Airbus A220-500 was rumored, but Airbus has not put the aircraft into production yet. It would be a stretched version of the A220-100 and would accommodate up to 180 passengers. It would fill the gap between the A220-300 and the A320neo. The aircraft would run on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), reducing its carbon footprint, and could be a future key player in sustainable aviation. Instead, Airbus is scaling up production of the existing A220s.

Which Airlines Utilize The Airbus A220?

There are currently 455 Airbus A220s in operation, with 21 commercial airlines. They have flown over one billion kilometers, carrying over 90 million passengers on over 1,100 routes, according to Airbus. Over 70% of the Airbus A220s will fly alongside the Airbus A320 at airlines such as Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Air France, and Air Canada, as well as SWISS and Qantas.

Delta Air Lines is the largest operator of the Airbus A220 in North America, according to data from ch-aviation. The airline uses both variants on domestic and transcontinental routes with two classes of seating. The airline has another 65 A220-300s on order and uses the aircraft to feed its hubs. Air Canada currently has 39 A220-300s and JetBlue has 55 of the aircraft. Breeze Airways has 46 of the larger variant and uses the aircraft for point-to-point flights.

In the top five are airBaltic with 50 Airbus A220 operating regional routes within Europe. Air France has 48 A220s in operation on short and medium-haul routes and has more of the aircraft on order. The Airbus A220 replaces its older Airbus A318 and A319. The launch customer, SWISS, has 30 of the aircraft. EgyptAir scrapped one of its fleet in 2025 and sold the rest in 2024, citing that they were difficult and costly to maintain.

What The Airlines Say

Here is what some of the airlines have said about the Airbus A220 as per this Airbus case study:

""The Airbus A220-300 provides both greater capacity and longer range. Notably, the longer range of the aircraft has enabled airBaltic to launch direct flights to destinations such as Abu Dhabi, Almaty, Malaga and Lisbon."" - Andris Vaivods, airBaltic SVP Technical Operations

""With this aircraft, we’re able to operate on longer routes, such as Moscow, Cairo or Hurghada, as well as at operationally challenging airports with short and narrow runways and complex approaches, such as London City and Florence. At the same time, the A220 is an all-rounder that can be used for all our other short and medium-haul destinations."" - Peter Koch, SWISS A220 Fleet Chief

""In the current reduced demand environment, it’s important to leverage the most efficient aircraft in the fleet. The A220 helped us fill a gap in terms of capacity between regional aircrafts and larger narrow-body aircraft, for which, the break-even threshold is too high in the current context."" - Mark Garlardo, SVP Network Planning and Revenue Management at Air Canada",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/why-the-airbus-a220-has-such-a-loyal-pilot-following.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-05 01:56:57.313145

For investors, this reframes DevvStream from a micro‑cap services profile to a financeable, industrial fuels and credits business with long‑duration revenue potential and scalability.
The new company is expected to be led by Carl Stanton as CEO and operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables.
“Aviation and maritime operators are facing some of the most ambitious decarbonization mandates globally, and most of them want to comply,” said Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream.","DevvStream Corp., a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, and Southern Energy Renewables Inc., a U.S.-based producer of low-cost fuels made from biomass, with a flagship Louisiana project that plans to utilize regional wood-waste biomass to deliver green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale, on Dec. 3 announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine under a new U.S.-domiciled, Nasdaq-listed company, following customary closing conditions.

The new company plans to help aviation and maritime operators meet tightening global mandates from regulations such as ReFuelEU and organizations such as the International Maritime Organization by creating a U.S.–built, integrated clean‑fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, using domestic feedstock and workforce to produce carbon‑negative SAF and green methanol at commercial scale. Operationally, the combined company is expected to have two divisions: one focused on climate solutions that generate environmental assets, and one centered on clean fuels and products, with an initial focus on a previously announced Louisiana biomass‑to‑fuel facility.

The new platform’s anticipated SAF pathway, combined with DevvStream’s environmental‑asset capabilities, is aimed at reducing the cost burden that slows alternative fuel adoption today. Management expects to utilize federal incentives early while targeting cost‑competitiveness even without these incentives, supported by various co‑products produced during the SAF process. The company also plans to leverage early airline and maritime offtaker engagement. For investors, this reframes DevvStream from a micro‑cap services profile to a financeable, industrial fuels and credits business with long‑duration revenue potential and scalability. The new company is expected to be led by Carl Stanton as CEO and operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. Closing of the business combination is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2026.

“Aviation and maritime operators are facing some of the most ambitious decarbonization mandates globally, and most of them want to comply,” said Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream. “But today’s renewable fuel options remain materially more expensive than fossil fuels, which is slowing adoption and creating a practical barrier to transitioning at the pace regulators envision. This merger matters now because Southern’s technology, low-cost feedstock, and development platform, combined with DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities, are aimed at reducing that cost burden and enabling compliance at scale.”

“The State of Louisiana continues to serve as an important partner in the development of this initiative, and we expect that it will continue to support the project moving forward,” said Jay Patel, CEOof Southern Energy Renewables. “We believe Louisiana’s combination of feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and experienced workforce creates a strong platform for long-term competitiveness, and we look forward to expanding our partnership with the State as we work to strengthen the nation’s energy leadership and supply global markets in a way that supports our expanding economy.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Devv_Stream_Logo_f79d1a2d8e.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:56:09.905492

(Greenlyte Carbon Technologies) Greenlyte Carbon Technologies is inaugurating the worldwide first LiquidSolar SNG plant in Duisburg, marking a decisive step from development towards industrial production of synthetic fuels (e-fuels). This milestone positions Greenlyte as a technology leader for innovative, competitive new energy carriers and strengthens North Rhine-Westphalia’s role as a leading hub for future industries.

LiquidSolar SNG serves as the first plant combining a direct synthesis use case with Greenlyte’s green molecule platform LiquidSolar™, in this case synthetic natural gas.

LiquidSolar™ is Greenlyte’s fully electrified, modular system uniquely combining carbon capture with green hydrogen production to deliver high purity syngas for downstream synthesis into e.g. e-methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) - and this at fossil-competitive costs.

With its flagship LiquidSolar SNG project, Greenlyte will demonstrate the commercial readiness of its technology over the next years. The total engineering to inauguration phase took less than 12 months and the final build-out of the plant less than three months. The plant will deliver five tons of SNG per year and has a carbon removal capacity of 40 tons CO₂ annually.

Greenlyte’s technology is modular, scalable and ready for the market. Over 13,000 operating hours in pilot projects demonstrate its reliability. The Duisburg facility is a first step in a comprehensive industrialization strategy: by 2027, a scaled plant producing e-Methanol is planned for Marl/Germany, and entry into international markets is targeted by 2030. Greenlyte has already secured long-term offtake agreements with leading companies such as Eurowings and MB Energy.

Florian Hildebrand, CEO and co-founder of Greenlyte: “Our system is technically advanced, economically attractive for customers, and offers strong return opportunities for investors. We are building the foundation for a competitive new energy industry by drawing on NRW’s industrial legacy, a world-class research ecosystem, and a dense supplier network - making optimal use of the great resources we have here”, says Florian Hildebrand, CEO and co-founder of Greenlyte.

Hendrik Wüst, Minister President of NRW: “North Rhine-Westphalia aims to become Europe’s first climate-neutral industrial region. This can succeed when growth, innovation, and climate protection go hand in hand. Companies like Greenlyte Carbon Technologies are exemplary of this path. Greenlyte impressively demonstrates how cutting-edge research becomes real value creation: With the world’s first integrated DAC-to-SNG plant in Duisburg, harmful greenhouse gas is turned into a valuable resource. This is future technology ‘Made in NRW’—reducing energy-sector dependencies and making a key contribution to a climate-friendly, circular, and future-proof economy.”

UCAA Deputy Director General, Olive Birungi Lumonya, noted that the study confirms Uganda’s strong potential to produce SAF domestically.
Uganda’s abundant biomass resources, such as agricultural residues, forestry by-products, and organic waste, position the country to becoming a future producer of sustainable jet fuel.
“Uganda recognises that achieving ICAO’s long-term climate goals requires advancements across the entire sector, from aircraft technology and air navigation operations to the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.
He added that UCAA has prioritised environmental protection and sustainable aviation in its strategic planning, pointing to Uganda’s strong commitment to CORSIA and the broader global movement toward lower-carbon fuels.","Uganda has taken a major step towards adopting cleaner aviation energy with the presentation of the Final Draft Report of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Feasibility Study, developed in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and funded by the Government of the United Kingdom.

The report marked a milestone in Uganda’s efforts to build a low-carbon and climate-resilient aviation sector.

UCAA Deputy Director General, Olive Birungi Lumonya, noted that the study confirms Uganda’s strong potential to produce SAF domestically. Uganda’s abundant biomass resources, such as agricultural residues, forestry by-products, and organic waste, position the country to becoming a future producer of sustainable jet fuel.

Lumonya emphasised Uganda’s alignment with ICAO’s global aspiration to reduce aviation CO₂ emissions by 5% by 2030 using SAF, Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other cleaner energy sources.

She noted that Uganda has already demonstrated commitment to green aviation, becoming one of the first African countries to voluntarily join ICAO’s CORSIA scheme in 2019.

“Uganda recognises that achieving ICAO’s long-term climate goals requires advancements across the entire sector, from aircraft technology and air navigation operations to the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.

She added that SAF is expected to make the largest contribution towards reducing emissions by 2050.

UCAA Acting Director of Safety, Security and Economic Regulation, Irene Atto, reiterated Uganda’s leadership role in continental climate-action efforts, stating that the study provides an evidence-based roadmap for SAF deployment.

“The SAF programme now moves into its next phase—developing a national Business Case Study that will guide implementation in collaboration with key ministries, UNOC, and aviation stakeholders,” she said.

Addressing participants, Barongo Ronny, Director of Safety, Security and Economic Regulation, hailed the feasibility study as “timely and transformative.” He noted that the report provides a comprehensive assessment of Uganda’s technical, economic and environmental readiness to produce SAF, including opportunities for new investments, jobs, and improved energy security.

He added that UCAA has prioritised environmental protection and sustainable aviation in its strategic planning, pointing to Uganda’s strong commitment to CORSIA and the broader global movement toward lower-carbon fuels.

According to ICAO experts, the global shift toward SAF is accelerating, with fuel-blend mandates already required in Europe. Uganda Airlines is among the carriers affected and must uplift SAF-blended fuel on return flights from London, an added cost that could be reduced if Uganda establishes its own SAF production capacity.

Officials noted that SAF production worldwide is currently concentrated in a few technologically advanced countries.

The new feasibility study, however, demonstrates a clear pathway for Uganda to participate across the entire value chain from feedstock production to refining and distribution.",https://softpower.ug/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/spweb.png,N,,2025-12-04 16:56:43.039971

In the Acará Valley in northeastern Pará, the production of palm oil for biodiesel illustrates the clash between the Belém 4X plan and the reality of the territories.","FROM BELÉM, Pará – André Nassar is the executive president of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE), an organization representing the country’s largest grain processors. He says that companies do not want to “break with the soy moratorium,” but he advocates “some kind of improvement” in the agreement that bans sourcing from areas deforested after July 2008 in the Amazon.

The statement was given to Repórter Brasil after he participated in a panel on Saturday (15) during COP30, in Belém, Pará. The event discussed biofuel production in Brazil. Today, seven out of ten liters of diesel manufactured from agricultural raw materials come from soybeans.

Environmental organizations claim that changes to the agreement could weaken the fight against deforestation and advocate keeping the current rules. To date, no concrete proposal has been presented to change them.

Signed by private companies, NGOs, and public authorities, the moratorium is considered one of the main instruments for preserving the Amazon biome, having contributed to a 69% reduction in clearing of native forests by 2022, according to estimates by the Soy Working Group (GTS), which includes environmental organizations, the federal government, businesses, and associations such as ABIOVE itself.

Rural producers critical of the agreement want to plant soy in areas deforested after 2008, which cannot supply signatory companies, according to the rules of the agreement.

Currently, the business pact is under evaluation by Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) and the Supreme Federal Court (STF).

Supreme Court Justice Flávio Dino ordered the suspension of all legal and administrative actions that discuss the validity of the moratorium and its compatibility with competition rules. The injunction seeks to avoid conflicting decisions and establish a “safe legal framework” for agribusinesses in a scenario of billion-dollar disputes.

The president of ABIOVE says that the industry has been committed to the pact for almost 20 years. According to Nassar, rural producer associations have been pressuring companies to be paid compensation for areas that have ceased to be cultivated due to the moratorium, which he sees as “absurd.”

Asked if increasing soybean production to meet the higher demand for biofuels could increase pressure on the forests, he disagreed. “I don’t agree with the argument that more biodiesel results in more soybean-planted area. Expansion of plantations is driven much more by exports of soybeans as grains. It’s the demand for food, not the demand for energy,” he argued.

Biofuel offensive involves “producing” science, executive says

In his presentation at the COP30 panel, Nassar stated that the soybean oil industry needs to “produce science to work on all the communication aspects.” Addressed to an audience dominated by industry representatives, the sentence was used to advocate agricultural biofuels at a time when the sector is under criticism.

Nassar stated that, after the UN climate conference, “the whole world will zoom in on Brazil” to discuss agricultural biofuels and question two points: competition with food production and deforestation associated with supply chains. “We are ready for that,” he said.

The optimistic statements contrast with the scenario that social organizations and researchers have been documenting on the ground. Far from the controlled environment of the COP30 negotiation zone, the supply chains that underpin ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) have been associated with territorial conflicts, deforestation, and labor violations.

The debate on biofuels at the climate summit is taking place at a time when the Brazilian government is trying to make the country a global leader on the agenda. In Brasília, President Lula presented the Belém 4X Commitment – an international declaration sponsored by Brazil, Italy, and Japan that proposes quadrupling the global use of sustainable fuels by 2035 over 2024.

The document includes biofuels, biogas, hydrogen, and e-fuels, and speaks of energy transition, carbon neutrality, and fast expansion of these sources in sectors such as transportation, aviation, and industry.

The debate over the land use for food or biofuel has not been overcome

According to ABIOVE’s president, two-thirds of Brazilian soybean production is exported as grains, and only one-third is processed. The goal is to increase industrialization – converting soybeans into biofuel is a core part of this process. He says that industrialization would increase the value paid to producers by 50% and add four times more value to the soybean supply chain.

Despite the enthusiasm for the COP showcase, he acknowledged that the “food vs. fuel” debate – the dispute between food and fuel production regarding land use – has not been overcome yet, especially in Europe. He said that there are several documents and studies that, in the industry’s view, show the absence of relevant adverse effects, but that “the other parties cling to the food vs. fuel argument based on premises rather than evidence.”

In his opinion, the main obstacle is improving communication. He pointed out the need to “disseminate positive data and information” about biofuels to influence decision-making forums and public opinion.

He recalled that COP30 has “several panels on the subject” and that it is necessary to “keep the subject alive so as not to create resistance.” Asked about the legacy of the conference, he replied that it is “the recognition of biofuels as decarbonization-based energy transition” and declared that he was “super happy about that.”

Nassar was comfortable speaking among industry and agribusiness peers. The panel, promoted by Brazil’s National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers (ANFAVEA), was moderated by Davi Bontempo, superintendent of Environment and Sustainability at the National Confederation of Industry (CNI). It included the participation of Congressman Arnaldo Jardim (Cidadania-SP), João Irineu Medeiros, vice president of Regulatory Affairs at Stellantis in South America, and former Minister of Agriculture Roberto Rodrigues, a special agribusiness envoy at COP30.

Rodrigues said that he is at the conference to defend agriculture. He sustained that there cannot be peace where there is “hunger, lack of energy and unemployment,” and pointed to interests of the oil industry trying to hinder the promotion of agricultural fuels.

The sugarcane industry sees a new boom in cases of slave labor

While the government offers the agenda as a climate showcase, Repórter Brasil’s report “The Biofuels Bill” shows that the ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF (Sugarcane Agroforestry Systems) supply chains are associated with deforestation, land conflicts, and slave labor.

The study details how production of sugarcane, soybeans, palm oil, and beef tallow, pointed out as the basis of the “clean” transition, repeats old practices of exploitation of land and people.

In the case of soybeans, used mainly in biodiesel production in Brazil, the report describes the pressure on the Cerrado. The biome is known as the country’s “water reservoir” and has already lost almost half of its native vegetation, with 74% of that loss caused by agriculture and livestock.

The expansion of soy to meet the demand for biofuels, coupled with grain exports, is pushing the agricultural frontier over native vegetation areas. International studies cited in the report indicate that, when considering Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) emissions, global biofuels emit, on average, more CO2 than the fossil fuels they are intended to replace.

In sugarcane – the basis of ethanol – there is a “new boom” in cases of slavery-like work. In 2023, 258 workers were rescued from sugarcane fields on farms supplying large mills. Several of them did not have minimum health and safety conditions: lack of drinking water, absence of toilets, and exhausting working hours. Even so, mills connected to these scandals are still certified by national and international “sustainability” programs.

In the Acará Valley in northeastern Pará, the production of palm oil for biodiesel illustrates the clash between the Belém 4X plan and the reality of the territories. Tembé Indigenous people, quilombola communities, and riverside dwellers claim that areas linked to BBF (Brasil BioFuels), a company that produces biofuels from palm oil, are associated with crop destruction, enclosures, and episodes of violence against local communities.

In addition to producing biodiesel to supply thermoelectric plants, BBF had plans to make jet fuel and supply the main Brazilian airlines. The company has recently had its request for judicial reorganization accepted by a court in Pará.

When questioned about the conflict with traditional peoples for a Repórter Brasil article in August 2022, BBF stated that it exercised possession of the disputed area in a “peaceful” and “fair” way. They also denied that there had been episodes of beatings, threats, or burning of houses by security agents. The company also said that there is a “reversal of the narrative that seeks to make the company the great villain.”

In a statement to Repórter Brasil during COP30, Chief Yuna Miriam Tembé from the I’xing territory in Tomé-Açu, Pará, summarizes the contradiction in the message she would like to deliver to President Lula if she could meet him personally: “Before quadrupling biofuel production, demarcate our territories.” For her, that production is not clean. It may even be “bio,” but it is “bio because it has indigenous blood, black blood, and the blood of riverside dwellers, extractive communities, and family farmers.”

While leaders like Yuna Miriam circulate through Belém without accreditation to access the area of ​​official negotiations, the biofuel business front has seats at blue zone tables.",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/card-twitter-especial-cop30-21.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 16:56:56.952037

The production technology exists, but barriers remain for large-scale deployment. Central to overcoming these issues is the choice of production pathway. One of the most promising is the G2L™ process, which integrates Sasol’s Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with Topsoe’s electrified reverse water-gas shift (eREACT™), including light hydrocarbon recycle and product upgrade section. It is so promising, in fact, that it was recently chosen for Europe’s largest e-fuels research and demonstration plant, the Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

The efficiency challenge

Producing liquid hydrocarbons from electricity and carbon dioxide is inherently energy intensive. Hydrogen production via electrolysis accounts for more than half of the total e-SAF cost, which makes energy efficiency the defining metric for economic viability. Every megawatt of electricity and kilogram of hydrogen must be translated into the highest possible yield of certified kerosene.

G2L™ addresses these issues through the use of eREACT, where electrically heated reactors replace combustion to supply the energy needed for syngas generation. By eliminating hydrogen combustion, the process improves both hydrogen and electricity efficiency. On a once-through basis, G2L™ performs comparably to other SAF pathways like the methanol-to-jet process.

But when recycling integration is introduced, its advantages become clear – G2L™ emerges as the most efficient option, achieving the highest energy and hydrogen efficiency, and enabling the lowest cost of SAF (LCO SAF) without producing low-value heavy products like the methanol-to-jet process.

Efficiencies and savings can be manyfold

One of the defining features of G2L™ is the easy implementation of the recycling of light hydrocarbons such as naphtha back into the process. In a standard once-through system, these co-products are separated and sold, reducing kerosene yield and complicating offtake agreements for multiple products. With G2L™, light ends are reintegrated alongside fresh CO2 and hydrogen, converting them into additional jet fuel.

This recycling loop increases kerosene yield to 100% of product output while maintaining more than 95% carbon efficiency. It also cuts hydrogen and electricity demand, with naphtha recycling alone reducing electricity consumption by around 15% compared to once-through operation. In a sector where electrolyser costs and power prices dominate economics, these savings are significant.

RNG as a SAF feedstock when using Topsoe`s syngas technologies

RNG (or biomethane) is a purified form of biogas derived from organic waste sources such as agricultural residue, food waste, or wastewater treatment. Upgraded to meet the quality standards of fossil natural gas, RNG is pipeline-compatible and can be used as a direct substitute for traditional natural gas. This means RNG has great potential to serve as a renewable feedstock for producing SAF due to its renewable origin and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

RNG can either be used locally on-site, primarily as a fuel or for power generation, or injected into natural gas distribution pipelines for broader regional export. For SAF production, pipeline distribution is a more practical option.

Integration with electrolysis

The G2L™ concept further improves efficiency through integration with high-temperature electrolysis. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is highly exothermic, producing steam at temperatures suited to Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells (SOECs). By feeding this waste heat into electrolysers, the system reduces the external electricity required for hydrogen production.

When SOEC integration is combined with naphtha recycling, electricity demand can fall by up to one third compared with conventional alkaline electrolysis.

This integration is a practical method of aligning thermodynamics with cost reduction, turning unavoidable process heat into a valuable resource. Efficiency gains in G2L™ technology strengthen project economics by maximizing kerosene yield and reducing hydrogen and electricity consumption.

G2L™ selected for the Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP)

The potential of G2L™ as a next-generation e-fuels pathway is underlined by its selection for DLRs Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) in Leuna. Funded with EUR 130 million from the German Federal Ministry of Transport, the TPP will be Europe’s largest PtL demonstration and research facility.

The TPP maps the entire value chain, from RED II-H2 and -CO2 to certified e-SAF, with a capacity of 2,500 t/a PtL. The e-fuels will be comprised mainly of kerosene, using renewable feedstocks such as biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen.

The core aims of the TPP are de-risking the PtL route, supporting industrial scaling, gathering PtL application experience, as well as optimizing the PtL process and the fuel (Fuel Design), e.g. reducing non-CO2- effects.

For G2L™, this deployment represents not just validation in a research environment but a steppingstone towards widespread commercialization of PtL production. The demonstration plant is currently under construction starting operation in Q4 2027.

Powering forward

In 2025, Sasol and Topsoe signed a cooperation agreement with DLR and Griesemann (acting as EPC-contractor) to enable the construction, operation and R&D activities of DLR’s e-SAF research and demonstration plant at the Leuna Chemical Complex.

This step forward follows Topsoe and Sasol’s selection in 2024 to deliver G2L™ e-fuels technology for the TPP, integrated with Topsoe’s innovative eREACT™ technology and hydroprocessing technologies as well as with Sasol’s LTFT™ (low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch) technology.

Delivering on this vision will depend on scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), because it is projected to deliver more than half of the emission reductions required. Expanding SAF production is also crucially important as it is creating entirely new economic opportunities, particularly in regions where investment and innovation can have the greatest impact.

Policy momentum is already evident across continents. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in October 2023, sets clear targets for SAF integration, while the African Union adopted its Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025, reflecting the continent’s commitment to sustainable aviation growth. These regional policies contribute to the implementation of the ICAO-adopted Global Framework for SAF and cleaner energy sources, which provides a shared reference point for governments, industry, and financial partners.

Africa’s potential as a producer and user of SAF is attracting increasing attention. Current global production of SAF is concentrated in a few regions, but Africa’s diverse feedstock resources and growing aviation sector position it as a future leader in this space. The EU Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), launched in November 2025, further emphasizes the value of partnerships between Africa and Europe in meeting shared sustainability goals.

Recent investment commitments from the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the African Development Bank (AfDB) are reshaping the landscape for SAF and cleaner energy production in Africa. These developments reflect a broad, collaborative approach to advancing sustainable aviation both within Africa and globally.

EIB Global, the EIB Group’s international arm, has set a €100 billion investment target by 2027 to support sustainable infrastructure and energy projects worldwide. The STIP, adopted on 4 November 2025, recognizes international partnerships as essential for expanding access to renewable and low-carbon fuels, facilitating technology exchange, and supporting regulatory harmonization.

Since 2022, the ICAO ACT-SAF programme has been supporting countries as they develop and deploy SAF, providing technical assistance, capacity-building, and a platform for sharing best practices and online training series, as well as SAF feasibility and business implementation studies. The ICAO Finvest Hub facilitates connections between project developers, financial institutions (including multilateral development banks) and policymakers. By supporting project preparation and validation, Finvest Hub helps to accelerate the flow of capital to viable SAF and cleaner energy projects.

The integration of these ICAO programmes into the strategies of EIB, EBRD, and AfDB demonstrates a shared commitment to effective implementation, while ensuring the ICAO technical requirements such as CORSIA sustainability criteria are met. Combining investment with technical and institutional support ensures that SAF projects benefit from robust expertise, regulatory clarity, and access to global networks.

Developed in partnership with World Energy and shaped by a broad, global consultation, this new framework recognises long-term environmental attribute certificate (EAC) offtake agreements and provides a credible demand signal to support financing for SAF production

Geneva, Switzerland 4December 2025 – The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) has launched the Market Acceleration Indicator (MAI) Methodology and Module for pilot testing. This new framework is designed to support the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by providing credible recognition of long-term EAC offtake agreements. These agreements will be verified and reflected in the RSB Book & Claim System, allowing SAF buyers and producers to demonstrate robust demand signals that support investment and financial decision-making.

The MAI was developed in close collaboration with World Energy and refined through stakeholder consultations. It responds directly to one of the SAF market’s most persistent challenges: the lack of visible and credible demand that can be used to secure project financing. By turning long-term offtake commitments into clear, verifiable indicators, the MAI gives producers and buyers a powerful tool to strengthen financing negotiations, unlock additional capital for facility expansions, and attract new investors to emerging SAF projects.

The framework is now available for pilot testing. Offtake contracts that meet the MAI criteria can be registered in RSB’s system, with a Market Acceleration Indicator included in the book and claim retirement statement. This creates a clear and auditable claim of long-term commitment that can support financing, insetting, and additionality claims.

.

Credibility supported by a diverse stakeholder group

.

The MAI was shaped through expert input from across the aviation, energy, technology, finance, consulting and sustainability sectors. Stakeholder participants included:

Airbus, Airlines for America, AIT Worldwide Logistics, Arcadia eFuels, Center for Green Market Activation, Charm Industrial, Deloitte US, EC-Impact, Evident, EY, Future Energy Global Ltd, GE Aerospace, Gevo Inc., Green Finance Institute,, Iberia Express, International Air Transport Association (IATA), Jet Zero, Microsoft, MotionECO, MUFG, Nova Pangaea Technologies, RMI, S&P Global Commodity Insights and Twelve,

“Scaling sustainable aviation fuel is critical to meeting our climate goals and driving progress across the industry. The Market Acceleration Indicator provides a clear, credible signal of long-term demand, giving both seasoned and new buyers—along with producers and investors—the confidence to move faster and unlock the next wave of SAF growth.” – Lauren Kickham, Microsoft, Director, Markets and Investments.

.

From pilot concept to system integration

The MAI builds on the concept of translating long-term offtake agreements into transparent and verifiable claims. Similar to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) used in renewable energy markets, EAC offtake agreements help to define commercial additionality. The MAI formalises what constitutes a strong, bankable and additional demand signal.

Once the MAI has been piloted and consulted with RSB’s multi-stakeholder membership, it will form an integral part of the RSB Book & Claim Manual and the RSB Book & Claim Registry. It introduces the system’s first impact claim beyond carbon emissions, focusing on the role of demand in enabling new supply and supporting additionality in the SAF market.

.

A tool for greater confidence and impact

The MAI provides:

A clear and standardised structure for qualifying long-term SAF offtake agreements

Registry-based recognition of these agreements at the point of retirement

Support for investors evaluating demand certainty during financial due diligence

Additional transparency for buyers pursuing credible insetting strategies

“RSB’s new Market Acceleration Indicator provides a solution to the persistent challenge for renewable fuel developers to achieve bankability. Thanks to RSB, with sponsorship from World Energy and Microsoft, we have a contract framework and an emerging system to certify projects. This will be a game changer to answer the question of what is “bankable” and to accelerate lower cost capital for harder-to-abate climate solutions.” said Adam Klauber, Chief Sustainability Officer at World Energy.

“This tool gives SAF market actors a credible way to prove commitment and unlock finance,” said Julia Fidler, Executive Director of RSB. “It brings visibility to contracts that can drive the crucial next generation of SAF investment, including from emerging producers who will be essential to meeting growing SAF demand.”

.

Next steps

The Market Acceleration Indicator is now available for pilot use. Interested SAF producers, buyers and financiers are encouraged to engage with the RSB team to explore how the framework can support project development, investment readiness and credible demand recognition.

According to a report by Bain & Company1, 36% of B2B buyers would leave suppliers that don’t meet their sustainability expectations. It could be the difference between a customer choosing your business over a competitor’s – or worse, vice versa. Now is the time to review your supply chain practices to see where changes could be made. First up, shipping.

Benefits of offering sustainable shipping to B2B customers

Competitive advantage: Only 53% of B2B customers say the sustainable options they are offered by suppliers fully meet their expectations2. This means there is a huge opportunity for businesses to leverage a sustainable shipping strategy to attract these underserved prospects.

New business opportunities: Large corporations often require suppliers to meet specific sustainability standards to help them meet their ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) goals. Thus, sustainable shipping will set you apart in procurement processes.

Cost savings: Optimizing shipping routes, using eco-friendly packaging, and leveraging carbon offset programs can help B2B businesses to reduce costs over time. Furthermore, energy-efficient transportation often means lower fuel costs and fewer emissions.

B2B v B2C shipping

With the growth of B2B e-commerce, buyers are beginning to expect the same speed, convenience, and sustainability they’re used to in B2C transactions. The good news? Due to the nature of the B2B sector, it lends itself well to a sustainable shipping strategy:

Five strategies for eco-friendly shipping

Low-emissions B2B delivery is not only great for the environment, but also for long-term efficiency, brand reputation, and often cost savings. Here’s a practical breakdown of strategies you can leverage.

Switch to sustainable fuels

DHL’s GoGreen Plus is a groundbreaking service that helps businesses reduce the carbon emissions associated with their shipments through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from renewable sources such as vegetable oils, animal fats, waste products, and agricultural crops. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuels. The service can be selected for individual shipments, making it a flexible option for SMEs and e-commerce businesses with smaller cargo loads.

Think electric

Electrifying your delivery fleet can have a significant impact on your emissions. DHL has a target to electrify 66% of its last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030, an initiative that aligns with their wider strategy to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. When you partner with DHL Express, you're not only cutting the carbon from your final-mile deliveries – you’re showing your customers that fast, reliable service can be sustainable too.

Optimize routes and loads

AI-powered route planning software isn’t just smart – it’s a game-changer. It can help determine the most fuel- and time-efficient routes, allowing drivers to complete multiple deliveries in the quickest, most strategic order. This not only cuts down on fuel consumption and emissions but also improves delivery reliability.

Additionally, consolidate orders whenever possible – grouping deliveries by geographic location or customer helps maximize truck capacity and reduce the number of trips.

Reduce your failed delivery rate

Failed deliveries are a huge contributor to your business’s carbon footprint – after all, every unsuccessful attempt clocks up more vehicle emissions (and costs!)

DHL's On-Demand Delivery (ODD) service offers businesses a way to enhance the customer experience in B2B shipping by providing flexible delivery options and real-time tracking. By notifying recipients with delivery status updates and offering alternatives like rescheduling, redirecting, or collecting at a ServicePoint, businesses can reduce failed deliveries and improve customer satisfaction. Win win!

Measure, report and improve

Making these changes isn't enough on its own. It’s equally important to measure emissions and efficiency gains. You can leverage tools and software to calculate and report emissions per delivery, helping your business to set goals to reduce them. Be sure to promote your progress and share sustainability metrics with your clients – it could be the difference between them choosing your business over a competitor.

Sustainable shipping is becoming a key differentiator in B2B logistics. By investing in this area, your business can position itself as a responsible leader, meet evolving client expectations, and gain a competitive advantage. And it all starts with opening a DHL Express Business Account…

The new company plans to help aviation and maritime operators meet tightening global mandates from regulations such as ReFuelEU and organizations such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) by creating a U.S.–built, integrated clean‑fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, using domestic feedstock and workforce to produce carbon‑negative SAF and green methanol at commercial scale. Operationally, the combined company is expected to have two divisions: one focused on climate solutions that generate environmental assets, and one centered on clean fuels and products, with an initial focus on a previously announced Louisiana biomass-to-fuel facility.

The new platform’s anticipated SAF pathway, combined with DevvStream’s environmental‑asset capabilities, is aimed at reducing the cost burden that slows alternative fuel adoption today. Management expects to utilize federal incentives early while targeting cost‑competitiveness even without these incentives, supported by various co‑products produced during the SAF process. The company also plans to leverage early airline and maritime offtaker engagement. For investors, this reframes DevvStream from a micro‑cap services profile to a financeable, industrial fuels and credits business with long‑duration revenue potential and scalability. The new company is expected to be led by Carl Stanton as CEO and operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. Closing of the business combination is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2026.

“Aviation and maritime operators are facing some of the most ambitious decarbonization mandates globally, and most of them want to comply,” said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. “But today’s renewable fuel options remain materially more expensive than fossil fuels, which is slowing adoption and creating a practical barrier to transitioning at the pace regulators envision. This merger matters now because Southern’s technology, low-cost feedstock, and development platform, combined with DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities, are aimed at reducing that cost burden and enabling compliance at scale.”

“The State of Louisiana continues to serve as an important partner in the development of this initiative, and we expect that it will continue to support the project moving forward,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “We believe Louisiana’s combination of feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and experienced workforce creates a strong platform for long-term competitiveness, and we look forward to expanding our partnership with the State as we work to strengthen the nation’s energy leadership and supply global markets in a way that supports our expanding economy.”

“Our roadmap is designed to deliver clean fuels at industrial scale with a clear cost advantage, creating an advanced platform with the potential to effectively compete with China and the rest of the world,” said Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “Our biomass-waste-to-methanol-to-SAF pathway relies on proven technologies and integrated carbon capture, targeting one of the lowest lifecycle-carbon profiles in the market.”

Regarding the transaction, Stanton added, “We are excited that Southern has agreed to make an initial approximately $2 million PIPE investment in DevvStream at $15.58 per share. This recognizes DevvStream’s core business and the strategic role its carbon-monetization business plays in lowering effective costs for customers. This also recognizes Southern’s industrial scale and capital intensity while giving DevvStream shareholders a substantial stake in a larger, more diversified platform dedicated to the growing SAF and green methanol markets.”

Business Combination Highlights:

Ownership Structure: Upon closing, Southern equity holders are expected to own approximately 70% of the combined company, and DevvStream shareholders approximately 30%.

Initial Investment: Southern has completed an approximately $2.0 million investment in DevvStream through the acquisition of 128,370 shares at $15.58 per share (the PIPE).

Accelerated Development and Capital Commitment: To accelerate development, Southern has committed to invest significant pre-closing capital to launch front-end engineering for its first commercial plant.

The government’s SAF Mandate requires at least 10% of the UK aviation fuel mix to come from sustainable sources by 2030.
Lighthouse Green Fuels is the most advanced SAF project of its kind in the UK and is projected to deliver 11% of the SAF Mandate’s requirement.
Unlike first generation fuels, second-generation SAF uses non-edible, waste or residue-based feedstock, which avoids competition with food crops and supports environmental and ethical best practices.
“We’re committed to reindustrialising Teesside and ensuring that local workers can transition from fossil fuel-based industries to work in future-facing facilities like ours.”","The Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility in Teesside has launched its public consultation which will run until Tuesday, January 13, 2026.

Feedback from the public and other stakeholders will inform the final application, which will be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in Summer 2026 as a project of national significance requiring a DCO from the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero.

Located on a new site in the industrial area of Seal Sands, the £2bn LGF project will convert 1.5m tonnes of sustainably-sourced biomass into more than 180m litres of SAF, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

SAF is a safe, proven fuel already in use today. More will be needed to meet the UK government’s targets for net zero domestic flights by 2040, and for all flights to achieve net zero by 2050.

The government’s SAF Mandate requires at least 10% of the UK aviation fuel mix to come from sustainable sources by 2030.

Lighthouse Green Fuels is the most advanced SAF project of its kind in the UK and is projected to deliver 11% of the SAF Mandate’s requirement.

Following an earlier public consultation in May 2024, LGF has been updated to reflect technical advancements and strategic improvement:

– Site relocation: A new, enhanced site in Seal Sands, 500m from the previously-proposed Billingham site. The proposed facility offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

– Change in feedstock: The project will now use sustainably-sourced biomass, including forestry and agricultural residues, as its primary feedstock to achieve greater carbon savings. This replaces the previous proposal which intended to use municipal solid waste derived feedstock

It is also located even closer to Teesside’s carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network in future. This could mean CO2 savings from the SAF produced will more than double from 350,000 to 750,000 tonnes of per year.

LGF is expected to be the UK’s first commercial scale, second-generation SAF production facility.

Unlike first generation fuels, second-generation SAF uses non-edible, waste or residue-based feedstock, which avoids competition with food crops and supports environmental and ethical best practices.

This transformative project represents a £2 billion investment in the region and will:

– Create over 3,400 full-time equivalent jobs across the UK during operations, including up to 600 local jobs on Teesside

– Support £3.8 billion in UK-wide GVA and £750 million in Teesside GVA over 25 years

– Drive apprenticeships and skills development to upskill the local workforce and support long-term economic growth

Noaman Al Adhami, UK Country Head for Alfanar Projects, said: “Launching this consultation marks an important milestone in accelerating our world-leading SAF investment, positioning Teesside at the centre of the UK’s fast-growing synthetic fuels sector.

“Delivering for the local area is a central to LGF’s mission. Our project will generate significant economic benefits, creating up to 2,000 jobs during construction, 300 permanent roles once operational, and 3,400 supply chain positions nationwide.

By anchoring this investment in Louisiana, Southern aims to strengthen U.S. energy leadership with a “made in America” supply of advanced fuels that can serve both domestic and international markets, while supporting jobs and industrial activity in a state that has long been central to the nation’s energy economy.

The LCDA approval represents an important milestone in the conventional project‑finance process. It permits Southern, working through LCDA as a conduit issuer, to seek an allocation of “volume cap” from the Louisiana State Bond Commission in the same $402 million amount. The volume‑cap request is currently scheduled for the week of December 15, 2025. At this time, no allocation of volume cap has been made; the final step is expected to be an Executive Order from the Governor of Louisiana, which is currently anticipated in January 2026. Until an Executive Order allocating volume cap is issued and bonds are actually sold, the LCDA approval does not represent committed funding, but Southern and DevvStream believe it does demonstrate meaningful progress toward a conventional U.S. project‑finance structure for the planned biomass‑to‑fuel facility.

“We are grateful for the support we are receiving in Louisiana,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “The LCDA’s authorization is an important milestone for our planned Louisiana facility and for our broader effort to produce advanced fuels here in the United States. Louisiana’s combination of feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and an experienced energy workforce creates a strong platform for long‑term competitiveness. This step also aligns with federal objectives to strengthen domestic energy security, expand U.S. industrial capacity, and support responsible decarbonization of hard‑to‑serve sectors.”

“We believe that this is the kind of step investors want to see in U.S. project finance: conventional, process-driven, and de-risking,” said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. “It creates a potential non-recourse financing path to support scale while protecting equity value, subject to remaining approvals and a successful bond issuance.”

The revenue bonds contemplated under the LCDA resolution are expected to be limited obligations of the issuer payable solely from project‑related revenues and other pledged security, and not from the general funds of the State of Louisiana. Final terms, including interest rates, maturities, security, and covenants, will be determined at the time of any bond issuance and remain subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions.

Southern’s Louisiana fuels project and the LCDA authorization complement the previously announced business combination between DevvStream and Southern to form a new U.S.‑domiciled, Nasdaq‑listed company focused on producing low‑cost, carbon‑negative SAF and green methanol using domestic biomass, integrated carbon capture, and environmental‑asset capabilities.

The accelerator is intended to help project developers become investment-ready and overcome funding gaps for UK SAF projects, particularly in early-stage development.
“Early-stage projects face well-known financing barriers that prevent them from moving ahead,” said John Willis, founder of WSF.
The partners expect the accelerator to support a broader set of early-stage SAF projects across the country as the UK works to expand production capacity ahead of its 2030 and 2040 targets.
If implemented, that mechanism could provide long-term stability for UK SAF developers, potentially helping turn proposals into operating plants.","UK-based Willis Sustainable Fuels and the Green Finance Institute are launching an accelerator aimed at supporting early-stage UK sustainable aviation fuel developments and helping scale the country’s domestic production capacity.

The move is designed to speed up progress towards the government’s SAF mandate, with WSF’s own Teesside project among those expected to benefit as it targets a final investment decision in 2026.

The mandate requires that aviation fuel supplied in the UK comprises at least 10% SAF by 2030, increasing to 22% by 2040.

The accelerator is intended to help project developers become investment-ready and overcome funding gaps for UK SAF projects, particularly in early-stage development.

“Early-stage projects face well-known financing barriers that prevent them from moving ahead,” said John Willis, founder of WSF. “By working with the Green Finance Institute on this accelerator, we want to break down those barriers … and move closer to delivering the domestic SAF production the UK needs.”

The programme will provide technical, financial and commercial support to UK SAF developers through a structured process designed to improve investment readiness. Both partners say the aim is to establish a reliable pipeline of investable domestic projects that can help meet long-term demand.

WSF’s own facility at Wilton International in Teesside is planned as a second-generation SAF plant that will convert biogenic waste into SAF using advanced gasification and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.

The project is targeting production of around 14,000 tonnes of fuel per year once fully operational.

“There is strong investor appetite for sustainable aviation fuel, but many UK projects are not yet in a position to access the capital they need to scale,” said Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, Chief Executive of the Green Finance Institute.

“This accelerator will help bridge that gap by supporting developers through the early stages of project development and improving their ability to attract finance.”

WSF believes its Teesside plant demonstrates the potential for a regional SAF industry built on domestic feedstock and industrial infrastructure.

“With the right support and access to finance, the UK can build a world-leading SAF industry that creates jobs, supports regional development, and reduces the aviation sector’s dependence on fossil fuels,” said Willis.

The partners expect the accelerator to support a broader set of early-stage SAF projects across the country as the UK works to expand production capacity ahead of its 2030 and 2040 targets.

The push from WSF and Green Finance Institute comes as the UK Government, via the Department for Transport (DfT), is advancing plans to underpin SAF investment with new support mechanisms.

In October 2025 the DfT opened a public consultation on a proposed levy-funded revenue certainty mechanism for SAF, designed to reduce financial risk for producers and help bring more SAF plants to final investment.

If implemented, that mechanism could provide long-term stability for UK SAF developers, potentially helping turn proposals into operating plants.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-12-04 10:59:04.941036

As part of the strategy, the Commission will look at possibilities for regulatory simplification and at a successor to the two existing Horizon Europe partnerships for aviation-related research and innovation: the Clean Aviation and Sesar joint undertakings.
Clean Aviation and Sesar are set to receive €1.7 billion and €600 million respectively from the Commission under the current programme.
Currently, the selection criteria and application process are ill-suited to the needs of innovative aviation technologies and sustainable aviation fuel production, it says.
The Commission plans to provide targeted funding for dual-use innovation with civil and military potential to make European technologies more competitive and interoperable.","The European Commission is working on a dedicated industrial strategy for the aviation sector, which would set out the direction of future EU research and innovation funding.

The move was confirmed by Filip Cornelis, director for aviation at the Commission’s transport directorate, after transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas backed industry moves in the same direction.

“I believe that, indeed, it is now the time for the European Union to review its position towards its aeronautics and aviation industries and the airlines,” Tzitzikostas said at the annual conference of the Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) on December 2. Any strategy should be designed and implemented with industry, he added.

As part of the strategy, the Commission will look at possibilities for regulatory simplification and at a successor to the two existing Horizon Europe partnerships for aviation-related research and innovation: the Clean Aviation and Sesar joint undertakings.

Cornelis said the Commission would need “a lot of input from the industry” on its requirements and expectations for joint undertakings over the next decade, a timescale dictated by the EU’s next Multiannual Financial Framework, which runs to the end of 2034.

It’s currently unclear whether Clean Aviation and Sesar will continue as separate partnerships or merge into one. The Commission’s proposal for the post-2027 Horizon Europe programme lists “smart and clean aviation” and “automated air traffic management,” which are the missions of the current joint undertakings, as one possible “moonshot” project for which the EU could provide funding from research to development and deployment.

Call for doubled research budget

Europe is a global leader in aviation, representing around 40% of the global civil aeronautics market, according to ASD. But a clear strategy is needed to ensure Europe retains its position amid growing competition from the US and China, industry argues.

“We shouldn’t take this leadership for granted,” said Micael Johansson, ASD president and chief executive of Saab, at the conference. “The crisis in other sectors, like the automotive sector, shows that even an innovative and flourishing industry can easily be put at risk.”

The ASD’s own strategy, presented at the conference, calls for at least a doubling of EU funding for civil aviation research in the next long-term EU budget.

It also repeats a request from the joint undertakings for EU research funding worth €5.3 billion for aircraft technologies and €700 million for air traffic management technologies in the next Horizon Europe programme. Clean Aviation and Sesar are set to receive €1.7 billion and €600 million respectively from the Commission under the current programme.

Meanwhile, the industry wants at least 20-25% of the Innovation Fund, which is funded by EU Emissions Trading System revenues, to be dedicated to civil aviation decarbonisation efforts. Currently, the selection criteria and application process are ill-suited to the needs of innovative aviation technologies and sustainable aviation fuel production, it says.

Focus on dual use

It’s not just about civil aviation. The Commission plans to provide targeted funding for dual-use innovation with civil and military potential to make European technologies more competitive and interoperable.

“As the European Defence Fund and other EU instruments continue to expand, the convergence between civil aeronautics, defence, space and security becomes increasingly evident,” Tzitzikostas said.

He pointed to the growing importance of drones, unmanned systems and autonomous technologies. “They strengthen surveillance, logistics, environmental protection, emergency response and tactical operations,” he said. This will require “substantial investment, regulation that keeps pace with innovation, and above all, industrial capacity.”

He went on to underline the need for predictable, harmonised and innovation-friendly rules for AI-based systems, from design and manufacturing to maintenance and monitoring. “If Europe can combine technological excellence with a robust safety culture, AI can become a powerful accelerator of our industrial competitiveness,” he said.

With EU support and coordinated national policies that help ensure European innovation reaches industrial scale quickly, Europe can become a leader in advanced drone and counter-drone systems, Tzitzikostas said. “This is fully understood at the European level [. . .] Concrete actions will follow.”

While European militaries rely heavily on US technologies, Europe does have strengths, notably as a result of its integrated aerospace and defence ecosystem. That means “common technologies, common teams, common engineering services and design offices, but also common platforms and common suppliers,” said Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury.

“That’s something we have probably done better than others. In the US, for instance, there is an incredible defence sector, but it’s very specific,” he told the conference.

While dual use is already an industrial reality in Europe, “at political and government level, I still see a lot of separation between those two worlds,” said Cornelis, from the Commission.

About the Green Finance Institute Established in 2019, the Green Finance Institute (GFI) is an independent advisor to governments and investors.","LONDON, UK, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Willis Sustainable Fuels UK Limited (""WSF""), a subsidiary of Willis Lease Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: WLFC) (""WLFC"") and the Green Finance Institute (""GFI""), an independent advisor to governments and investors, have announced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Project Accelerator to bring WSF's pioneering SAF project at Wilton International in Teesside to Final Investment Decision (FID) and establish a replicable blueprint for financing new homegrown transition projects.

Since the start of 2025, the UK's SAF mandate requires increasing levels of SAF in the UK's jet fuel supply to reach 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.1 Under the mandate, the economic, energy-security and innovation benefits of expanding domestic SAF production are compelling. This policy stability provides a strong, long-term demand signal to accelerate SAF growth, but the challenge remains in reaching bankability.

WSF's Teesside project is one of the UK's most advanced second-generation SAF projects, using existing, proven technology to make SAF from waste. Targeting 14,000 tonnes of production per year, the project supports national energy security, by reducing reliance on imported fuels and anchors new green-industry jobs in the Northeast, by converting mainly UK biomethane into next-generation jet fuel. This project has been funded £7.6 million through two rounds of the UK Government's Advanced Fuels Fund.

Before committing capital to transactions in this nascent sector, financiers need to address risks including technology performance, feedstock, and price/revenue certainty. While the UK mandate provides strong long-term demand certainty, developers need to assemble a complex mix of public and private de-risking tools to meet these requirements.

With a track record of mobilising £77 billion in committed capital to drive the transition and as a key adviser in shaping the UK's SAF mandate, GFI's SAF programme will focus on helping leading projects reach FID in 2026. The ""accelerator"" platform is designed to remove financing barriers and develop solutions that attract private sector investment into pioneering projects.

Key objectives of the accelerator include:

Developing innovative financing and de-risking strategies for SAF infrastructure.

Identifying regulatory and financial gaps that, if addressed, could enable advanced SAF projects to reach FID and deliver volumes aligned with the UK SAF Mandate.

Convening private- and public-sector market participants to develop solutions that address bankability gaps.

Establishing a replicable model for turning policy ambition into built, investable clean-energy infrastructure as a number of UK projects seek to reach FID in the coming year.

""This partnership with the GFI is a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK,"" said Dr. Amy Ruddock, Director, Willis Sustainable Fuels. ""Together, we aim to create a blueprint for financing solutions that will accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.""

""Our collaboration with WSF exemplifies how strategic partnerships across the value chain can unlock investment for innovative technologies,"" said Dr. Rhian-Mari Thomas, CEO at GFI. ""By launching this accelerator approach, we aim to scale SAF production to support the UK's ambitions for a homegrown SAF industry.""

Both organisations will also collaborate on communicating best practice and lessons learned from this process to raise visibility for SAF financing solutions within the UK's transition finance ecosystem.

Thermal management may be one of the toughest challenges in sustainable aviation, but it’s also one of the most rewarding.","The ambition to achieve net-zero emissions is driving significant change in aerospace – from propulsion systems and energy sources to the very materials and methods used to build aircraft. As the industry races to decarbonize, additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a transformative technology enabling that shift.

At Conflux Technology, we see AM not only as a new way to manufacture components, but as a fundamental enabler of smarter, lighter, and more sustainable flight. Our work across multiple collaborations – including projects with Airbus, Honeywell’s TheMa4HERA consortium, and AMSL Aero in the last year alone – demonstrate how AM is being used to tackle one of aerospace’s biggest technical barriers to sustainability: thermal management.

Why thermal management matters for sustainable aviation

Whether powered by hydrogen fuel cells, hybrid-electric systems, sustainable aviation fuel or battery packs, next-generation aircraft generate significant amounts of heat. Managing that heat safely and efficiently, without adding unnecessary weight or complexity, is a challenge that directly affects the viability of sustainable aviation.

Effective thermal management is critical because excessive heat can compromise both performance and safety. In hydrogen fuel cell systems, overheating can reduce efficiency and shorten component lifespan, while in battery- or hybrid-electric configurations, unmanaged heat can lead to reduced energy density, faster degradation, or even safety risks. Conventional heat exchangers are often limited by design constraints, forcing trade-offs between weight, size, and thermal performance. Additive manufacturing removes these limits, enabling intricate geometries and optimized flow paths that ensure efficient cooling without adding unnecessary weight or complexity.

The design freedoms of additive manufacturing make a critical difference. With AM, we can create lightweight, high-performance heat exchangers that would be impossible to produce using conventional methods. Our expertise allows us to achieve exceptionally thin walls and apply tailored de-powdering strategies for each part, pushing the technology to its limits. The result is components that can be precisely optimized for each system’s operating conditions, maximizing thermal efficiency and heat transfer while minimizing material use.

In essence, AM allows engineers to design for performance, not for process, and that’s key to advancing the technologies that will power cleaner flight.

From hydrogen to hybrid: collaboration in action

Conflux’s collaborations illustrate how AM is being applied to real-world sustainability challenges across the aerospace spectrum.

With Airbus, we’re developing heat exchangers for the ZEROe program that feature intricate internal channels optimized for hydrogen fuel cell cooling. These geometries, achievable only through AM, allow efficient heat transfer while keeping weight to a minimum. In the TheMa4HERA consortium, we’re designing scalable heat exchangers for hybrid-electric regional aircraft, while also providing shared insights from 28 partners across Europe to maximize energy efficiency and minimize material use.

Our partnership with AMSL Aero brings these principles to regional air mobility. Together we’re developing an optimized hydrogen fuel cell cooling system for Vertiia, AMSL’s long-range zero-emissions VTOL aircraft. The heat exchangers we’ve designed balance weight, volume, and aerodynamic performance to support flight distances of up to 1000 kilometers – an unprecedented range for a hydrogen-electric VTOL.

Each of these projects underscores a shared vision: that innovation through collaboration is essential to creating a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

The broader impact: sustainability beyond propulsion

While thermal management is our business, the sustainability potential of AM extends beyond individual components.

AM enables localized production, reduced material waste, and shorter supply chains –all vital to minimizing the environmental footprint of aircraft development. It also supports rapid iteration and digital validation, meaning better designs can be tested and refined faster, without the need for costly tooling or excess material.

Beyond efficiency, AM can contribute to circularity: parts can be remanufactured, repaired, or redesigned without discarding entire assemblies, extending their useful life and reducing resource consumption. Localized, on-demand production not only lowers carbon emissions from transport but also strengthens supply chain resilience, making aircraft development more adaptable and sustainable. Economically, faster iteration and reduced waste can lower costs for manufacturers and operators, creating a model where environmental responsibility and commercial viability reinforce each other.

The result is a new manufacturing paradigm where performance, efficiency, and sustainability are no longer competing priorities, they’re part of the same design process.

Looking ahead

As aerospace companies around the world accelerate toward their 2030 and 2050 sustainability targets, additive manufacturing is proving to be more than an engineering advantage: it’s a strategic one.

Thermal management may be one of the toughest challenges in sustainable aviation, but it’s also one of the most rewarding. Every breakthrough brings the industry one step closer to a cleaner, more efficient, and more connected future for flight, unlocking new possibilities for hydrogen, hybrid-electric, and other next-generation propulsion systems that will redefine how we travel.

Southern Energy Renewables has a flagship Louisiana-based project. It plans to utilise regional wood-waste biomass to deliver green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“The State of Louisiana continues to serve as an important partner in the development of this initiative, and we expect that it will continue to support the project moving forward,” said Jay Patel, CEO of Southern Energy Renewables.

The new combined company will create an integrated clean-fuels platform using domestic feedstock. This means it can produce carbon-negative SAF and green methanol on a commercial scale. The goal is to help aviation and maritime operators meet tightening global mandates such as ReFuelEU.

“Aviation and maritime operators are facing some of the most ambitious decarbonisation mandates globally,” said Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream. “But today’s renewable fuel options remain materially more expensive than fossil fuels, which is slowing adoption.

“This merger matters now because Southern’s technology, low-cost feedstock, and development platform, combined with DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities, are aimed at reducing that cost burden and enabling compliance at scale.”

The company will have two operational divisions. The first focuses on climate solutions, while the other develops clean fuels and products.

Management expects to use federal incentives early, and target cost-competitiveness. The company also wants to leverage early airline offtake engagement, reframing alternative fuels to have long-duration revenue potential and scalability.

“Our roadmap is designed to deliver clean fuels at industrial scale with a clear cost advantage, creating an advanced platform with the potential to effectively compete with China and the rest of the world,” said Nevin Smalls, chief strategy officer of Southern Energy Renewables.

“Our biomass-waste-to-methanol-to-SAF pathway relies on proven technologies and integrated carbon capture, targeting one of the lowest lifecycle-carbon profiles in the market.”

The 8th ASEAN Energy Outlook 2023–2050 has acknowledged biofuels’ importance for enhancing energy security and meeting climate objectives. Biodiesel and bioethanol are used in the transportation sector.

The region’s biofuel ambition also promises to benefit rural economies as it can potentially create new markets, jobs, and income streams in agricultural areas, according to a new report, Biofuel Market Potential for Regional Cooperation in ASEAN. The report was published by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN East Asia (ERIA) and the ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE).

Rural economies in BIMP-EAGA stand to benefit, as Kalimantan, Sabah, Sarawak, and Mindanao already produce biofuel feedstocks, such as sugarcane, cassava, palm oil, coconut, and corn.

However, stronger regional coordination is needed to address fragmented national biofuel efforts and build a cohesive market that delivers cheaper, greener fuel, while positioning ASEAN as a global leader in advanced biofuels. The lack of a unified approach has led to inefficiencies and hindered the development of a cohesive biofuel industry. Having harmonized standards and shared infrastructure is crucial to unlocking the region’s biofuel potential.

According to the report, diverting just 1 billion liters of biofuel trade to within ASEAN can cut the region’s fuel bill by $100 million to $150 million annually and leverage up to $300 million in new investments, while supporting over 5,000 jobs. ASEAN also stands to retain up to $800 million in economic value.

The region’s biofuel demand is expected to surge by 2050, with bioethanol potentially reaching 20 billion to 22 billion liters, biodiesel approaching 40 billion liters, and sustainable aviation fuel to 12 billion–13 billion liters. This growth currently relies heavily on first-generation feedstock like palm oil, sugarcane, and cassava, with sustainable aviation fuel likely competing for resources like used cooking oil and palm byproducts.

Billions in investments are needed though to meet the demand as it entails investing in shared infrastructure, scaling sustainable feedstock supply, and fostering technology transfer.

Well-established

In a 2024 report, the International Energy Agency said biofuels are already well-established in Southeast Asia, meeting nearly 10% of road transport energy demand—twice the global average.

As of 2020, five member states have used biodiesel in their energy mix: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam have also used bioethanol.

Enhancing cooperation on biofuel though can be a challenge as ASEAN members have distinct biofuel landscapes, national priorities, and resources, according to the ERIA–ACE report.

As the world's largest biodiesel producer, Indonesia has set ambitious domestic mandates. It leverages on its vast palm oil resources covering 16.8 million hectares, predominantly in Sumatra and Kalimantan. It is shifting to higher biofuel blends, from B35 to B40/B50, and has set more ambitious targets for sustainable aviation fuel.

Malaysia, another major palm oil producer, has established biodiesel programs (B10/B20 with B30 ambitions) serving both domestic and export markets. It is actively developing large-scale sustainable aviation fuel and hydro-treated vegetable oil production facilities. Geographically, Malaysia's major biodiesel production capacity is distributed in Sabah, Johor, Selangor, and Pahang; Sarawak and Perak have a smaller share.

Thailand is ASEAN's leading bioethanol producer, primarily serving its strong domestic E10/E20 gasohol market. It has significant palm oil-based biodiesel capacity largely for domestic self-sufficiency, with flexible blending mandates. It is also an emerging player in sustainable aviation fuel.

The Philippines has a long-standing E10 ethanol mandate but faces feedstock challenges leading to high import reliance. Its biodiesel (coconut methyl ester) sector envisions catering to domestic mandates (B2 gradually increasing to B5). Luzon accounts for bulk of production capacity at 415 million liters per year and Mindanao 199.6 million liters per year.

Viet Nam maintains an E5 ethanol mandate with cassava as a key feedstock, but it faces uptake and production challenges. Its biodiesel program has seen limited adoption, and sustainable aviation fuel use currently relies on imports.

Singapore strategically focuses on being a global hub for advanced biofuel trading and refining, particularly sustainable aviation fuel (with mandates starting at 1% in 2026) and marine biofuels.

Other ASEAN members are in earlier stages of biofuel policy development.

Opportunity for intraregional trade

ASEAN is projected to maintain a biodiesel production surplus up to 2030, primarily driven by the large output from Indonesia and Malaysia, which consistently exceeds their substantial domestic demands. This surplus presents a clear opportunity for intraregional trade.

Conversely, the region faces a persistent and potentially widening bioethanol deficit. While Thailand is a major producer meeting its own needs, the overall regional demand, significantly influenced by countries like the Philippines with high import dependency, is expected to outpace the combined production capacity of key ASEAN producers. This highlights a structural imbalance where some nations have excess biodiesel capacity and others a critical need for ethanol.

The existing complementarities within ASEAN—surplus production in some nations and deficits or higher-cost domestic production in others—create a strong case for enhancing intra-ASEAN biofuel and feedstock trade.

Thailand's potential ethanol surplus could competitively meet the Philippines' growing E20 needs, saving costs and redirecting expenditure within ASEAN. Similarly, palm biodiesel from Indonesia or Malaysia could offer a more cost-effective solution for countries like the Philippines to achieve higher biodiesel blend rates compared to relying solely on more expensive local feedstock like coconut oil. Beyond finished fuels, facilitating intra-ASEAN trade in feedstock could further optimize regional production and energy security.

Biofuel task force and structural priorities

The ERIA–ACE report has recommended the creation of a task force that would serve as the primary operational vehicle to advance the region’s biofuel ambition. The task force will ensure regional collaboration and influence policymaking at the highest levels.

Another priority is to implement a comprehensive ASEAN sustainability certification and carbon accounting framework that will be recognized by all member countries.

Having a regional biofuel infrastructure and logistics network should also be prioritized to integrate ASEAN biofuel markets physically. Having such a network will reduce logistics costs for intra-ASEAN biofuel trade.

Other priorities include fully implementing a regional biofuel roadmap that takes into account technological advancements, market changes, and evolving national and/or regional priorities; integrating biofuels mandates with national and regional climate and energy transition policies; and promoting pilots for advanced biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel to build regional experience with next-generation technologies.",https://bimp-eaga.asia/sites/default/files/favicon_3.ico,N,,2025-12-04 05:56:19.084794

co-processed low-carbon intensity diesel, co-processed low-carbon intensity gasoline).","Purpose

On September 5, 2025, the Government of Canada announced its intent to make targeted amendments to the Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) to strengthen the resiliency and support the development of Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector, while maintaining the Regulations’ primary focus on lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and transitioning to a low carbon economy.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is publishing this Discussion Paper to invite views and information related to these targeted amendments. The comment period will close January 15, 2026. Information on how to submit comments is provided at the end of the paper.

Context

The Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel (i.e. primary suppliers) to reduce the life cycle carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel produced and imported for use in Canada, thereby reducing GHG emissions. A life cycle approach considers the GHG emissions involved in multiple stages of the fuel’s production process, from feedstock extraction or cultivation to fuel combustion. Reduction requirements for primary suppliers took effect as of July 1, 2023. The CFR is an important part of Canada’s climate competitiveness strategy -- reducing emissions, accelerating the use of clean technologies and fuels, and supporting sustainable jobs in a diversified economy. It is the main federal measure creating demand for clean fuels in the Canadian market and complements the various clean fuel policies and regulations in the provinces and territories.

The CFR establishes a credit market, where each credit represents a life cycle emission reduction of one tonne of CO2e. Regulated parties meet their obligations via credits which they create themselves or buy on the CFR credit market. Credits can be created by:

compliance category 1 – undertaking projects that reduce the life cycle carbon intensity of liquid fossil fuels (e.g. carbon capture and storage, renewable electricity, co-processing)

compliance category 2 – supplying low-carbon intensity fuels (e.g. ethanol, biodiesel)

compliance category 3 – supplying fuel or energy to advanced vehicle technology (e.g. electricity or hydrogen in vehicles)

The majority of credits created to-date under the CFR come from the supply of low-carbon intensity fuelsFootnote 1. While an important share of these credits comes from fuel produced in Canada, Canada does not currently produce enough low-carbon intensity fuels to meet the total domestic demand. As such, a large share of CFR credits for low-carbon intensity fuel supply come from imports, mostly from the United States (US) (Annex 1)Footnote 2.

Canada’s liquid low-carbon intensity fuel production is split between a relatively small number of facilities (see Annex 2 for more information on the sector). There are twelve ethanol facilities, six biodiesel facilities and three renewable diesel facilities, including one that focuses mainly on exports. Six refineries have indicated interest in co-processing low-carbon feedstock along with crude oil by 2030, with some of them already creating credits under the CFR. There are currently 48 Canadian facilities registered under the CFR, which produce biogas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen or renewable propane. In 2024, 1.3% of the credits created were for low-carbon-intensity gaseous fuels. Domestic feedstocks are used to produce about 41-66% of Canadian liquid low-carbon intensity fuels used to create CFR credits. For canola specifically, 90% of domestically produced biomass-based diesel was produced from Canadian canola. Demand for ethanol and biomass-based diesel has grown significantly over recent years and is projected to continue growing out to 2030.

Canadian biofuel producers, and their supply chains, are facing competitiveness and trade challenges, which are putting their operations at risk. This could result in less supply of domestic low-carbon intensity fuels, putting future emission reductions at risk, deepening Canada’s reliance on imports, including from the US, and dampening demand for domestic agricultural feedstocks like canola.

In this context, the Government of Canada announced (Sept. 5, 2025) it will make targeted amendments to the CFR to strengthen the resiliency and support the development of Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector, while maintaining the Regulations’ primary focus on lowering GHG emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The targeted amendments will ensure the Canadian market is able to continue supplying material and reliable quantities of low-carbon intensity fuels. This will help to ensure the CFR can continue to deliver emission reductions. By creating more demand for Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels, the targeted amendments will support Canada’s agriculture producers – such as canola – whose crops are a key feedstock in the production of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels.

The targeted CFR amendments will complement Canada’s recently announced Biofuels Production Incentive, which will provide over $372 million over two years to support the stability and resiliency of domestic producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel. The Government will also work closely with provinces and territories to explore a more comprehensive approach to growing the domestic low-carbon fuel sector and ensuring its longer-term competitiveness.

A number of provinces have also taken action. In February 2025, the Government of British Columbia published amendments to their Low Carbon Fuel Standard, requiring a minimum percentage of renewable fuels to be from domestically produced biofuel (i.e. 8% Canadian renewable content in diesel, starting April 1, 2025; 5% Canadian renewable content in gasoline, starting January 1, 2026). On August 7, 2025, the Government of Ontario finalized regulatory amendments mandating that at least 75% of the renewable content required in diesel fuel and 64% of the renewable content required in gasoline be produced in Canada. Quebec is the only province with a low-carbon fuel production tax credit. In 2024, the Government of Quebec modified the credit to ensure low-carbon intensity fuel facilities in Quebec could remain competitive.

CFR amendments

This paper outlines two regulatory options to achieve this goal, however ECCC welcomes input on other design options and considerations.

Regulatory approach

Minimum domestic content approach

The CFR currently requires primary suppliers to incorporate a minimum of 5% low-carbon intensity fuel content in the total volume of gasoline produced and imported for use in Canada, and 2% in diesel (sections 6 and 7 of the Regulations). Under this approach, the volumetric requirements of the CFR could be amended to require that a minimum volumetric requirement be met with low-carbon intensity fuel produced in Canada. Implemented similarly to the volumetric requirements currently set in the CFR, a minimum volume of domestic low-carbon intensity fuel content could be set for gasoline and for diesel. This approach would require primary suppliers to demonstrate that low-carbon intensity fuels produced in Canada represent a certain percentage of their regulated volume of gasoline and diesel.

A minimum content approach could guarantee a market for a significant portion of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuel production while allowing the remaining demand to be met with imports. By creating more demand for Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels, the targeted amendments will support Canada’s agriculture producers, whose crops are a key feedstock in the production of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels.

Minimum domestic content requirements would be set high enough to provide a market for a significant portion of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuel production. However, the requirements would need to provide some flexibility to account for unforeseen circumstances (e.g. closure of a low-carbon intensity fuel production facility), regional considerations and unequal access to low-carbon intensity fuels across Canada.

Key questions on the regulatory approach

What design would best meet the objective of the amendments:

a minimum domestic content, a credit multiplier, or another potential design?

Should a combination of options be used?

Should the targeted amendment be a temporary measure or longer-term?

If a minimum domestic content approach is recommended, should the requirements remain stable or increase over time?

Under a minimum domestic content approach, what percentage of the respective gasoline and diesel CFR regulated volumes is recommended?

Are there special circumstances, cases or exceptions that should be taken into consideration if a minimum domestic content approach is taken?

Considering the different costs and challenges for each type of fuel, if a credit multiplier approach is taken, should there be a differentiated rate set for each type of domestic low-carbon intensity fuel? If so, what multiplication rate is recommended for each type of fuel?

If a credit multiplier approach is taken, how could it be designed to prevent it from creating an oversupply of credits or depressing the credit price?

Are there other elements, data or information that should be considered?

Scope

A number of different types of low-carbon intensity fuels are produced in Canada and are eligible for credit creation under the CFR.

Under the CFR, credits for liquid low-carbon fuels are created predominantly via Compliance Category 2 (i.e. sections 94-97 of the CFR). Liquid low-carbon intensity fuels for which credits have been created include ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel and pyrolysis oil. Under Compliance Category 1, specific to low-carbon intensity fuels, credits can also be created for co-processing low-carbon intensity feedstocks along with crude oil at refineries, which requires the use of a Quantification Method, a project application and the recognition of the co-processing project. While the number of credits created based on the production of co-processed fuels in 2024 was a small portion of the total number credits created that year, the production of co-processed fuels at refineries has the potential to increase significantly in future years. This, in turn, would be expected to increase the demand for low-carbon intensity fuel feedstock such as canola oil.

Credits can be created in respect of gaseous low-carbon intensity fuels produced and imported for use in Canada (i.e. biogas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen, renewable propane). These gaseous credits can be used to satisfy up to 10% of a primary supplier’s annual reduction requirements.

ECCC is seeking input on which fuels should be in scope for the targeted amendments.

Key questions on scope

Which fuels should be in scope?

What considerations should inform which fuels would be in scope?

Special circumstances and exemptions

Depending on the design, it may be relevant to consider the regional variations and different circumstances of certain primary suppliers, such as exclusive importers.

If we take the example of minimum domestic content requirements, a minimum threshold for the obligated gasoline and diesel pools could be set to exempt lower volume suppliers. Alternatively, another option could be to calculate the minimum domestic content requirements as a function of the size of a primary supplier’s obligated poolFootnote 3 .

Depending on the approach taken, ECCC may also consider further compliance flexibility as part of the targeted amendments. For example, a mechanism to mitigate potential risks to fuel supply could be considered in a scenario where there was insufficient domestic low-carbon intensity fuel supply to comply with the CFR requirements due to unforeseen circumstances.

Key questions on special circumstances & exemptions

If minimum domestic content requirement or other mandatory requirements are set, should the requirement be the same for all primary suppliers?

Are there specific criteria, considerations or circumstances that could justify setting different requirements that should be taken into account?

Should the requirements be set only above a minimum volume threshold (i.e. domestic requirements would only apply to primary suppliers who supply more than a minimum amount of gasoline or diesel)?

If so, what threshold do you recommend?

Should the requirements be progressive and / or be calculated as a function of the size of the primary supplier’s obligated pool (e.g. lower percentage of domestic content requirement for small pool vs higher percentage of domestic content requirement for big pool)?

Should a special clause or mechanism be integrated in the amendments to provide additional flexibility in the case where the domestic low-carbon intensity fuel supply is insufficient to meet the minimum domestic content requirement?

How should this be designed?

Maintaining focus on emission reductions and transition to a low-carbon economy

The primary objectives of the CFR are to reduce GHG emissions by reducing the lifecycle carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel produced and imported for use in Canada, and transition to a low-carbon economy. The targeted amendment will maintain these primary objectives. To do so:

the targeted amendment will ensure the Canadian market is able to continue supplying material and reliable quantities of low-carbon intensity fuel and can continue to deliver significant emission reductions

credits for all low-carbon intensity fuel will continue to be created based on the life cycle carbon intensity determined using the Fuel LCA Model to reward fuels with the lowest carbon intensity

low-carbon intensity fuels (those derived from biomass) will continue to be subjected to the land use and biodiversity criteria of the CFR

Information requested

ECCC is gathering data and undertaking analysis to ensure that the targeted amendments will support Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector while maintaining the Regulations’ primary focus on lowering carbon emissions. To support this, ECCC invites stakeholders with access to relevant information and data to share this with ECCC, including the data and inputs outlined below.

Additional input requested

For primary suppliers, what are your constraints to obtaining Canadian-made low-carbon intensity fuel (e.g. transport, contracts, geographical concerns, specific constraints related to blending, etc.)?

What percentage of the CFR regulated volumes for gasoline and diesel do you think is achievable and why?

If physically procuring domestic low-carbon fuel is challenging, are there constraints to obtaining the credits created based on the production of domestic low-carbon fuels from the credit market instead?

If so, what are these?

For low-carbon intensity fuel producers, what measures would be sufficient to ensure you can continue to produce or stay competitive?

Recognizing this may vary by approach, how much time would you need after the publication of the amendments in Canada Gazette, Part II to implement the changes required in the amendments?

Do you have any other information or considerations to support the development of these targeted amendments to the CFR?

Next steps

The Government of Canada plans to move quickly to advance these amendments.

Your input is important as ECCC’s develops this amendment. Please submit your written comments on the above key considerations and questions by January 15, 2026.

Comments may be submitted by email to the following address:

Lisa Ryan, Acting Executive Director, Low Carbon Fuels Division

Email: cfsncp@ec.gc.ca

Building on the feedback received on this paper and through further consultations, ECCC will publish draft amendments in Canada Gazette, Part I. Only comments related to these targeted amendments will be considered at this time.

As a next step in the Government’s commitment to further examine concerns raised about potential compliance risks related to imported low carbon fuel feedstocks used for the CFR, including used cooking oil (UCO), the Government will assess the verification and certification requirements in other jurisdictions, as well as best practices regarding traceability, tracking, and data management across feedstock supply chains. ECCC welcomes input on other actions or steps relating to the treatment of imported low carbon fuel feedstocks, including UCO.

Annex II - Snapshot of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuel sector

Canada’s low-carbon intensity fuel production is split between a relatively small number of facilities.

**Statistic Canada, Table 25-10-0081-01

*** Canadian Gas Association, Innovation Hub. Facilities in operation in 2025 or before. The following energy density were used for conversion: 38 MJ/m3.

Ethanol

Ethanol represents Canada’s largest volume of low-carbon intensity fuel production, with a capacity of 1,869 ML across 12 facilities. Canada does not currently produce enough ethanol to meet the total domestic demand; 38% of the volume of ethanol used to create credits in 2024 was produced in Canada. While Canada’s ethanol production has been stable in recent years, Canadian ethanol sector has indicated it may start experiencing competitiveness problems in the near term. With policy changes passed in summer 2025 in the US, US-produced ethanol exported to Canada will now be eligible to receive US tax incentives, potentially making it harder for Canadian producers trying to compete on the Canadian market.

Biodiesel

Canada has six biodiesel facilities and sufficient domestic biodiesel production capacity to meet the current total domestic demand. However, until 2024, most of the biodiesel produced in Canada was exported to United States and was eligible to benefit from the now cancelled US Blender’s Tax Credit, where both biodiesel and renewable diesel imported into and produced in United States received a US$1 per gallon tax. Therefore, most of the biodiesel used in Canada was imported. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) replaced the Blender's Tax Credit with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit in 2025, which only applies to biodiesel and renewable diesel produced in United States, regardless of whether the fuel is used in United[LR2] [DA3] [EW4] States. The IRA tax credit made it virtually impossible for Canadian production to compete on the US or Canadian market, resulting in a temporary shut-down of several facilities.

However, recent actions taken by Provinces are starting to have an impact. As a result of the production tax credit in Quebec and the recent regulatory amendments in British Columbia and Ontario, some biodiesel facilities are resuming production. In the second quarter of 2025, four biodiesel facilities produced biodiesel in Canada and created CFR credits.

Renewable diesel

Canada’s renewable diesel industry is nascent. There are three domestic production facilities, including one that focuses on exports and another one that just started production in Summer 2025. Prior to the first Canadian facility starting production in 2023, all volumes of renewable diesel were imported.

Co-processing in refineries

Low-carbon intensity feedstock (e.g. canola oil) may be co-processed along crude oil at existing refineries to produce co-processed low-carbon intensity fuels (e.g. co-processed low-carbon intensity diesel, co-processed low-carbon intensity gasoline). Co-processing projects at four different refineries have been approved for credit creation under the CFR. In total, six refineries have indicated their interest in co-processing by 2030.

Low-carbon intensity gaseous fuels

There are currently 48 active Canadian facilities registered under the CFR, which produce biogas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen or renewable propane, but only 34 facilities have created credits to date. In 2024, 1.3% of the credits created were for low-carbon-intensity gaseous fuels. Many registered creators currently use default carbon intensity values that result in no or only a few credits. The number of credits is expected to increase in future years as carbon intensities determined with the Fuel LCA Model are more commonly used to create credits and new facilities come online.

The installed capacity of low-carbon intensity gaseous fuels is expected to grow quickly over the next few years. For instance, the Canadian Gas Association projects that the renewable natural gas capacity will grow from 9.3 PJ (244,737 ML) in 2023 to 28.9 PJ (760,526 ML) in 2026. There are also several hydrogen projects under development[DA5] [EW6] .

Feedstocks

About 41-66% of liquid low-carbon intensity fuels produced in Canada that create CFR credits is produced from Canadian feedstock, such as canola and corn. For domestically produced renewable diesel and biodiesel, 90% of the fuel was produced from Canadian canola.

Demand

Demand for ethanol and biomass-based diesel has grown significantly in recent years, driven by provincial and territorial policies, as well as the CFR. This demand is projected to continue to grow out to 2030 (Table 3).

Canadian production capacity of ethanol and co-processed low-carbon intensity gasoline represents 37% of the expected ethanol demand in 2030. Canadian production capacity of biodiesel, renewable diesel and co-processed low-carbon intensity diesel represents 59% of the expected biomass-based diesel demand in 2030.

The government’s SAF Mandate requires at least ten per cent of UK aviation fuel to come from sustainable sources by 2030.
The LGF facility would provide around 11 per cent of this requirement.
The project is expected to create more than 3,400 full-time equivalent jobs across the UK during its operational phase, including up to 600 roles in Teesside.
The company says apprenticeships and training will be a key part of the project, helping upskill the local workforce.","The £2 billion Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility proposed at Seal Sands on Teesside promises to bring major investment and development to the region.

If approved, the facility could play a critical role in the UK’s push towards net zero aviation.

Noaman Al Adhami, UK country head for Alfanar Projects, said: ""Launching this consultation marks an important milestone in accelerating our world-leading SAF investment, positioning Teesside at the centre of the UK’s fast-growing synthetic fuels sector.

""Delivering for the local area is a central to LGF’s mission.

""Our project will generate significant economic benefits, creating up to 2,000 jobs during construction, 300 permanent roles once operational, and 3,400 supply chain positions nationwide.

""We’re committed to reindustrialising Teesside and ensuring that local workers can transition from fossil fuel-based industries to work in future-facing facilities like ours.""

The public consultation has today launched and will run until January 13, 2026.

It forms part of the planning process for a development consent order (DCO), which will be submitted in summer 2026 to the Planning Inspectorate as a project of national significance.

The proposed facility will convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass into more than 180 million litres of SAF each year.

This volume is equivalent to offsetting the carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

SAF is a proven low-carbon fuel already being used in aircraft, but increased production is essential to meet the UK Government’s target of net zero domestic flights by 2040 and all flights by 2050.

The government’s SAF Mandate requires at least ten per cent of UK aviation fuel to come from sustainable sources by 2030.

The LGF facility would provide around 11 per cent of this requirement.

A previous round of public consultation took place in May 2024.

Since then, the project has been updated to incorporate technical improvements and strategic changes.

Among the key updates is a relocation from the originally planned Billingham site to a new site in Seal Sands.

The new location offers improved access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and allows the entire fuel conversion process to occur on a single site.

There has also been a change in the proposed feedstock.

The facility will now use sustainably sourced biomass, such as forestry and agricultural residues, instead of municipal solid waste.

This change is expected to deliver greater carbon savings.

The site’s proximity to Teesside’s carbon capture and storage infrastructure also allows for future integration into the network.

This could increase annual CO2 savings from 350,000 to 750,000 tonnes.

If constructed, LGF would become the UK’s first commercial-scale, second-generation SAF production facility.

Second-generation fuels use non-edible, waste or residue-based materials, avoiding competition with food crops and supporting environmental and ethical sustainability.

The project is expected to create more than 3,400 full-time equivalent jobs across the UK during its operational phase, including up to 600 roles in Teesside.

It is also projected to deliver £3.8 billion in gross value added (GVA) nationally, with £750 million of that concentrated in Teesside over 25 years.

“Greenko, and by extension AM Green, is one of the lowest-cost producers of green ammonia in the world,” Mr. Nikkel observes.
The company is building a full value chain: from manufacturing electrolyzers to producing a suite of green molecules, including methanol, SAF, and eventually green ethane, chlorine, and caustic soda.
Strategic partnerships, with global energy majors, technology providers, and also financial investors, are central to this model.
Making Impact.” By recycling capital from a successful renewables investment into a new platform for green molecules, ORIX is not only generating strong returns but also advancing global decarbonization agenda.","For a lesson in how to navigate the rapidly evolving global Energy Transition while demonstrating strategic foresight and capital discipline ORIX’s journey with Greenko and AM Green is hard to top. What began in 2021 as a bold bet on Indian renewables has matured into a sophisticated, multi-phase investment in the next generation of ‘green molecules’ and clean technologies – with the Japanese corporate group displaying not only financial acumen but a deep commitment to decarbonization and long-term partnerships with fellow long-term investors such as Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC, and visionary entrepreneurs.

Founded in 2006 by Anil Chalamalasetty (CEO) and Mahesh Kolli (President), Greenko has grown from a small startup into one of India’s largest and most innovative renewable energy companies. As of March 2025, Greenko’s installed capacity stands at 7.3 Gigawatts (GW), spanning wind, solar, and -- most notably -- pumped storage hydroelectricity. The company’s rapid ascent has been fueled by its ability to deliver ultra-low-cost, long-duration renewable power, largely due to its pioneering work in large-scale pumped-storage facilities.

“Greenko’s differentiated approach, particularly in pumped hydro, enabled us to participate in one of the world’s most cost-competitive renewable energy platforms,” notes Mike Nikkel, Senior Managing Director, Global Business Development, Energy and Eco Services Business at ORIX. “The founders’ vision and execution have been exceptional, and their willingness to challenge conventional models set the stage for what came next.”

The Leap to Green Molecules

While renewable energy can reduce emissions from electricity production, decarbonizing heavy industry and transport also requires clean fuels and clean sources of heat and this is intensifying demand for green molecules such as hydrogen, ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Recognizing this, Messrs. Chalamalasetty and Kolli launched AM Green in 2023, aiming to build a vertically integrated platform for these next-generation products. Their strategy: leverage Greenko’s cheap, reliable renewable power to drive large-scale electrolysis and downstream molecule production.

“AM Green’s approach is not just about building green hydrogen or ammonia plants,” explains Satofumi Suzuki, Senior Vice President, Global Business Development, Energy and Eco Services Headquarters at ORIX. “It’s about creating an end-to-end value chain -- from renewable electrons to green molecules to global offtake agreements. That’s what makes the platform scalable and globally relevant.”

To ensure robust cash flows during AM Green’s capital-intensive ramp-up, the founders orchestrated a financial restructuring: repurchasing a large stake in Greenko, making it an affiliate of AM Green, and embedding the former’s profit-generating assets at the heart of the new venture.

This structure allows AM Green to anchor its ambitious projects -- such as the 1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) green ammonia facility in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh (targeted for late 2026) -- on a foundation of operational excellence and cost leadership. It is also important to note that key projects, like Kakinada, are funded largely by debt and equity at the project level.

Capital Recycling, Continued Commitment

ORIX’s initial investment in Greenko in 2021 was both timely and transformative. Over four years, the company not only supported Greenko’s expansion but also realized substantial value. This June, ORIX agreed to sell its 20% stake in Greenko to AM Green for $1.3 billion, while temporarily retaining a 2.5% residual interest. Simultaneously, ORIX committed to a two-tranche $730 million investment in a convertible note issued by AM Green.

“This transaction is a textbook example of our capital recycling strategy,” says Mr. Nikkel. “We realized a significant capital gain -- one of the largest in ORIX’s history -- while redeploying about half of the proceeds into a next-generation platform. It’s about backing winners repeatedly and amplifying impact, not just rotating capital for its own sake.”

Mr. Suzuki adds: “Our willingness to support Anil and Mahesh again reflects our belief in their track record and vision. We look for local partners who can scale globally, and these two have consistently delivered.”

India’s Competitive Edge

A recurring question in global energy circles is whether India can compete on cost in the emerging green molecule market. The answer, according to ORIX’s executives, is a resounding ‘yes’, thanks to India’s economies of scale as well as a pro-business government and regulatory environment that is very different from the era of the Licence Raj.

“Greenko, and by extension AM Green, is one of the lowest-cost producers of green ammonia in the world,” Mr. Nikkel observes. “The cost advantage comes from their ability to generate renewable energy at scale and store it efficiently, which underpins the economics of hydrogen and ammonia production.”

While political winds in the US have temporarily dampened enthusiasm for green hydrogen, cost-competitive demand from Europe, Japan, and other major economies remains robust. AM Green has already secured long-term offtake agreements with companies like Uniper and Yara Clean Ammonia, positioning itself as a key supplier to global markets.

And the vision extends beyond production. The company is building a full value chain: from manufacturing electrolyzers to producing a suite of green molecules, including methanol, SAF, and eventually green ethane, chlorine, and caustic soda. Strategic partnerships, with global energy majors, technology providers, and also financial investors, are central to this model. Notably, the Kakinada ammonia project is a joint effort with Petronas’s Gentari, Singapore’s GIC and others.

“AM Green is exceptionally good at partnering and dealmaking,” Mr. Suzuki emphasizes. “They’re not just product developers, they’re ecosystem builders. That’s critical for scaling up in a sector where offtake, logistics, and technology integration are all essential.”

Scaling Synergies, Delivering Purpose

ORIX is also thinking holistically: the reinvestment in AM Green is not an isolated bet, but a move designed to generate synergies across its broader environment and energy businesses. The company’s portfolio spans aviation, shipping, and renewables, including Elawan Energy in Spain, which boasts 4.7 GW of capacity worldwide.

“There’s a natural alignment between AM Green’s future production of SAF and our aviation leasing business, as well as the potential for green fuels in shipping,” Mr. Nikkel notes. “We’re already seeing collaboration opportunities, from facilitating offtake agreements to integrating supply chains. We are providing more than just capital.”

While investing in India and working with strong-willed entrepreneurs is not without its complexities, ORIX’s collaboration with Greenko and AM Green is emblematic of its broader purpose: “Finding Paths. Making Impact.” By recycling capital from a successful renewables investment into a new platform for green molecules, ORIX is not only generating strong returns but also advancing global decarbonization agenda.

“Ultimately, this is about being at the forefront of the energy transition,” Mr. Nikkel concludes. “We’re leveraging our global network, our experience in renewables, and our belief in the next generation of clean tech to create value -- for shareholders, for partners, and for society.”",https://cdn.image.st-hatena.com/image/scale/1cbb33b2adfee2d66ed2edc76bee080f58d11076/backend=imagemagick;version=1;width=1300/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com%2Fimages%2Ffotolife%2FO%2FORIX%2F20251203%2F20251203101319.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 00:57:25.203818

ALACHUA, Fla. and TAMPA, Fla., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axogen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AXGN), a global leader in developing and marketing innovative surgical technologies for the restoration of peripheral nerve function, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has approved the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for AVANCE ® (acellular nerve allograft-arwx).

Avance is an acellular nerve scaffold for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 month or older with sensory, mixed, and motor peripheral nerve discontinuities.

The indications for sensory nerve discontinuities >25mm and for mixed and motor nerve discontinuities were approved under FDA’s Accelerated Approval pathway based on the effect on static two-point discrimination in sensory nerve gaps ≤25mm, which provided empirical evidence to reasonably predict clinical benefit given similarities in pathophysiology and anticipated therapeutic effects. Continued approval for these indications depends on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.

“All stakeholders in Axogen’s mission to restore health and improve quality of life by making restoration of peripheral nerve function an expected standard of care should take great pride in today’s approval,” said Michael Dale, Axogen’s Chief Executive Officer. “This approval represents a meaningful shift from our historical classification as a human tissue product and brings the product in line with FDA’s classification of Avance as a biologic. This milestone clarifies and strengthens our regulatory footing and confirms approval for use of Avance as an acceptable therapeutic option for treating peripheral nerve discontinuities in all of Axogen’s present nerve repair use cases. The approved BLA and successful transition of Avance to a biologic regulatory framework should give all stakeholders the assurance that Avance has been rigorously evaluated and determined to be safe, pure, and potent for its intended use, and that its benefits outweigh its known or potential risks. We want to thank FDA and the surgical community for the tremendous work and collaboration over more than a decade to make this therapy available to patients.”

Commercial availability of the licensed Avance product is expected early in the second quarter of 2026. In the meantime, Avance remains available under the current tissue framework.

About Avance

Indications

AVANCE ® is an acellular nerve scaffold indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged one month and older with:

Sensory nerve discontinuity (≤25mm)

Sensory nerve discontinuity (>25mm); Approved under accelerated approval based on static two-point discrimination (s2PD) at 12 months in sensory nerve gaps ≤25 mm, which reasonably predicts clinical benefit. Continued approval is contingent upon confirmatory clinical trial results.

Long-term LEQEMBI treatment suggests potential to delay disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid group who started treatment at an early stage

New safety and efficacy data presented at scientific symposium on subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI initiation treatment, which is under regulatory review in the United States

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that the latest findings on time savings with continued treatment with humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody lecanemab (generic name, U.S. brand name LEQEMBI ® ) were presented at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference. Additionally, a scientific symposium was held on the subcutaneous formulation (SC-AI), which was approved for maintenance treatment in the United States in August 2025, and the rolling supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for initiation treatment was completed in November 2025. The application for a subcutaneous injectable formulation in Japan was submitted in November 2025.

Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks, that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* (PF) that begins before amyloid plaque removal and continues afterward. 1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both PF and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

Estimating the 10-Year Time-Savings Benefits of Lecanemab Treatment (Presentation: December 3, 2:40 PM PT)

This analysis used data from the Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) and 16 clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies for AD to estimate long-term AD progression over 10 years and the slowing effect of continued lecanemab treatment. The analysis evaluated estimated “time savings” (slowing of disease progression) compared to natural decline based on ADNI** (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data (untreated group), using Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). These results suggest that early initiation and long-term lecanemab treatment may continue to slow AD progression and help maintain cognitive function over a longer period.

Findings from each group:

Time Savings from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Due to AD to Mild AD

The time to progression from MCI due to AD to mild AD was 7.2 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to mild AD took 9.7 years, indicating a time savings of 2.5 years.

In the low-amyloid group (patients who started treatment at an early stage: amyloid PET <60 centiloids), the time to progression from MCI to mild AD was 13.2 years with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, suggesting a time savings of 6.0 years.

Time Savings from MCI due to AD to Moderate AD

The time to progression from MCI due to AD to moderate AD was 10.1 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to moderate AD took 13.6 years, indicating a time savings of 3.5 years.

In the low-amyloid group, the time to progression with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD was 18.4 years, suggesting a time savings of 8.3 years.

These findings indicate that earlier initiation of LEQEMBI treatment may provide a greater delay in disease progression. Furthermore, each additional year on LEQEMBI could further delay disease progression compared to stopping treatment, even long after plaque is expected to have been cleared.

Lecanemab Subcutaneous Formulation for Treatment Initiation in Early Alzheimer’s Disease: Optimizing Patient Care with a Potential New Option (Symposium Presentation: December 3, 3:10 PM PT)

In this symposium, the latest data from the lecanemab subcutaneous clinical development program were presented focusing on treatment initiation, including results from the subcutaneous (SC) formulation subcohort (n=273) in the Clarity AD trial OLE. It was shown that weekly administration of lecanemab SC-AI at 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) demonstrated bioequivalence in drug exposure compared to intravenous (IV) dosing of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (exposure ratio: 104%, 90% CI: 99.1%–109%).

Based on clinical data and modeling analysis, the effect on amyloid removal in the brain and safety (ARIA-E incidence) was shown to be independent of the route of administration and explained by exposure, suggesting that weekly 500 mg SC dosing provides similar efficacy and safety to biweekly 10 mg/kg IV dosing. Additionally, ARIA-E incidence was also predicted to be comparable between SC and IV administration (12.4% overall, 30.9% in ApoE4 homozygotes).

In this sub-cohort which had prior exposure to lecanemab, safety evaluation showed systemic infusion reactions occurred in 0% of patients receiving 500 mg SC, all of whom had previously received IV lecanemab, and 1.4% of patients who initiated on 720 mg SC by vial, which is favorable compared to systemic infusion reactions in the IV group (26.4%). Immunogenicity assessment indicated a low incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at 1.4%.

These results indicate that the subcutaneous formulations of lecanemab, designed with consideration for the convenience of patients and their care partners, maintains efficacy with a low incidence of systemic infusion reactions, and is otherwise equivalent to conventional IV administration.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms. 3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially preventing the progression of AD. 4

** ADNI is a clinical research project launched in 2005 to develop methods to predict the onset and progression of AD and to confirm the effectiveness of treatments. The project involves a multi-year longitudinal observation targeting healthy elderly individuals as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stages of AD.

INDICATION

LEQEMBI ® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA)

Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed with this class of medications. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy to a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) is available :

Intravenous infusion: 100 mg/mL

Subcutaneous injection: 200 mg/mL

Notes to Editors

About lecanemab (generic name, brand name: LEQEMBI ® )

Lecanemab is the result of a strategic research alliance between Eisai and BioArctic. It is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (Aβ).

Lecanemab has been approved in 51 countries and regions including Japan, the United States, Europe, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia, and is under regulatory review in 9 countries. LEQEMBI received manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan in September, 2023 for the indication of slowing progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Following the initial phase with treatment every two weeks for 18 months, intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing with treatment every four weeks was approved in the U.S., China, the United Kingdom, and others, and applications have been filed in 4 countries and regions. The U.S. FDA approved Eisai’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for subcutaneous maintenance dosing with LEQEMBI IQLIK in August 2025. A rolling Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for initiation treatment was initiated under Fast Track status in September 2025, and completed in November 2025. In November 2025, an application for a subcutaneous injectable formulation in Japan was submitted.

Since July 2020 the Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) for individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, is ongoing. AHEAD 3-45 is conducted as a public-private partnership between the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium that provides the infrastructure for academic clinical trials in AD and related dementias in the U.S, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, Eisai and Biogen. Since January 2022, the Tau NexGen clinical study for Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD), that is conducted by Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is ongoing and includes lecanemab as the backbone anti-amyloid therapy.

About the Collaboration between Eisai and Biogen for AD

Eisai and Biogen have been collaborating on the joint development and commercialization of AD treatments since 2014. Eisai serves as the lead of lecanemab development and regulatory submissions globally with both companies co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

About the Collaboration between Eisai and BioArctic for AD

Since 2005, Eisai and BioArctic have had a long-term collaboration regarding the development and commercialization of AD treatments. Eisai obtained the global rights to study, develop, manufacture and market lecanemab for the treatment of AD pursuant to an agreement with BioArctic in December 2007. The development and commercialization agreement on the antibody lecanemab back-up was signed in May 2015.

The new prices will help market participants optimize their compliance with the U.K. SAF mandate by enabling them to compare the cost of purchasing SAF certificates, blending physical bio-SAF — produced from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) feedstock, and paying 'buy-out' costs in case of non-compliance.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said, ""As SAF mandates ramp up, companies will increasingly need reliable prices not just for the fuel itself but also for certificates. We have worked closely with the industry to develop this new price and we are confident that it will bring much-needed transparency as participants across the aviation value chain work to comply with tightening carbon-cutting mandates.""

The new assessment will track the price of certificates acceptable for meeting the U.K. SAF Mandate and based on manufacture using a relevant HEFA feedstock.

These tradeable certificates are generated by supplying eligible SAF in the U.K. and are then redeemed by obligated parties to comply with the mandate's rules. The mandate allows companies which exceed their own quota to sell their excess certificates to others needing to comply.

From 2025, the U.K. requires jet fuel suppliers to blend 2pc SAF into their domestic aviation fuel deliveries to curb emissions. The mandate increases year by year, rising to 10pc by 2030 and to 22pc by 2040. Transparent pricing for the U.K. certificates market will therefore become increasingly valuable.

This first U.K. SAF certificate price complements Argus' existing suite of assessments for tradeable biofuel tickets for road transport mandates in the U.K. and in several EU countries. Argus also provides a range of physical SAF prices in northwest Europe, including SAF produced using the HEFA pathway and the first-ever modelled production costs for electrolytic SAF (e-SAF).

Responding to his query, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Suresh Gopi informed the House that India's current refining capacity stands at 258.1 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) and is projected to increase to 309.5 MMTPA by 2030.

He further stated that efforts are underway to enhance the petrochemical intensity index of public sector refineries from 4.1 to approximately 9.3 in the coming years.

This move, he said, will significantly boost India’s petrochemical output and improve value addition within the sector, thereby strengthening the overall refining and petrochemical value chain.

The Minister also highlighted that India is actively integrating green and sustainable energy solutions with conventional fuel systems to meet future national energy demands in a holistic manner.

A major contributor to this shift is the ethanol blending programme, under which the target of 20 per cent blending with petrol is being pursued.

To support this, the government is expanding the availability of diverse feedstocks, which will not only reduce crude oil imports but also benefit farmers by increasing income opportunities and creating a more resilient rural economy.

To accelerate biofuel production, initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Biofuel–Vatavaran Sanrakshan Fasal Avashesh Nivaran Yojana (PM-G1) are being implemented.

Additionally, infrastructure schemes like biomass collection machinery and Direct Pipeline Infrastructure (DPI) are being introduced to improve logistics, storage and market connectivity.

These efforts are generating employment and stimulating economic activity, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas.

(Forest Data Network) Consideration of proposed Wisconsin state legislation that would approve $210 million in financing for a sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Hayward, Wisconsin, was launched at the meeting of the Wisconsin Council on Forestry on November 18.

The legislation would authorize $150 million in state bonding and $60 million in Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation tax credits. It was introduced by State Senator Mary Felzkowski.

Among markets for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the European Union, which has mandated its use for commercial flights within its borders, that would unfold slowly over the next 25 years (from 1.2% in 2030 to 35% in 2050). Similar requirements are not in place elsewhere, but airlines are being pushed to consider the use of SAF, including in the U.S.

Members of the Council on Forestry encouraged analysis and consideration of the following:

Supply and demand for the necessary biomass feedstock.

Likely return on investment (ROI) for the required state investment.

Interpretation and stability of the proposed EU regulations on the fuel.

The likelihood of adoption of SAF in the U.S.

How required certification by the E.U. fit with existing SFI and FSC forest certification standards.

How prices for existing users of forest biomass would be affected.

Interestingly, the figure is higher than the export sales of 1.4 million to 2.5 million tonnes that market players expected for the week.

USDA also reported private export sales of 273,988 tonnes of corn to Unknown Destinations on Friday. The agency groups undisclosed destinations under “unknown.”

Global market trends in corn

Prices in the Ukrainian corn market remained stable for December-February shipments on a FOB basis as well as on internal DAP terms, supported by ongoing logistics issues.

Selling ideas for December-January shipment were heard at $222-223 per tonne. Meanwhile, buying ideas were heard at $218-219 per tonne FOB Pivdennyi-Odesa-Chornomorsk (POC).

On the delivered markets, selling ideas were stable and at $243-244 per tonne CIF Marmara.

Concurrently, bids on internal DAP terms were heard up to $212 per tonne DAP POC for spot delivery.

South American insights and US corn futures impact

In South America, the market was quiet following the US Thanksgiving national holiday on Thursday November 27.

Fastmarkets’ assessment for Argentine FOB premiums for December was steady at 98 cents per bu over December CME futures.

Corn planting advanced by 2 percentage points over the week, reaching 39.3% of the 7.8 million ha projected area. Buenos Aires Grain Exchange (BAGE) said this in its weekly report.

Brazil’s corn FOB premiums for December remained unchanged at 130 cents per bu. And Brazil’s corn Northern Arc FOB premiums for December was flat at 124 cents per bu. Both were over December CME futures.

Brazilian corn production is expected to reach 141.6 million tonnes in 2025/26. This is down by 6.2% from the previous year’s record crop of 151 million tonnes, data from local consultancy Agroconsult showed on Thursday.

Domestic demand is forecast at 105.5 million tonnes in 2026, up by 6.9% from the record 98.7 million tonnes from 2025.

Exports are expected to drop to 40 million tonnes in 2025/26, 2.6% lower than the 41.1 million tonnes forecast for 2024/25. But this is a 10% increase when compared with the 37.4 million tonnes exported in 2023/24.

For years, researchers and policymakers have debated whether converting farmland or grassland to bioenergy crops could erase greenhouse gas savings.
Fast carbon payback, big climate gains The study found that the “carbon debt” from converting land to bioenergy crops is quickly repaid.
On average, soil carbon levels recover within five to seven years and overall carbon savings (including reduction in carbon emissions) can be achieved within one year by displacing fossil fuel emissions.
“Our analysis shows that sustainable aviation fuel can deliver deep climate benefits if it’s produced from the right feedstocks,” Khanna said.","Aviation fuel from perennial bioenergy crops such as miscanthus, switchgrass, and energy sorghum could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, even when accounting for land-use change, according to new research led by Madhu Khanna, director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

The study, supported by the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), found that scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from these crops could cut emissions by as much as 83 percent compared with petroleum jet fuel.

For years, researchers and policymakers have debated whether converting farmland or grassland to bioenergy crops could erase greenhouse gas savings. But the Illinois-led analysis found the opposite: deep-rooted perennials store enough carbon in the soil to offset—and even outweigh—the losses from land conversion to produce them.

“This is a counterintuitive but critical finding,” said Khanna. “Expanding energy crop production on both cropland and marginal land can lower the carbon footprint of sustainable aviation fuel.”

The research team built a first-of-its-kind national model linking economics, ecology, and engineering to explore how the U.S. could meet the SAF Grand Challenge goal of replacing all 35 billion gallons of jet fuel used annually with sustainable alternatives by 2050. The results show that meeting the SAF target would require converting about 29 million hectares, or roughly 12 percent of U.S. cropland and non-cropland, to energy crops.

Fast carbon payback, big climate gains

The study found that the “carbon debt” from converting land to bioenergy crops is quickly repaid. On average, soil carbon levels recover within five to seven years and overall carbon savings (including reduction in carbon emissions) can be achieved within one year by displacing fossil fuel emissions.

“These deeply established perennial systems do more than just produce biomass; they help rebuild the soil,” said Evan DeLucia, professor emeritus of plant biology at Illinois. “By continuously sequestering carbon underground, they offer climate advantages that grow over time. The true value of these crops lies in their ability to provide long-term carbon storage while also producing renewable fuel.”

Even under conservative assumptions, SAF from these crops reduced lifecycle emissions by 75 to 83 percent relative to petroleum jet fuel.

“Our analysis shows that sustainable aviation fuel can deliver deep climate benefits if it’s produced from the right feedstocks,” Khanna said. “It also highlights the importance of policies that reward lower-carbon fuels, not just more fuel.”

Next steps for policy and industry

Sustainable aviation fuel from cellulosic feedstocks is currently several times the price of conventional jet fuel. The authors note that carbon-intensity-based incentives, rather than flat per-gallon subsidies, would more effectively drive investment in the cleanest SAF pathways.

The study also provides a blueprint for balancing land, energy, and food systems under climate policy. By integrating economic and biophysical data at fine spatial scales, it helps decision-makers visualize where and how SAF could expand sustainably.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program supported this research through CABBI (DE-SC0018420).

Hosted by Todd M. Schoenberger, the episode—titled ""Turning Grease Into Green: Buffalo Biodiesel's Big Leap Into RNG""—explores how America's waste stream is rapidly becoming a strategic energy resource. Majumdar details how Buffalo Biodiesel collects used cooking oil from 28,000 locations across 15 states, turning recycled materials into high-value renewable fuel and positioning the company for expanded growth across multiple clean-energy pathways resulting in additional business verticals.

""Buffalo Biodiesel represents the kind of real-world innovation that turns today's waste problems into tomorrow's energy solutions,"" said Todd M. Schoenberger, Host and Executive Producer of The Money Path. ""This episode shows how scale, logistics, and smart regulation can unlock new markets—while also exposing the vulnerabilities threatening the supply chain.""

During the episode, Majumdar walks viewers through Buffalo Biodiesel's operational modernization and discusses how upgrades are supporting the company's next phase: expansion into renewable natural gas, with a longer-term eye toward sustainable aviation fuel. He also addresses the regulatory and permitting process with New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and how progress on permitting can serve as a catalyst for continued modernization and new revenue streams.

A key focus of the interview is RNG's growing importance as demand accelerates for cleaner, transportable energy sources. Majumdar and Schoenberger discuss how RNG can support a broad range of sectors—from agriculture and industry to next-generation infrastructure—and why the energy needs of emerging technologies, including AI data centers, are likely to increase pressure on domestic energy solutions.

The episode also spotlights a significant and often overlooked threat to the renewable fuels economy: theft and fraud in the used cooking oil supply chain. Majumdar explains how these crimes disrupt collection logistics, erode margins, and create downstream economic consequences for producers and the broader renewable fuels ecosystem. Schoenberger and Majumdar outline the need for stronger safeguards—including regulatory and enforcement measures—to protect supply-chain integrity and support America's domestic biodiesel industry.

""This isn't just an energy story—it's a supply-chain story, a public policy story, and a business story,"" added Schoenberger. ""When you understand the economics behind the circular economy, you understand why protecting the system matters for job creation, energy independence, and long-term investment.""

(NASDAQ: DEVS), a prominent player in the carbon management sector, saw its stock plummet by a significant 14.1% today after announcing a definitive agreement to combine with Southern Energy Renewables Inc. The unexpected downturn immediately followed the public disclosure of the strategic merger, which aims to create a new, U.S.-domiciled, Nasdaq-listed entity focused on the burgeoning sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green methanol market.

The sharp decline in DevvStream's share price signals a cautious, if not skeptical, initial reaction from investors regarding the proposed combination. While the companies tout the merger as a transformative step towards addressing global decarbonization mandates and revolutionizing renewable fuel production, the market's immediate response suggests concerns about dilution, integration risks, or the long-term value proposition for existing DevvStream shareholders.

A New Horizon for Sustainable Fuels: Details of the DevvStream-Southern Energy Renewables Merger

The definitive agreement for the business combination between DevvStream Corp. and Southern Energy Renewables Inc. was publicly announced on Wednesday, December 3, 2025. This strategic move is poised to reshape DevvStream from its current standing as a micro-cap services company into a more robust industrial fuels and credits business. The core objective of the newly formed entity will be the production of carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green methanol, leveraging biomass as a primary feedstock.

The merger is strategically designed to target aviation and maritime operators who are facing increasingly stringent global decarbonization mandates. By integrating Southern Energy Renewables' advanced technology, access to low-cost feedstock, and established development platform with DevvStream's proven environmental-asset monetization capabilities, the combined company aims to significantly reduce the high production costs currently associated with renewable fuels. This cost-efficiency is critical for widespread adoption and compliance with global environmental regulations. The new entity plans to operate with two distinct divisions: one dedicated to climate solutions that generate environmental assets, and another focused on clean fuel production, with an initial flagship biomass-to-fuel facility slated for Louisiana. This Louisiana facility is intended to utilize regional wood-waste biomass to commercially produce green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Southern Energy Renewables' equity holders are projected to own approximately 70% of the combined company, while DevvStream shareholders are expected to retain about 30%. This ownership structure suggests a significant shift in control and potentially a re-evaluation of DevvStream's existing assets and future growth trajectory by the market. Further solidifying the partnership, Southern Energy Renewables made an initial equity investment of $2 million in DevvStream, acquiring 128,370 shares at a price of $15.58 each. The completion of this merger is anticipated in the first half of 2026, contingent upon securing necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals, including the green light from Nasdaq and the effectiveness of a Form S-4 registration statement.

Market Dynamics: Winners, Losers, and Shifting Valuations

The proposed merger between DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) and Southern Energy Renewables is set to create distinct winners and losers, fundamentally altering the market positions and valuations of the involved entities. For DevvStream shareholders, the immediate aftermath has been a significant loss, as evidenced by the 14.1% stock plunge. While the long-term vision promises a transformation into a more substantial industrial fuels company with potentially higher revenue streams, the immediate dilution of ownership (retaining only 30% of the combined entity) and the uncertainty surrounding the integration process have triggered investor apprehension. The hope for DevvStream is that this merger will provide access to capital, technology, and a larger operational footprint that would be unattainable independently, ultimately leading to a higher valuation for the combined entity in the future.

Southern Energy Renewables, on the other hand, appears to be an immediate strategic winner. By gaining a controlling 70% stake in the combined company, it effectively leverages DevvStream's public listing on Nasdaq, its environmental asset monetization expertise, and its existing investor base. This allows Southern Energy Renewables to accelerate its growth plans in the capital-intensive renewable fuels sector without the arduous process of an independent IPO. The $2 million equity investment further underscores its commitment and strategic positioning, allowing it to acquire DevvStream shares at a price point that, post-announcement, may look favorable if the combined entity succeeds. The merger provides Southern Energy Renewables with a direct pathway to scale its biomass-to-fuel technology and address a global market for sustainable fuels with a publicly traded vehicle.

Beyond the immediate players, the broader market for carbon management and renewable fuels will also see shifts. Companies specializing in SAF and green methanol production, such as Neste (HEL: NESTE) or Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO), might view this new entity as a stronger competitor, potentially intensifying the race for market share and technological advancements. Conversely, companies providing feedstock (like timber or agricultural waste suppliers) could see increased demand and potentially higher prices, while technology providers for biomass conversion might find new opportunities. The success or failure of this merger could set a precedent for similar consolidations in the fragmented but rapidly growing renewable energy and carbon credit markets, influencing investor sentiment towards other smaller players in the sector.

Broader Implications: Navigating the Green Transition

This merger between DevvStream Corp. and Southern Energy Renewables is more than just a corporate transaction; it's a significant indicator of broader industry trends accelerating the green transition, particularly within hard-to-decarbonize sectors like aviation and maritime. The strategic pivot towards carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green methanol aligns perfectly with the increasing global pressure for companies to reduce their carbon footprint. This event underscores the growing realization that voluntary carbon offsets, while valuable, may not be sufficient on their own, and that direct production of low-carbon fuels is essential for meeting aggressive climate targets. The combined entity's focus on cost-effective production is critical, as high prices have been a major barrier to widespread adoption of renewable fuels, suggesting a mature market ready for scalable, economically viable solutions.

The potential ripple effects of this merger could be substantial. Competitors in the SAF and green methanol space may face increased pressure to innovate, scale production, and reduce costs to remain competitive against a potentially larger, more integrated player. Partnerships across the supply chain, from biomass providers to fuel distributors, could also be re-evaluated and restructured as the new entity seeks to optimize its operations. From a regulatory standpoint, the merger could draw increased scrutiny, particularly concerning the claims of ""carbon-negative"" fuel production and the methodologies used to verify such claims. Policymakers and regulators will be keen to ensure that such mergers genuinely contribute to decarbonization goals and are not merely financial maneuvers. Historically, similar consolidations in emerging green industries have often led to accelerated technological development and market maturation, but also to initial market volatility as investors digest new business models and risk profiles.

This event also highlights the evolving role of carbon management firms. DevvStream's transformation from a ""micro-cap services company"" focused on environmental asset monetization to a ""financeable industrial fuels and credits business"" suggests a broader trend where carbon credit developers are moving upstream into direct climate solutions. This vertical integration could become a common strategy for companies seeking to capture more value across the entire decarbonization value chain, from project development and credit generation to the actual production and sale of low-carbon products. Such moves could redefine the competitive landscape, blurring the lines between traditional energy companies, technology providers, and environmental services firms, ultimately accelerating the shift towards a more sustainable global economy.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Integration and Market Opportunities

The coming months will be critical for the newly formed entity as it embarks on the complex journey of integration and execution. In the short term, the immediate challenge will be to stabilize DevvStream's (NASDAQ: DEVS) stock price and reassure investors of the long-term value proposition. This will involve transparent communication regarding the integration plan, synergy realization, and the timeline for the Louisiana biomass-to-fuel facility. Successfully navigating shareholder and regulatory approvals, including the Nasdaq approval and the effectiveness of the Form S-4 registration statement, will be paramount, with an expected completion in the first half of 2026. Any delays or hurdles in this process could further impact market confidence.

Looking further ahead, the long-term possibilities for the combined company are significant, predicated on its ability to deliver on its promise of cost-effective, carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green methanol. The successful commissioning and scaling of the Louisiana facility will be a key performance indicator. Potential strategic pivots may include expanding the geographical footprint of biomass-to-fuel facilities, diversifying feedstock sources, or exploring additional renewable fuel products beyond SAF and green methanol. The market opportunities are vast, driven by aggressive global decarbonization mandates in aviation and maritime, creating a sustained demand for low-carbon fuels. However, challenges such as fluctuating biomass prices, technological scaling issues, and intense competition from other renewable fuel producers will need to be meticulously managed.

Potential scenarios range from a highly successful integration leading to a dominant position in the sustainable fuels market, to slower-than-anticipated growth due to operational complexities or market headwinds. A key outcome to watch will be the ability of the combined management team to effectively merge two distinct corporate cultures and leverage the strengths of both DevvStream's environmental asset expertise and Southern Energy Renewables' industrial production capabilities. If successful, the new entity could emerge as a leader in the global energy transition, offering a compelling investment thesis for those betting on the future of green fuels.

A New Chapter for Carbon Management and Renewable Fuels

The definitive agreement to combine DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) with Southern Energy Renewables marks a pivotal moment in the carbon management and renewable fuels sectors. The immediate 14.1% plunge in DevvStream's stock price reflects initial investor skepticism, but the underlying strategic rationale points towards a potentially transformative shift for the company, aiming to evolve from a carbon credit services provider into a substantial industrial producer of sustainable fuels. This merger underscores a broader industry trend where companies are increasingly seeking vertically integrated solutions to address global decarbonization mandates, moving beyond just offsets to direct low-carbon product generation.

Moving forward, the market will closely assess the execution of this merger, particularly the integration of operations, the successful development of the Louisiana biomass-to-fuel facility, and the realization of promised synergies. The ability of the new entity to produce cost-effective, carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green methanol will be critical to its long-term success and market acceptance. This event highlights the dynamic nature of the green economy, where innovation, strategic partnerships, and scalability are paramount for capturing emerging opportunities.

Investors should closely watch the progress of regulatory and shareholder approvals, the detailed integration plans, and initial operational metrics from the combined company. The future performance of this new entity will not only impact its shareholders but could also serve as a bellwether for the broader sustainable fuels market, indicating the viability and growth trajectory of such ambitious decarbonization initiatives. The journey ahead will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities, but the direction is clear: the financial markets are increasingly aligning with the imperative for a sustainable future.

The technology is aimed at raising per-acre wheat productivity and freeing up agricultural land for other priority crops such as corn for ethanol and mustard for edible oil and sustainable aviation fuel, Brook Cunningham, President of Corteva’s Asia Pacific operations, told PTI in an interview.

“We announced a new sterility system for hybrid wheat at our investor day last year and have begun investing in India-specific germplasm,” Cunningham said during her visit, calling India a “top priority” for the initiative. She noted that hybrid wheat typically requires a 25-year global development timeline but said Corteva has already prioritised work on localised germplasm suited to Indian conditions.

Cunningham, who took on her current role in June and serves on the company’s global executive leadership team, said India is at an “inflection point to feed and fuel the world,” citing the country’s self-sufficiency in rice and wheat and its export potential in fruits, vegetables, corn, and sustainable aviation fuels.

With the global population set to grow by another two billion in the next 25 years, alongside mounting challenges from climate change and pest resistance, she stressed that “technology is the only way India achieves food security and export ambitions amid climate impacts.” Corteva’s seeds, crop-protection products, and biologicals, she added, give farmers the tools to maximise output from every hectare.

The company has recorded a 12% compound annual growth rate in India while keeping its focus on accessibility for the country’s 150 million smallholder farmers, most of whom operate on less than two hectares. Cunningham described the model as a “win-win,” explaining that value generated from R&D is shared among farmers, the value chain, and the company. Yield gains and other benefits are distributed in a way that ensures both grower viability and Corteva’s ability to invest, she said.

According to Cunningham, Corteva’s technologies typically boost yields for smallholders by 15–20% on farms averaging around 0.3 hectares, with some innovations increasing incomes by 20–30%. She emphasised the need for efficient delivery and collaborative partnerships that balance shareholder growth, farmer needs, and government goals.

A former investment banker, Cunningham joined Corteva in late 2022 after 15 years in finance, attracted by agriculture’s potential for impact—particularly in smallholder-dominated markets.

Corteva, active in India since 1972, operates two major research hubs in Telangana and invests about USD 1.4 billion annually in global R&D, roughly 8% of its revenue. Cunningham declined to disclose specific investment figures for India or the hybrid wheat programme.

Beyond wheat, the company sees strong growth prospects in corn, with acreage expected to expand by 15% over the next two years on the back of rising ethanol and protein demand. She said new rainy-season corn hybrids will be introduced soon.

Corteva also launched Clearfield mustard hybrids in India this year and plans to scale them over the coming years. In rice—where hybrid adoption in India remains in single digits—Cunningham sees significant scope for yield improvement, with Corteva preparing to bring its top global technologies to the market.

The company’s offerings include crop-protection products spanning traditional chemistry and biologicals to address resistance challenges. It is also leveraging artificial intelligence to speed up the development of new technologies.

From there, we are committed to expanding to Mexico and Belize to work on cleaner coasts and a circular economy.’","The sargassum crisis

Scientists are still debating the exact causes of this phenomenon, now known as the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt. Many argue that nutrient runoff from intensive agriculture, carried by rivers such as the Amazon, Congo, and Mississippi, has fueled the growth.

Others point to changing circulation and wind patterns in the Atlantic – linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation – that displaced part of the Sargasso Sea’s algae to tropical waters around 2010. In these warmer, nutrient-rich waters, sargassum found ideal conditions to multiply. Whatever the combination of factors, the trend of the past fifteen years suggests that these blooms will remain a recurring challenge.

The impacts are especially severe in Mexico, where the states of Yucatán and Quintana Roo host some of the country’s most popular tourist destinations. The arrival of sargassum threatens not only ecosystems but also livelihoods. Estimates from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) suggest that Quintana Roo loses nearly 12% of its gross local product due to declining economic activity caused by reduced touristm. The hotel sector indicates that it spends around 135 million dollars annually on beach cleaning. Ecologically, bays become clogged, reefs are deprived of sunlight, turtles cannot nest, and beach erosion worsens through repeated cleaning efforts. Public health risks also emerge, as decomposing sargassum releases toxic gases and may contain heavy metals and bacteria.

In 2025, satellite data show more than 37.5 million tons of sargassum in the Atlantic, making it the most severe year on record. By July this year, 44,000 tons have already been removed from beaches and coastal waters in Quintana Roo alone. While the Mexican navy, municipalities, and the hotel sector attempt to intercept the seaweed before it reaches land, large-scale offshore technology is still lacking. The scale of the crisis underscores the need for structural solutions rather than temporary fixes.

Mexico takes essential steps

Building a bioeconomy around sargassum is far from a quick fix. Unlike controlled biomass cultivation, sargassum grows unpredictably. It is seasonal and varies greatly from year to year. Harvesting must take place at sea, posing both practical and regulatory challenges. Sustainable harvesting is essential to avoid creating new problems. Governance is another critical issue: who benefits from valorization, and who bears the costs?

The private sector, NGOs, and the Mexican government understand that only collaboration can provide solutions. In recent months, momentum has grown, and key conditions are being put in place. In July 2025, the state government of Quintana Roo introduced PODECIBI ( Polos de Desarrollo de Economía Circular para el Bienestar), a new decree that gives tax benefits to companies working in circular economy hubs, including the one focused on using sargassum. In August 2025, sargassum was also formally included as a fishery resource in the National Fisheries Charter, creating a legal basis for large-scale offshore harvesting. Permits can be issued for up to 945,000 tons per year.

The European Union is supporting Mexico and other Caribbean countries to create sustainable value chains for sargassum and to give a push to approaches and operations in strategic and financial terms. In the framework of the EU Global Gateway Strategy, a forum will be organized together with a separate side event under the theme ' Beyond the Tide: Practical Approaches to Sargassum Response' on 8 October in Brussels.

Mexican–Dutch cooperation

Together with Dutch company Dutch Clean Tech and partners, the state of Quintana Roo is developing a center where sargassum will be combined with wastewater sludge and processed into biogas. Dutch Clean Tech is designing a project in Cancun's hotel zone for the wastewater treatment of more than 60,000 hotel rooms:

‘We combine this with the valorization of sargassum through biodigestion and thermal recovery systems, with the goal of transforming it into clean, renewable energy. Satellite monitoring will allow us to locate sargassum on the open sea and plan its collection before it reaches the coast. Together with our partners, we are building a project that combines technology, financing, and sustainability - turning an environmental challenge into an energy solution for the region.’

The partnership between Dutch Clean Tech and Quintana Roo is just one example of the strong ties between the Netherlands and Mexico. Building on long-standing collaboration in water and circular economy, Dutch expertise is now being connected with Mexican needs in areas such as offshore collection, monitoring, and valorization.

The Dutch Embassy in Mexico supports the move from plans to execution, ensuring ecological and social sustainability remain central. In April 2025, the LAN team in Mexico organized a mission to Quintana Roo, bringing together eleven Dutch companies, governments, and researchers. Hosting a two-day conference for this group and the Mexican stakeholders further strengthened the Dutch-Mexican network of true pioneers collaborating on an integral solution.

Furthermore, a total of 25 Dutch companies have expressed their interest in working on sargassum in Mexico. The maritime sector has a crucial role here, to provide vessels or other technology for capturing sargassum at sea. Other complementary services and technologies the Netherlands can provide range from producing biogas and fertilizers to sustainable housing material. Seeing this complementarity, the sector is currently writing a proposal for the Partners in Business program of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO). In the meantime, the LAN team in Mexico provides the sector with information, news updates and a strong network.

Klaas Hofstra of Adverio Waste Systems says:

‘Joining the trade mission in April 2025 to Mexico strengthened our ambition to produce renewable biogas and sustainable fertilizer from sargassum. With our new company, Sustainable Planet Solutions, we have now established a base in Jamaica. From there, we are committed to expanding to Mexico and Belize to work on cleaner coasts and a circular economy.’",https://www.agroberichtenbuitenland.nl/openGraphImage.png?path=%2Factueel%2Fnieuws%2F2025%2F12%2F03%2Fas15-mexican-dutch-cooperation-for-sustainable-sargassum-solutions,N,,2025-12-03 17:57:55.295344

Southern is based in Lafayette with plans to relocate to the greater New Orleans area, according to a spokesperson. DevvStream is headquartered in Sacramento, California.

The companies said the deal aims to combine DevvStream’s carbon-credit generation business with Southern’s biomass-to-fuel technology. The merged entity, expected to operate under the Southern Energy Renewables name, is slated to close in the first half of 2026 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Under the agreement, Southern equity holders would own about 70% of the combined company, while DevvStream shareholders would hold roughly 30%.

A key component of the strategy centers on Southern’s planned Louisiana facility, which would use regional wood-waste biomass to produce green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The companies said the platform is designed to help aviation and maritime customers meet tightening global emissions rules, including Europe’s ReFuelEU regulations and mandates from the International Maritime Organization.

Executives said the two-division structure of the merged company will allow it to offer both climate-solution services and clean-fuel production. Management expects federal incentives to help reduce initial production costs, with a long-term goal of reaching cost competitiveness even without subsidies.

Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream and the expected CEO of the new company, said the merger comes as airlines and shipping operators face some of the most aggressive decarbonization mandates to date.

“But today’s renewable fuel options remain materially more expensive than fossil fuels,” Stanton said. “This merger matters now because Southern’s technology, low-cost feedstock, and development platform, combined with DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities, are aimed at reducing that cost burden and enabling compliance at scale.”

Southern CEO Jay Patel said Louisiana remains central to the company’s development plan, citing the state’s biomass resources, logistics infrastructure and industrial workforce. “We believe Louisiana’s combination of feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and experienced workforce creates a strong platform for long-term competitiveness,” Patel said.

Southern also secured a $402 million bond allocation from the Louisiana Community Development Authority to support the flagship project.

Nevin Smalls, chief strategy officer at Southern, said the company’s production pathway uses proven biomass-to-methanol technologies combined with carbon capture to target “one of the lowest lifecycle-carbon profiles in the market.”

As part of the transaction, Southern completed an initial $2 million PIPE investment in DevvStream through the purchase of 128,370 shares at $15.58 each. Stanton said the investment highlights Southern’s industrial scale and recognizes the value of DevvStream’s carbon-monetization platform.

Abstract

The continuous fossil fuel exhaustion, as well as the increasing environmental challenges that are occurring globally, has underscored the need for research on alternative pathways of producing biofuels that will minimize aviation emissions over the next decades. The present review explores the employment of diverse waste sources as feedstock and enzymes as catalysts as environmentally friendly methods for producing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). To achieve this goal, a comprehensive review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The results demonstrated that waste feedstocks catalyzed by enzymes represent an innovative alternative for SAF production. Specifically, the combination of enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation demonstrated considerable effectiveness in transforming complex waste feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and food waste, into SAF precursors, including bio-isobutene and fatty acid methyl esters. Moreover, employing Chlorella variabilis fatty acid photodecarboxylase enzymes for photoenzymatic decarboxylation demonstrated significant conversion efficiency, particularly under gentle conditions, low energy consumption and remarkable selectivity. However, further research and development of the reviewed methods are necessary to enable the industrialization of these technologies.

1. Introduction

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are primarily driven by human activities, including energy production, industrial processes, agriculture, and transportation. Transportation is responsible for a significant portion of global GHG emissions, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. The sector contributes approximately 20–25% of global CO2 emissions, with road vehicles accounting for the largest share [1]. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) [2], in 2023, aviation emissions increased to more than 90% of their 2019 pre-pandemic high level. As demand for air travel recovered in 2022 and 2023, emissions rose in all regions except Russia, reaching about 950 Mt CO2. Under the Net Zero Scenario, international aviation emissions could be reduced to 570.56 Mt CO2 by 2030. As a result, significant research on alternative and eco-friendly jet fuels is expected to continue in the near future. This would include using sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are notably produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and food scraps. These resources can alleviate environmental degradation and provide an ecological alternative to fossil fuels [3]. Alongside other areas, several technologies for SAF production are being researched and developed, and among them, enzymatic treatments appear to be of special interest. Under the main scenario of IEA [4], demand for SAF is expected to rise to around 9 billion liters (0.3 EJ) by 2030, accounting for approximately 2.0% of global jet fuel demand. The ReFuelEU Aviation Act in the European Union mandates SAF blending requirements of 2% for 2025 and 6% by 2030. By 2030, a significant portion of Europe’s SAF demand is expected to be met by local production, with almost 4 billion liters of SAF capacity already in advanced development. The majority of additional demand for residual and vegetable oils will meet ReFuelEU feedstock standards, which include intermediate crops or marginal land. In North America, current SAF production and projects in advanced development phases are projected to yield a capacity of 3.3 billion liters by 2030. The projected SAF regulations in Japan (10%) and Singapore (1% by 2026) will generate an additional global demand of 1.4 billion liters (0.05 EJ). Recent studies have proven that oils, lignocellulosic biomass and other organic waste materials can be converted into biofuels through enzymatic hydrolysis, photoenzymatic decarboxylation, and fermentation [5,6,7]. Compared to highly energy-intensive thermochemical techniques, enzymatic processes can operate in mild conditions, such as lower temperatures and pressures [8]. Under these conditions, we can also utilize more challenging feedstocks that are typically difficult to decompose using conventional techniques [9]. However, despite the potential, before enzymatic SAF becomes a widely used substitute for large-scale industrial applications, challenges such as enzyme stability and the overall cost-effectiveness of the processes must be overcome [10]. The strict greenhouse gas (GHG) emission requirements set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have complete control over the bio-jet fuel market, and aviation companies that fail to comply with the rules face fines. Consequently, the use of bio-jet fuels has a significant impact on the corporate profit margin. The cost of the feedstock, its availability, the volatility of conventional jet fuel, and the viability of commercializing production systems all affect the price of bio-jet fuel [3].

The ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) has certified eight pathways to produce SAF. These pathways ensure that SAF meets stringent safety, performance, and compatibility standards with existing aviation engines and infrastructure. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids-Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) is one of the most mature and widely used pathways for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), involving the conversion of lipid-based feedstocks, such as waste cooking oils, animal fats, and vegetable oils, into jet fuel through hydroprocessing. Other promising technologies for converting waste biomass to SAF include the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) pathways. ATJ involves several steps, starting with the enzymatic conversion of waste biomass into sugars, followed by fermentation to alcohols, and finally, upgrading the alcohols into jet fuel through catalytic processes. FT synthesis can utilize various biomass sources, including agricultural residues, wood, or waste materials, to convert syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into liquid hydrocarbons, which can then be refined into biofuels, such as biojet fuel [1,3,11].

SAF, like Jet A-1, contains hydrocarbons. However, the quantity and kind may vary significantly. SAF ought to meet ASTM D1655 [12] and ASTM D7566 [13] criteria for commercial air transport, similar to JET A-1 or JET A quality, such as fuel composition, flash point, smoke point, density, and corrosion tendency [14]. Conventional kerosene derived from crude oil (Jet A−1) with a carbon atom range from 8 to 16, comprises diverse species categorized into four chemical families: (i) n-alkanes or n-paraffins, (ii) iso-alkanes or iso-paraffins, (iii) cyclo-alkanes (naphthenes or cyclo-paraffins), and (iv) aromatics. Additionally, antioxidants, antistatic agents, and metal deactivators are examples of some fuel additives that may be present [15]. Aside from compositional variations, SAF and conventional aviation fuels exhibit distinct physical and chemical properties. For instance, the final boiling points of Jet A and Jet A-1 fuels, and SIP fuel, are limited to 300 °C, 255 °C, and 255 °C, respectively. Whereas, the ranges of the density at 15 °C for Jet A or Jet A−1 fuel and FT-SPK fuel are 775–840 kg/m3 and 730–770 kg/m3, respectively, all measured according to ASTM D7566 [13]. SAFs exhibit differences in atomization and combustion performance compared with conventional aviation fuels due to differences in volatility, viscosity, and thermal stability, which, to some extent, can influence CO, NOx, and unburnt hydrocarbons (UHC) emissions, even though engine operating conditions have a greater influence [16].

Enzymatic hydrolysis is a cutting-edge technology that utilizes waste feedstocks for producing biofuels selectively through enzymes that break down lipids into free fatty acids (FFAs) which are then converted into biojet fuels without generating unwanted byproducts [6]. In addition, it is an eco-friendly alternative to fossil-derived jet fuels, as it enables the recovery of high-value lipids without harsh chemicals. Moreover, photoenzymatic decarboxylation is an innovative biochemical process that uses light energy to activate specific enzymes, removing carboxyl groups from fatty acids or other carboxylic compounds. As a result, it produces valuable hydrocarbons, including alkanes and alkenes, as biofuels or as feedstocks for chemical production. This can be achieved under mild conditions, usually at ambient temperature and pressure, in contrast to conventional chemical decarboxylation methods. Thus, it minimizes energy inputs, making it a highly energy-efficient and eco-friendly process [17].

A key strategy for bio-based sustainable aviation fuel production from lipid derived from organic waste is the microbial lipid SAF pathway [18]. Those lipids, for example, can be derived after the recovery of anthocyanins [19] or by oleaginous microorganisms [20]. As lipid feedstocks, vegetable oils and biowaste are commonly used; nonetheless, they are inadequate to meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuels in the future. As a promising alternative to tackle this challenge, lignocellulosic waste that consists of non-edible plant materials such as agricultural residues, forestry byproducts, and dedicated energy crops, can notably enhance the sustainable production of bio-jet fuel while minimizing environmental footprint and competitiveness with food resources [21]. Eventually, municipal solid waste (MSW) which is conventionally managed through incineration or landfilling can be used as feedstock for producing biofuels while mitigating climate change [2]. This comprehensive review examines the potential to establish a circular bioeconomy within the aviation industry, with a main focus on converting waste materials through enzymatic processes into sustainable aviation fuels for the future. Given the ongoing interest in the utilization of waste biomass for biofuel production, the novelty of the review lies in combining waste biomass feedstocks with enzymatic processes to convert them into SAF.

2. Results and Discussion

The use of waste sources and the application of enzymes as catalysts are crucial for meeting the future demand for SAF, reducing costs, and minimizing the negative environmental impact [3]. Recent literature review and experimental and modeling data on SAF production from various waste materials using several technologies and different enzymes are comprehensively discussed in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of enzyme and microbial pathways in converting waste into SAF. Enzymatic hydrolysis, combined with microbial fermentation, degrades complex substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass, food waste, and solid municipal waste into SAF precursors, including bio-isobutene and fatty acid methyl esters.

2.1. Review Studies for SAF Production via Enzymatic Processes of Waste Biomass

Figure 1 illustrates SAF production pathways via enzymatic processes of waste biomass. Lignin, the most abundant natural source of aromatic compounds on a large scale, has a high energy density, making it a valuable renewable alternative to fossil fuels for directly producing various green fuels. Converting lignocellulosic biomass into aviation fuel precursors is crucial in producing fuel from biomass. Enzymatic hydrolysis is often combined with other pretreatment methods, playing a crucial role in lignocellulosic pretreatment by catalyzing the breakdown of lignin. However, enzymes can be costly and have a limited lifespan, as they often become denatured during pretreatment. Thermochemical techniques are advantageous over direct combustion as they emit less hazardous gases and produce valuable products during conversion. Fuels of high value and biojet can be refined via FT synthesis of combustible synthesis gases resulting from gasification. However, lignin gasification of lignocellulosic biomass is being evaluated at the pilot scale, with consequential investment costs and uncertainties in production expenses [22].

A promising method for producing fuels is bioconversion, which is environmentally benign and operates under mild conditions. Rhodococcus has attracted interest as a valuable microorganism with multiple catabolic capabilities for producing high-value products from biomass. Diverse methods for aviation fuel production have evolved, such as gasification-FT synthesis, thermal/catalytic cracking and hydrodeoxygenation, which is the most broadly implemented method for enhancing bio-aviation fuel quality. Rhodococcus strains can be utilized to convert lignin into lipids through fermentation, offering a hydrodeoxygenation strategy that does not allow lipid and residual lignin separation and thus has an important potential for lowering aviation fuel production cost and enhancing processes [23].

Guo et al. [24] proposed that the fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) from Chlorella variabilis NC64A, which has been lately discovered, presents a viable route for producing carbon-neutral biofuels and fine chemicals. Triglycerides are hydrolyzed by lipase into long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and glycerol under mild conditions, with conversion rates of 85–100%. CvFAP then converts the resulting LCFAs into aliphatic hydrocarbons under visible light and normal pressure. This pathway streamlines biofuel production by serving as an alternative to the initial steps of HEFA.

The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass through enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation presents a valuable solution for generating biofuels, especially bioethanol and biojet fuels. As described by Ashokkumar et al. [25], a suite of enzymes, including cellulases, hemisellulases and pectinases, through hydrolysis, break down the biomass into simpler sugar molecules. The resulting sugars are later fermented to produce bioethanol, which can be further refined into biojet fuel. Moreover, in some combined processes, enzymatic biomass breakdown is combined with syngas conversion via FT synthesis, leading to an increase in the overall yield of jet fuels. As part of the ATJ process, gas fermentation provides an alternative route to alcohol production that does not depend on sugars or biomass. Their ability to metabolize CO, CO2 and H2 into biomass and SAF precursors positions acetogenic microorganisms as valuable candidates for industrial gas fermentation applications. At present, LanzaTech uses CO-rich emissions from industrial and solid waste sources to produce ethanol. Rodriguez et al. [26] noted that the expanding H2 sector along with the waste gases generated by the national energy sector, could provide feedstocks for gas fermentation, elevating Australia’s role as a frontrunner in SAF production. Gas fermentation differs from biomass-based methods by converting waste CO and CO2, enabling a carbon-neutral or potentially carbon-negative process. This work utilized the metabolic adaptability of Clostridium autoethanogenum under anaerobic conditions to generate SAF intermediates, operating fermentations at 30 °C and 500 rpm. The authors focused on mitigating challenges, such as pathway compartmentalization and cofactor shortages, to improve the efficiency of isobutanol production.

Finally, Lynd et al. [27] examined enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass, breaking down cellulose into sugars, followed by fermentation to produce ethanol, which is then converted into jet fuel through the ATJ pathway.

Kubic et al. [28] have proposed a two-model approach to recycled paper as a feedstock for bio-jet fuel production, expanding on prior studies. A techno-economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the viability of enzymatic and acid hydrolysis for biofuel production. The study involved a six-step enzymatic hydrolysis process, a two-step acid hydrolysis process, and subsequent catalytic conversion and upgrading, including sugar hydrogenation to sugar alcohols and the transformation of sugar alcohols into hydrocarbons. The findings indicated that bio-jet fuel yields were 2.40 barrels per tonne for enzymatic hydrolysis and 2.36 barrels per tonne for acid hydrolysis. The direct hydrogenation of cellulose and hemicellulose into sugar alcohols is crucial for making the paper-to-jet fuel process economically viable. This approach can significantly reduce capital and operating costs. Nonetheless, existing limitations related to production costs and technical matters hinder the potential large-scale implementation of the process. Biogas, which consists of CO2 and CH4, can be produced from anaerobic digestion under mild conditions of food waste. The gases in biogas can serve as substrates for microorganisms, producing microbial lipids that can then be refined into SAF [46]. In their recent study, Zhang et al. [29] introduced a sustainable, carbon-neutral and cost-efficient method to produce SAF from food waste. The CO2 and CH4 from food-waste-derived biogas can be transformed by microalgae and methanotrophs into lipids that are later refined into SAF. Guo et al. [30] investigated food waste, where oil is separated from water, followed by photoenzymatic decarboxylation of waste oil (WO) lipase hydrolysate. WO was hydrolyzed by lipase to generate long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), which were then subjected to photoenzymatic decarboxylation. Meanwhile, non-oil components (NOC) were utilized as feedstock for anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce methane. CvFAP achieved a palmitic acid conversion rate 26.4 times higher than in single-phase catalysis in the biphasic system using petroleum ether as the oil phase. The WO hydrolysate catalyzed by CvFAP produced C17 hydrocarbons at a rate of 1.7 mM/h. Additionally, the same authors, for the first time, compared the catalytic performance of photoenzymatic decarboxylation reactions between recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing CvFAP (CvFAP@E. coli) and broken cells (CvFAP BCs) [31]. The study found that CvFAP BC and CvFAP@E. coli exhibit similar behavior under appropriate conditions. Both reactions were conducted at 30 °C under blue light and in an anaerobic environment. Pentadecane was produced at 88.4% from CvFAP@E. coli and 95.4% from CvFAP BC. The highest conversion rate for CvFAP BC reported to date was 17.2 mM/h. Li et al. [32] developed a photoenzymatic method to decarboxylate FFAs from waste oils into hydrocarbon fuels, with a focus on producing biojet fuel by initially hydrolyzing waste oils to release FFAs. This step was followed by the enhancement of enzyme activity and an increase in alkane yield, through decarboxylation utilizing CvFAP under visible light. Outstanding hydrocarbon production with a rate of 18.4 mM·h−1 and an energy output of 204.3 kJ·L−1·h−1 was attained by this research, demonstrating high efficiency. Harahap et al. [33] investigated the conversion of caproic acid into (SAF. To achieve this, caproic acid was produced from green waste utilizing microbial chain elongation (CE) with arrested anaerobic digestion (AAD) at 37 °C, pH 7.2, and a 15% inoculum level, with stepwise ethanol addition to enhance its yield. This pathway demonstrated an innovative, high-efficiency, scalable approach to SAF precursor production from green waste, addressing feedstock volatility and the need for enhanced fermentation stability in industrial applications. Puschnigg et al. [34] introduced an advanced biorefinery model that converts softwood residues, such as sawdust, into SAF and valuable by-products. The process begins with enzymatic hydrolysis to extract sugars, which are then fermented using genetically engineered E. coli to produce bio-isobutene, a key SAF precursor. Subsequent oligomerization and hydrogenation steps yield SAF isoparaffins that comply with ASTM D7566 standards [13]. Environmental assessments indicate significant GHG emission reductions of up to 80.1% under the LI-B RES scenario (Lignin boiler, RES grid), which integrates renewable electricity and on-site lignin utilization for thermal energy.

Van Rooyen et al. [35] examined the use of pre- and post-consumer food waste to produce biojet fuel, utilizing optimized enzymes to advance process efficiency while integrating decontamination strategies. To eradicate microbial contaminants and enhance ethanol yields, food waste was pretreated with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or potassium metabisulfite (PMB). Moreover, fermentation was conducted using the concurrent saccharification and fermentation method, and the ATJ pathway was applied to convert to biojet fuel. Mansy et al. [36] explored the use of office paper waste to produce bioethanol through a sustainable integrated method of hydrolysis, fermentation and purification. Ethanol purity was increased by the implementation of a novel polymeric membrane composed of sulfonated polyvinyl chloride (SPVC) combined with poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl−1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) to separate ethanol via pervaporation, resulting in increased concentration raising lab-prepared ethanol from 25% to 56% and bioethanol from 30% to 63%, with total flux values of 289.54 g·m−2·h−1 and 253.06 g·m−2·h−1, respectively. Moretti et al. [37] examined the potential of producing SAF via the ATJ pathway using potato by-products as feedstock through acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, followed by catalytic upgrading. This approach resulted in 88% conversion to jet-range alkanes, with a minor fraction allocated for lubricant production. An analysis of economic and environmental impact was conducted for both the centralized and decentralized production models, which showed that the centralized approach resulted in 5% lower GHG emissions. In their study, Hong et al. [38] assessed two potential feedstocks, wheat straw (Case I) and industrial cellulosic residue (Case II), for the sustainable conversion of biomass to bioethanol, followed by the production of a hydrocarbon fuel from aqueous ethanol via C–C coupling and HDO. The results demonstrated that for Case I, the biomass feedstock consumption for bio-jet fuel production is 7.2 tonnes of wheat straw with a 5% moisture content, whereas for Case II, 16.0 tonnes of industrial cellulosic residue with a 45% moisture content per tonne of fuel, respectively.

Muanruksa et al. [39] investigated the utilization of palm oil mill effluent (POME) using a combination of enzymatic and thermochemical methods for the production of biojet fuel. The POME was first hydrolyzed under optimal conditions of 40 °C and 200 rpm using immobilized lipase, achieving a 90% FFA yield. Using hydrocracking, the resulting hydrolyzed product (HPOME) was treated with a palladium/alumina (Pd/Al2O3) catalyst at 400 °C and 10 bar hydrogen pressure for 1 h. Through the aforementioned process, FFAs were converted into hydrocarbons, producing mainly green kerosene with a 57.44% selectivity and 94% crude biofuel yield. This method outlined the effectiveness of industrial waste utilization and addressed ecological challenges associated with POME while producing valuable renewable fuels. Marchesan et al. [40] assessed the application of HEFA technology in SAF production from microbial oil (MO). By incorporating sugar and starch crops, as well as lignocellulosic waste, it expands the feedstock options for established SAF production. Due to the high productivity of sugarcane, averaging 76.3 tonnes per hectare, SAF production via MO-HEFA reaches 2450 L per hectare. This is nearly four times higher than the 630 L/ha yield of soybeans, which have an average productivity of 3.3 tonnes of soybean grains per hectare in Brazil, assuming a SAF yield of 1 L/kg oil. Utilizing more productive feedstocks helps minimize pressure on land conversion, thereby reducing both direct and indirect GHG emissions associated with land-use change. Lan et al. [41] conducted a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) of a SAF biorefinery in the U.S., utilizing a catalytic sugar upgrading pathway. The results indicate that selecting acetone instead of dioxane, wood pellets over natural gas, and biobased methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) over fossil-based MEK can significantly lower the life-cycle global warming potential (GWP) of SAF. However, while wood pellets help reduce GWP and fossil fuel depletion, their use increases environmental impacts in other categories due to emissions from wood combustion. Li et al. [42] achieved a maximum bio-aviation fuel production rate of 59.8 mM/h through the photodecarboxylation of FFAs extracted from lipid-rich wastewater into C1-shortened alkanes under blue light illumination. This presents a viable alternative for bio-aviation fuel production under mild conditions.

Affandy et al. [43] reported that high-titer 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) fermentation at a 100 L scale, pretreated with nanofiltration, resulted in a reduction in impurity levels from 4.6 to 0.6 wt. %. A novel catalytic upgrading process was then developed to convert aqueous 2,3-BDO into a jet fuel blendstock candidate. The oligomerization of light olefins, demonstrated for over 270 h of time-on-stream (TOS), primarily produced dimers (C8–C10) and trimers (C13–C14). The resulting oligomerized product underwent hydrogenation and distillation to recover the jet fraction, yielding a mass fraction of 35% (corresponding to a carbon-based yield of 40.9%). Additionally, Zhu et al. [44] investigated the impact of iron ion-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (Fe-HP) pretreatment on enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and bio-jet fuel production from straw. The enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation efficiency of straw biomass were notably improved after Fe-HP treatment, enabling the conversion of the feedstock into bio-jet fuels using a dual-functioning catalyst. This process resulted in a 94.9% high conversion rate and 77.3% jet fuel selectivity. Akter et al. [45] examined the use of forestry waste logging residues as feedstock for SAF production via the ATJ process, including both ETJ and Iso-BTJ pathways. Their study indicated that higher alcohol yield (0.33 L/kg) and lower carbon intensity (758 g CO2eq/L) are achieved through the ETJ pathway, whereas Iso-BTJ resulted in 0.24 L/kg and 976 g CO2eq/L, respectively. Although ETJ led to greater GHG savings, Iso-BTJ compensated by achieving higher daily SAF production.

From the results above, the highly promising and most widely used enzyme appears to be CvFAP, followed by cellulase. The first exhibits high performance, either in selectivity or conversion rate, when used with different types of waste feedstock in the photodecarboxylation process. On the other hand, cellulase was primarily applied to paper-related waste. This type of feedstock, along with food waste, appears to spark interest in SAF production research. As for the production pathways, enzymatic hydrolysis and photoenzymatic decarboxylation are the most commonly used to potentially produce SAF. In this review, it was observed that the combination of waste feedstock and an enzymatic process, delivering the highest yield of 95.4% and the highest conversion rate of 17.2 mM/h, was achieved by utilizing waste cooking oil together with CvFAP BCs under the photoenzymatic decarboxylation method. In addition, when the process mentioned above was repeated using CvFAP and waste oil, the study reported 100% selectivity for C15-C17 hydrocarbon biofuel. As for the environmental aspect, the pathway that achieved the highest GHG emission reduction, up to 80.1%, was anaerobic digestion and chain elongation of garden waste. The enzyme employed was a mixed culture that enabled conversion of the waste feedstock into caproic acid, a SAF precursor.

3. LCA and Economic Viability of SAF Produced via Enzymatic Processes

The LCA of SAF suggests that it has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 26–93% compared to fossil-based jet fuel, disregarding land-use change effects. The steps that account for the majority of CO2 emissions in the SAF are feedstock cultivation and collection, as well as feedstock conversion and processing to jet fuels, with fuel transportation and feedstock transportation contributing the least to the core LCA value [47]. SAF produced from various feedstocks and techniques, including pyrolysis, FT, HEFA, and ATJ, can drastically reduce aviation industry GHG emissions by 41–89%. Because sulfur concentration and SO2 emissions are directly correlated, pure FT fuel can lower SO2 emissions from pure JP−8 by 92% because SAFs have a very low sulfur content [16]. A recent study conducted by Bhatt et al. [48] indicated that the life cycle GHG emissions from the woody FT pathway showed the greatest reduction at 86% compared to Jet A, assuming GHG emissions from conventional jet fuels are 85 g CO2 eq/MJ. In the ATJ pathway using crop residue as the feedstock, life-cycle GHG emissions were reduced by 67%. Lan et al. [41] found that converting 1 dry kg of waste paper sludge into SAF through ash removal, enzymatic hydrolysis, dehydration, aldol condensation, and hydroprocessing is more climate-friendly (−925 to −584 g CO2 eq/MJ) than landfilling without landfill gas recovery. Quiroz et al. [49] suggested using prospective LCA methods to evaluate the environmental impacts of advanced technologies still at the research and development stage for long-term estimation. Specifically, they highlighted that the miscanthus-FT pathway achieved a carbon intensity below 42 g CO2 eq/MJ under all the scenarios investigated. On the other hand, the corn-ATJ GWP distribution is centered between 55 and 60 g CO2 eq/MJ and extended to elevated emissions of 70 g CO2 eq/MJ. According to a recent review of LCA applications for biobased SAF production processes, there remains a scarcity of cradle-to-cradle LCAs that mimic a circular economy that includes SAF production. The capacity of a temporal LCA to address future uncertainties in consumer behavior, legislation, and regulations is also highly desired. Finally, as technological advancements in SAF conversion processes and feedstock production techniques continue, more LCAs are needed to evaluate the latest methods, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions [50].

In terms of cost, the key factors are feedstock and capital costs across the SAF routes. Dedicated energy crops like switchgrass and miscanthus are more expensive (0.27–0.37 $/L) than biomass residues like forest and agricultural residues (0.18–0.28 $/L). As a result, residue feedstocks contribute less to the total harmonized SAF cost (15–17%) than energy crops (∼25%). In contrast, HEFA pathways have the lowest capital investment (541 MM$) and the highest returns (6.2–33.3 MJ SAF/kg biomass), resulting in the lowest capital cost per unit of SAF, accounting for 6–24% of the overall cost. In ATJ paths, the ethanol production stage incurs significant capital expenses, accounting for 39–42% of overall costs and becoming the primary contributor. In the case of pyrolysis, the comparatively low fuel production (2.47 MJ SAF/kg biomass) results in a high capital cost per unit of SAF, even though the capital input is very modest. ATJ routes demonstrate the least cost variance, since they operate within a tight yield range (0.11–0.13 kg feedstock/MJ). Among the ATJ choices, ATJ-MC and ATJ-SW have marginally higher production costs than ATJ-AR and ATJ-FR, reflecting their higher feedstock prices [51]. However, the increasing costs of renewable fuels have a minimal impact on consumers at current blending rates and under 2030 targets. If ReFuelEU Aviation targets are met, flying from Frankfurt to New York will cost an additional 2% due to a 5.3% sustainable aviation fuel blend rate and a 0.7% e-kerosene content [4].

4. Materials and Methods

The method used to conduct the present comprehensive review is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [52], as illustrated in Figure 2.

The Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases were used to find relevant material. Database research was conducted from 14 November 2024 to 14 February 2025 to identify article titles, abstracts, and keywords published between 2014 and 2025. The search for relevant papers was conducted in the Scopus database using the term combination “sustainable AND aviation AND fuels”. In addition, the enhanced search was limited to articles and reviews published in English. Finally, an advanced search was performed using the following keywords: “waste OR enzyme OR production.” A total of 77 articles were identified. The Google Scholar database was also used for research using the following criteria: “waste” AND “enzyme” AND “production” AND “sustainable AND aviation AND fuel”, with an advanced search using the precise phrase “SAF production” between 2014 and 2025. A total of 213 papers were identified. Finally, in the Science Direct database, the keywords utilized were waste AND enzyme AND production, and an advanced search was again undertaken with the specific term “sustainable aviation fuels” to refine the search for article titles, abstracts, and keywords published between 2014 and 2025. A total of 93 articles were derived. In summary, 383 papers (77 from Scopus, 213 from Google Scholar, and 93 from Science Direct) were identified and exported from the databases to Zotero, containing the document title, abstract, authors, and year. Duplicates (63) were identified and eliminated. Furthermore, 151 records were excluded before screening because their titles did not align with the subject area. Specifically, either the title was unrelated to aviation biofuel production but linked to other biofuel production, feedstocks were not derived from waste materials, or enzymes were not used as catalysts when employing waste feedstocks. The following essential stage of record screening involved a cursory examination of each abstract and its associated keywords. Some abstracts did not meet the research criteria (97 records). Specifically, during the screening of the abstracts, the production route mentioned was unrelated to SAF and concerned only the production of biofuels used in other transportation sectors. Furthermore, although some abstracts mentioned waste feedstocks for SAF production, the conversion process was not enzymatic. Therefore, a total of 72 publications were deemed relevant to the current evaluation and thoroughly reviewed. Following a thorough investigation, 24 papers were included in this study, while 48 records were excluded because their results did not meet the research purpose regarding comparability with papers that referred to methods employing enzymes for SAF production from waste biomass. Specifically, upon thorough reading, some papers did not provide measurable data on yield or process performance. Waste feedstock was only a minor discussion point, not the subject of the study. Lastly, although some of the abstracts were accessible for screening, the full article texts were paywalled or otherwise inaccessible even after institutional access.

The quality and risk of bias of the studies included in the present review were assessed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Examining potential bias is crucial to the validity of the evidence supporting each process and to the transparency and reproducibility of the highlighted areas of each study. For this reason, each article was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on its methodological detail, experimental data and quantitative outputs. The scope of this section is to provide a clear and reliable foundation for the reported sources. Studies that included sufficient methodological reporting and clear experimental and quantitative results were classified as low risk, exhibiting reliability and minimizing uncertainty. In this category, 16 articles were classified, including the studies [26,28,29,30,31,32,33,36,38,39,40,42,43,44,45], which demonstrated well-organized experimental approaches and accounted for 69.6% of the analyzed articles. Studies that presented useful scientific information and contributed meaningfully, but did not thoroughly examine sensitivity parameters or experimental conditions, were categorized as moderate risk. Studies [34,35,37,41] are assigned to this category, representing 17.4% of the total. Studies that were more conceptual or had insufficient methodological detail were categorized as high risk. Finally, the studies [22,23,24,25], which primarily emphasize theoretical explanations, constitute 13% of the research examined.

5. Conclusions

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are considered the most viable solution for the aviation industry to combat climate change, reduce emissions, and improve energy efficiency. Among the promising sources for bio-jet fuel production, waste feedstocks stand out, mainly catering waste, which has been identified as a significant risk factor. Methods that employ enzymes as catalysts to convert waste biomass feedstocks into biofuels offer an eco-friendly alternative to conventional chemical processes, whose conditions are often environmentally detrimental and intense. The approaches mentioned above provide high selectivity and energy efficiency, yielding specific hydrocarbon combinations while minimizing downstream process burdens when needed. The present review highlights the growing potential of enzymatic hydrolysis, photoenzymatic decarboxylation, and microbial lipid production as cutting-edge techniques for converting waste into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) or their precursors. The combination of enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation has proven highly effective in converting lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and food waste into SAF precursors, such as bio-isobutene, alcohols, and fatty acid methyl esters. Moreover, photoenzymatic decarboxylation demonstrates high conversion efficiency, especially under mild conditions, with low energy consumption and excellent selectivity. Nevertheless, further research on innovative developments in enzyme engineering, as well as the incorporation of biorefinery systems within circular economy frameworks, will be crucial to unlocking the full potential for large-scale SAF production and making a significant contribution to the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

Watch all the ST Podcasts Live events:","SINGAPORE – For a sustainability project that encourages repair over disposal, it is perhaps surprising that many participants of Repair Kopitiam join for practical reasons instead of environmental ones.

Saving money, having fun and meeting new people were the most commonly cited reasons for joining the grassroots initiative, which teaches people to repair damaged items like electronics and furniture instead of throwing them away.

Only about 20 per cent of participants gave environmental reasons, said Mr Veerappan Swaminathan, co-founder of Repair Kopitiam.

Incidental sustainability – the act of being sustainable due to reasons not related to sustainability – is something that projects and programmes should consider, he added.

“We have to reframe some of these projects and programmes, and meet where people are,” said Mr Veerappan, who is also chief executive of consultancy Sustainable Living Lab Group.

He was answering an audience member’s question about how climate conversations can be brought to the common man.

Mr Veerappan was a guest panellist, alongside National University of Singapore Assistant Professor Alisius Leong, at a live podcast recording of The Straits Times’ Green Pulse podcast on Dec 2.

More than 50 people attended the free event at SPH Media’s auditorium. Kiss92 radio DJ Kim Anne Tan was the event’s emcee.

The panel was discussing whether individual actions can move the needle on climate change.

Joining them were ST correspondents Shabana Begum and Ang Qing, the podcast’s hosts.

The live recording of the Green Pulse podcast, which provides a South-east Asian perspective on climate change and environmental issues, was one of two podcast recordings in the sixth and final ST Podcasts Live series.

One topic discussed was whether the climate issue is solely a government issue, beyond the influence of individuals.

Prof Leong said individual actions can shape societal norms.

“When there is a critical mass, when enough people are engaging in these actions, I think corporations, businesses (and) the Government do pay attention,” she said.

She cited an example of how increasing consumer demand for electric vehicles pushed companies to shift their production to EVs.

Mr Veerappan also agreed that individuals have the power to make an impact.

“One of the things that I often remind people is (to) look at your own sphere of influence – the organisation that you work in, the friends that you hang out with, and even colleagues and... family members whom you speak to. All these are points of influence that you can actually make change starting from there,” he said.

ST’s Wheel Insights podcast, hosted by ST senior transport correspondent Lee Nian Tjoe, was also recorded at the Dec 2 event. He was joined by Mr Andrey Berdichevskiy, partner and associate director of Boston Consulting Group, and Professor S. Viswanathan from Nanyang Business School.

The panel discussed whether current efforts to “green” Singapore’s transport are sufficient, and how commuters can aid the transition.

ST recently reported that

from Oct 1, 2026, departing air passengers from Singapore will have to pay a sustainable aviation fuel levy on their flight tickets.

Responding to Mr Lee’s question on whether the levy is sufficient to make a meaningful impact on consumers’ aviation habits, Prof Viswanathan said that while Singapore needs to decarbonise for the long run, the Republic cannot afford to price people out of taking flights as the aviation sector provides a lot of jobs for Singaporeans.

He said the levy ensures airlines that buy sustainable aviation fuel in Singapore are actually compensated, as the fuel costs about two to five times more than kerosene, which is used to make aviation fuel.

“So it’s not really about discouraging air travel at the moment, it’s more about whether we can make the baby steps to actually decarbonise aviation,” Prof Viswanathan said.

Mr Berdichevskiy said that there is a need for market mechanisms to equalise the playing field and “give a chance to sustainable aviation fuel”.

He added that individuals can also adopt a playful mindset, to find joy in saving carbon.

“I use my commute to listen to music... and discover new tracks,” he said.

Individuals can also “cast a wider net” and see where they can reduce their carbon footprint, be it eating less meat or repairing things instead of throwing them away, he added.

Mr Jason Ng, 33, programmes and community manager at a sustainability charity, was one of the attendees at the event. He said he usually does not listen to podcasts, and found the live version more engaging.

“I think it is great that there is a live version of the podcast, because when I go to an event, I would pay attention,” he added.

Dr Nachammai Vidhya , 33, said the podcasts provided her with new perspectives. She cited the dialogue on managing carbon emissions in the aviation industry as an example of something that she learnt and that she had not often considered.

ST should hold more such events and explore more ways to connect with audiences, she added.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-canceled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/President-Bush-with-corn.jpg?fit=1200%2C842&quality=100&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-03 10:58:03.491209

Southern secures a $402 million bond allocation from the Louisiana Community Development Authority in support of its flagship biomass-to-fuel facility

Southern makes initial PIPE Investment in DevvStream of approximately $2.0 million at $15.58 per share

SACRAMENTO, Calif. & NEW ORLEANS, December 03, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (""DevvStream""), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, and Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""), a U.S.-based producer of low-cost fuels made from biomass, with a flagship Louisiana project that plans to utilize regional wood-waste biomass to deliver green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") at scale, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine under a new U.S.-domiciled, Nasdaq-listed company, following customary closing conditions.

The new company plans to help aviation and maritime operators meet tightening global mandates from regulations such as ReFuelEU and organizations such as the International Maritime Organization (""IMO"") by creating a U.S.–built, integrated clean‑fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, using domestic feedstock and workforce to produce carbon‑negative SAF and green methanol at commercial scale. Operationally, the combined company is expected to have two divisions: one focused on climate solutions that generate environmental assets, and one centered on clean fuels and products, with an initial focus on a previously announced Louisiana biomass‑to‑fuel facility.

The new platform’s anticipated SAF pathway, combined with DevvStream’s environmental‑asset capabilities, is aimed at reducing the cost burden that slows alternative fuel adoption today. Management expects to utilize federal incentives early while targeting cost‑competitiveness even without these incentives, supported by various co‑products produced during the SAF process. The company also plans to leverage early airline and maritime offtaker engagement. For investors, this reframes DevvStream from a micro‑cap services profile to a financeable, industrial fuels and credits business with long‑duration revenue potential and scalability. The new company is expected to be led by Carl Stanton as CEO and operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. Closing of the business combination is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2026.

""Aviation and maritime operators are facing some of the most ambitious decarbonization mandates globally, and most of them want to comply,"" said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. ""But today’s renewable fuel options remain materially more expensive than fossil fuels, which is slowing adoption and creating a practical barrier to transitioning at the pace regulators envision. This merger matters now because Southern’s technology, low-cost feedstock, and development platform, combined with DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities, are aimed at reducing that cost burden and enabling compliance at scale.""

""The State of Louisiana continues to serve as an important partner in the development of this initiative, and we expect that it will continue to support the project moving forward,"" said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. ""We believe Louisiana’s combination of feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and experienced workforce creates a strong platform for long-term competitiveness, and we look forward to expanding our partnership with the State as we work to strengthen the nation’s energy leadership and supply global markets in a way that supports our expanding economy.""

""Our roadmap is designed to deliver clean fuels at industrial scale with a clear cost advantage, creating an advanced platform with the potential to effectively compete with China and the rest of the world,"" said Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. ""Our biomass-waste-to-methanol-to-SAF pathway relies on proven technologies and integrated carbon capture, targeting one of the lowest lifecycle-carbon profiles in the market.""

Regarding the transaction, Stanton added, ""We are excited that Southern has agreed to make an initial approximately $2.0 million PIPE investment in DevvStream at $15.58 per share. This recognizes DevvStream’s core business and the strategic role its carbon-monetization business plays in lowering effective costs for customers. This also recognizes Southern’s industrial scale and capital intensity while giving DevvStream shareholders a substantial stake in a larger, more diversified platform dedicated to the growing SAF and green methanol markets.""

Business Combination Highlights:

Ownership Structure: Upon closing, Southern equity holders are expected to own approximately 70% of the combined company, and DevvStream shareholders approximately 30%.

Initial Investment: Southern has completed an approximately $2.0 million investment in DevvStream through the acquisition of 128,370 shares at $15.58 per share (the ""PIPE"").

Aviation needs a solution Aviation emissions are set to grow rapidly, even with some demand destruction.
Aviation needs a solution, and RefuelEU is a critical step towards delivering one.","There has been some skepticism in recent months about RefuelEU, the regulation that mandates a gradual uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Criticism from those who do not think climate is a serious problem is expected, as SAF is more expensive than fossil jet fuel, but interestingly there has been some criticism from pro climate action electrification-focused activists as well.

Their critique derives from the rational mindset that we should prioritize the sectors with the highest emission savings per $ spent first, as shorter term emissions

savings are more impactful than those in the future due to the long-lived nature of CO2. Displacing coal electricity generation with renewables comes top of the list, followed by the electrification of road transport and then home heating. Sectors such as SAF, which have significantly higher costs of abatement, are further down the list.

In response, countries have prioritized renewable power, and they are now starting to seriously tackle the roll out of EVs and heat pumps. But some are now pushing this logical argument to the extreme. They argue that any money and time spent now on reducing emissions in sectors like SAF such as RefuelEU is a waste.

This demand for a strict, rigid sequence is wrong for three reasons.

1 The next sector won’t be ready when we do need it

Without any support for SAF now, the costs will not come down, and it will not be ready when we do need it. SAF needs the continuous input of feedstock, so the cost down potential may not be as dramatic as solar and wind, but innovation can still make a huge difference. Aside from used cooking oil SAF via HEFA which is strictly limited due to land use, the other SAF routes from gasified carbon waste, biogas, methanol, ethanol and CO2, are all fairly new and all need initial support for costs to come down. We are used to starting with crude oil and making a mix of gasoline, jet, diesel and fuel. Starting with waste carbon feedstocks and trying to make only C8-C16 jet fuel hydrocarbons with branching and aromatics for SAF is a new challenge.

2 Aviation is more discretionary. People accept something should be done

What different sectors can achieve depends on many factors, not just the cost of the emissions saved. SAF has a higher cost per ton of avoided emissions than home heating, but it is also a far more discretionary use of fossil fuels. Other methods of communication and travel are often available meaning there is more tolerance for price increases. Spending on aviation correlates much more closely with wealth than home heating. Taxing aviation and then putting the money towards things other than SAF is already done and leaves aviation without a solution.

3Sectors are not silos

This line of thinking ignores the positive links between sectors. SAF production pathways with low carbon intensities rely on green electricity. Rather than focusing solely on how every megawatt of green electricity used for SAF is one less for EVs or heat pumps, the reality is more nuanced. Increasing demand for green electricity to produce SAF and e-SAF can drive greater investment in renewables, ultimately benefiting all sectors that depend on it by reducing costs. SAF can be part of the grand electrification megatrend. SAF can also strengthen local agriculture and forestry sectors by creating a valuable market for waste carbon.

Aviation needs a solution

Aviation emissions are set to grow rapidly, even with some demand destruction. In the UK, they are already higher than those from the electricity supply sector. There is no question that decarbonizing aviation is more expensive per ton than other options. But policies like RefuelEU are still important. It is not about prioritizing aviation over other sectors. It is about ensuring the sector is not left behind in the transition. Aviation needs a solution, and RefuelEU is a critical step towards delivering one.

The europe E-fuel market size was valued at USD 1.93 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 2.54 billion in 2025 from USD 23.04 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 31.75% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

E-fuel is a synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels produced using renewable electricity, captured carbon dioxide, and green hydrogen through power-to-liquid or power-to-gas processes. These carbon neutral fuels are engineered to be drop-in replacements for conventional fossil fuels, which is requiring no modification to existing internal combustion engines or fuel distribution infrastructure. In the European context, e-fuels are increasingly positioned as a decarbonization pathway for sectors where full electrification remains technically or economically unfeasible, such as aviation, maritime shipping, and legacy vehicle fleets. According to the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, sustainable aviation fuels must constitute at least 2% of total jet fuel consumed in the EU by 2025, which is rising to 70% by 2050. As per a 2024 study by Transport & Environment, Europe hosts around 45 e‑fuel projects, including 25 industrial-scale initiatives and 20 pilot projects, which is indicating a strong policy backing and industrial commitment. Meanwhile, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) projects that over 200 million internal combustion engine vehicles could still be on EU roads in 2035, which is indicating the practical demand for low‑carbon liquid alternatives. Unlike biofuels, e‑fuels avoid land‑use competition and offer near‑zero particulate emissions and align with the EU’s zero pollution action plan and circular carbon economy principles.

MARKET DRIVERS

EU Policy Mandates for Hard to Abate Transport Sectors Drive e-Fuel Adoption

The growing regulatory endorsement of e‑fuels across hard‑to‑electrify transport segments is supporting the expansion of the European e‑fuels market. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, sustainable aviation fuels must account for 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, 6% by 2030, and 70% by 2050, with synthetic fuels specifically required to reach 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050. Aviation remains a major contributor to EU transport emissions, yet battery‑powered commercial aircraft remain technologically distant for medium‑and-long‑haul routes. Similarly, the-fuelEU Maritime Regulation requires ships calling at EU ports to progressively reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels from 2025. A substantial share of the EU’s heavy‑duty truck fleet continues to operate beyond ranges suitable for current battery technology, which is preserving a role for e‑diesel. Porsche’s Haru Oni e‑fuel plant in Chile, backed by the German government, already supplies e‑gasoline to European motorsport and classic car communities. These policy carve‑outs ensure that e‑fuels are not merely niche alternatives but legally sanctioned tools for meeting binding climate targets in sectors where electrification cannot deliver timely reductions.

Preservation of Existing Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle Fleets Creates Practical Demand

The growing presence of long‑lasting internal combustion vehicles across Europe is one of the key factors propelling the growth of the European e‑fuels market. According to ACEA, 249 million passenger cars were in circulation across the EU in 2023. The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) reported 49.1 million passenger cars registered in Germany in 2024, with an average age of 10.3 years. These legacy fleets cannot be rapidly replaced or retrofitted, which is generating sustained demand for carbon‑neutral liquid fuels. E‑fuels offer a pragmatic solution by enabling these vehicles to operate with near net‑zero lifecycle emissions without infrastructure overhaul. Unlike biofuels, which face feedstock limitations and indirect land‑use concerns, e‑fuels can be synthesized using air, water, and renewable power. France’s Ministry of Ecological Transition permits e‑gasoline in historic vehicle rallies under its “neutral carbon heritage” clause and recognizing cultural and economic value in preserving automotive history.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Extremely High Production Costs and Energy Inefficiencies Constrain Scalability

One of the primary restraints facing the European e‑fuels market is the prohibitively high production cost driven by multi‑step conversion processes. Producing one liter of e‑gasoline requires 10–12 kWh of renewable electricity, compared to about 1.5 kWh for an EV to travel the same distance. Current production costs are estimated at €4–6 per liter in 2024, with forecasts suggesting costs will remain above €2 per liter by 2035. Electrolysis and Fischer‑Tropsch synthesis operate at less than 50% efficiency, meaning over half the input renewable power is lost as heat. This inefficiency competes directly with grid decarbonization and industrial electrification goals. At a time when the EU is prioritizing energy security following the 2022 energy crisis, diverting scarce renewable electricity to low‑efficiency fuel synthesis creates a structural barrier to scalability.

Limited Renewable Energy Surplus and Grid Integration Barriers

The limited availability of dedicated renewable electricity is also hampering the European e‑fuels market growth. According to Eurostat, renewables represented 24.5% of EU gross final energy consumption in 2023. Much of this capacity is already allocated to electrifying transport, heating, and industry. Grid congestion further limits access, with wind and solar output frequently curtailed due to insufficient flexibility. Without dedicated offshore wind or solar parks exclusively allocated to e‑fuel production, domestic output will remain marginal. The EU’s Net Zero Industry Act prioritizes battery and heat pump manufacturing over e‑fuel facilities in permitting, which is reflecting a strategic preference for higher‑efficiency decarbonization pathways.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Integration into Aviation and Maritime Decarbonization Roadmaps Offers Structured Growth Pathways

The growing adoption of sustainable aviation and maritime-fuels is a significant opportunity for the European e‑fuels market. ReFuelEU Aviation mandates 6% SAF by 2030 and 70% by 2050, with synthetic fuels forming a rising share. FuelEU Maritime recognizes e‑methanol and e‑ammonia as compliant fuels, with shipping companies commissioning dual‑fuel vessels. The Port of Rotterdam has designated land for future e‑fuel clusters, with major energy companies planning integrated e‑methanol facilities expected later this decade. Airlines operating in Europe have entered long‑term offtake agreements for e‑kerosene to secure supply as obligations tighten. Unlike road transport, where electrification dominates, aviation and maritime sectors have no near‑term alternative to liquid or gaseous carbon‑neutral fuels.

Repurposing Existing Fossil Fuel Infrastructure Enables Rapid Deployment

Repurposing existing fossil fuel infrastructure offers another promising avenue for the European e‑fuels market expansion. Europe hosts over 114,000 fuel stations across the EU‑27, enabling compatibility with existing distribution networks. Blending e‑fuels with conventional fuels can be achieved without major changes to pipelines, tankers, or dispensers. The German Ministry for Economic Affairs approved the co‑processing of e‑diesel in refinery units in 2024, demonstrating feasibility at industrial scale. Moreover, the European Committee for Standardization has adopted EN 16709 and EN 15940 specifications for paraffinic e‑fuels, which is ensuring compatibility with existing engine warranties. This infrastructure reuse reduces capital expenditure compared to building hydrogen refueling or EV charging networks. In rural regions where grid upgrades are costly, e‑fuels provide a geographically agnostic decarbonization option.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Energy Intensity and Low Well to Wheel Efficiency Undermine Climate Credibility

The poor energy efficiency associated with e‑fuels across their value chain is a significant challenge to the European e‑fuels market. Well‑to‑wheel efficiency of e‑fuels is estimated at around 15%, compared to 70–85% for battery electric vehicles. This inefficiency is critical in Europe, where renewable electricity remains constrained. Lifecycle assessments indicate that under current grid mixes, some e‑fuels exhibit only marginally lower emissions than advanced biofuels when upstream energy sourcing is considered. As the EU tightens climate accounting under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, such inefficiencies may disqualify e‑fuels from certain green finance instruments, undermining their environmental legitimacy.

Lack of Standardized Certification and Carbon Accounting Frameworks Creates Market Uncertainty

The lack of a harmonized EU‑wide methodology for verifying the carbon neutrality of e‑fuels is also challenging the expansion of the European e‑fuels market. While the Renewable Energy Directive II includes provisions for renewable-fuels of non‑biological origin (RFNBOs), it does not specify how to account for upstream emissions of electricity used in synthesis. Multiple carbon intensity models remain in use across member states, leading to divergent emission values for identical e‑fuel batches. This inconsistency complicates cross‑border trade and deters offtake agreements. Until the EU establishes a single digital product passport with embedded real‑time electricity source tracking, investors and airlines face uncertainty over whether e‑fuel purchases will count toward binding decarbonization targets.

In 2023, UK biomass demand reached 193TWh, and the government expects similar levels into the mid-2030s to support Carbon Budget 6.

With around a third of the UK’s biomass energy content imported, officials say alignment with other major regimes - particularly the EU Renewable Energy Directive - will be important for smooth trade while maintaining high standards.
Feedback will help shape the territorial scope of the policy, with both devolved and reserved areas currently covering biomass sustainability.","The UK government has opened a wide-ranging consultation on plans to establish a common sustainability framework for biomass, aiming to strengthen oversight, improve public confidence and ensure the sector continues to support the country’s transition to net zero.

Published on 2 December, the consultation seeks views on proposals to align and tighten existing sustainability rules that govern the use of biomass across power, heat, transport and industrial applications.

Biomass accounted for around 10% of the UK’s total energy supply in 2024, but ministers say updated standards are needed to ensure the resource remains genuinely low-carbon and environmentally responsible.

Officials say the new framework would bring consistency to sustainability criteria currently spread across multiple incentive schemes, including the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate, the Green Gas Support Scheme and Contracts for Difference.

It would also strengthen monitoring, reporting and verification requirements for domestic and imported feedstocks.

The consultation follows concerns from environmental groups and policymakers about the need for more robust safeguards.

The government acknowledges that confidence in biomass sustainability “must be improved” if the sector is to play a continued role in the UK’s clean energy strategy and its goal of becoming a “clean energy superpower”.

Biomass covers a wide range of materials of biological origin, from forestry and sawmill residues to food and agricultural waste.

With appropriate safeguards, international bodies such as the IPCC and the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) recognise its value in decarbonising energy systems—particularly where combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to deliver greenhouse gas removals.

In 2023, UK biomass demand reached 193TWh, and the government expects similar levels into the mid-2030s to support Carbon Budget 6.

Longer term, the CCC has said sustainable biomass, used in priority sectors and paired with capture technology, could provide “a valuable source of CO₂ removals”.

The consultation also notes the increasing global focus on transparency in biomass supply chains and the need for stronger international governance.

With around a third of the UK’s biomass energy content imported, officials say alignment with other major regimes - particularly the EU Renewable Energy Directive - will be important for smooth trade while maintaining high standards.

At the heart of the proposals are strengthened land-use and greenhouse gas criteria, covering environmental protections, forest carbon stock and supply-chain emissions.

The government is also seeking views on improving monitoring and verification and on guiding principles for enforcement, though it stops short of prescribing penalties, saying these are best tailored by individual schemes.

The new framework would first apply to government-backed bioenergy incentive schemes and could later be adopted more widely, including voluntarily by industry.

Biofuels, such as those refined from the fats and oils from certain seed crops or even used cooking oil, offer a compelling alternative.
For Bilby, who’s been evaluating the biofuels market for years at Bayer, this means a growing appetite for the oil seed crops that can be made into biofuels.
“When you introduce these crops as an additional crop in the middle of your current rotations, it creates additional revenue opportunities for farmers,” Bilby says.
“We’ve got to be able to actually fulfill the demand so the demand doesn’t wander away,” he says.","The continued global push to rein in carbon emissions is bringing new opportunities for St. Louis companies, which see the chance to bring to market products helping speed the shift away from fossil fuels.

Biofuels are one such opportunity. Global demand is growing for alternative fuels that can power large vehicles, such as airplanes, cargo ships, trains, construction equipment, or large manufacturing equipment, says Chad Bilby, Bayer Crop Science’s biofuel crop innovation and commercial lead.

“Things like that are not going to be powered on batteries or EVs for a long time, or maybe ever,” he says. “That’s where biomass-based diesel is playing a role, these larger horsepower-type engines that are going to need sustainably created fuels, such as biofuels.”

Battery power may work well in smaller vehicles, such as passenger cars, Bilby says, but it’s a less practical or feasible solution for much larger vehicles. Biofuels, such as those refined from the fats and oils from certain seed crops or even used cooking oil, offer a compelling alternative.

Some so-called “drop-in” fuels can even replace fossil fuels “one-to-one without having any engine modifications,” he adds.

“The infrastructure is there today, and all you have to do is swap it out with a new fuel,” Bilby says. “Renewable diesel and specifically sustainable aviation fuel are two types of drop-in fuels that allow you to replace your fossil fuels, gain the reductions in your greenhouse gas emissions, and not have to make modifications or change out your engines for them to operate.”

On a global scale, the transportation sector accounts for about 16 percent of global carbon emissions, per the Rhodium Group’s 2022 estimates. Ships and aviation make up a combined three percent of that global figure.

For Bilby, who’s been evaluating the biofuels market for years at Bayer, this means a growing appetite for the oil seed crops that can be made into biofuels. Last year, he estimates that some 95 million acres of these crops were grown globally, but by 2030 that total could be anywhere between 128 million acres on the conservative side up to 200 million acres.

It’s why the company’s crop science arm is partially focused on developing the seed technology for crops, such as CoverCress (a genetically engineered version of pennycress that can be refined into aviation fuel), camelina, and winter canola, as a new source of revenue for farmers.

“When you introduce these crops as an additional crop in the middle of your current rotations, it creates additional revenue opportunities for farmers,” Bilby says. “Obviously today, with farmer margins becoming ever tighter, and commodity prices and tariffs making things more unpredictable, you couldn’t come at a better time to really help farmers diversify their operation,”

Bilby says these crops also come with an upside of enhancing soil quality and health and in some cases driving better yield for a farmer’s main cash crops.

Ben Kruger, senior vice president of renewables for St. Louis-based Roeslein Renewables, is also keen on the way biofuels can become a revenue source for farmers.

“It will come from farmers, either their row crop production directly, or indirectly from some of the agricultural waste and other biomass that can come from the farm that today doesn’t really have a home at all,” he says.

Kruger’s company estimates that renewable fuels for large ocean-going vessels will alone be a $200 billion market by 2050. The International Maritime Organization, a governing body of global maritime activities made up of hundreds of countries, had agreed to a draft framework for the sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 in April and was set to fully adopt the framework this October before pushing back that decision for a year.

“The IMO, a few years ago, recognized there was an opportunity to improve some of the environmental-related aspects of shipping by driving incentives and regulation towards the fleets of the ships in the world, to lower their emissions profile,” Kruger says.

The framework would have instituted an incentive structure for ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, designed to reward owners who’ve eliminated emissions and levy fees against those who haven’t. While the adoption of such a framework is delayed, Kruger says it’s still prudent to prepare for this shift so that the U.S., and its farmers, are in a position to capture market share.

“We ourselves are very active with certain ship owners that want to buy renewable energy, and there’s some that are looking to test the system as soon as next calendar year, because they don’t want to wait,” he says.

But changing political winds can make for a difficult climate. Kruger stresses the importance of developing the domestic infrastructure to support the biofuels supply chain, from farmer to end-user.

“At some point, things become a little bit habitual and we want to make sure that the United States is open for business, is ready, and that we’re one of the most competitive choices on the planet,” he says. “Ship owners are very smart and savvy people, as they start optimizing their routes, we want to be there on the early end, so that we’re not left out if other countries are able to move at a faster pace.”

That’s also a challenge for any of the crops showing promise as future biofuels, says CoverCress CEO Jim Hedges.

“We’ve got to be able to actually fulfill the demand so the demand doesn’t wander away,” he says. “Be slow and build it, right? But once you get it built, you need to scale it fast.”

But Hedges is convinced the demand is there, pointing to a $150 million investment fund established by multiple airlines with Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which is designed to bring sustainable aviation fuel to market.

“The commitment to this is real, from the airlines, from ocean going vessels, even freight trains,” Hedges says.",https://www.stlmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/farm-tractor-plow_GettyImages-1337041902.webp,N,,2025-12-03 10:59:41.504623

Deere & Co., the world's largest farm machinery manufacturer, has pledged to increase the use of renewable fuels in its equipment.
On why it's been tough for the industry in general to get more biofuels used on farms, Deere said lack of awareness is partly to blame.
""We’ve got to do more to make sure customers are aware of what’s possible,"" Josh Garetson, Deere's director of renewable fuels and corporate strategy, said in an interview.
There's scant data available on the use of biofuels in farm machinery and other off-road equipment.","Biofuel producers are hopeful that hard-to-electrify transportation like aviation, rail and marine will spur new demand growth. But there’s another sector the industry's eyed for decades that's remained stubbornly out of reach: the American farm.

Despite U.S. farmers playing a major role in establishing markets for soybean-based biodiesel and corn-based ethanol, a combination of industry growing pains, lack of engine technology and simple misinformation left a generation of growers wary of using renewable fuels in their tractors, sprayers and combines.

Momentum, though, is slowly starting to build in the push to make biofuel-powered equipment commonplace on farms. Still, challenges include ongoing pushback on crop-made fuels by some environmentalists, the rapid development of electric tractors and a dearth of needed infrastructure.

Deere & Co., the world's largest farm machinery manufacturer, has pledged to increase the use of renewable fuels in its equipment. The Moline, Illinois-based company in August unveiled approval for higher biodiesel blends across its fleet of Tier 4 non-road diesel engines. It also has quietly been getting feedback from customers on a tractor prototype that runs on 100% ethanol.

On why it's been tough for the industry in general to get more biofuels used on farms, Deere said lack of awareness is partly to blame.

""We’ve got to do more to make sure customers are aware of what’s possible,"" Josh Garetson, Deere's director of renewable fuels and corporate strategy, said in an interview.

There's scant data available on the use of biofuels in farm machinery and other off-road equipment. The U.S. Energy Information Administration stopped collecting sales figures for distillate fuel oil by end user in 2020. Pre-Covid data for 2019 show sales to farms at 3.5 billion gallons, roughly the same as for railroads and exceeding marine use by more than double.

""When you look at the sheer volume of fuel the ag sector consumes on an annual basis, there’s a lot of room for growth for biofuels,"" said Geoff Cooper, who heads the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group. ""Even a modest share of that existing demand would be a meaningful new market.”

Most biofuel used on farms and ranches is biomass-based diesel at fairly low blend levels and little to no ethanol outside of trucks and light-duty equipment.

“We expect that can change in the next five or 10 years,"" Cooper said. ""Deere has shown that it can be done. Where there needs to be additional attention and focus is on the logistics and the infrastructure of getting the right fuels to the farm.""

RFA is also funding a Purdue University study on blending ethanol with diesel fuel. Meanwhile, Brazil is seriously studying using ethanol in ag equipment. ""It feels to me like they're a step ahead of us,"" Cooper said.

Whereas ethanol largely hasn't been tried on U.S. farms, biodiesel is still contending with the perception that it isn't a reliable fuel in certain farm settings, in part due to cold weather issues that industry advocates say are manageable.

Soybean producer Ryan Pederson, who farms about 25 miles south of the Canadian border in North Dakota, where bull moose are a more common sighting than people, said his father was initially reluctant to start using biodiesel due to problems he'd heard about through the grapevine. Since data on the fuel was scarce given how few farmers were using it, biodiesel started being blamed, even when some other human-caused error was the culprit, Pederson said.

“That was the challenge that we had, getting over those anecdotal stories about why the fuel doesn't work,"" he said earlier this year to a gathering of Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents the biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel industries.

Another issue was some dealerships blaming engine issues on biodiesel, prompting Pederson at one point to stop using the fuel for a period so it couldn't be used as an excuse.

“It was a scapegoat,"" he said. Still, that doesn't mean there were never problems with biodiesel quality a couple of decades ago when the industry was still in its infancy. ""We had some really good producers, and then we had some other people who were just making it whenever and however they could,"" Pederson said.

""Memories are long. Maybe you had a bad experience that was partially because we didn't have a good understanding of making sure fuel tanks were clean,"" Garetson said. ""The standards have evolved and the quality levels have improved from the biofuel producers themselves. That's given us the confidence to announce higher-blend levels.""

Deere, which is also busy working to commercialize battery-operated tractors, wants to give its core customers a more seamless supply chain, according to Garetson.

""It's about taking a load of corn to the ethanol plant and converting a thousand bushels into three thousand gallons and then bringing those gallons back to the farm.""",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/2025/12/02/John-Deere-combine.jpeg?height=635&t=1764710536&width=1200,N,,2025-12-03 12:56:26.189761

Fruit of the Loom’s recyclable packaging

Fruit of the Loom is one of six clothing and apparel companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

It launched its campaign “The Fruit Way” which outlines its sustainability commitments and actions for the future.

Its targets were to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% and reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline.

In 2024, it met these goals, achieving a 68% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 47% reduction in Scope 3 emissions.

Fruit of the Loom also plans to use 100% renewable electricity in its operations and facilities by 2030 and maintain zero waste in its owned facilities.

The company is aiming to transform its packaging operations, starting at its manufacturing plant in Morocco.

All of its cartons are made from 100% recycled fibres and feature the company’s new recycled materials logo, as well as using mineral-free ink for its carton printing.

It is making an effort to reduce its use of polybags and stretch film in its packaging, to reduce its reliance on single use plastics.

Fruit of the Loom says it is committed to being among the first companies to embrace changes in packaging technology and will continue to implement innovative solutions across its packaging process.

How does NetJets offset its emissions?

As a leader in the private aviation sector, Berkshire Hathaway’s subsidiary NetJets is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.

Highlight:

Fiji airways spend up to 1 Billion dollars annually in aviation fuel.

Land Lease Guarantee

Through this top down proposal, I hope we can secure abundant LAND to cultivate enough sugarcane to support our National Airline & Sugar Production.

Start:

Exploring sustainable and locally produced fuel options could contribute to price stability, energy security, environmental performance, and Fiji's decarbonisation efforts. This aligns with our National Development Plan and global climate commitments. Most aviation biofuel programs currently emphasize first- and second-generation biojet fuels.

Focus on Sugar

If we talk about the struggling sugar industry, we often discuss the supply chain to produce sugar. Yet we must realise that sugar is just one of the end products.

Alternative product: Ethanol

Fiji's long-standing sugar cane industry provides a natural foundation for developing ethanol as a domestically produced renewable fuel. Ethanol is produced from the fermentation of sugarcane juice or molasses.

To create ethanol-derived pathways, as part of Fiji's broader aviation decarbonisation strategy, we need to determine the amount of ethanol to be consumed as jet fuel, the required sugar cane to be planted, the human resources and machinery needed, the support structure, and, lastly, enough land to be acquired to implement this plan.

Currently, the importation of domestic fuel costs is up to $1.5 billion every year.

Proposal

From sugarcane to aviation ethanol-based fuel, this supply chain is a win-win, billion-dollar pathway and a beacon of hope for the entire sugar industry. This will come at a cost, but through strategic financing and political will, I am confident we will be able to realise it. By leveraging such value chains, this could help diversify sugar cane farmer incomes, increase landowner lease income and royalties for them, reduce imported fuel dependence, and create a domestic market for ethanol that supports both road transport and aviation fuel pathways.

Land Lease Guarantee

Through this top down proposal, I hope we can secure abundant LAND to cultivate enough sugarcane to support our National Airline & sugar production.

Extra Summary

As with many island economies, aviation fuel costs constitute a significant share of operating expenses for airlines, airports, and related services. Tourism remains Fiji's backbone. Fiji Airways serves 27 international destinations, with 26,586 flights and an estimated 2.2 million passengers annually, according to Fiji Airways’ statistics.

Expenditure

We are proud, and I am very proud of our national airline, but it can be said that Fiji Airways spends almost $1 billion annually on fuel consumption.

To increase profits, Fiji Airways needs to reduce its expenses, and its greatest expense is fuel. As legislators, we should seek concrete solutions to aviation fuel.

Farmer Age Statistics

Fiji’s sugar industry is facing a critical generational crisis, with only 5 percent of cane farmers under the age of 40.

Growers’ age statistics:

Latest assessment shows that 7 percent of our growers are over the age of 70

12 percent are between 60 and 70

14 percent are between 50 and 60

The commercial court of Évry has declared the judicial liquidation of the French company Global Bioenergies, specialised in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), after rejecting both takeover proposals submitted during its administration procedure.

The start-up stated that neither bid met the court’s criteria. The first offer, which did not include any job retention, was dismissed on that basis, while the second was considered inadequate for ensuring satisfactory operational continuity. A judicial liquidator has been appointed to organise the sale of the company’s assets, including its portfolio of technological patents.

Stock market failure and delisting

Global Bioenergies has simultaneously begun the process of delisting from the Euronext Growth market in Paris. The company announced that its shares will become worthless, resulting in a total loss for its shareholders.

Based on a bacterial fermentation process to produce isobutene from renewable resources, the company had received certification in 2023 for the use of its SAF in aviation. In March 2025, tests were conducted with aerospace supplier Safran on the injection phase and with the French aerospace research centre Office national d’études et de recherches aérospatiales (Onera) on the combustion phase.

A strategic sector facing high costs

The aviation sector accounts for between 2% and 3% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and alternative fuels are seen as one of the few available solutions to reduce its environmental impact in the short term.

SAFs can be produced from biomass, used cooking oils or hydrogen derived from low-carbon electricity. However, these processes remain technically complex and expensive, currently limiting their large-scale deployment.

Increasing regulatory pressure on airlines

Since 2025, European Union regulations have required at least 2% of jet fuel for flights departing EU airports to be composed of SAF. This share is expected to reach 6% by 2030, and progressively rise to 70% by 2050, forcing airlines and suppliers to scale up quickly.

The withdrawal of Global Bioenergies highlights the difficulty emerging players face in establishing themselves in a market that is still in its early stages, despite tightening regulations and growing industry interest.

The new facility is spacious, studded with public art, and Pittsburgh proud down to its smallest details — something Allegheny County Airport Authority CEO Christina Cassotis says is by design.
And the most basic is [we were] running an airport while we’re building one,” Cassotis says.
“We took a lot of time to work on universal access principles,” Cassotis says.
While building the new terminal, the airport also became the first in the world powered by a self-contained electrical microgrid.","While framed as a much-needed rightsizing, the transformation of Pittsburgh International Airport also feels like a coming-of-age project for the airport and the region. The new facility is spacious, studded with public art, and Pittsburgh proud down to its smallest details — something Allegheny County Airport Authority CEO Christina Cassotis says is by design.

“I love things that tie this region’s history to its future,” Cassotis says.

Cassotis’ family has deep roots in air travel. Her father was a pilot, and she spent a career in commercial aviation and airport consulting before coming to Pittsburgh in 2015. “I have seen a lot of different business models, different operational models, different commercial models, and I have seen what resonates with certain types of passengers, where frustrations are as a traveler, as a consultant, as somebody representing a leadership team,” she tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We’re very, very curious and very interested in what works somewhere else that may work here.”

Actually bringing this lifetime of knowledge to bear on the new PIT terminal wasn’t straightforward. “When you’re building super-complex critical infrastructure, it’s always a challenge because you just have a lot of competing interests. And the most basic is [we were] running an airport while we’re building one,” Cassotis says. “I mean, it’s operating on a live patient.” But a holistic approach to bringing the new landside terminal online has kept the new airport progressing smoothly since a COVID-induced delay.

Because of that, Cassotis says airport staff has had the bandwidth to “sweat the small stuff,” including countless artistic touches and updated wayfinding — the garage, for example, combines accessible signage with Pittsburgh lore. “We took a lot of time to work on universal access principles,” Cassotis says. “Each level of the new terminal garage has a color, an icon, a name, and a number. So the fifth floor of the new terminal garage is, of course, black and gold, and it’s called the City of Champions, and the symbol is a trophy.”

This attention to detail shows up everywhere in the new building, even in spaces closed to the public. Cassotis notes, for example, features to ease flight crew travel and conversion of the airport’s old baggage tunnel into part of the airport’s “green spine.” Work on this and other outdoor spaces and airport sustainability (PIT is notably home to solar arrays and an on-site apiary) continues to be a part of Cassotis’ day-to-day following the terminal’s public debut in November. While building the new terminal, the airport also became the first in the world powered by a self-contained electrical microgrid. The airport authority is considering additional ways to bring sustainability to the skies next year and beyond.

“​​We’ve got our eyes on this sustainable aviation fuel, [which is] an ASTM-certified fuel that the U.S. Air Force has already flown with,” Cassotis says. “This is a big deal.” She says work on sustainable fuel will ramp up in the first quarter of 2026. In the interim, she says the airport will be focused on collecting feedback from passengers and seeing how the new terminal’s opening weeks go.

“To me, it’s very much an ending, but it’s a huge beginning, too,” she says. “I love being part of this, so I’m not going anywhere.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.pghcitypaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/POY-ChristinaCassotis-Business-1.jpg?fit=900%2C599&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-03 02:57:11.234099

The initiative brings together the ministry, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Airways and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) in what officials described as a coordinated national approach to research-based climate action.

Assistant Undersecretary for the ministry, Ahamed Mohammed Al Sada, said the ministry is placing greater emphasis on scientific research and innovation to address environmental challenges. He noted that the projects reflect growing cooperation between government entities, academic institutions and the aviation industry.

‘This partnership unites academic expertise, regulatory capabilities and operational experience,’ he said, adding that the work supports Qatar’s 2024–2030 climate strategy and its commitments under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA framework.

Environmental and engineering adviser to the ministry, Dr Mohammed Saif Al Kuwari, highlighted the economic importance of the aviation sector and the need to reduce its climate impact. He said research indicates that sustainable aviation fuels can reduce emissions by up to 80 percent compared with conventional jet fuel, and that multisector collaboration is essential for future commercial viability.

From a regulatory perspective, Acting President of QCAA, Mohammed bin Faleh Al Hajri, said the global aviation sector is undergoing significant change as countries work toward decarbonisation. He noted that Qatar Airways is a key partner in testing alternative fuels and emerging technologies.

Al Hajri said that low-carbon fuels can serve as a practical interim step towards wider SAF adoption and called for clearer international standards under ICAO to support investment and market development.

The five research projects cover areas including producing SAF from local resources, assessing long-term environmental and economic impacts, and examining how sustainable fuels can be incorporated into Qatar’s aviation infrastructure.

Officials stated that the findings will help inform policy decisions and contribute to Qatar’s role in the international transition to lower-emissions aviation. The initiative aligns with broader national plans to support low-carbon growth and environmental innovation.

Greenda possesses technology that converts fried food scraps—materials that were rarely recycled—into high-purity Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) feedstock.
Producing SAF feedstock from food waste is the first commercial case in Korea.
Amid these strengthening international regulations, Greenda's technology for producing SAF feedstock from food waste is drawing increased attention for its growth potential.
Through this funding round, Greenda is set to establish itself as a leading company in Korea’s SAF industry.” Hwang Kyu-yong, CEO of Greenda, commented, “Waste that was previously discarded is now being reborn as jet fuel feedstock through our technology.","Greenda, an eco-friendly resource circulation technology company, announced on the 3rd that it has officially begun a Series A funding round worth 3 billion won. This move follows a surge in sales, which grew by over 2,000% this year compared to 300 million won last year.

Greenda possesses technology that converts fried food scraps—materials that were rarely recycled—into high-purity Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) feedstock. Producing SAF feedstock from food waste is the first commercial case in Korea. The company currently operates facilities capable of producing more than 10,000 tons annually. In May of this year, Greenda obtained International Sustainability and Carbon Certification EU (ISCC EU), completing its SAF feedstock value chain from raw material collection to production, quality control, and delivery. With certification-based management throughout the production process, the company is accelerating partnerships with overseas refiners and fuel suppliers.

SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel, making it a core element of the global aviation industry’s carbon neutrality strategies. The European Union (EU) will mandate a 2% SAF blend starting in 2025 and plans to increase this to over 63% by 2050. South Korea is also preparing to require at least 1% SAF adoption for international flights beginning in 2027. Amid these strengthening international regulations, Greenda's technology for producing SAF feedstock from food waste is drawing increased attention for its growth potential.

Nam-Gi Min, Senior Investment Manager at Bluepoint, stated, “Greenda is a company that has proven its rapid growth in the SAF market, its waste upcycling technology, and its global scalability based on international certification. Through this funding round, Greenda is set to establish itself as a leading company in Korea’s SAF industry.”

Hwang Kyu-yong, CEO of Greenda, commented, “Waste that was previously discarded is now being reborn as jet fuel feedstock through our technology. With this Series A funding, we plan to expand our nationwide collection network and storage infrastructure, laying the groundwork for full-scale entry into the global SAF feedstock supply chain.”

To meet this surge, African airlines will take delivery of more than 1,200 new airplanes over the next two decades.
Beyond the direct impact of airlines, aviation’s multiplier effect will continue to power tourism, trade, foreign direct investment, and logistics development.

Driven by a youthful and rapidly urbanizing population, an expanding middle class, and sustained investment in airports and intra-continental connectivity, the region’s commercial fleet is projected to more than double from today’s levels to 1,680 aircraft by 2044. To meet this surge, African airlines will take delivery of more than 1,200 new airplanes over the next two decades.

Single-aisle aircraft will dominate demand, accounting for roughly 70% of new deliveries (865 units), reflecting the rise of low-cost carriers and the expansion of domestic and regional networks linking secondary cities across the continent and to nearby Europe and the Middle East.

“Aviation is a catalyst for Africa’s economic expansion and intra-continental connection, building on industry growth we’ve seen across the region over the last 20 years,” said Shahab Matin, Boeing managing director of Commercial Marketing for Middle East and Africa. “More efficient, versatile airplanes – paired with investments and strategies to make air travel more accessible to more Africans – will unlock further growth opportunities for the region’s airlines and hubs.”

Key Highlights from Boeing’s 2025 Africa CMO (2025–2044)

Passenger traffic growth: ~6% per year, among the highest of any global region

Fleet expansion: From current levels to 1,680 aircraft by 2044

New airplane deliveries: 1,205

Single-aisle: 865

Widebody: 240

Regional jets: 90

Dedicated freighters: 10

Aftermarket services demand: ~$130 billion (maintenance, repairs, training, spares, and modifications)

New aviation personnel required: 74,000 pilots, technicians, and cabin crew

Widebody demand will be driven by fleet modernization and ambitious long-haul expansion plans by flagship carriers targeting Europe, Asia, and North America, while a modest but steady need for dedicated freighters underscores Africa’s growing role in global e-commerce and perishable export corridors.

Beyond the direct impact of airlines, aviation’s multiplier effect will continue to power tourism, trade, foreign direct investment, and logistics development. Every new route and frequency creates thousands of indirect jobs in hospitality, ground handling, manufacturing, and supply-chain services.

The outlook arrives as African governments and the African Union push forward the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) and as new terminal and runway projects come online in cities such as Accra, Addis Ababa, Lagos, Abidjan, and Kigali. Combined with the proliferation of low-cost business models, these developments are making air travel affordable for a broader segment of the continent’s 1.4 billion people.

The GEnx stands as GE Aerospace’s fastest-selling high-thrust engine to date and powers more than two-thirds of all Boeing 787 aircraft currently in operation.
Built for the Challenge The long-haul flights the GEnx engine powers traverse some of Earth’s harshest environments.
In November, a GEnx engine that has been operating since 2021 in the Middle East surpassed 4,000 cycles with the new HPT blade design.
The GEnx engine has 1.4% better specific fuel consumption than the competition for a typical 3,000 nautical-mile mission.","In the mid-2000s, airlines around the world could see the global aviation market expanding. Knowing they had to meet the new demand, they were eager for improvements in three key areas: fuel efficiency, durability, and reliability — especially when it came to long-range, widebody aircraft. To deliver that aircraft, airframers needed engine makers to produce a step-change in engine technology.

Boeing responded with its 787 widebody aircraft, known as the “Dreamliner.” And GE Aerospace responded with a high-bypass, high-thrust, and more fuel efficient engine called the GEnx. The pairing of the GEnx engine with the 787 has been a success, to say the least.

The GEnx stands as GE Aerospace’s fastest-selling high-thrust engine to date and powers more than two-thirds of all Boeing 787 aircraft currently in operation. It also earned a spot underneath the wings of the Boeing 747-8, the final iteration of the legendary 747 family of aircraft. Today, there are nearly 4,400 GEnx engines in service or in the company’s production backlog — a testament to the aviation world’s overwhelming response to a new era of turbofan technology.

As the GEnx celebrates its fifteenth year of service in 2026, here are five things you should know about this groundbreaking engine.

Big Brother, Little Brother

In jet engine design, lessons learned during research and development are passed down from one product to the next. The GEnx engine is no exception. In fact, during its development phase, GE Aerospace engineers took to calling the engine the “little brother” of the GE90 engine.

The evidence is there for all to see. The GE90 engine was the first commercial jet engine to feature lighter, more durable carbon-fiber composite fan blades, a major visual departure from traditional titanium blades. The GEnx engine features the next generation of those iconic fan blades, using four fewer blades than the GE90 engine, for a total of 18, to produce up to 78,000 pounds of thrust.

Built for the Challenge

The long-haul flights the GEnx engine powers traverse some of Earth’s harshest environments. In particular, hot, sandy, and dusty environments seen in the Middle East and South Asia can pose a challenge to the finely-tuned rotating parts in an engine’s core.

GE Aerospace engineers have diligently worked on solutions over the GEnx’s nearly 15 years in revenue service, including redesigns of the stage 1 high-pressure turbine blade and specialized durability coating for the combustor. These sophisticated upgrades to the GEnx’s high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades and more resilient coating technology for the combustor have more than doubled the GEnx engine’s time on wing in harsh environments. In November, a GEnx engine that has been operating since 2021 in the Middle East surpassed 4,000 cycles with the new HPT blade design.

GE Aerospace’s 360 Foam Wash, an advanced cleaning process that removes dirt and debris from engines, has also enabled improvements in both durability and fuel efficiency.

Today, the engine boasts a 99.98% dispatch reliability rate and stays on-wing at a rate three times higher than competing engines.

Efficient from the Start

Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner is heralded for its advances in overall efficiency and fuel savings. A central piece of the Dreamliner’s efficiency story comes from its engines.

The GEnx engine has 1.4% better specific fuel consumption than the competition for a typical 3,000 nautical-mile mission. Since a significant portion of an airline’s operating cost is fuel, that 1.4% difference over time can result in substantial savings for customers.

The GEnx engine was designed with efficiency in mind from the start, offering 15% better fuel efficiency than previous GE Aerospace engines in its thrust class. Weight savings in the engine are driven by advanced composite materials in both the fan blades and fan case, as well as titanium aluminum blades in the low-pressure turbine.

A Star Performer

As the adage goes in sports, sometimes the best ability is availability. The same can be true for airlines and their engine fleets: It’s critical for airlines to know their engines can perform reliably.

The GEnx engine delivers, boasting 6% higher utilization over the past 12 months compared to competing engines. That 6% utilization translates to seven more days per year of aircraft availability — ultimately meaning fewer disruptions to airlines and their customers.

Playing the Long Game

In 2019, 49 passengers and crew became part of an aviation milestone when they spent 19 hours and 16 minutes aboard a GEnx-powered 787 that traveled non-stop for the 10,066 mile journey from New York to Sydney. The flight was part of Project Sunrise, a test flight operated by Australian carrier Qantas to study the effect of ultra long-haul flights on passengers and crew. The GEnx engine’s superior fuel burn and reliability were critical elements of that successful flight, demonstrating how the power it provides to the Dreamliner could create all-new route flexibility and revenue opportunities for airlines.",https://www.geaerospace.com/news/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/GEnx_GE_Peebles_0177%20resize.jpg?itok=KjpKFCLa,N,,2025-12-02 19:56:10.118860

UC’s new CryoLab is the only cryogenics research team in New Zealand that combines cutting edge R&D in cryogenic refrigeration, and consulting to industry in cryogenics, fluids and thermodynamics.

A new CryoLab opening at UC will strengthen New Zealand’s capability in cryogenic research, consulting, and emerging technologies.

Opening this afternoon in Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, the CryoLab will become Aotearoa New Zealand’s only research group combining cutting-edge cryogenic refrigeration research and development as well as consulting to industry in cryogenics, fluids and thermodynamics. University of Canterbury (UC) Principal Researcher Dr Alan Caughley will give a presentation at the opening, ‘At the Cryo-Tech Frontier’, and guests will then tour the new lab facilities.

Following the disestablishment of Callaghan Innovation’s Christchurch-based cryogenics operations, UC has provided a new home for the CryoLab team and its specialised equipment. The facility will support consulting for industry requirements and research opportunities for master’s and PhD students.

“CryoLab represents a powerful opportunity for collaboration between academia and industry,” Professor Stefanie Gutschmidt, Head of UC’s Mechanical Engineering Department, says. “The expertise of our researchers, combined with strong partnerships across the engineering and aerospace sectors, means we can accelerate innovation in areas that matter for Aotearoa and the world. We’re proud to provide a permanent home for this highly specialised capability.

”Cryogenics is a key enabler for technologies that rely on extremely low temperatures, including MRI scanners, superconductors, night-vision systems, low-noise sensors, satellites, space telescopes, biological storage, quantum computing and cryogenic fuels such as liquefied natural gas and liquid hydrogen — an emerging sustainable aviation fuel that must also be cooled to temperatures below –250°C.”

Much of this work is made possible by cryocoolers: small-scale mechanical refrigerators that are enabling breakthroughs in aerospace, medical and sensing technologies.

CryoLab’s flagship research programme focuses on providing cooling for a superconducting motor intended to power electric aircraft. The motor aims to replace conventional jet engines, enabling major efficiency gains while working with liquid hydrogen as a clean fuel. This technology is significant for New Zealand’s growing aerospace sector and contributes to global efforts to electrify aviation.

Dr Alan Caughley, Principal Researcher at CryoLab says cryogenics underpins the development of other cutting-edge technologies. “Cryogenics has increasingly become part of high-tech conversations. Over the past few decades it has become a crucial enabler for superconductors, night-vision systems, low-noise sensors, satellites, space telescopes, biological storage and quantum computing — made possible through small-scale mechanical cryocoolers.

“In the early 2000s, our Christchurch cryogenics programme developed a mid-sized, mid-temperature cryogenic refrigerator robust enough to operate 24/7 in electrical power environments — technology that is now central to Christchurch-based company Fabrum’s cryogenics business. Our team later contributed to superconducting motor development for electric aviation.

“The new CryoLab at UC allows us to continue this trajectory, advancing the superconducting aircraft motor project and supporting a wide range of consulting work powered by our expertise in fluids, thermodynamics, and modelling.”",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 21:56:59.978971

Oil and gas heavyweights went deal hunting just as energy prices and sector stocks slipped, locking in new supply agreements and circling major oil and gas fields from Africa to the Middle East.

What does this mean?

Energy markets softened, with West Texas Intermediate crude down 1.2% to $58.64 a barrel, Brent crude off 1.2% to $62.43, and Henry Hub natural gas falling 1.9% to $4.83 per million BTU. That weakness spilled into stocks: the NYSE Energy Sector Index lost 1%, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) slipped 1.3%, and the Dow Jones US Utilities Index eased 0.7%, even as the Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index eked out a small gain. Yet instead of hitting pause, the industry’s big names leaned in. Shell signed a long-term offtake deal to buy all the sustainable aviation fuel produced at Egypt’s first planned commercial-scale SAF facility, and Exxon Mobil reportedly approached Iraq’s oil ministry about taking over Lukoil’s majority stake in the giant West Qurna 2 oilfield. At the same time, TotalEnergies emerged as the leading bidder for half of Galp’s 80% stake in Namibia’s Mopane discovery and secured fresh equity backing for its Mozambique LNG project after export credit agencies stepped back – clear signs that long-term supply and resource access matter more to these firms than short-term price wobbles.

Why should I care?

For markets: Deals keep flowing even when prices cool.

Energy benchmarks might be under pressure, but capital is still on the move. ONE Gas laid out a hefty plan with about $800 million of capital investments in 2026 and roughly $4.30 billion through 2030, paired with targeted 2026 earnings of $4.65 to $4.77 per share. Add in Shell’s long-term SAF commitments and TotalEnergies’ push into Namibia and Mozambique, and you get a clear message: big players are betting on steady demand for oil, gas, and lower-carbon fuels well into the future. For investors, that hints that today’s softer prices and a 1–1.3% pullback in broad energy ETFs haven’t dented management confidence in projects that can run for decades. The gap between short-term price dips and aggressive deal-making could open up valuation mismatches within the sector, especially between asset-light service firms – already holding up better, as the slightly positive Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index shows – and capital-heavy producers and utilities.

The study, carried out by the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), highlights a range of viable feedstocks, including agricultural residues and municipal solid waste.

Presenting the report, Cesar Velarde from ICAO’s Office of Environment said SAF development would help Uganda cut aviation emissions by up to 80–90% over a fuel’s full lifecycle while also strengthening the circular economy.

“This marks the beginning of a new path for the future of aviation,” Velarde said. “Uganda can reduce its reliance on traditional fuels and create opportunities across agriculture, waste management and energy.”

The findings support ICAO’s global targets and mirror trends in regions such as the EU, India and Brazil, where mandatory SAF use is already under way. With this confirmation of local feedstock potential, Uganda could position itself as a regional frontrunner in green aviation.

Next Steps: A Business Case to Attract Investors

Following the feasibility results, UCAA will lead a business implementation study aimed at shaping a viable SAF project and attracting industry partners. According to UCAA Deputy Director General Olive Birungi Lumonya, the report shows Uganda can meet its commitments, including Africa’s 5% aviation emissions-reduction goal.

Lumonya added that companies like Tri-star have already expressed readiness to adjust their systems for SAF blending and production.

Government and Industry Support Growing

Ronny Barongo, UCAA’s Director of Safety, Security and Economic Regulation, thanked ICAO and the UK government for supporting the study. He emphasised Uganda’s broader commitment to environmental protection and its ongoing participation in ICAO’s CORSIA scheme since 2019.

“The release of this SAF report is timely and marks a major turning point,” Barongo said. “We remain committed to innovation, sustainability and ensuring Uganda keeps pace with global aviation trends.”

Barongo noted that coordinated action, supportive government policies and long-term investment will be essential to make SAF production a reality.

A Pathway to Regional Leadership in Green Aviation

With its strong feedstock potential, growing policy support and increasing investor interest, Uganda is well placed to become a regional leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel production.

,,2025-12-02 20:05:31+00:00,www.ecoaero.org,Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel worth it for Military Aviation? By Aviraj Dastidar - EcoAero,Not Available,,,,,https://www.ecoaero.org/article/saf-military-aviation,"In 2023, the United States Department of Defense awarded a series of contracts cumulatively worth 65 million dollars to a sustainable aviation fuel startup called Air Company .
This deal is just one example in a series of multi-million-dollar efforts and expenditures by the United States military to invest in green technologies.
Expenditures on sustainable aviation fuel research would play a key role in assuaging all of these concerns.
Sustainable aviation fuel is primarily made by converting feedstocks into usable fuel , which means its domestic production can easily be facilitated, especially in the United States, where the agriculture industry is worth over 1.5 trillion dollars .
Some may argue that, from a financial standpoint, sustainable aviation fuels are less appealing than conventional fuels (indeed, SAFs are generally 120-700% more expensive than their traditional counterparts ).","In 2023, the United States Department of Defense awarded a series of contracts cumulatively worth 65 million dollars to a sustainable aviation fuel startup called Air Company . This deal is just one example in a series of multi-million-dollar efforts and expenditures by the United States military to invest in green technologies. Naturally, the scale of such expenditures on sustainable aerospace technologies in defense contexts begets the question of whether such research is fiscally wise to undertake. Some may argue that because military operations are a much smaller contributor to greenhouse gas emissions than civilian aviation (military and defense activities around the world account for approximately 1% of all greenhouse gas emissions , while civilian aviation is responsible for around 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions ), air forces and military aviation units around the world should limit expenditures on sustainable aerospace technology, arguing that such budgetary allocations would be more effective in other areas.

However, there is a very strong case from a strategic and financial perspective to support the use of defense funding to research these sustainable aviation technologies. Consider that in 2018, the United States Air Force consumed over two billion gallons of fuel . The procurement of said fuel requires oil, and despite being the largest domestic producer of oil in the world, the United States still relies on trade with foreign nation-states (especially those in the Middle East) in order to fully meet its energy demands. However, when tensions flare in the Middle East, the price of oil tends to skyrocket (consider the Arab Oil Embargo in the 1970s, the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the First Gulf War in 1991, three separate instances of conflict in the Middle East directly leading to the price of oil doubling). In addition to oil itself becoming more expensive whenever turmoil brews in the region, the safety of the oil pipeline from the Gulf States to the United States enters a state of jeopardy. In particular, the 700,000 barrels of crude oil per day (accounting for 11% of all US crude oil imports) that the US obtains via ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz is at exceptionally high risk because of Iran’s proximity to the chokepoint.

In other words, in order for the United States Air Force and other military aviation units to remain properly fueled for their operations, they must rely on (among other things) the cooperation of OPEC, a high level of stability in the Middle East, the ability to freely navigate the Strait of Hormuz, and for there to be no major disruptions in global maritime trade networks. In practice, what this means is that the United States military is at risk of either purchasing needed fuel at an elevated rate or, worse yet, having its fuel supply compromised.

Expenditures on sustainable aviation fuel research would play a key role in assuaging all of these concerns. Sustainable aviation fuel is primarily made by converting feedstocks into usable fuel , which means its domestic production can easily be facilitated, especially in the United States, where the agriculture industry is worth over 1.5 trillion dollars . Having an alternative energy source to conventional fuels would also reduce reliance on crude oil, which, as addressed before, has the potential to be not only strategically dangerous but also financially inefficient for the United States military.

Some may argue that, from a financial standpoint, sustainable aviation fuels are less appealing than conventional fuels (indeed, SAFs are generally 120-700% more expensive than their traditional counterparts ). However, a large reason for this is that the technology is still in its infancy. Continued research expenditures into these systems is the antidote to this issue: further studies will enable the discovery of new production techniques and distribution systems to make production more affordable, and increased usage of SAFs themselves would itself lower the cost per gallon because the bulk production rate of such fuels would go down.

Ultimately, while some may be hesitant about the usage of taxpayer dollars on researching sustainable aviation fuels for the military, in practice, such an investment would be incredibly wise, not only in terms of ensuring the strategic security of the US military but also in terms of making US military aviation operations more affordable in the long run from a fuel expenditure standpoint.

The agreement was signed by Mr. Abderahmane Berthé, Secretary-General of AFRAA, and Mr. Kwame Bekoe, Chief Executive Officer of AfriSAF, during a ceremony that underscored the urgency and opportunity for Africa to play a leading role in the global transition to low-carbon aviation.

The partnership creates a structured framework for collaboration in five critical areas:

Advocacy and policy development – leveraging AFRAA’s influence with governments and regulators and AfriSAF’s technical expertise to shape SAF-enabling policies and national decarbonisation roadmaps.

Capacity building – joint design and delivery of training programmes, workshops, and educational resources covering the entire SAF value chain, from feedstock cultivation to sustainability certification and commercial models.

Project pipeline development – co-creating a portfolio of bankable SAF production projects, with AfriSAF handling technical feasibility, engineering, and design phases while AFRAA mobilises airline offtake commitments to de-risk investments.

Resource mobilisation – coordinated outreach to development finance institutions, climate funds, and impact investors to unlock grants and concessional finance for project preparation.

Sustainable feedstock supply chains – expansion of traceable, deforestation-free feedstock networks using AfriSAF’s digital traceability platform and joint advocacy for international recognition of African SAF pathways under schemes such as CORSIA and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.

Speaking at the signing, AFRAA Secretary-General Abderahmane Berthé declared: “This collaboration with AfriSAF marks a major step in supporting African airlines on their decarbonisation journey. SAF is essential to the future of sustainable aviation, and Africa has immense potential to become a competitive global supplier. Through this partnership, AFRAA will lead the African airlines’ agenda on decarbonisation, ensuring the region’s maximum contribution towards global carbon-neutral growth by 2050.”

AfriSAF CEO Kwame Bekoe added: “Africa has one of the world’s largest untapped volumes of sustainable biomass suitable for SAF production. By combining AfriSAF’s feedstock intelligence, project development capabilities, and digital traceability tools with AFRAA’s industry leadership, we are creating the conditions for Africa to lead in global aviation sustainability. This MOU catalyses a new era of SAF development on the continent.”

The partnership arrives at a pivotal moment. Global aviation has committed to net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, and SAF is widely regarded as the most viable near- to medium-term solution for long-haul flights. Yet Africa currently produces virtually no commercial-scale SAF, despite possessing abundant sustainable feedstock resources—ranging from agricultural residues and municipal waste to dedicated energy crops on marginal lands.

Industry analysts estimate that Africa could supply 10–20% of global SAF demand by 2040 if the right policy, investment, and partnership conditions are put in place. The AFRAA–AfriSAF alliance is designed to deliver exactly those conditions.

The two organisations have already begun mapping priority countries and feedstock clusters and are preparing a joint SAF investment prospectus to present to international climate funds and development banks in early 2026.

With African air traffic projected to grow faster than any other region over the next two decades, the continent now has a unique opportunity to build a greener aviation ecosystem from the ground up—rather than retrofitting legacy systems. Today’s MOU signals that Africa’s airlines and SAF developers are determined to seize that opportunity together.",https://airspace-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/afrisaf.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:57:46.587175

,,2025-12-02 16:01:02+00:00,Vogue Scandinavia,“We see more green juice on board than champagne”: The new jet set are flying private differently,Not Available,,,,,https://www.voguescandinavia.com/articles/the-new-jet-set,"Private aviation usage reflects this: aviation industry data platform WingX ranks Sweden eighth in Europe for private jet flights in the first half of 2025.
“Private aviation is the best efficiency tool to give people their time back,” he continues.
Private aviation wasn’t always synonymous with history-making feats or on-the-clock optimisation.
“Business travel is back, it just looks different than before,” says Kelly.
Hedge fund and analysts use private jet flight tracking data to gain an edge by predicting upcoming M&A deals before they are publicly announced (a fitting Succession plot line, if we’ve ever heard one).","In May of 1927, Charles Lindbergh – 25 years old, sleep-deprived, and half-frozen – descended through the Parisian night sky in his custom-built, single-engine, high-wing aircraft ‘The Spirit of St. Louis’. Having set off from a muddy, rain-soaked runway on Long Island, he had flown for 33.5 hours alone, navigating storm clouds, turbulence, fog, and bouts of hallucination to complete the first ever non-stop transatlantic flight. On arrival, Lindbergh circled the Eiffel Tower before landing at Le Bourget airfield, where 150,000 people were waiting. Attendees surged toward him, ripped open the cockpit, and carried him across the tarmac on their shoulders, a celebration that ended with trophy hunters tearing the aircraft apart.

Lindbergh was half-Swedish; his father hailed from Smedstorp in Skåne, a fact often buried beneath his legend. But in many ways, that detail is uncannily relevant now. Private aviation’s latest chapter, like its earliest, has a profound connection to Sweden and the Nordics’ particular relationship with flight: pragmatic, efficient and discreetly ambitious. That may explain why, nearly a century after Lindbergh’s history-making flight, our region has become a nucleus for new-era air travel. The Nordics are among Europe’s most resilient economies, Sweden being a hub of private wealth boasting more than 520 centi-millionaires and over one trillion US dollars in assets under management, according to Knight Frank and Henley & Partners report in 2024. Private aviation usage reflects this: aviation industry data platform WingX ranks Sweden eighth in Europe for private jet flights in the first half of 2025.

But where Lindbergh navigated by dead reckoning (he rejected radio navigation gear as heavy and unreliable), today’s elite travellers are in search of something equally elusive: taste and time. “You can’t buy more hours in the day, but you can spend them better,” says Mats Leander, president of the Nordics and Eastern Europe at VistaJet, a subscription-based private aviation company. “Private aviation is the best efficiency tool to give people their time back,” he continues.

For Brian Kelly, founder of website The Points Guy and a travel cultural analyst, the shift in values is palpable. “People still want premium,” he says. “But the markers have changed. Privacy, personalisation, and time, they’re the real luxuries now.” Kelly points to a broader segmentation across travel: “Even in business class, it’s no longer one-size-fits-all,” he says. “In Lufthansa’s new Allegris Business Class, there are over five seating options. British Airways now charges to choose a seat, even if you paid for a Business Class ticket. So, segmentation is the biggest thing I see happening.” With private flight being perhaps the ultimate segment in the market, it seems that, as commercial prices climb, private aviation is starting to make sense for more people – especially for those who can’t afford delays. “Private travel is all about convenience and saving time since airports are as packed as ever, with a record number of travellers going through while airports have, generally, not gotten bigger,” adds Kelly.

Private aviation wasn’t always synonymous with history-making feats or on-the-clock optimisation. During the golden age of ‘Come Fly With Me’, Frank Sinatra lugged his Rat Pack around in a dual-prop plane he dubbed ‘El Dago’, which came complete with a full bar and a piano and helped codify the myth of flying private as something raucous, romantic, and deeply male. Elvis and Priscilla borrowed that same plane to go get married in Las Vegas. The Beatles flew it. The ‘Jet Set’, a term coined by The New York Times in 1951, became shorthand for a glamorous world where proximity to a cocktail cart was as important as your passport stamp count.

By the early 2000s, the Bling Ring era of aviation saw the likes of Paris Hilton clutching her Chihuahua boarding Gulfstreams. It was a champagne-laced level of hyper luxury that was synonymous with diamanté velour track suits, Motorola Razr phones, and staged paparazzi tarmac walks with silver monogrammed Rimowa suitcases. It was the sort of Y2K pop princess look of Juicy Couture revivalism now championed by Zara Larsson. But that is not the VistaJet client of today. Theirs is a low-profile traveller, more akin to Alexander Skarsgård’s Succession character Lukas Matsson than a member of the Entourage set. “Our clients aren’t looking to show off,” says Leander. “In fact, today, we see more green juice on board than champagne.”

Founded in 2004 by Swiss entrepreneur Thomas Flohr, VistaJet recognised the shift to that excess and rejected the traditional ownership and charter models in favour of a sleek, subscription-based service. Effectively, this brought the on-demand logic of Spotify and Netflix to the skies. Travellers don’t own a plane (no depreciating asset on the books) and wherever they are in the world, they have access to an identical fleet – in VistaJet’s case, a global fleet of more than 350 aircraft guaranteed to be ready for take-off within 24 hours.

Still, the question of emissions can’t be ignored. Aviation accounts for around two and a half per cent of global CO₂ emissions, and private jets, for all their glamour, are famously inefficient. VistaJet doesn’t pretend otherwise. What they do instead is measure obsessively, report transparently, and invest aggressively. In 2025 alone, the company purchased over 27 million litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the equivalent of 11 Olympic swimming pools and 10 flights to the moon, for example. But why, in our digital age, do we feel the need to travel for business at all? “Business travel is back, it just looks different than before,” says Kelly. “It’s changed in that people travel on a less frequent basis but companies have more off-sites and in-person bonding.”

In the Nordics, Leander and his peers see two typical types of private jet travellers: “It’s multinationals and entrepreneurs,” he says. “People who need to be in Munich one day, back in Oslo for a shareholder meeting the next, and closing an infrastructure deal in Singapore two days later.” These are not the people who Instagram their in-flight meals. They’re business leaders who need flexibility, with zero risk of cancellation, delays or missed flights. And, most importantly, privacy. Hedge fund and analysts use private jet flight tracking data to gain an edge by predicting upcoming M&A deals before they are publicly announced (a fitting Succession plot line, if we’ve ever heard one). One of the main perks of travelling private through a subscription model rather than owning your own (or a fraction of a) PJ is the fact that you remain, well, private. Entirely untraceable on flight scanners. VistaJet and its fleet facilitate just that.

And what a fleet it is: feather down duvets, Egyptian cotton bed linen, cashmere blankets, tableware by French heritage brand Christofle on every flight; Moncler-designed crew uniforms and a specially made Le Labo scent diffusing through the cabin. There are in-air sleep programmes, in-flight facial treatments developed with Dr Barbara Sturm, and crew trained in child psychology (and as sommeliers, though hopefully not in the same session). On certain flights, the cabin can be pre-heated to accommodate exotic pets. One memorable passenger list included two elderly Great Danes, a cat, and a Sulcata tortoise, with the floor warmed to mimic the latter’s natural desert habitat.

Today we see more green juice on board than champagne

It all sounds absurd until you realise that, like Lindbergh, these travellers are still crossing oceans with a very precise purpose. Unlike Lindbergh, they’re doing it in comfort, without frostbite or a pocket compass. And waiting for these modern travellers upon arrival are not the parades or paparazzi of yore, but performance metrics and boardrooms. Still, some things haven’t changed. When Lindbergh looked down at the earth from above the Atlantic, he described the view as “too beautiful, too wonderful, too distant for human eyes to see”. That’s something no class of cabin can commodify. The view from 40,000 feet still has the power to humble you, whether you’re sipping green juice or champagne.

Developed with Apical, the €1.2 billion project is part of Southern Europe’s largest second-generation renewable fuels complex and will create about 2,000 direct and indirect jobs, strengthening Huelva’s role as a major energy and technology hub.
The facility will add up to 500,000 tons per year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (HVO), doubling Moeve’s total capacity to one million tons annually.
As one of Spain’s three largest industrial projects underway, it supports national reindustrialization and leadership in green fuels.
Once operational, the complex is expected to avoid three million tons of CO₂ emissions each year—around 4% of Spain’s road-transport emissions—helping decarbonize air, sea, land transport, and industrial sectors.","Moeve has announced that its new 2G biofuels plant at La Rábida Energy Park in Palos de la Frontera, is now over 50% complete.

The new pricing benchmarks are expected to help companies better manage their compliance with the UK’s SAF mandate. The assessments will allow industry participants to compare the cost of buying SAF certificates, blending physical bio-SAF produced from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) feedstock, and paying buy-out costs if they do not meet their obligations.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said that as SAF mandates continue to increase, companies will need dependable pricing not only for the fuel but also for certificates. He said the agency has worked closely with industry stakeholders to create the new assessment, which is designed to bring greater transparency as the aviation sector adapts to stricter carbon-reduction rules.

The new benchmark will track certificate prices that qualify for meeting the UK SAF mandate and are based on SAF produced using HEFA feedstock. These certificates, which are tradeable, are issued when eligible SAF is supplied in the UK and are later used by obligated companies to fulfil their mandate requirements. The system allows firms that exceed their quota to sell surplus certificates to companies that need them.

Beginning in 2025, jet fuel suppliers in the UK must blend 2% SAF into domestic aviation fuel deliveries. The mandate will rise each year, reaching 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. As these targets grow, transparent prices for UK SAF certificates are expected to become increasingly important.

The new SAF certificate price adds to Argus’ existing assessments for tradeable biofuel tickets used for road transport mandates in the UK and several EU nations. The agency also provides a range of physical SAF prices in northwest Europe, including those for HEFA-based SAF and modelled production costs for electrolytic SAF (e-SAF).",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-12-02 10:57:12.844125

Grazia Vittadini, chief technology officer of Lufthansa Group, said: “We embed sustainability where it has the most immediate impact - in the day-to-day operations of our airlines.
“Our Ops Sustainability programme is already delivering measurable efficiency gains and environmental improvements.
The company said this film “mimics the aerodynamic properties of shark skin” and helps to reduce drag – leading to lower fuel consumption and a CO2 emissions reduction of around 1 per cent per flight.
Alongside these fuel efficiency gains, the group is also focused on the increased use of alternative aviation fuels, including its “green fares” and other initiatives to encourage the further uptake of these fuels by corporate clients.","Lufthansa Group has set new targets for reducing CO2 emissions from its operations over the next few years.

The aviation giant, which also owns Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings, said it had managed to “permanently avoid’ 170,000 tonnes of CO2 since 2022 through 90 separate projects.

Lufthansa said that it now aimed to avoid another 50,000 tonnes of CO2 annually by the end of 2028, which corresponds to a kerosene fuel “saving” of 15,200 metric tonnes.

Grazia Vittadini, chief technology officer of Lufthansa Group, said: “We embed sustainability where it has the most immediate impact - in the day-to-day operations of our airlines.

“Our Ops Sustainability programme is already delivering measurable efficiency gains and environmental improvements. At the same time, we are investing more than ever in highly fuel-efficient, state-of-the-art aircraft.”

The sustainability programme, which was launched three years ago, has created a wide variety of projects to reduce carbon emissions by improving fuel efficiency. These include single-engine taxiing, flight route optimisation, lighter onboard equipment, electric ground vehicles and using AI to improve inflight catering services.

The group said the next stage of this process would see the increased use of digital applications to make operations more efficient, including “more precise” decisions on the amount of fuel needed for a flight, as well as optimised taxiing and approach procedures.

Another initiative is Lufthansa’s AeroSHARK surface technology project, which has produced a special film that has been applied to the surface of more than 20 aircraft. The company said this film “mimics the aerodynamic properties of shark skin” and helps to reduce drag – leading to lower fuel consumption and a CO2 emissions reduction of around 1 per cent per flight.
