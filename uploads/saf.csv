In an era when flying has become both more accessible and more exhausting, United Airlines is trying to prove that the U.S. legacy carrier can be more than a grudging default. From retrofitted cabins and massive widebody orders to a tech-forward app and sustainability experiments, United Airlines is positioning its product as the flagship experience for long-haul travelers who actually care what happens between takeoff and landing.

That may sound like branding spin, but the strategy is unusually concrete. United Airlines is simultaneously refreshing its domestic narrowbody fleet, doubling down on international widebodies, and rolling its signature United Polaris and United Premium Plus cabins across key global routes. Add to that its United Next growth plan, an aggressive expansion of its international network, and a renewed focus on operational reliability, and you get something rare in U.S. aviation: a coherent product story with clear bets on where premium demand is headed.

On the other side of that bet is the United Airlines Aktie, which lives and dies on whether all this capital spending actually translates into sustainable margins. Right now, the airline is trying to convince both passengers and investors that premium-heavy cabins and a global footprint are not a vanity play, but a long-term growth engine.

Inside the Flagship: United Airlines

For United Airlines, the product is the airline itself: the end-to-end experience that starts in its app and ends when you clear customs on the other side of the world. The airline has been rebuilding that experience around a few core pillars: premium cabins, a modernized fleet, a strong international network, and digital tools that don’t feel stuck in the early smartphone era.

Polaris: The international calling card

United Polaris is the business-class product that anchors the entire United Airlines brand. It was designed to fix United’s long-standing weakness in premium cabins versus Delta and foreign carriers like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines. The Polaris hard product includes a lie-flat seat with direct aisle access, staggered layout for privacy, and thoughtful storage. On the soft-product side you get upgraded bedding (developed with Saks Fifth Avenue), improved catering, and redesigned lounges at key hubs.

While not every long-haul aircraft has been updated at the same pace, the direction of travel is clear: United Airlines wants travelers to associate its name with a predictable, globally competitive business-class experience. On routes like Newark–London, San Francisco–Tokyo, and Chicago–Frankfurt, Polaris now sets the tone for United’s entire brand perception.

United Premium Plus and Economy Plus: Monetizing the middle

The airline’s other big product push is the cabin space between business and standard economy. United Premium Plus is its true premium economy cabin: wider seats, extra pitch, bigger screens, upgraded dining, and more checked baggage. This is aimed squarely at price-sensitive premium travelers and corporate travel policies that refuse to spring for full business class but are increasingly open to a middle tier.

Then there’s Economy Plus, United’s long-standing extra-legroom economy section. While every major U.S. carrier has some version of this, United Airlines has doubled down on consistently carving out these seats across both domestic and international fleets, turning legroom into an important ancillary revenue stream and a modest quality-of-life upgrade for frequent flyers.

Cabin refresh and United Next

The United Next initiative is the structural backbone of United Airlines’ product story. This plan includes thousands of new narrowbody aircraft and a retrofit program that installs seat-back screens and improved cabins across the domestic fleet. Where many airlines have leaned hard into BYOD (bring your own device) for entertainment, United’s strategy is hybrid: keep the free streaming and Wi?Fi, but also give passengers a dedicated screen and power at every seat.

That might sound like an incremental change, but for passengers used to bare-bones domestic cabins, the redesigned interiors—with larger overhead bins, USB and AC power, updated lighting, and more cohesive branding—make United Airlines feel like a unified product instead of a patchwork of old and new aircraft.

Network and hubs: Global reach as a feature

United Airlines leans heavily on its status as the most globally oriented of the big three U.S. carriers. While Delta has a strong transatlantic network and American leans into Latin America, United has built an especially deep presence across the Pacific and to secondary European and South Asian cities. Think San Francisco–Singapore, Newark–Cape Town, and Denver–Munich—routes that emphasize its strength in connecting tech centers, financial hubs, and growing leisure destinations.

Its major hubs—Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Denver, Houston, San Francisco, Washington Dulles, and Los Angeles—operate as the core of that network. For the end user, the breadth of the United Airlines network is a critical product feature: if you’re loyal, you can get almost anywhere on the planet with a single carrier and its Star Alliance partners.

Digital layer: The app as cockpit

United Airlines has also been unusually serious about its digital layer. The United app is now central to the airline’s product identity. It offers real-time flight and rebooking options, baggage tracking, dynamic seat maps, same-day change tools, and even inflight entertainment control on some aircraft. While app quality alone doesn’t fix delays or cancellations, it does dramatically shape how passengers experience disruption—and how forgiving they’re likely to be afterward.

From mobile boarding passes and automatic standby clearing to upgrading at the gate with one tap, United is trying to position its digital experience as a differentiator in a market where flying can often feel like a black box.

Market Rivals: United Airlines Aktie vs. The Competition

United Airlines doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Its product choices reverberate through a brutally competitive market defined by razor-thin margins and fickle business travelers. The most direct rivals are Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with their own distinct flagship products and strategies.

Delta Air Lines with Delta One and Delta Premium Select

Compared directly to Delta One, Delta’s long-haul business-class product, United Polaris is often seen as the more modern cabin on refitted aircraft, but Delta traditionally holds an edge on service consistency and soft product polish. Delta One’s suites on select aircraft include sliding doors, a feature United Airlines has not widely adopted, which appeals to privacy-obsessed premium travelers.

Delta’s Premium Select competes directly with United Premium Plus, offering a similar in-between cabin. Where Delta often shines is in operational reliability and on-time performance; a strong track record there makes its product feel less risky for corporate travel managers who care as much about punctuality as pillows.

American Airlines with Flagship Business and Premium Economy

Compared directly to American Airlines Flagship Business, United Polaris often wins on network breadth and lounge design but faces a mixed perception on consistency, since some United aircraft still lag behind the Polaris standard. American’s Flagship lounges and transcontinental business product remain competitive, but American has been less aggressive than United in announcing massive widebody orders or making long-haul expansion central to its identity.

Low-cost pressure from Southwest and international rivals

On domestic routes, the competitive heat comes from Southwest Airlines and ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier. These aren’t full analogues to United Airlines’ flagship product, but they redefine pricing expectations. For many leisure travelers, a cheap fare and two free checked bags from Southwest beat seat-back screens and global connectivity.

Internationally, carriers like Qatar Airways Qsuite and Singapore Airlines Business Class set the premium benchmark. United Airlines can’t always match those gold-standard experiences seat for seat, but it doesn’t have to. Its true competitive field is the U.S. big three plus European majors like Lufthansa and British Airways. Within that peer group, United’s decision to invest heavily in widebodies, Polaris, and a dense long-haul schedule makes it one of the more ambitious players.

Strengths and weaknesses in the current rivalry

United Airlines’ strengths versus these rivals are clear: a vast international network, particularly across the Pacific; a coherent, widely deployed business-class brand in Polaris; and a serious commitment to aircraft modernization. On the other hand, Delta’s reputation for service reliability and American’s strong loyalty base in certain corporate-heavy markets keep the rivalry tight.

From an investor lens, all three carriers’ stocks trade as leveraged plays on global travel demand, but the United Airlines Aktie is uniquely tied to the success of its international and premium strategy. If global business and high-yield leisure travel remain strong, United’s product may give it a higher ceiling. If those segments soften, its heavy capex and complex network become a risk.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

So why does United Airlines have a credible claim to leadership in this space? The answer lies in how its product strategy lines up with where travel patterns are heading.

1. Premium-heavy cabins mapped to real demand

United Airlines isn’t just slapping lie-flat seats on every route and hoping for the best. It has focused Polaris and United Premium Plus on city pairs where high-yield demand is structurally strong: tech corridors, financial centers, political capitals, and emerging tourism hubs with premium leisure traffic. That alignment allows United to justify its investment with higher average fares and better cabin load factors.

While Delta and American are also expanding premium cabins, United’s emphasis on widebodies and long-haul connectivity gives it more room to monetize those seats. This is especially true on routes where U.S. corporates, global consultancies, and tech giants dominate the front of the plane.

2. A unified cabin and tech story

The combination of retrofitted narrowbodies, large overhead bins, seat-back screens, universal power, and a feature-rich app means the United Airlines product feels coherent across aircraft types. That doesn’t fully erase regional jet headaches or occasional equipment swaps, but it moves the airline closer to the kind of consistent brand experience you expect from top international carriers.

Crucially, United isn’t betting everything on in-flight bells and whistles alone. Its digital layer—real-time rebooking, proactive notifications, and self-service tools—tackles one of air travel’s ugliest pain points: being trapped in information limbo when something goes wrong.

3. Network synergy with Star Alliance

United Airlines belongs to Star Alliance, the largest global airline alliance. That means its product doesn’t stop at the edge of its own fleet. A Polaris ticket from a U.S. hub to Europe can connect seamlessly onto Lufthansa, Swiss, or SAS. A trip to Asia can flow onto ANA or Singapore Airlines. This alliance integration amplifies the perceived value of United’s product for frequent travelers and corporate buyers who need network coverage more than they need a favorite logo on the tail.

4. Sustainability and fleet modernization

United Airlines has also been vocal about sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments and carbon reduction goals. While every major airline is talking up sustainability, United’s early and frequent commitments have turned it into something of a category leader in the public conversation. For large corporate customers with ESG goals, that matters—especially when selecting preferred carriers for corporate contracts.

The more modern fleet under United Next isn’t just about passenger comfort; it’s a fuel burn and operating cost story. Newer aircraft typically mean lower emissions and better economics, which in theory support both sustainability targets and long-term profitability.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The United Airlines Aktie, trading under the ISIN US9100471096, is closely intertwined with the fortunes of this evolving product strategy. As of the latest available market data pulled in real time, the stock reflects investors’ mixed but increasingly focused view on whether United’s premium and international bets will pay off.

Current stock snapshot

Based on recent data cross-checked from multiple financial platforms, including major market trackers, the United Airlines Aktie is trading in a range that reflects a recovery from pandemic-era lows but still discounts the airline relative to high-growth tech or consumer brands. The stock price and recent performance numbers are anchored to the last confirmed trading session rather than intraday speculation, underscoring how volatile airline equities can be around fuel prices, macroeconomic news, and travel demand headlines.

Because trading hours and quote availability can vary by exchange and time zone, the most reliable figure for analysis is the last close price available from those sources at the time of research. That closing quote serves as the baseline against which investors judge new capacity announcements, quarterly earnings, and any shocks to international travel demand.

How the product feeds the stock story

For investors, United Airlines is no longer just a volume play on domestic flying. The core thesis behind the United Airlines Aktie is that a premium-heavy, internationally skewed airline can generate higher revenue per available seat mile (RASM) and more resilient cash flow than a commodity carrier. The widespread rollout of Polaris, the growth of United Premium Plus, and the United Next fleet modernization program are all designed to support that thesis.

Premium seats drive outsized revenue contribution relative to their footprint on the aircraft. If United can keep those cabins full, especially on business-heavy routes, it can offset volatility in lower-yield economy cabins. Likewise, newer aircraft with better fuel efficiency and more seats per departure improve unit costs and margin potential. Both levers are directly linked to the perceived upside of United Airlines Aktie.

Risks and upside

The flip side is risk. Capital expenditures on new aircraft, cabin retrofits, lounges, and digital infrastructure are enormous. If global business travel underperforms, or if geopolitical shocks hit key long-haul markets, United Airlines could find itself with too much high-end capacity chasing too little premium demand. In that scenario, investors would likely punish the stock for overreaching.

But if international and premium leisure demand remain robust—and early post-pandemic patterns suggest these segments are structurally healthier than many expected—United Airlines’ product strategy offers real upside. A well-executed, premium-oriented, tech-enabled, globally networked airline has a better chance of convincing markets that airline stocks don’t have to be perpetual boom-and-bust trades.

Ultimately, the fate of United Airlines Aktie depends on more than quarterly earnings beats. It depends on whether travelers, especially those in the front of the cabin, decide that the United Airlines product has finally crossed the line from legacy necessity to deliberate choice. If they do, the airline’s massive investment in cabins, aircraft, and digital tools could turn one of America’s most complex airlines into one of its most compelling long-term aviation bets.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404982_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 23:11:41.668964

Emerging markets are willing to invest in local solutions, like increased adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers and local car manufacturing.

Three CEOs share approaches specific to sustainable mobility in India, Brazil and Africa that are worth exploring to accelerate the green transition.

Road mobility accounts for about a quarter of global energy-related carbon emissions and is increasing, so its decarbonization is critical for global climate crisis mitigation. Cars account for the largest portion of increasing emissions sources globally, making the transition to zero tailpipe emissions attractive, especially to electric vehicles (EVs) in developed markets.

It is no wonder that major developed markets committed to the phase out of internal combustion engine vehicles and EV value chains investments. Luckily, despite the backdrop of supply chain disruptions, geopolitical shocks, and high commodity and energy prices, electric vehicles sales (hybrid and pure) exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021.

However, not all markets can electrify their car fleets at the pace the climate crisis warrants. For several emerging markets, car ownership continues to be quite low, but sales are growing. There is a need to look at mobility holistically in order to take a more nuanced and collaborative approach.

China, Europe and US dominate EV sales

China, Europe and the United States accounted for about 95% of global electric car sales in 2022. Emerging and developing economies outside China account for only a fraction of global EV markets.

In many key emerging and developing economies, transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, and shared mobility for regional commutes.

In 2021, electric two- and three- wheelers accounted for one million barrels of oil demand displacement per day – 66% of the overall oil demand displacement by EVs in the year, making electrification of this segment more globally significant than many imagine.

Even in large car markets in the emerging world, governments find it more attractive to invest in assembly and manufacturing of vehicles and parts in which they can have a long-lasting relative advantage.

The World Economic Forum asked three CEOs and senior executives for their views on the challenge. Here’s what they said:

‘Energy transition in many emerging markets driven by electric two-wheeler adoption’

K N Radhakrishnan, Director & CEO, TVS Motor

Two-wheelers are the most important transport mode in several emerging markets across Asia and Africa, with India being the world’s largest two-wheeler market. The energy transition in mobility in many emerging markets, including India, is being led by electric two-wheeler adoption.

Led by electric two-wheelers sales, the accelerated pace of EV adoption in India industry volumes tripled in 2022, with growth continuing into 2023. This growth has been driven, in part, by the support extended in form of incentives from the Central and State governments in India.

The vision of accelerated EV adoption is being driven by the government and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are responding with investments in technology and building capacity to help realize this vision.

Apart from driving growth, during 2022-23, there were consistent policy and regulatory interventions by the government to ensure high quality and enhanced safety levels of electric two-wheelers for consumers.

This has led to the formalization of the industry, and the result is a product mix, that moved from low-quality, low-cost options, in favour of the offerings meeting quality and safety requirements.

The enhanced safety, localization and quality norms have a threefold impact. First, they enhance the quality of products received by the customers. Secondly, they aid the formalization of the sector, ensuring quality players. Thirdly, product quality is on par with global levels, enabling the industry to export overseas.

As for internal combustion engine two wheelers, in addition to India’s large domestic market, the country is also expected to emerge as a major hub for electric two-wheeler exports.

The heightened consumer interest in electric two-wheelers in India and across the emerging world, continues to be driven by the attractive total cost of operation and the technology proposition offer by EVs. This is made even more relevant with increasing fuel prices.

We expect the EV industry will grow rapidly as the consumer interest is buttressed with active policy support. Not only will electric two-wheelers provide low-cost mobility to millions in emerging markets, they will also be an important piece of the puzzle for clean cities, net-zero transport and energy security.

‘Tax incentives and stimulus schemes would accelerate decarbonization’

Daniel Randon, President, Randoncorp

The most challenging aspect for accelerating decarbonization of road transport in emerging markets is the lack of common understanding about local realities, which leads to two fundamental suggestions:

The creation of programmes to stimulate the development of new markets, in which companies are not present or where they are still not competitive enough.

The adoption of tax incentives to encourage local entrepreneurs to invest more aggressively in the development and transformation of products in this sustainable logic.

This would benefit not only the industrial chain, but also other chains such as infrastructure companies and associated services. Our experience in Brazil shows us that this is the most appropriate path.

This is not only because of Brazil's potential to lead the green economy, but also because of the level of adaptability that we can achieve, given the multiplicity of characteristics we have within the same country and the bureaucracy we still face.

Cars equipped with flex-fuel engines – which can run on both petrol and ethanol – have a strong presence in Brazil, for example. The potential for developing biofuels has also grown.

Another example is the electric auxiliary axle system that we developed at Randoncorp, together with partners and start-ups, which can reduce up to 25% of trucks' fossil fuel consumption. This solution also has the potential to be used in other heavy vehicles, such as buses or tractors.

This mechanism could have great application in South America and Africa, or even in countries in Central Asia, due to the very different relief conditions and poor infrastructure conditions, which may enable more intensive use of the auxiliary axle, thereby reducing other consumption harmful to nature.

This is just one of the technologies we created. We have also invested a lot in the design of automotive parts with lighter materials, such as composites, and with the application of niobium on a nanometric scale – a technology with an exclusive patent that improves the properties of countless materials, from paints to casting parts, among others.

‘2023 is a year of step change for the African automotive industry’

Dave Coffey, CEO, African Association of Automotive Manufacturers (AAAM)

Africa’s automotive sector is well poised for industrialization and growth. 2023 is a year of step change for the African automotive industry, with five hub countries – Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya –either implementing progressive automotive policies or due to approve and implement such policies.

Other African countries are exploring their competitive advantage. Up to now, only Morocco and South Africa have successfully and competitively industrialized their automotive industries with production volumes of around one million vehicles.

There is an understanding that not every country can assemble a vehicle – hub countries will assemble vehicles with neighbouring economies sharing in the value chain determined by their competitive and sustainable advantage – and much work is taking place on the ground to explore and develop value chains with regional collaboration key to driving scale.

The annual importation of 3 million to 5 million used cars into Africa, is an unregulated environment with many cars being unroadworthy and with outdated emission standards. A used vehicle ecosystem is key for affordable mobility, but the source will transition to vehicles assembled in Africa which will comply with minimum standards.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, will face a trial in the U.S. They have been indicted in the Southern District of New York, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media.

Maduro is charged with “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,” Bondi said.

The military action came as Trump has waged a months-long pressure campaign to oust the authoritarian leader. Dozens of boat strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean that the president and members of his administration have justified, without showing evidence, by saying the boats were carrying drugs to the U.S.

“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote on his social media site, TruthSocial. “This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement.”

The president will hold a press conference at his Florida residence in Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. Eastern.

Andy Kim: Officials ‘blatantly lied’ to Congress

The news drew ire from Congress, which has the authority to declare war. New Jersey Democratic Senator Andy Kim said for weeks Trump officials briefed Congress that the boat strikes were not “about regime change.”

“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on social media. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.

The top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, wrote on social media that without “authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela.”

But Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is also co-chair of the Congressional Venezuela Democracy Caucus, said in a statement that the “capture of the brutal, illegitimate ruler of Venezuela … is welcome news for my friends and neighbors who fled his violent, lawless, and disastrous rule.”

However, she called for the opportunity for Venezuelans to partake in democracy, such as being able to swear in the presidential candidate who won Venezuela’s election in the summer of 2024.

President-elect Edmundo Gonzalez was forced into exile and fled to Spain under asylum. Voter results showed that Gonzalez won by a large margin, but Venezuelan government officials, without providing proof, determined that Maduro won. It was an election that many countries, including the U.S., saw as illegitimate.

Mike Lee speaks to Rubio

Utah’s GOP Senator Mike Lee initially questioned “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”

But Lee later changed course after speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

“He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” Lee said of Rubio.

Rubio has long stated that Venezuela’s president is not legitimate, nor is his government. Rubio accused him of being the head of a drug cartel, but provided little evidence.

For months, Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers have tried to curb the president’s strikes in the Caribbean, which have killed hundreds, but Congress failed to pass several War Powers Resolutions.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a tool for Congress to check the power of the executive branch by limiting the president’s ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad.

Venezuelans in the US

As the U.S. conducts military land strikes on Venezuela, more than half a million Venezuelan immigrants are legally fighting the Trump administration’s move to end Temporary Protected Status.

TPS is granted when a nation’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, due to violence, such as war, or a major natural disaster.

More than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS, which was initially granted in 2021, just one day before the first Trump administration finished its term. Temporary protections were granted to Venezuelans due to Maduro’s regime.

Trump has also tried to apply the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to any Venezuelan national, aged 14 and older, who is a suspected gang member, for the purpose of removing them from the U.S. without due process.

Trump and Maduro also clashed after several deportation planes carrying Venezuelan immigrants landed in El Salvador, where more than 200 men were detained at a brutal mega-prison known as CECOT.

Maduro called the move a “kidnapping,” and several months later the Venezuelans were returned to their home country in a prisoner exchange.

World leaders call for UN to convene

It’s unclear what the consequences of the Trump administration’s move to capture a foreign leader will have on international relations, but many world leaders disavowed the attacks and called for an emergency United Nations General Assembly meeting.

The U.N., which is five miles away from the New York court where Maduro will stand trial, did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, condemned the attacks and said they violated Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.

“Based on its foreign policy principles and its pacifist vocation, Mexico makes an urgent call to respect international law, as well as the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and to cease any act of aggression against the Venezuelan government and people,” she said in a statement.

Sheinbaum Pardo called on the United Nations to “act immediately to contribute to the de-escalation of tensions, facilitate dialogue and create conditions that allow a peaceful, sustainable solution in accordance with international law.”

Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also criticized the attack in Caracas, Venezuela.

“The justifications put forward for these actions have no factual basis. Ideological hostility has prevailed over pragmatic, businesslike approaches and over efforts to build relationships based on trust and predictability,” according to Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said on social media that the U.S. moves to capture Maduro and bomb Venezuela “cross an unacceptable line.”

“Attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law, is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism,” he wrote.

The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, called for de-escalation and said that international law “and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2026-01-03 16:11:40.368668

In essence, Galp Energia SGPS SA is now the single most important variable in the valuation of Galp Energia Aktie.","The Next-Gen Oil & Power Hybrid: Why Galp Energia SGPS SA Matters Now

Galp Energia SGPS SA sits in the middle of one of the toughest transitions in modern industry: how do you turn a century-old fossil-fuel business into a profitable, low-carbon energy platform without blowing up your balance sheet or alienating shareholders? The company, long known for Iberian fuel stations and upstream oil and gas, is recasting itself as a vertically integrated energy and materials provider spanning upstream hydrocarbons, low?carbon fuels, renewable power and high-value petrochemicals.

This is not just a branding exercise. Galp Energia SGPS SA now anchors the group’s strategic pivot: a portfolio of upstream assets in Brazil and Africa, a rapidly scaling solar and wind pipeline, and a refocused industrial & midstream division centered on its Sines refinery and petrochemical complex in Portugal. Together, they are designed to feed into what the company calls a ""resilient, cash-generative and decarbonising"" energy system that can survive volatile oil cycles and tighter European climate policy.

The stakes are high. Investors buying Galp Energia Aktie (ISIN PTGAL0AM0009) today are effectively buying into the execution risk of Galp Energia SGPS SA’s transformation roadmap: divesting high-cost barrels, doubling down on Brazilian pre-salt, electrifying operations, and turning one of Europe’s coastal refining hubs into a low-carbon fuels and chemicals engine.

Get all details on Galp Energia SGPS SA here

Inside the Flagship: Galp Energia SGPS SA

Galp Energia SGPS SA is the listed holding and operating structure that consolidates the group’s main business lines: Upstream, Industrial & Midstream, and Commercial & Renewables. What makes it interesting right now is how these legacy segments are being repurposed into a coherent energy transition engine rather than treated as a sunset portfolio to be milked and discarded.

1. Upstream: High-Margin Barrels, Lower Carbon Intensity

The upstream pillar of Galp Energia SGPS SA is heavily concentrated in Brazilian pre-salt assets, particularly through its stake in the prolific Santos Basin fields. These are deepwater assets with high flow rates and relatively low lifting costs, which allows Galp to keep upstream margins robust even when benchmark prices soften. Strategically, Galp emphasizes their comparatively lower carbon intensity per barrel versus older, more energy-intensive basins.

In practical terms, the upstream product is no longer “volume at all costs.” Instead, Galp Energia SGPS SA positions its upstream portfolio as a cash engine and optionality platform: free cash flow funds the build-out of renewables and low-carbon fuels, while selective exploration keeps long-life reserves that can be produced at competitive emissions per unit.

2. Industrial & Midstream: From Traditional Refining to Low-Carbon Fuels and Chemicals

The Sines industrial complex in Portugal is the core industrial asset under Galp Energia SGPS SA. Historically a conventional refinery, Sines is being retooled as a multi-energy hub. The roadmap includes:

Refining optimization with higher yields of middle distillates and petrochemical feedstocks.

Integration with renewable power to reduce the site’s Scope 2 emissions.

Progressive introduction of biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and potentially other synthetic fuels as regulatory frameworks and economics align.

This industrial base is what differentiates Galp from pure-play renewables developers: the company can convert both fossil and biogenic inputs into fuels and petrochemicals at scale, directly serving Iberian and export markets.

3. Renewables & New Energies: Solar, Wind and Storage at Utility Scale

The most visible sign of change within Galp Energia SGPS SA is its fast-expanding renewables arm. Galp has built and acquired a pipeline of utility-scale solar PV parks, particularly in Portugal and Spain, while selectively adding wind and hybrid projects. Rather than chasing global volume, Galp focuses on Iberian and select international markets where it can leverage existing commercial, grid and trading expertise.

The renewables portfolio is designed to:

Provide long-term contracted and merchant power to offset upstream cyclicality.

Feed industrial assets such as Sines with low-carbon electricity and, in the future, green hydrogen.

Support emerging retail and corporate PPA products under the Galp brand.

The result: Galp Energia SGPS SA evolves from a fuel supplier to an integrated power player, able to offer molecules and electrons in the same customer relationship.

4. Customer & Mobility: From Fuel Cards to Multi-Energy Services

On the demand side, Galp Energia SGPS SA manages an extensive Iberian service-station network and a growing mobility-services platform. The strategy is to transform this footprint into a multi-energy retail grid that can offer conventional fuels, EV charging, lubricants, convenience retail and, over time, additional energy services for households and businesses.

Where older oil majors saw service stations simply as volumetric outlets, Galp sees them as experiential and data-rich nodes in its evolving ecosystem. Integration with digital payments, loyalty schemes and energy services positions Galp as more than just a commodity seller; it becomes a branded energy partner.

5. The Strategic USP: Integrated, Iberia-Centric, Transition-Ready

The unique selling proposition of Galp Energia SGPS SA is its blend of three things:

High-quality upstream cash flow from Brazilian pre-salt assets.

Strategic industrial & port location at Sines, a gateway between Atlantic shipping lanes and European demand.

Fast-growing Iberian renewables and customer operations enabling a pivot towards electrification and low-carbon fuels.

Instead of discarding hydrocarbons altogether, Galp Energia SGPS SA is architected to run them more efficiently, at lower carbon intensity, and redeploy excess cash into its power and low-carbon fuels platforms. In a policy-heavy and capital-constrained environment, that integrated design is a meaningful differentiator.

Market Rivals: Galp Energia Aktie vs. The Competition

Galp Energia SGPS SA does not operate in a vacuum. On public markets and in the field, it faces a set of powerful regional peers that are following their own transition playbooks. Compared directly to Repsol S.A. and Eni S.p.A., Galp’s product strategy stands out in a few important ways.

Repsol S.A.: The Multi-Energy Blueprint Next Door

Repsol is perhaps Galp’s most visible Iberian benchmark. Repsol’s core ""product"" as a company is a broad multi-energy platform that spans upstream oil & gas, refining, biofuels, renewables, and a sizeable retail power and gas business. Repsol has aggressively marketed its renewable generation portfolio and green branding, while committing to net-zero emissions targets and exploring synthetic fuels.

Compared directly to Repsol’s multi-energy model, Galp Energia SGPS SA is:

More concentrated in high-margin Brazilian upstream, giving it a leaner but more profitable upstream cash base.

Less diversified geographically on the renewables side, focusing heavily on Iberia rather than building a broad global footprint.

More reliant on its single flagship industrial hub at Sines, as opposed to Repsol’s broader refining network across Spain and other regions.

This concentration cuts both ways. It leaves Galp more exposed to Brazil and Iberia, but also more focused—execution risk is contained to fewer, higher-impact levers.

Eni S.p.A.: The Integrated Energy & Materials Challenger

Eni S.p.A., the Italian major, is another template for transformation. Its corporate product package now includes:

Global upstream oil & gas.

The Versalis chemicals division.

A growing renewables platform under Plenitude.

Expanding positions in bio-refining and sustainable fuels.

Compared directly to Eni’s integrated energy and chemicals portfolio, Galp Energia SGPS SA looks like a more compact, regionally focused version of the same idea. It lacks Eni’s scale in chemicals and global LNG reach, but it also avoids some of the structural complexity and political entanglements that come with such breadth.

Where Galp’s product positioning shines is in the clarity of its core thesis: monetize premium upstream, pivot Iberian infrastructure toward low-carbon fuels and power, and own the customer relationship in a defined home market rather than trying to be everywhere at once.

BP and Shell: The Supermajor Benchmark

Against giants such as BP and Shell, Galp Energia SGPS SA is not a peer in sheer scale, but it competes in overlapping product categories: retail fuels, EV charging, industrial fuels, marine bunkers and corporate power supply in Europe.

Compared directly to BP’s transition strategy and Shell’s power & chemicals push, Galp Energia SGPS SA is:

More agile and regionally targeted, able to adjust Iberian offerings more quickly than a supermajor can move its global portfolio.

Less exposed to political and legal risk in multiple jurisdictions.

More dependent on getting its Sines and Iberian renewables build-out exactly right, as there is no global network of refineries and industrial sites to fall back on.

In the competitive hierarchy, Galp Energia SGPS SA is best understood as a focused, Iberia-and-Brazil-centric challenger, leveraging modern upstream assets and a strategic industrial base to compete with bigger, more sprawling rivals.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

For investors, analysts and industry insiders trying to make sense of Galp Energia SGPS SA, the key question is whether this product—this integrated corporate platform—offers a better risk-reward profile than its peers in the same energy transition race. Several structural advantages stand out.

1. Premium Upstream as a Funding Engine

Galp’s stake in Brazilian pre-salt fields delivers high-margin, long-life production with comparatively low carbon intensity. This combination is critical: it supports attractive returns even in moderate oil price environments while remaining defensible under tightening emissions scrutiny.

Where many competitors are still saddled with large portfolios of mature, higher-cost assets, Galp Energia SGPS SA can credibly argue that its upstream isn’t just a legacy drag; it’s a deliberately pruned engine that underwrites its transition investments.

2. Strategic Geography: Iberia and the Atlantic Gateway

Portugal and Spain are among Europe’s most attractive markets for solar generation, with strong irradiation and an increasingly supportive regulatory landscape. Galp’s core renewables roll-out is essentially happening in its home backyard, where it already understands the grid, permitting and customer behavior.

On the industrial side, Sines offers deep-water access, links into the European fuels and chemicals markets, and potential for exports of low-carbon fuels in the future. That single hub, if successfully upgraded, can function as a central node in regional decarbonisation value chains.

3. Integrated Molecules-and-Electrons Offering

Unlike pure-play renewables or upstream-only producers, Galp Energia SGPS SA can design integrated offers across molecules (fuels, petrochemicals, gases) and electrons (renewable power). This integrated offering creates:

Stickier customer relationships across mobility, industrial and corporate segments.

Operational synergies in trading, balancing and hedging across the value chain.

Better risk distribution between commodity-exposed and contracted revenue streams.

In a world where both demand and regulation are unpredictable, that kind of optionality is valuable.

4. Focus over Bloat

Perhaps Galp’s least obvious edge is its scale: it is large enough to execute multi-billion-euro industrial projects, but small enough to maintain strategic focus. While supermajors wrestle with sprawling legacy portfolios and competing internal agendas, Galp Energia SGPS SA can direct capital and management attention toward a few high-impact bets—Brazilian production, Sines industrial transformation, and Iberian renewables and mobility.

This tightness can make execution risk more binary, but it also offers a cleaner story to regulators, partners and investors.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The transformation of Galp Energia SGPS SA into an integrated, transition-ready platform is already reflected in how markets treat Galp Energia Aktie (ISIN PTGAL0AM0009), even if the journey is far from complete.

Based on live market data checked across multiple sources, Galp Energia Aktie is actively traded on Euronext Lisbon. As of the latest available session data (cross-checked between at least two major financial portals on the same day), the share price reflects a market view that Galp is a leveraged play on both premium upstream cash flows and European decarbonisation policy. Day-to-day, the stock still moves heavily with oil prices and macro sentiment, but the medium-term narrative is gradually shifting from “small oil major” toward “Iberian energy transition platform.”

When markets are open, investors parse each operational update from Galp Energia SGPS SA for signals on:

Upstream delivery: production volumes, lifting costs and capital discipline in Brazil.

Industrial transformation: progress on Sines upgrades, low-carbon fuels projects and energy-efficiency gains.

Renewables growth: commissioning schedules, capacity additions, load factors and PPA coverage in solar and wind.

Capital allocation: dividends, buybacks and the balance between shareholder returns and growth capex.

For periods when markets are closed or intraday pricing is unavailable, investors fall back on the last close price as a snapshot of sentiment. That last close embeds expectations not only about oil and gas markets but also about how convincingly Galp Energia SGPS SA can execute its roadmap without destroying value.

If the company manages to keep upstream free cash flow robust while steadily increasing the share of earnings from renewables and low-carbon fuels, Galp Energia Aktie has a pathway to rerating: investors could begin to price it less like a traditional cyclical oil stock and more like a hybrid infrastructure and energy-transition vehicle. Conversely, delays at Sines, cost overruns, or underperformance in the solar and wind portfolio would likely see the stock trade back toward a discounted, higher-risk profile.

In essence, Galp Energia SGPS SA is now the single most important variable in the valuation of Galp Energia Aktie. It encapsulates the group’s transition risks and opportunities, turning abstract net-zero commitments into concrete industrial projects, power plants and mobility services. For shareholders, that makes watching the evolution of this product—this integrated corporate platform—every bit as critical as tracking the next move in Brent or Henry Hub.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405049_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 16:11:46.187628

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is now firmly embedded in aviation decarbonisation plans worldwide.
India’s long-term potential to produce SAF is widely acknowledged.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel sits at the intersection of aviation, energy, agriculture and environmental policy.
The question is no longer whether sustainable aviation will become part of India’s future.","India’s challenge with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is not a lack of intent, but the absence of clear market signals on pricing, incentives, and long-term demand that would allow airlines, producers, and investors to move together.

With SAF costing significantly more than conventional jet fuel, airlines in a price-sensitive market cannot absorb the transition alone, making policy design and shared risk critical to scaling adoption.

India has the feedstock potential and industrial base to become more than a SAF consumer, but without coordinated governance and timely policy clarity, value creation and investment may shift to markets that move faster.

India’s aviation sector continues to grow steadily, supported by rising passenger numbers, a large aircraft order pipeline, and the ongoing expansion of airport infrastructure across the country. Yet alongside this growth sits a structural challenge that is becoming harder to ignore: how to decarbonise aviation without undermining its commercial foundations.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is now firmly embedded in aviation decarbonisation plans worldwide. However, in India, adoption has progressed cautiously, constrained by pricing, limited availability and the absence of a fully developed market structure.

The issue is not ambition. It is execution.

Policy, Cost and Scale

India has made its intent clear. Policymakers have acknowledged SAF as part of the country’s long-term aviation and climate strategy, and indicative blending targets have been outlined, beginning with low single-digit blending later this decade. However, unlike Europe or the United States, these targets are not yet backed by a comprehensive regulatory or financial framework.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending starting at 2 per cent in 2025, rising progressively to 70 per cent by 2050.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act and related clean fuel tax credits have created a strong incentive structure that directly supports SAF producers.

These frameworks do not eliminate cost challenges, but they reduce uncertainty and provide clear investment signals.

India’s approach remains more cautious. While this flexibility allows room to adapt, it also delays market formation.

Without defined incentives, pricing mechanisms or long-term offtake clarity, investors face difficulty committing capital to large-scale SAF projects.

This matters because SAF economics remain challenging. Depending on the feedstock and technology pathway, SAF can cost between two to five times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel. In a price-sensitive market like India, airlines cannot absorb this premium indefinitely, nor can passengers be expected to shoulder it through higher fares.

The result is a familiar stalemate: producers wait for assured demand, airlines wait for affordable supply, and financiers wait for policy certainty.

Aviation operates on thin margins even in strong market conditions. Fuel already accounts for a significant share of operating costs, and any sustained increase directly affects network planning, pricing and profitability.

Unlike fleet renewal, which often delivers fuel efficiency gains over time, SAF does not yet offer a cost-offsetting benefit.

Its value lies in emissions reduction, not operational savings. Expecting airlines to absorb this premium indefinitely is neither realistic nor sustainable.

This is where policy intervention becomes unavoidable. In markets where SAF adoption has advanced, governments have provided early support through mandates, fiscal incentives, or structured offtake arrangements, to reduce risk during the initial scaling phase and allow costs to moderate over time.

India faces a different challenge. The market is large, competitive and highly price-sensitive. While demand growth is strong, margins are thin. Any transition that significantly increases operating costs risks slowing growth or shifting capacity decisions.

This does not mean SAF is unviable; it means the transition must be carefully sequenced. Shared responsibility across government, producers, financiers and airlines becomes essential.

India’s long-term potential to produce SAF is widely acknowledged. The country has access to multiple feedstock pathways, including used cooking oil, agricultural residues and municipal waste. It also has a growing renewable energy base that could support advanced production routes over time.

However, potential does not automatically translate into supply.

Feedstock aggregation remains fragmented, logistics networks are still evolving, and robust traceability systems, critical for certification and compliance, are yet to be fully established.

Long-term offtake contracts, which are essential for financing, remain limited. These are not technological barriers as much as organisational and commercial ones.

Even if production capacity were to increase quickly, challenges would persist around standardisation, quality assurance and distribution. Without coordinated planning, scale alone will not resolve these constraints.

This is where institutional alignment becomes crucial. Sustainable Aviation Fuel sits at the intersection of aviation, energy, agriculture and environmental policy. Fragmented decision-making slows progress and raises costs, while coherent governance, rather than isolated initiatives, will determine whether India can move from pilot projects to a functioning market.

Risk and Opportunity

No major energy transition has occurred without early public-sector involvement. The role of government is not to replace markets, but to enable them, particularly in the early stages when risk is high and returns are uncertain.

For SAF, this could take the form of time-bound incentives, risk-sharing mechanisms, or clearly defined blending trajectories that provide visibility to investors. The objective is not a permanent subsidy, but confidence.

Without this, capital tends to flow to jurisdictions where policy signals are clearer. That does not mean aviation demand disappears in India, aircraft will still fly, but it does mean production, innovation and value creation may occur elsewhere.

This distinction matters. Being a consumer of SAF is not the same as being a producer. The latter brings industrial capability, jobs and strategic resilience.

India is not late to the conversation, but the window for shaping outcomes is narrowing.

Global SAF capacity is beginning to take form, and early movers are securing investment and partnerships that will define supply chains for decades.

The opportunity for India lies in acting decisively, not through grand declarations, but through practical frameworks that align policy ambition with market realities.

If that alignment is achieved, SAF can evolve from a compliance concept into a viable industrial pathway. If not, the transition will still happen, just on terms shaped elsewhere.

The question is no longer whether sustainable aviation will become part of India’s future. It is whether India will help define that future or simply adapt to it.",https://www.aviationjeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9pdKwzbgAA-eRg.jpeg,N,,2026-01-03 14:56:53.920299

Istraživači sa Tehničkog univerziteta u Gracu (TU Graz) pokrenuli su projekat pod nazivom ToFuel čiji je cilj da razvije integrisanu biotehnologiju koja može da pretvori biomasu paradajza u održivo avio gorivo (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel), uz istovremenu proizvodnju sporednih proizvoda kao što su đubrivo, stočna hrana i ulja pogodna za ljudsku ishranu.

Ovo predstavlja primjer kružne bioekonomije u kojoj se biootpad ne odlaže, već koristi kao sirovina za visokoenergetske proizvode, čime se smanjuje zavisnost od fosilnih goriva i emisije ugljen-vodonika.

THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT NEEDS MORE THAN USED COOKING OIL!

Aviation is racing to cut carbon emissions, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of its strongest paths forward. But relying on used cooking oil alone won’t take us far, the supply is limited, unstable, and tied to human consumption rather than the industry’s urgent need to fly cleaner.

That’s why new feedstocks matter. Converting palm oil empty fruit bunches (EFB), a material often treated as waste, into SAF creates a path that is scalable, sustainable, and far more dependable. If aviation wants real progress, diversification isn’t optional. It’s essential.

Chicago soybean futures eased in the latest session, trimming earlier advances, but still closed the year with their first annual gain in three years, marking a turnaround after a prolonged period of price pressure driven by ample global supplies and volatile demand signals.

Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade moved lower during the session as traders locked in profits following weeks of upward momentum. Despite the pullback, soybeans finished the year higher, a development widely attributed to shifting trade flows, tighter-than-expected inventories in key exporting countries and renewed buying interest from major importers.

A central factor supporting the market has been the re-emergence of China as a significant buyer of US soybeans after a late-October trade truce eased tensions between the world's two largest economies. Purchases by state-linked and private importers helped stabilise demand expectations at a time when growers in the United States were marketing the bulk of their harvested crop. Market participants said the return of Chinese buying improved confidence in export prospects, particularly for shipments scheduled in the first half of the new year.

Soybean prices had struggled to find sustained traction over the previous two years, weighed down by record or near-record harvests in Brazil and the United States, alongside sluggish demand growth and logistical disruptions. The annual gain therefore stands out as a shift in market sentiment rather than a simple technical rebound.

Weather developments in South America also played a role. Periods of dryness in parts of Brazil and Argentina earlier in the growing season raised concerns over yield potential, prompting risk premiums to be added to prices. Although rainfall later improved conditions in some regions, uncertainty around final production figures continued to underpin futures markets.

In the United States, farmers harvested a large crop, but export sales accelerated more than anticipated during the latter part of the year. Traders pointed to competitive US pricing and improved river logistics as factors aiding shipments. Domestic crushers also maintained strong demand, supported by steady margins in the production of soybean meal and oil.

Soybean oil prices benefited from broader trends in the energy and biofuels sectors. Demand for vegetable oils used in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel has been expanding, adding a structural layer of support to oilseed markets. While policy clarity varies across jurisdictions, the long-term outlook for biofuel feedstocks has become an increasingly important consideration for investors and producers alike.

The pullback in prices during the session reflected broader weakness across agricultural markets. Corn and wheat futures also edged lower, pressured by favourable harvest results in several exporting regions and by a stronger US dollar, which can make American commodities less competitive on the global market. Analysts noted that funds reduced long positions ahead of year-end, a common feature of thin holiday trading.

Currency movements remained a key variable. A firmer dollar tends to weigh on dollar-denominated commodities, while shifts in South American currencies influence export competitiveness. Brazil's real, in particular, is closely watched by soybean traders, as its fluctuations can alter selling behaviour by producers and exporters.

Looking ahead, attention is turning to planting intentions in the United States and to final crop outcomes in South America. Early indications suggest farmers may reassess acreage allocations between soybeans and corn, influenced by relative price signals and input costs. Fertiliser prices have moderated from previous peaks, but remain a significant factor in planting decisions.

Trade policy remains another area of focus. While the late-October truce helped reopen channels between Washington and Beijing, market participants remain cautious about the durability of improved relations. Any disruption to trade flows could quickly alter demand dynamics, given China's dominant role in global soybean imports.

Shell plc sits at the center of the modern energy dilemma. On one side, the world still runs on hydrocarbons: oil, gas, and the vast infrastructure built over a century. On the other, governments, investors, and consumers are aggressively demanding decarbonization, cleaner power, and electrification. Shell is attempting to live in both worlds at once.

Unlike a single physical gadget or app, Shell plc is a globally integrated energy platform: upstream oil and gas fields, liquefied natural gas (LNG), refineries, petrochemicals, power trading desks, EV charging networks, biofuels plants, and carbon management projects. The company’s product is energy itself, wrapped in logistics, software, and risk management.

That dual identity is exactly what makes Shell plc so important to watch: it is a real-time case study of how a legacy supermajor tries to become an integrated energy company without breaking its cash machine. The company’s latest moves in LNG, power trading, chemicals and renewables, together with portfolio simplification and cost-cutting, are shaping not just Shell plc’s future, but the broader energy transition.

Get all details on Shell plc here

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

Shell plc today is best understood as a stack of four tightly linked product pillars: LNG and upstream gas, oil and refining, marketing and mobility, and low-carbon solutions built around power, biofuels, and carbon management.

1. LNG & Upstream Gas: Shell’s crown jewel

Shell plc has quietly become one of the world’s most important liquefied natural gas players. It operates an integrated LNG value chain spanning gas production, liquefaction, shipping, regasification, and trading. Flagship assets such as its Qatari LNG interests, Australian projects, and positions in North America underpin a portfolio that can dynamically reroute cargoes to wherever prices spike.

This LNG footprint functions like a high-bandwidth global energy API for countries trying to exit coal quickly without fully committing to intermittent renewables. When Europe scrambled to replace Russian pipeline gas, Shell plc’s LNG trading and flexible contracts turned into a strategic advantage, feeding directly into higher margins and cash flow.

Technologically, Shell’s edge here is not just in steel and concrete but in software: sophisticated market analytics, fleet optimization, and risk management systems that turn volatile gas markets into an opportunity rather than a threat. In energy terms, Shell’s LNG desk is the equivalent of a hyperscale cloud region dynamically shifting workloads across regions.

2. Oil, refining, and chemicals: Fewer, bigger, more integrated

On the liquids side, Shell plc has been pruning aggressively. The company has been shutting or selling less competitive refineries and turning its most advantaged sites into integrated energy and chemicals ""parks"" that can co-process biofeedstocks, produce lower-carbon fuels, and feed high-margin petrochemicals. The logic: fewer, more complex sites with better returns and lower unit emissions.

These integrated hubs are being redesigned around digital twins, predictive maintenance, and energy efficiency optimization. Shell plc is using advanced process control and data analytics to squeeze more product per barrel and more profit per ton of CO2 emitted, while building in the optionality to process sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) components, renewable diesel, and bio-naphtha.

3. Marketing, mobility, and EV charging: Owning the customer interface

Shell’s retail and mobility business is its most visible consumer-facing ""product."" Across more than 70,000 branded retail sites globally, Shell plc is selling fuels, lubricants, convenience retail, and increasingly, electrons.

Shell plc has been building and acquiring public EV charging networks in Europe, the UK, North America, and Asia, folding them into a unified Shell Recharge brand. In dense urban environments, the company is repositioning traditional forecourts as multi-energy hubs where drivers can fuel with gasoline, charge EVs, grab food, and in some markets even work or receive delivery services.

The USP here is ecosystem: loyalty apps, payment integration, and data about how customers move, charge, and shop. Shell plc is using that behavioral data to drive cross-sell across fuels, EV charging, lubricants, and convenience retail, turning physical sites into a high-frequency customer platform.

4. Low-carbon energy and carbon management: From optics to optionality

Shell plc’s low-carbon portfolio has shifted from ""grow at all costs"" to ""grow where it pays."" The company has been more selective in new wind and solar projects, preferring positions where it can bolt on its trading, optimization, and industrial customer relationships to lift returns.

Key focus areas include:

Power trading and optimization: Using Shell’s global trading engine to manage the intermittency of renewables for utilities and large industrials.

Biofuels and SAF: Large-scale renewable fuel plants targeting aviation and heavy transport, where electrification is hard.

Hydrogen: Early-stage green and blue hydrogen projects tied to industrial clusters and heavy mobility.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS): Cluster-based projects that help hard-to-abate sectors decarbonize, effectively selling ""carbon infrastructure"" as a service.

The through line is optionality: Shell plc wants to be positioned for whichever decarbonization technologies mature fastest, without destroying near-term returns.

Market Rivals: Shell Aktie vs. The Competition

Measured as a tradable equity, Shell Aktie (ISIN GB00BP6MXD84; ticker typically SHEL on major exchanges) lives in a brutally simple peer group: global energy supermajors. The real product battle, however, is between Shell plc’s integrated energy platform and competing architectures at BP, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil.

BP plc: The ""greenest"" supermajor pivot

Compared directly to BP plc and its evolving portfolio, Shell plc looks more conservative but more disciplined. BP’s product narrative centers on rapidly expanding renewables capacity, e-mobility, and bioenergy, while deliberately shrinking oil and gas over time. BP's equivalent ""product"" stack features:

BP Pulse: An EV charging and e-mobility brand competing directly with Shell Recharge in the UK, Europe, and selected other markets.

Massive renewables pipeline: Offshore wind and solar farms where BP positions itself as an integrated developer and operator.

Bioenergy and hydrogen: Similar thematic bets to Shell, but with more aggressive public decarbonization targets.

BP’s competitive strength is its willingness to rebrand as a lower-carbon champion, which appeals to some ESG-focused investors and certain regulators. But that same ambition has raised questions about returns and execution risk. Shell plc, by contrast, is making smaller, more targeted green bets while leaning harder into LNG and trading as near-term profit engines.

TotalEnergies SE: The closest structural rival

Compared directly to TotalEnergies SE, Shell plc faces a competitor that has fully embraced the language of being a ""multi-energy"" company. TotalEnergies’ rival product suite includes:

TotalEnergies Renewables: A fast-growing portfolio of solar and wind assets with integrated power marketing.

Saft and energy storage: Battery and storage technologies that support grid services and renewable integration.

Expanding LNG portfolio: A serious competitor to Shell in the global LNG trade, with strong positions in the US and the Middle East.

TotalEnergies positions itself as slightly more aggressive than Shell plc on renewables while still very committed to oil, gas, and LNG. In practice, both are betting heavily on gas as a ""transition fuel,"" but Shell’s trading and scale in LNG arguably give it a sharper commodity toolset.

ExxonMobil: The fossil-first counterprogramming

Compared directly to ExxonMobil, Shell plc looks like a more diversified transition play. Exxon’s core product proposition remains heavily skewed towards upstream oil and gas, petrochemicals, and mega-project execution, with lower direct exposure to retail mobility and less visible consumer branding than Shell plc. Exxon is investing in carbon capture and low-carbon solutions, but its narrative is more about ""emissions reduction from hydrocarbons"" than full electrification or consumer-side transition.

In this rivalry, Shell plc’s advantages are its retail and EV charging presence, a bigger LNG and power trading platform, and a more developed low-carbon customer offer. ExxonMobil’s pitch, by contrast, is mechanical and chemical engineering at scale, running very large, long-lived projects with strong returns.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Shell plc’s competitive edge is not that it is the greenest, nor the purest fossil play. Its edge is that it has built a hybrid, cash-generating energy stack that can flex between hydrocarbons and electrons faster than most of its peers.

1. LNG plus trading as the central spine

By anchoring its strategy in LNG and gas, Shell plc has placed itself at the heart of how many countries plan to decarbonize: get off coal, then add renewables, with flexible gas in the middle. This is not just a resource play; it is a sophisticated logistics and software play where Shell’s trading desks, shipping fleet, and market analytics effectively function as the orchestration layer.

Competitors like BP and TotalEnergies are strong in LNG too, but Shell plc combines that with unmatched retail and mobility reach, letting it push molecules and electrons across both wholesale and consumer channels.

2. A disciplined, returns-first approach to low carbon

Shell plc’s pivot away from volume-based renewables targets towards returns-focused projects is polarizing but rational. Instead of chasing gigawatts of capacity for headlines, Shell is increasingly insisting on returns that compare respectfully to its fossil portfolio. That means fewer vanity wind farms and more integrated deals where Shell contributes trading, industrial customer access, or infrastructure know-how.

This discipline arguably gives Shell plc a better chance of maintaining dividend support and buyback capacity, while still building a scalable low-carbon product stack in power, biofuels, and carbon management.

3. The physical-plus-digital ecosystem

The combined impact of Shell’s retail sites, EV charging, convenience stores, and digital loyalty programs is powerful. Unlike ExxonMobil, and even more so than BP in some markets, Shell plc owns a dense network of high-traffic physical nodes that double as data capture points.

As EV adoption accelerates, those sites become multi-energy experience centers: drivers can charge, fuel, shop, and interact with the Shell brand. On top of that, Shell plc can bundle services for fleet operators, logistics firms, and ride-hailing platforms, selling them integrated packages of fuels, charging, lubricants, and carbon offsets. That ecosystem story is hard to replicate quickly.

4. Optionality without an identity crisis

Where BP and some European peers have sometimes appeared to lurch from fossil to green narratives, Shell plc is leaning into a more pragmatic identity: a cash-obsessed, transition-aware energy major. It is not promising to abandon oil and gas overnight; instead, it is promising to run them harder and more efficiently while selectively building businesses that can thrive in a lower-carbon system.

For investors, that translates into a product that is easier to model: strong free cash flow from hydrocarbons plus carefully curated growth in scalable, adjacent low-carbon segments.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Shell Aktie (ISIN GB00BP6MXD84) is the financial manifestation of this entire strategic stack. How is the market pricing it today?

Using two major financial data sources, recent market data for Shell plc indicates the following. As of the latest available trading data retrieved from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, Shell Aktie last closed at approximately the mid?$60s per share on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker SHEL), with a market capitalization firmly in large?cap territory. The specific last close price and intraday moves depend on the current trading session, but the key takeaway is that Shell plc is valued as a high-yield, cash-rich energy major rather than a high-growth tech-style transition stock.

Note: Figures referenced are based on the latest reported ""last close"" and recent trading range at the time of research, cross-verified across at least two financial data providers. Exact intraday quotes will vary with market conditions.

From a product perspective, the drivers behind Shell Aktie’s valuation are clear:

Hydrocarbon cash engine: Upstream oil and gas, LNG, and refining still deliver the bulk of earnings and cash flow, supporting a strong dividend and buyback program. When oil and gas prices are firm, Shell Aktie tends to benefit disproportionately due to its scale and trading capabilities.

LNG and gas premium: The market increasingly treats LNG-heavy majors like Shell plc and TotalEnergies as slightly differentiated from pure oil players. That gas and trading combo is viewed as a medium-term growth and resilience driver.

Measured low-carbon exposure: Shell plc’s pivot to a more returns-focused low-carbon strategy reassures income-focused investors. The company is not sacrificing short-term returns for long-term optics, which supports valuation multiples relative to peers that have more aggressively pursued renewables at lower returns.

Transition risk discount: At the same time, Shell Aktie still trades with a visible energy-transition risk discount. Regulatory actions, climate litigation, and potential demand destruction for oil over the long term weigh on how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings versus less carbon-intensive sectors.

In this context, Shell plc’s product strategy is directly tied to shareholder value. The more the company can demonstrate that LNG, power trading, low-carbon fuels, and EV charging can grow profitably alongside a leaner hydrocarbon base, the more it can compress that valuation discount. Conversely, any stumble in executing the hybrid model—whether a major stranded-asset write-down, a regulatory shock, or consumer rejection of Shell’s mobility offers—would feed quickly into Shell Aktie’s risk profile.

For now, Shell plc is positioned as a high-cash-yield energy transition platform: not a clean-tech pure play, but a disciplined, data-driven supermajor betting that it can ride and shape the transition instead of being run over by it.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405009_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 18:11:41.815076

The latest financial outlook for the global airline industry, released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has confirmed a stabilization in airline profitability despite facing persistent global challenges. According to IATA’s 2026 projections, the airline industry is expected to achieve a 3.9% net profit margin, with a net profit of $41 billion USD, up slightly from $39.5 billion USD in 2025. This marks a record-high for the industry, despite facing hurdles such as supply chain bottlenecks, geopolitical conflicts, and sluggish global trade.

With a continued strong performance from key regions such as the U.S., China, Russia, and Europe, airlines are adjusting to an evolving market and consolidating their recovery from earlier disruptions. However, despite the stable growth, the industry still faces significant challenges, particularly related to cost of capital and operating margins.

1. 2026 Airline Profit Outlook: Stabilization and Record-Breaking Revenue

The global airline industry is on track to surpass $1 trillion in revenue in 2026, a 4.5% increase from 2025. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase, while cargo volumes are set to grow by 2.4%. With strong passenger demand across all regions, airlines are expected to set new records in both operating profit and revenue.

Despite the record-setting net profits, the net margin remains relatively unchanged at 3.9%, signaling that while airlines are thriving, operating profitability is still a key challenge. This is particularly significant when compared to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), expected to be 8.2% in 2026, which still puts pressure on airline profitability.

2. Airlines Continue to Face Operating Challenges: Supply Chain and Geopolitical Pressures

Airlines have been able to show resilience despite ongoing headwinds, such as rising costs, bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, and the impacts of geopolitical tensions. These pressures have contributed to airlines’ efforts to maintain profitability, but operating expenses are rising steadily, with fuel costs and labor expenses leading the charge.

In 2026, operating profits are expected to reach $72.8 billion USD, improving from $67 billion USD in 2025, while operating margins are projected to improve slightly to 6.9%, up from 6.6% in 2025. This improvement is a testament to the industry’s ability to adapt, particularly with fuel cost stabilization and a recovery in cargo operations.

3. Air Cargo Resilience: A Bright Spot Amid Challenges

While passenger services are showing stable growth, air cargo has become a standout performer in 2025, defying early predictions of a downturn. Air cargo volumes are expected to reach 71.6 million tonnes in 2026, with a 2.4% increase compared to 2025. This growth is largely attributed to the resilience of the air cargo industry, particularly in e-commerce and the semiconductor sectors, which have seen increasing demand due to the global rise of artificial intelligence (AI) investments.

The air cargo sector has played a critical role in global trade by enabling timely deliveries, especially in the face of the protectionist US tariff regime. The global supply chain adjustments have positioned air cargo as a vital industry player in maintaining international trade.

4. Regional Outlook: Profitability Varies Across Global Markets

The regional profitability outlook varies significantly. Europe is expected to show the strongest financial performance, with airlines reporting the highest net profit margins of 4.9% in 2026. The Middle East follows closely behind, continuing its strong performance with 9.3% margins.

North America, however, saw a slight decline, as U.S. domestic travel faced contraction due to policy uncertainty and labor shortages. Yet, Asia-Pacific continues to show robust growth, with China and India contributing significantly to the region’s expansion.

5. Airline Costs: Fuel, Labor, and Compliance Pressures

The cost landscape for airlines in 2026 points to a more balanced environment, but non-fuel costs remain a significant concern. Fuel costs are expected to see a slight decline, but rising labor costs and maintenance costs driven by the aging fleet remain prevalent.

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) will continue to affect airlines, with compliance costs rising to $1.7 billion USD for 2026. Additionally, the purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will cost airlines around $4.5 billion USD.

Conclusion: A Stable, Yet Challenging 2026 for Airlines

The 2026 financial outlook for the global airline industry reflects both resilience and challenges. Despite record revenues and stable profitability, airlines continue to face pressures from rising costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and supply chain constraints. While passenger demand remains robust, airlines must navigate a complicated environment that includes rising fuel and labor costs, as well as regulatory challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-Russia-UK-China-and-Australia.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 10:12:51.080530

“We knew we needed to act quickly to keep the World Cup safe from the rising threat of unmanned aircraft systems, and that’s exactly what we did,” said Karen Evans, acting FEMA administrator.
The World Cup presents a massive stage for bad actors to disrupt proceedings.","The eleven U.S. states scheduled to host matches during the FIFA World Cup this summer may be the first to exercise newly granted authority to jam, intercept, and take down uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), or drones.

During past World Cups, stadium security teams focused primarily on stopping pitch invaders and other threats on the ground. Now, they are paying more attention to the airspace above and around stadiums, which in the U.S. has become increasingly vulnerable as more drones take to the skies.

During a counter-UAS (C-UAS) summit in December, the Washington National Guard simulated a drone attack on Seattle’s Lumen Field—a World Cup host venue—in anticipation that one could actually take place.

To address that contingency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Tuesday awarded $250 million to help state and local law enforcement detect, identify, track, and mitigate UAS. The money comes from FEMA’s $500 million Counter-UAS Grant Program, established in July by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The initial tranche of funding is reserved for World Cup host states, as well as the National Capital Region, which will host the America250 celebration in July. The remaining $250 million will become available to all U.S. states and territories in fiscal year 2027.

“We knew we needed to act quickly to keep the World Cup safe from the rising threat of unmanned aircraft systems, and that’s exactly what we did,” said Karen Evans, acting FEMA administrator. “This is the fastest non-disaster grant program ever executed by FEMA with funds being awarded just 25 days after the application deadline.”

About $28 million of the initial tranche of $250 million was awarded to Washington, D.C., on behalf of the National Capital Region. The rest was allocated as follows:

$34.6 million to California

$30.3 million to Texas

$23.6 million to Florida

$21.9 million to Massachusetts

$21.8 million to New Jersey

$20.3 million to Georgia

$19.5 million to Washington state

$17.7 million to New York

$14.2 million to Missouri

$12.5 million to Pennsylvania

$5.3 million to Kansas

To receive funding for UAS mitigation capabilities, states were required to send law enforcement and correctional personnel for training at the FBI’s National C-UAS Training Center (NCUTC), created in June by a White House executive order.

The order directed the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces—which secure large public gatherings such as the Super Bowl—to integrate C-UAS capabilities. It also accelerated a federal safety review of foreign UAS and their components, which prompted the Federal Communications Commission to enact a total ban on new sales of those products in December.

The latter move was welcomed by American drone manufacturers but met with concern by drone pilots, many of whom rely on products from China’s DJI. In 2020, the company’s share of the U.S. market was estimated at 77 percent among hobbyists and as high as 90 percent among public safety agencies.

Drone Disruptions

As of November 2025, the FAA has registered more than 830,000 drones and certified more than 480,000 remote pilots. Both figures have risen exponentially since Part 107 regulations for small UAS took effect in 2016. They could continue to grow with the looming introduction of Part 108, which covers operations beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) of the operator.

The U.S. military deploys UAS in combat, and commercial operators use them to deliver food, equipment, and medical supplies. But they are also used for purposes the government considers nefarious, such as smuggling contraband into prisons or surveilling sensitive infrastructure. In January officials said unidentified drones were spotted over military installations.

The FAA uses temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) to keep recreational and commercial drones away from crowds. At stadiums, these TFRs typically bar them from flying below 3,000 feet and 3 nm from the venue within one hour of an event’s scheduled start and end time. Larger events, such as the Super Bowl and December’s Army-Navy college football game, have added restrictions.

The FAA’s publicly accessible Sporting Event Automated Monitoring System (SEAMS) tells pilots when and where TFRs are in place. It is updated with weather delays, cancellations, overtime periods, and other data from the NFL, MLB, and other professional sports leagues.

Still, thousands of drones slip through the cracks each year. Cathy Lanier, the NFL’s chief of security, testified to Congress in December 2024 that the league recorded 2,845 drone incursions into the TFRs around its stadiums during its 2023 season. That figure was 2,527 the season prior.

“Our national security and intelligence agencies continue to warn that terrorist groups and other bad non-state actors consider stadiums and other mass gatherings attractive targets for attack,” Lanier said. “In fact, earlier this year, Islamic State propaganda specifically encouraged attacks on stadiums, including referencing the Paris Summer Olympics.”

State and local law enforcement can respond to drone incidents and arrest pilots. But until December, they relied on federal authorities—which are present only for major events—to jam, intercept, or take down the UAS. Lanier in a 2023 interview said that of 121,000 requests for FBI or DHS counter-drone support to stadiums and other venues since 2018, only 77 were approved.

That changed last month with the introduction of the Safer Skies Act, part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. It extends drone mitigation authority to state, local, territorial, and tribal agencies, which will be trained by the FBI. They will use technologies—including radio frequency and detection, tracking, and identification systems—from a list maintained by the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Defense, Transportation, and other agencies.

The typical C-UAS protocol is for authorities to contact the drone’s pilot and persuade them to land. If that fails, they can take an array of actions, from shooting the drone down to catching it with a net.

The World Cup presents a massive stage for bad actors to disrupt proceedings. It could also be an opportunity for authorities to determine how effective their C-UAS capabilities really are.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/230922-drone2_rdax_775x440s-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 09:11:39.915526

For most travelers, Airbus SE is a logo on the cabin wall as they buckle in for another flight. For airlines, lessors, and governments, Airbus SE is something far bigger: the defining product and industrial platform at the heart of modern aviation. It is the integrated machine that designs, builds, certifies, and supports aircraft like the A320neo and A350, orchestrates a global supply chain, and steers the industry’s transition toward lower-carbon flight.

As air travel demand rebounds and airlines race to renew aging fleets, Airbus SE has become the de facto standard for fuel-efficient narrowbodies and long-haul widebodies. The company’s commercial aircraft franchise is sold out for years, its decarbonization roadmap is now shaping policy as much as it responds to it, and its digital and defense units are quietly building the scaffolding for the next era of aerospace.

In other words, Airbus SE is no longer just an aircraft manufacturer. It is a product ecosystem that spans jets, services, data, defense, and space — and right now, it is dictating the pace of change across the global aviation market.

Inside the Flagship: Airbus SE

At its core, Airbus SE is the flagship product: an integrated aerospace and defense platform that turns a sprawling portfolio of programs into one coherent value proposition for airlines, governments, and investors. The company is structured around four key divisions — Commercial Aircraft, Helicopters, Defence & Space, and a growing Services & Digital layer — but the real magic is how these pieces reinforce each other.

The star attraction remains the commercial aircraft line-up, led by the A320neo Family, the long-range A321XLR, and the A350 widebody family:

A320neo Family: The single most important workhorse in global aviation right now. With new-generation engines, advanced aerodynamics, and cabin flexibility, the A320neo and its siblings offer double-digit fuel-burn reductions compared to previous generations. They are the backbone of low-cost and network carriers from Europe to Asia to the Americas and form the financial backbone of Airbus SE itself.

A321XLR: Perhaps the most disruptive variant in the portfolio. By stretching range into traditional widebody territory while keeping narrowbody economics, the A321XLR allows airlines to open thinner long-haul point-to-point routes. This is a structural challenge to older, less efficient widebodies and a gap Boeing has struggled to fill with a convincing competitor.

A350 Family: Airbus’s long-haul flagship, engineered around composite structures, advanced aerodynamics, and quiet, efficient Rolls-Royce engines. The A350-900 and A350-1000 are built to replace aging 777 and A340 fleets with lower fuel burn, more range flexibility, and passenger-friendly cabins. The freighter version, A350F, extends that advantage into the cargo market.

Wrapped around these aircraft is an increasingly sophisticated services and digital envelope. Under the Airbus SE umbrella, the company sells:

Flight operations and maintenance services via Airbus Services and the Skywise data platform, turning operational data from global fleets into predictive maintenance tools, route optimization, and fuel savings.

Training and support ecosystems that lock in Airbus SE as a long-term partner, not just a one-off hardware supplier. Full-flight simulators, pilot and maintenance training, and lifecycle support are all revenue streams that deepen customer stickiness.

Defense, space, and secure communications, from the Eurofighter Typhoon and A400M airlifter to telecommunications and Earth observation satellites. These programs diversify revenue and give Airbus SE strategic relevance beyond commercial cycles.

Crucially, Airbus SE has positioned itself as the vanguard of aviation decarbonization. Its roadmap includes:

Hydrogen-powered concepts under the ZEROe program, exploring multiple airframe architectures with an ambition to bring a hydrogen aircraft to market in the next decade.

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) readiness across its in-production fleet, aiming for 100% SAF compatibility over time, which can cut lifecycle emissions while the world waits for hydrogen and new propulsion systems to scale.

Incremental efficiency gains — from winglet design and composite use to avionics and cabin reconfigurations — that compound across hundreds of aircraft and millions of flight hours.

This combination of hardware, software, services, and sustainability is what makes Airbus SE a flagship product in the truest sense. It is not just selling planes; it is selling a complete vision of what global air travel looks like over the next 20 years.

Market Rivals: Airbus Aktie vs. The Competition

Airbus SE does not exist in a vacuum. Its dominance is being contested by a small but fierce set of rivals — primarily Boeing in the United States, China’s COMAC, and Brazil’s Embraer. Each is fielding specific products that aim to chip away at Airbus SE’s lead.

On the narrowbody front, the main dogfight is between the Airbus A320neo Family and Boeing’s 737 MAX Family. Compared directly to the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 10, Airbus’s A320neo and A321neo have carved out a commanding market share thanks to:

Perceived reliability and brand momentum after Boeing’s prolonged 737 MAX grounding and certification issues, which pushed many airlines and lessors to hedge or shift orders toward Airbus SE.

Cabin and range flexibility, especially in the A321neo and A321XLR, which allow high-density short-haul operations and long-range flights from the same basic airframe.

Earlier time-to-market for the neo concept, letting Airbus SE lock in key customers and slot positions before Boeing’s MAX program fully stabilized.

In the widebody arena, the rivalry centers on the Airbus A350 versus Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 777X. Compared directly to the Boeing 787-9 and 787-10, the A350-900 and A350-1000 lean heavily on their composite structure, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort. While the 787 remains a strong product, Airbus SE has been winning marquee long-haul fleet renewals, in part because of:

Operational economics on long sectors, which many airlines see as tilting slightly in favor of the A350, especially when factoring in growing networks and premium-heavy configurations.

A350F freighter variant, which directly challenges Boeing’s traditional stronghold in cargo and positions Airbus SE as a credible alternative to older 777 and 747 freighters.

Meanwhile, COMAC is emerging as a geopolitical and commercial wildcard. Its C919 narrowbody is positioned as a domestic competitor to the A320neo and 737 MAX on Chinese routes, backed by state-led industrial policy. Compared directly to the Airbus A320neo, the COMAC C919 today lags in:

Global certification and support — critical if it wants to break out of China-centric deployment.

Fleet maturity — Airbus SE brings millions of fleet-hours of operational experience that translate to reliability and predictable maintenance.

At the regional end of the spectrum, Embraer is pushing its E2 jet family as a right-sized alternative for thinner routes traditionally flown by older Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies. Compared directly to the Embraer E195-E2, Airbus’s smallest A220 (marketed under the Airbus SE umbrella after its acquisition) offers:

Mainline comfort in a smaller package, with a cabin that feels more like a full narrowbody than a regional jet.

Unified support under Airbus SE, which appeals to airlines trying to streamline their OEM relationships.

Taken together, these rival products underscore why Airbus SE’s integrated approach matters. Where competitors often anchor on a single marquee jet, Airbus SE fields a full-spectrum offering — from A220 to A321XLR to A350 and A350F — that lets airlines design entire network strategies around a single supplier.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Airbus SE’s edge is not just that it has strong aircraft. It is that it has turned those programs into a cohesive, future-focused platform that is hard to match.

1. Locked-in demand and supply discipline

Years-long backlogs across the A320neo and A350 programs give Airbus SE rare visibility into future revenue. This isn’t just a comfort blanket for investors; it allows the company to:

Optimize production ramp-ups without chasing volume at any cost.

Negotiate from a position of strength with suppliers and airline customers alike.

Fund long-horizon bets like hydrogen and advanced materials without betting the company on any single technology leap.

2. A coherent decarbonization roadmap

Every aerospace company now talks about net zero. Airbus SE has moved faster than most to transform that rhetoric into a product strategy:

ZEROe hydrogen concepts give Airbus SE a credible claim to leadership in future propulsion systems, even if timelines remain challenging.

SAF-ready fleets ensure its current products are compatible with regulatory and customer pressure to cut emissions this decade, not just in the 2040s.

Incremental design improvements — lighter cabins, aerodynamic tweaks, digital route optimization — ensure that existing jets keep getting more efficient while the big technology step-changes mature.

Compared to Boeing, which has spent years firefighting program crises, Airbus SE has been able to engage regulators, airlines, and fuel suppliers as a proactive architect of the future ecosystem. Against COMAC, it pitches not just technology but a mature, globally proven support network. That matters when airlines are planning 20-year fleet decisions.

3. Digital and services flywheel

Skywise and the wider Airbus Services stack are easy to overlook next to gleaming jets, but they are central to Airbus SE’s competitive moat. By embedding itself in airlines’ daily operations — maintenance, crew planning, fuel management — Airbus SE:

Turns aircraft sales into long-term, high-margin service relationships.

Aggregates operational data that can inform next-generation aircraft design.

Raises switching costs if an airline considers leaning more heavily into a competing OEM.

4. Portfolio breadth and resilience

While commercial aircraft dominate headlines, Airbus SE’s helicopters and defence and space businesses give it important hedges. Government contracts, satellite programs, and rotorcraft demand do not always move in sync with airline capex cycles. That smoother revenue base makes it easier for Airbus SE to keep investing in next-gen products even when commercial aviation hits turbulence.

All of this feeds one central narrative: Airbus SE is not winning because of a single blockbuster jet. It is winning because it has systematized innovation, risk management, and customer lock-in across an entire ecosystem.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

While the narrative around Airbus SE is product-led, the financial markets ultimately distill that story into the performance of Airbus Aktie (ISIN: NL0000235190).

Using live market data obtained via financial portals such as Yahoo Finance and other major quote providers, Airbus Aktie is currently trading with a valuation that reflects strong confidence in its commercial aircraft backlog, improving margins as production scales, and the long-term growth thesis around fleet renewal and emerging markets. Where precise intraday figures differ slightly between sources, they consistently show Airbus shares pricing in substantial expectations for sustained demand, tempered by near-term execution risks in the supply chain and industrial ramp-up.

The link between the Airbus SE product ecosystem and Airbus Aktie is direct:

Backlog as a quasi-asset: The enormous multi-year backlog for the A320neo family and A350 line effectively functions as a forward revenue pipeline. Investors scrutinize new orders, cancellations, and delivery schedules as real-time proxies for the health of the Airbus SE product franchise.

Margin trajectory: Each incremental improvement in production efficiency or supplier cost — whether on the A321neo or A350 — drops through to margins. As Airbus SE moves along the learning curve of higher-rate production, investors have bid the stock to levels that imply continued margin expansion, provided the company can keep supply chain bottlenecks under control.

Strategic optionality: Hydrogen concepts, SAF integration, and digital services may not yet be the biggest line items on Airbus’s income statement, but they are central to the equity story. The market tends to reward companies that own key choke points in an industry’s transition; Airbus SE’s position in aviation’s decarbonization journey gives Airbus Aktie an embedded growth option beyond the current product cycle.

That said, the stock is not without risk. Any major delay or certification issue with flagship programs like the A321XLR, significant geopolitical disruptions affecting airline demand, or structural setbacks in hydrogen or SAF policy could compress the growth premium investors currently assign to Airbus Aktie. Supply chain fragility — from engines to avionics — remains a persistent watchpoint and can influence short-term share price volatility even when long-term demand is intact.

Still, viewed from the lens of Airbus SE as a product, the market’s verdict is clear: this is the platform on which much of global commercial aviation will run for the next two decades. Airbus Aktie is, in effect, a liquid proxy for the strength, resilience, and future relevance of that platform.

As airlines, regulators, and passengers push for more efficient, lower-carbon, and better-connected flight, Airbus SE is sitting at the center of the conversation with a portfolio that is already in service today and a roadmap designed for the next era. For competitors, customers, and investors alike, ignoring what Airbus SE is building is no longer an option.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405051_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 10:12:57.238223

2025 recorded several exciting developments in high-speed air-breathing propulsion ground and flight testing, especially in terms of multidisciplinary efforts combining different propulsion technologies. These included turbojet and detonation engines fused with ram/scramjet propulsion systems to achieve sustained supersonic and hypersonic flight.

In Edmonton, Canada, Space Engine Systems (SES) in July and August performed ground tests based on a hypersonic Los Angeles-to-Sydney trajectory. Aims included validating thrust coefficients and establishing throttling protocols to prevent engine seizure during the turbojet-to-ramjet transition. At the company’s Villeneuve Airport facility in Canada, the precooler-enabled turbojet demonstrated operational performance up to Mach 3 with simulations extending to Mach 5, including windmilling. Full-scale ramjet ground tests achieved sustained hydrogen combustion for up to 30 seconds at fuel flow rates of 0.5-3.0 kilograms per second and air equivalence ratios of 0.3-1.0 k/s, providing confidence in thrust coefficients for a flight-ready ramjet. As the trials simulated full-scale conditions, they also served to optimize and demonstrate a working flame holder design along with an actuated, variable-throat rectangular nozzle.

In May, Venus Aerospace completed the first U.S. flight of a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE). The prototype, known as the Venus Detonation Ramjet (VDR2), integrates a ramjet with the RDRE to support sustained flight at speeds of Mach 6 to Mach10 directly from conventional runways. Unlike traditional engines that rely on steady combustion, the RDRE harnesses a continuous detonation wave: a supersonic shock front that propagates around a ring-shaped chamber thousands of times per second.

This approach delivers 15-30% higher fuel efficiency and greater thrust in a compact design. The engine operates by injecting fuel, such as jet fuel or hydrocarbon propellants, with a stabilized liquid oxidizer (typically hydrogen peroxide at 70-100% concentration) into the annular chamber, where ignition triggers a self-sustaining detonation wave. Each cycle compresses and ignites fresh mixture, generating immense pressure and thrust while consuming less propellant. With this breakthrough, Venus Aerospace joins other U.S. companies — including Anduril Industries, Hermeus, Castelion, Ursa Major and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions — driving innovation in hypersonics as the nation races to maintain leadership in the global aerospace arena.

The German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Space Propulsion continued its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ramjet test campaign within the European More & Less project for emissions testing through multiple test campaigns throughout 2025. Additionally, a big test campaign on rotational detonation combustors (RDCs), a campaign between The French Aerospace Lab (ONERA) and DLR, kept the M11.1 test bench busy from June through August. The tests in this campaign led to a 300 grams per second hot run for two seconds at the end of July after several weeks of successful testing with different configurations and different boundary conditions.The test schedule was completed by two smaller campaigns on new injectors designs at the end of the year.

POLARIS Raumflugzeuge GmbH, a German startup based in Bremen, accomplished its historic in-flight ignition of a linear aerospike rocket engine during a test flight in October of its MIRA II demonstrator. The small company also crossed its 100-flight mark with its four demonstrators in December.

‘SUSTAINABLE’ AVIATION FUELS

The aviation industry uses marketing greenwash and accounting tricks to mislead you into thinking that actual flight emissions from ‘Sustainable’ Aviation Fuel (SAF) are a fraction of those from fossil jet fuel. A jet never burns pure SAF, so a common 50:50 blend with fossil jet fuel doubles claimed emissions. And actual flight CO2 emissions are additionally more than claimed, by the amount of CO2 drawn down in making the fuel. Furthermore SAF still creates non-CO2 emissions twice as warming as actual flight CO2 emissions.

Scaling Synthetic Fuel Production for the 2026 Global Energy Transition The progress recorded throughout 2025 confirms that the era of theoretical decarbonization has ended, giving way to a period of active industrial execution.","In 2025, the conversation around e-fuels transformed from speculation to tangible reality. For years, synthetic fuels were portrayed as futuristic solutions that might one day power planes and ships without fossil emissions. That day arrived sooner than expected.

Governments across Europe, Asia, and the Americas implemented long-awaited climate mandates in 2025. Pioneering companies simultaneously launched the first commercial-scale e-fuel plants. These milestones marked the moment when policy, production, and technology moved in sync.

The shift is critical because e-fuels, produced by combining green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide, use processes that turn CO₂ into green fuel in a way that can directly replace fossil fuels in hard-to-electrify sectors such as aviation and maritime shipping. Operators can cut emissions using existing infrastructure instead of redesigning entire fleets or energy systems.

Yet challenges remain, especially around cost, feedstock supply, and financing. What 2025 proved is that e-fuels are now operational, not theoretical. What 2026 will determine is whether they can scale fast enough to matter.

Twelve Significant Industrial Milestones in the 2025 E-Fuels Market

1. ReFuelEU Aviation: The SAF Clock Starts

In January 2025, Europe’s aviation industry officially entered a new regulatory era through ReFuelEU aviation fuel rules. The law requires all flights departing from European Union airports to use at least 2% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This sets in motion the first legally binding fuel-blending target of its kind.

SAFs are low-carbon alternatives derived from biological or synthetic sources. The regulation’s most ambitious clause begins in 2030. At that point, synthetic fuels made from renewable electricity and captured CO₂ will have their own dedicated sub-mandate.

Regulations provided airlines and fuel producers with a clear long-term investment trajectory. This certainty allowed financiers to assign predictable value to SAF projects for the first time. Aviation regulations represented a major step toward making e-fuels bankable, even before their specific quotas begin later in the decade, because CO₂-based sustainable aviation fuels are starting to move from pilot projects into commercial contracts.

2. FuelEU Maritime: Shipping’s New Greenhouse Gas Rules Go Live

While aviation captured headlines, 2025 was equally transformative for the maritime sector. The EU’s FuelEU maritime greenhouse gas rules officially came into force on January 1. This regulation requires ships in European waters to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of their onboard energy by 2%. The initial percentage marks the start of a ratcheting mechanism that will tighten through mid-century, eventually forcing large-scale adoption of low- and zero-emission fuels.

Shipping leaders Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd pioneered the transition by investing in dual-fuel vessels capable of operating on green methanol or ammonia. By combining legal certainty with early commercial success stories, the rule accelerated the business case for green shipping. The rule also positioned Europe as a central hub for alternative maritime fuel development in 2026 and beyond.

3. Kassø: The Commercial-Scale E-Methanol Proof Point

Denmark’s Kassø e-methanol plant achieved a global first in 2025 by launching commercial operations. Beyond serving as a national milestone, the Kassø inauguration validates the global viability of the power-to-liquid model.

The facility achieves significant output through advanced synthesis methods:

Generates 42,000 metric tons of e-methanol annually.

Utilizes renewable power for hydrogen production.

Integrates biogenic CO₂ captured from nearby industrial sources.

Shipping giant Maersk has already contracted the entire volume for its dual-fuel vessels. This partnership proves that large-scale synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels is both possible and profitable. Efficiency, carbon intensity, and cost curves provided by the plant will guide the global e-fuels market as it expands in 2026.

4. ERA ONE: Modular Power-To-Liquids Hits an Operational Milestone

Germany entered the spotlight in 2025 with INERATEC’s ERA ONE facility, Europe’s largest operating e-fuels plant. The site can produce up to 2,500 metric tons of synthetic hydrocarbons per year.

The facility showcases a modular design that allows multiple compact reactors to be deployed efficiently. Each module converts renewable hydrogen and captured CO₂ into synthetic hydrocarbons. These outputs are suitable for use as sustainable fuels or vital chemical feedstocks.

Modular approaches could be transformative for the industry. They lower upfront capital requirements and shorten construction timelines, both major barriers for emerging fuel technologies. ERA ONE demonstrated that e-fuel systems can be built at a smaller, distributed scale before scaling up to industrial capacities. By 2026, INERATEC and its partners plan to replicate this model in additional European regions.

5. Project Roadrunner: A Flagship E-SAF FID and Construction Start

Across the Atlantic, U.S.-based Infinium achieved a significant milestone with the Project Roadrunner facility, which reached its final investment decision (FID) and began construction in 2025. Located in West Texas, the plant aims to produce around 23,000 metric tons—or roughly 7.6 million gallons—of electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) annually by 2027. Project Roadrunner represents a pivotal shift in North American energy production, far surpassing its annual output figures.

Project Roadrunner demonstrates the financial and technical confidence now emerging in the U.S. e-fuels sector. By combining domestic renewable power resources with captured carbon from industrial sources, the project offers a blueprint for scaling synthetic fuels in regions with favorable energy economics. If completed on schedule, it could make the United States a leader in eSAF production by the late 2020s.

6. Argus E-SAF Indexes: The First Real Price Mirror for Buyers

In late 2025, Argus Media introduced the world’s first eSAF price indexes, establishing the transparency required for institutional maturity. These benchmarks assess regional eSAF prices in Northwest Europe and other hubs, offering investors and off-takers reliable data for contract negotiation. Before these indexes existed, price discovery was opaque, leaving many projects unable to secure financing.

Standardized pricing transformed the market by establishing the transparency required for institutional maturity. Analysts quickly noted a significant price gap in the market. Costs for eSAF were roughly 13 times higher than conventional jet fuel and 3.5 times higher than bio-based SAF. Despite the high price, transparency created a reference framework for subsidies and cost reduction tracking. The data reinforced how economies of scale and cheaper renewable electricity could narrow the gap in the years ahead.

7. The E-SAF Pipeline Reality Check: Cancellations and Delays

Although 2025 brought impressive policy and investment milestones, it also revealed the fragility of the e-fuel supply chain. A comprehensive e-kerosene outlook revealed significant headwinds for the industry. At least 16 large-scale eSAF projects across Europe were paused or canceled by early 2025.

Several critical bottlenecks contributed to these industrial delays:

Inaccessible financing for high-CAPEX projects.

Uncertain long-term CO₂ feedstock supply.

Severe delays in electrical grid connections.

Supply chain obstacles indicate that Europe risks missing 2030 SAF mandates unless production capacity expands immediately. Developers are now focusing on public-private partnerships to bridge the funding gap. With government support increasing and early facilities like Kassø and ERA ONE demonstrating feasibility, 2026 is shaping up to be the make-or-break year for eSAF scalability.

8. ZEMBA: Shipping Demand Pools Turn Into Booked Volumes

By 2025, shipping decarbonization had gained real momentum through coordinated buying power. The Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance finalized a tender that locked in approximately 70,000 tons of e-methanol and 25,000 tons of e-ammonia for delivery beginning in 2027. Companies such as Hapag-Lloyd and NCL participated, showing that the demand side of the market was finally catching up with supply ambitions.

Aggregated purchasing signals maturity within the industry. Instead of fragmented, small-scale trials, global shipping firms are contracting multi-year volumes that enable producers to secure financing. Private-sector collaboration accelerates the energy transition by complementing policy-driven initiatives and aligning with emerging green shipping corridors that test methanol- and ammonia-powered vessels on real trade routes.

9. Maersk: Dual-Fuel Fleets Become the Market’s Metronome

Maersk continued to define the pace of the maritime energy transition in 2025, operating dual-fuel vessels capable of using either traditional fuels or green methanol. Each new delivery added credibility to methanol’s role as a bridge fuel that can immediately reduce lifecycle emissions while e-fuels scale up. The company’s procurement strategy effectively became a market signal for suppliers, port operators, and financiers.

Each Maersk vessel launch drives the development of global port infrastructure, bunkering networks, and standardized fuel protocols. By 2026, analysts expect this fleet to serve as a bellwether for whether e-methanol and e-ammonia can achieve cost parity and availability across global trade routes.

10. Methanol’s Pipeline: Announced Capacity vs. Delivered Reality

The Methanol Institute reported that as of late 2025, there were 252 renewable methanol projects globally, representing more than 45 million tons of announced annual capacity by 2030. However, only a fraction of these are expected to materialize on schedule, given the high capital costs and limited carbon feedstock availability.

This disparity highlights the difference between ambition and execution. While methanol has emerged as the leading candidate for near-term decarbonization in shipping and chemicals, real-world deployments of green methanol as a shipping fuel illustrate how quickly demand grows once supply chains align. In 2026, investors will be watching closely to see which of these projects break ground and which stall at the proposal stage.

11. ANDRITZ Electrolyzer Gigafactory: Scaling the Hardware Layer

In 2025, engineering firm ANDRITZ inaugurated an electrolyzer gigafactory in Erfurt, Germany, with an annual capacity of roughly 1 gigawatt. The Erfurt gigafactory represents a foundational step toward securing the hardware backbone of the hydrogen economy. Electrolyzers split water into hydrogen and oxygen, providing the essential input for e-fuel production.

By increasing production volumes and localizing supply chains, ANDRITZ aims to drive down costs while ensuring component availability for Europe’s rapidly expanding hydrogen projects. The facility’s modular design supports multiple electrolyzer types, including alkaline and PEM systems, allowing for flexibility as technology evolves. This scaling effort lays the groundwork for a green hydrogen supply chain that can reliably feed e-fuel synthesis in the years ahead.

12. Topsoe SOEC Factory: Higher-Efficiency Electrolysis Goes Industrial

Also in 2025, Danish company Topsoe opened the SOEC manufacturing facility in Herning, Europe’s largest solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) factory. With an initial capacity of 500 megawatts per year and support from the EU Innovation Fund, the site showcases how high-efficiency electrolysis can reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production. SOEC technology operates at higher temperatures, allowing for greater conversion efficiency compared with conventional systems.

Expanding manufacturing capacity drives the economies of scale and technical performance needed to compete directly with fossil fuel pricing. As more factories like this come online, economies of scale and improved performance could accelerate cost parity with fossil fuels.

Critical Commercial Success Factors for Global E-Fuels Growth in 2026

The coming year will test whether the groundwork laid in 2025 can translate into measurable scale. The first metric to watch is final investment decisions (FIDs)—a sign that investors trust both the technology and market conditions. Successful FIDs will unlock construction financing, moving projects from concept to reality.

Identifying Strategic Carbon Feedstocks and Energy Economics

Next, attention will shift to CO₂ sourcing. E-fuels rely on captured carbon, meaning access to affordable CO₂ from biogenic systems will determine production growth. Emerging green ammonia and e-fuel pathways show how fuel molecules and critical mineral supply chains are beginning to converge. Meanwhile, electricity costs remain the largest factor shaping e-fuel competitiveness. Regions with abundant wind and solar power, such as Texas, Chile, and northern Europe, are positioned to lead.

Aligning these strategic factors will enable 2026 to serve as the definitive transition from demonstration projects to genuine commercial scaling. Finally, policymakers will need to ensure that subsidies, contracts-for-difference, and tax credits align to de-risk early projects.

Scaling Synthetic Fuel Production for the 2026 Global Energy Transition

The progress recorded throughout 2025 confirms that the era of theoretical decarbonization has ended, giving way to a period of active industrial execution. With the launch of massive electrolyzer gigafactories and the implementation of binding fuel mandates, the primary hurdles to adoption are shifting from technical feasibility to economic scalability. Corporate leaders and policymakers have successfully demonstrated that the power-to-liquid pathway is viable, creating a roadmap that other regions are already beginning to replicate.

Sustaining Momentum Through Policy and Infrastructure Alignment

As 2026 approaches, the focus moves toward stabilizing supply chains and securing the vast quantities of biogenic carbon required for continuous production. The transition from pilot projects to mainstream energy pillars will require sustained investment and a continued focus on driving down the cost of green hydrogen. If the current trajectory of innovation and policy alignment persists, synthetic fuels will likely become the dominant decarbonizing force for global trade before the end of the decade.

The Surprising Airline Price Wars

Air travel is becoming increasingly unaffordable. As airlines and governments impose various fees, surcharges, and taxes, the cost of flying continues to rise globally. In 2026, passengers are finding themselves facing larger bills for their flights, as airlines pass the cost of fuel, labor, and environmental regulations onto customers. This article explores the various factors behind the dramatic increase in airfares and what it means for travelers.

The Role of Airlines in Raising Ticket Prices

Airlines are directly responsible for a significant portion of the rising airfare prices. Many carriers are imposing fuel surcharges, which are adjusted based on fuel prices. For instance, Delta Air Lines has been charging passengers from Japan hefty fuel surcharges that can add hundreds of dollars to the cost of a ticket. This is not an isolated incident. Emirates, Japan Airlines, and American Airlines are also introducing fuel surcharges that increase flight pricesAirline Fare Research.

One particularly notable example is the Emirates surcharge on flights from Japan, where passengers are expected to pay up to ¥39,500 for certain routesAirline Fare Research. Similarly, Japan Airlines recently updated its fuel surcharges, which vary depending on the destinationAirline Fare Research. These surcharges are added to the base airfare, making the total cost of a ticket much higher than initially expected.

The logic behind these surcharges is simple: airlines are trying to shield themselves from the volatility of fuel prices. When oil prices spike, airlines pass these costs on to passengers, who are left to bear the brunt of unpredictable fuel price fluctuations.

The Growing Green Tax: Environmental Costs and Aviation

As if rising fuel prices weren’t enough, airlines are also being required to comply with stricter environmental regulations. Lufthansa, for example, has introduced an “Environmental Cost Surcharge,” which helps fund sustainable aviation fuel mandates and emissions trading schemes. The fee can range from €1 to €72, depending on the flight’s route and classAirline Fare Research. This green levy is just one example of how environmental regulations are making air travel more expensive.

Similarly, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore has introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy that will be applied to flights from Singapore starting in October 2026. The SAF levy will affect both economy and premium cabins, with long-haul passengers being hit hardestAirline Fare Research. These green taxes are seen as necessary for reducing aviation’s environmental impact, but they are also contributing to soaring ticket prices.

Government Taxation: A Hidden Culprit

Governments are also adding their own layers of cost to air travel. The United Kingdom, for example, raised its Air Passenger Duty (APD) in April 2026. The tax now ranges from £32 for short-haul flights to £253 for long-haul flightsAirline Fare Research. This increase in tax is expected to have a significant impact on ticket prices, especially for travelers flying to distant destinations.

Similarly, Canada has increased its Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC) by as much as 33%Airline Fare Research. This new tax means that passengers will be paying more for security checks when they fly. Although this charge is collected by airlines, it’s an additional burden for passengers who are already grappling with rising base fares and fuel surcharges.

Airlines Get Creative with Fees: The Case of Turkish Airlines

Some airlines are finding new ways to increase revenue without directly raising ticket prices. Turkish Airlines, for example, has introduced a new charge for infant passengers. Previously, infants flying with a parent on their lap would often fly for free or pay a small percentage of the adult fare. Now, Turkish Airlines charges 610 Turkish Lira for domestic flights and 915 Turkish Lira for connecting flightsAirline Fare Research. This seemingly minor fee is a part of the growing trend of airlines monetizing every aspect of air travel, even infant passengers.

Global Comparisons: A World of Rising Prices

Airline fare increases are not limited to any one region. From Australia to Europe and the United States, passengers are facing rising costs. In the U.S., domestic flight prices have increased dramatically for certain city-pair routes. For example, the Austin–Detroit route saw a massive fare hike of 51.5% from $205 to $310Airline Fare Research. Similar increases have been recorded for other routes, with some cities seeing airfare rises of 30% or moreAirline Fare Research.

Even low-cost carriers like Ryanair have raised fares. After a year of cutting prices, the airline saw a 13% increase in average fares for the first half of 2026, a trend that is likely to continue as demand for travel picks upAirline Fare Research.

How Airlines Are Justifying Higher Costs

Airlines typically justify the rising costs by blaming external factors. For example, Ryanair pointed to the costs of environmental taxes and fuel surcharges in explaining its fare increasesAirline Fare Research. Similarly, Qantas cited rising wages, engineering costs, and airport charges as reasons for its higher faresAirline Fare Research. While these reasons are certainly valid, they place the financial burden on passengers, who have little choice but to accept the higher prices.

Is There Any Relief in Sight?

Some airlines have attempted to provide relief to passengers by introducing caps on fares or offering discounts. For example, Air India capped its economy-class fares on non-stop domestic flights following directives from the Indian government to prevent price gougingAirline Fare Research. However, these efforts are relatively rare and do little to offset the broader trend of increasing prices.

The overall message from airlines and governments is clear: passengers should brace for higher ticket prices in the years to come. While some carriers are trying to offer competitive pricing, the global trend is towards rising costs across the board.

Higher Fares Are Here to Stay

As we enter 2026, it’s evident that airfare inflation is not going away anytime soon. Airlines and governments are working in tandem to raise ticket prices through surcharges, taxes, and new levies. Whether it’s the fuel surcharge imposed by Delta, the environmental tax introduced by Lufthansa, or the Air Passenger Duty hike in the UK, passengers will continue to feel the pinch.

In the future, travelers should expect to pay more for their flights and be prepared for hidden fees and charges that are often not disclosed upfront. While some airlines are trying to mitigate costs through discounts or fare caps, the overall trend suggests that airfares will remain high for the foreseeable future.

For passengers planning their travel, the key takeaway is simple: budget for higher ticket prices and keep an eye on additional fees. If current trends continue, flying will only get more expensive, and understanding the complex network of fees and surcharges will become more important than ever before.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airlines-price-surge.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 14:11:43.565907

CC - Oh dear, looks like yet another example of you not having a clue about the company / products you are invested in. Your poor / non-existent research and lack of knowledge shines through again. You post -

“You’d think shortages would lead to higher SAF prices.”

Let's cover the bases in nice simple terms, so that you might grasp it.

This is not a normal commodity market where scarcity automatically translates into higher prices. SAF pricing is politically constructed, mandate-driven and subsidy-dependent, not led by demand. The airlines are NOT clambering over themselves in a frenzied need to buy SAF - they'd be quite happy not to have to buy any. Only green-washing and politics might claim otherwise.

Why would any airline buy SAF when it doesn’t have to?

Airlines operate on razor-thin margins. SAF typically costs 2–5× conventional jet fuel. In a competitive industry where fuel is the largest operating cost, voluntarily paying multiples of market price is commercial suicide unless forced to do so. Only a handful of jurisdictions — principally the UK and the EU — currently mandate SAF blending. Much of the rest of the world does not. That creates an immediate and unavoidable distortion:

A non-SAF-using US airline can undercut a UK or EU airline on the same long-haul routes. The US have incentivized SAF usage but it is not mandatory. Figures are targets but by no means compulsory. If economics dictate that it is too costly it won't be used. Will Trump ditch those costly incentives? Drill baby, drill suggests so.

Lower fares win customers.

The “green premium” is not recoverable in ticket pricing.

This is pretty basic stuff - it is not rocket science.

As a result, airlines are reluctant buyers, and when they do buy SAF, they do so grudgingly and opportunistically — often only to the minimum level required for regulatory compliance.

Crucially, airlines are also unwilling to commit to long-term SAF offtake agreements. Why? Because SAF economics are entirely dependent on transient political support: Subsidies, blending credits, tax incentives and mandated targets that can (and do) change with elections and fiscal pressure.

No airline CFO is going to lock into long-term, above-market fuel contracts when the legislative framework underpinning the price can be altered or withdrawn at short notice.

That reluctance feeds directly into the supply side. Without long-term purchase commitments, producers cannot justify the capital investment required to scale SAF production. And without scale, costs don’t come down. Raising prices further only reduces demand even more, making the problem worse, not better.

So while there may be a headline “scarcity” of SAF today, it is a structural and artificial scarcity, not one driven by organic market demand. There is no deep, desperate, cash heavy buyer base waiting to willingly pay higher prices.

RE: UK ​u​likely to have ​h​it the 2025 Sustainable Aviation Fu...Today 08:30

Yawn......tell me something I don't know.

Of course it's not a market driven by simple supply and demand.

However, that needs to change and it can change quickly and easiily; but the framework needs to change and IMO it will. Quick enough for 80M shareholders, who knows.

Why would airlines have to buy SAF when they don;t have to, exactly.That's where we are at the moment.

They might start buying it if they can't fly or land their planes without it and I am sorry but we are starting to see signs of that.

CC - Take a look at this recent article (15.12.25) which provides a broker’s analysis of Neste (link below). The stock has more than doubled from its April 2025 lows, though it remains around 60% lower over a three-year view. Share price recovery now seems to be on a decent ascend due to company specific reasons (e.g. management change) and factors relating to the bigger picture.

As for the bigger picture, the article says: [Demand visibility has improved across key markets. In Europe, the impact of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III is starting to be felt, with Germany recently passing draft legislation that should support significantly higher renewable fuel volumes from 2026. “The 2026 renewable volume obligation in the U.S. is also expected to be sharply higher, which should support margins in the country next year,” the analysts said.] End

Loso Judijanto

Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is an underutilized feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, positioning waste valorization as a game-changing strategy for aviation decarbonization and the implementation of a circular economy. This qualitative literature review synthesizes recent research (2020-2025) from various journals to evaluate the environmental, technological, economic, and policy dimensions of POME-based SAF. Key findings indicate that POME-derived SAF achieves 65-80% lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to conventional jet fuel, with 25-30% of climate benefitsderived from avoided methane emissions through improved wastewater management. Hydrothermal liquefaction and hydro processing pathways demonstrate technical feasibility for compliance with ASTM D7566, while anaerobic digestion remains the most commercially mature conversion route. Indonesia and Malaysia's combined POME generation of 119-178 million metric tons annually creates scalable feedstock potential supporting 360-480 million gallons of SAF production—addressing aviation's primary feedstock scarcity constraint. However, economic viability depends critically on policy support mechanisms, including blending mandates, carbon credits, and cost parity subsidies. Critical challenges include certification integrity (fraud prevention), smallholder inclusion, and potential rebound effects from expanded palm oil cultivation. Indonesia's emerging SAF roadmap, export restrictions prioritizing domestic value addition, and investment in biorefinery infrastructure position it as a potential global leader in POME-SAF production. The analysis concludes that POME-based SAF, through integrated technological optimization, strengthened policy frameworks, and inclusive supply chain development, can meaningfully contribute to aviation's decarbonization while demonstrating circular economy principles at scale.",https://www.wecmelive.com/assets/images/logo.png,N,,2026-01-03 06:12:56.572997

Ten years ago, agriculture was on the cusp of a digital transformation.
Ten years later, the dust has settled on the ag-tech boom, and yet we have not seen major disruption to ag supply chains.
The practice of law has changed, too.","Ten years ago, our law firm opened its doors to try something new. Rather than focus on one specific area of law or operate a general practice that tried to cover all areas, we decided to focus on a single industry — agriculture. Our clients — farmers, ag-tech providers, and businesses that work in agriculture — were grateful to find lawyers dedicated to their industry. Looking back at how our firm has evolved during the past decade, I see many ways agriculture has changed and how our practice has changed with it.

The business of agriculture has continued to advance. Ten years ago, agriculture was on the cusp of a digital transformation. The ag-tech boom was just beginning, following the ag-data gold rush sparked by Climate Corporation’s sale to Monsanto for nearly $1 billion in 2013. Ag-tech startups were being launched everywhere as Silicon Valley sought to disrupt farming the way it had disrupted brick-and-mortar retailers with internet shopping. Legacy agricultural companies were scrambling to keep pace with ideas from these new startups. Ten years later, the dust has settled on the ag-tech boom, and yet we have not seen major disruption to ag supply chains. Instead, we have seen gradual evolution and improvement to long-standing models, made more efficient by digital tools and connectivity.

Rural America has seen diversification in the landscape from renewable energy projects. Ten years ago, farmland pressures came mainly from urban sprawl and residential development. But now, the Midwest is dotted with renewable projects — wind farms, solar developments, anaerobic digesters producing biogas. The use of corn and soy to create biofuels now includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). American farms do not just produce crops; they produce energy.

Livestock farms have continued to survive and thrive. Ten years ago, plant-based “meat” products looked to be rapidly expanding into grocery store shelves. Similarly, alternative “milk” products made with almonds and oats started to expand market share. But a decade and one pandemic later, traditional proteins are having a resurgence, and desire for alt-proteins appears to have stalled. We are especially happy to see our livestock producers doing well and expanding their farming operations.

The practice of law has changed, too. When we started this firm, we felt like we were cutting-edge. No expensive offices, marble floors, mahogany desks, or file rooms filled with paper. Instead, we operated with laptops, cell phones, cloud-based software, and modest but modern accommodations provided in a building full of ag commodity groups (thanks, Jane Ade Stevens). We were ahead of the curve in creating a streamlined office environment.

While there have been many changes to both agriculture and the practice of law in the past ten years, the core of our business has remained the same. That core focus is on building human relationships. More than anything, after ten years, I am grateful for those relationships — clients, co-workers, friends, and family — that have helped make us successful. Here’s to ten more years!",https://www.precisionfarmingdealer.com/ext/resources/images/2019/Summer/DataSecurity/Todd-Janzen.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 01:11:51.948398

Shukla, thank you so much for joining me. So it's been an eventful year, maybe in geopolitics, with geopolitics linked to energy as well. But that's not what I'm going to ask you about.

What's the most interesting or the most interesting challenge that you've been posed in the context of the work that you're doing from perhaps the clients that you talk to, either existing or potential?

First of all, thank you for speaking with me again. And it's an absolute delight to speak on so many issues that we continue from last year. Interestingly, the question that you ask is my answer wouldn't be entirely from the oil and gas.

Very recently, in fact, this has been for the last about a year or so. And very recently, our honourable minister directed that we look at one development which has happened in the sector, which is a solar cooker. And this was this is developed by Indian Oils, R&D.

And he challenged that whether we as a team jointly or otherwise can look at reducing the cost as well as the weight of the solar cooker such that it becomes, you know, affordable and friendly to the mass that, you know, who would be the end user. And it can have a better efficiency as well. So this is one challenge which would probably be a game changer for, you know, steering the solar mission as well and using the solar heat for cooking medium.

Also bring down the energy requirement and the energy cost, especially of households which are challenged in terms of their capacity to purchase, you know, oil and gas for their electricity.

And that's and I'm going to ask you more about the cooker. But that's an interesting point which maybe people have missed, which is that we can address the problems on the demand side as well. And really going right into the house and saying that each of these components of consumption of energy and how can I maybe find solar sources for them?

So the cooker sounds interesting. So tell us more about the cooker itself. And how is your cooker different from Indian Oils?

So I think it's a collaborative effort because the initiation and the credit of the first development and the second development goes to Indian Oil R&D. And we put an independent mind and it's always good to have a second round or a third round of in-depth analysis of the elements that can go into improvement of efficiency, reduction of cost, reduction of weight. And as Engineers India, we have a team which has the expertise in insulation, on materials, on electrical systems.

So it's a, you know, a task in progress, work in progress. It has achieved some milestones and we have challenged ourselves that within a month's time, we would target a really significant reduction on that, on all of the fronts, such that it becomes affordable, you know, for the for end-users. Now, although the solar energy is not a 24-7 available, but today we need all kinds of energy and any element of decarbonised energy and especially solar-based you know, heat that can be used at the end for any of us would be anything, would be an added benefit, you know, in the whole ecosystem of the energy space.

So let's take a step back. And if you were to look at the last year and the work that you've been doing, you've been doing a lot of international work.

Your order book has been the highest ever. And you're also doing a lot of domestic work, which is not to do with oil and gas. You're working in academia, building infrastructure, urban infrastructure and data centres, which is the hottest thing right now.

And I'll come to that in a bit. So tell us about what are the more exciting landmarks for you in the last year?

So the last year has been, last few years, I would say, have been instrumental in steering and shaping the landscape of our business portfolio, the current business portfolio as it is. And where we look forward in the future to lead from the front as an engineering company with excellence and international footprint. So on the international front, very recently we signed a contract to build four very large fertiliser trains in Nigeria for the Dangote group.

These are larger than any of the Indian Urea trains. They are four to five zero TPD of urea. And that puts us into the global map of engineering consultants who have the ability and who have garnered the trust of a very prestigious, large group internationally to implement these projects on a PCM basis.

Similarly, the Dangote group is also looking at adding another 33 million tonnes, 650,000 barrels per day of refinery in the same region, in the same location as we have built the first one, which will bring up the capacity of that single location to 1.2 million barrels per day, which is a very, very large capacity at one place. Again, it is a testimony of the ability of our engineering and project management teams. Would that be larger than any single installation in India?

Yes. Yes. It would be put together at least two such installations of our nation at Patlu and also the six fertiliser trains eventually.

So that will be a conglomeration of refinery, petrochemicals, as well as fertiliser, one of its kind in the entire world. So that's one historic landmark which we have achieved in the last year. Besides, as you mentioned on the diversification part on the other than oil and gas, the world and our clients have found merit and found value in the abilities that our teams have and the experience that they have, you know, over the last 60 years or so, and the strong database and, you know, the wherewithal to solve any of the problems.

So those kind of USPs that we bring on the table for our clients have helped us steer and navigate in, let's say, the fertiliser sector for one, which we weren't a major player earlier and in the infrastructure sector, because there is any client who puts in investments, who puts in, you know, have large capital projects, looks at the ability of the consultant to give a quality delivery, delivery as much as can be possible in the schedule. But more importantly, having cost control, good processes and procedures for procurement. And all these are they are inherent in our teams.

And that's one reason why we have gone beyond the oil and gas. And today, as we speak for this financial year, we have almost 50 percent of our order inflow from international operations. And our order book, which is about 13,700 crores, is an all time high for our organisation.

And we are also hopeful for growing it further.

And tell us about the most technologically complex or fascinating or interesting projects that you're working on right now compared to your past, whether it's an oil and gas or outside.

I think the project which is unique to the industry and the world as well is the Bamboo Refinery, which was dedicated by the Honourable Prime Minister in September in Umar Egar. And that is a second generation ethanol project with some byproducts, which is unique in comparison to other 2G ethanol projects, which just makes second generation ethanol. And we put together that plant with the most exotic material, metallurgy, with new vendors, both national and international, with the equipments which no one has ever operated before.

And our team has supported that plant in troubleshooting, in pre-commissioning. There were huge challenges because people have not faced environments of the nature of slurry, of acidity in the process streams and how to manage the corrosion aspects, the plugging aspects and so many other aspects. These all fluids are not proper fluids, they're non-Newtonian fluids.

So you cannot apply the same principles of chemical engineering, transport phenomena as you do in the plants that we have conventionally done. So that's been a great learning. And the success of the commissioning and operation of that plant is actually is a testimony of the fact that it was extremely exciting, challenging, yet very satisfying at the end when it all came together.

And there's a sort of general knowledge question, perhaps. How do you start with bamboo or because bamboo is already available there and you say, OK, now let's see if we can find another use for it, because obviously one would think of sugar when one thinks of ethanol or maize.

So see, these technologies are some of them are feed agnostic. So whether you look at rice straw or you look at wheat straw or you look at cotton, it's likely tough to, you know, go to second generation ethanol, it's a tough feedstock per se. Or you look at stubble or, you know, any kind of those feedstocks.

People also look at growing some kind of grasses on purpose to get second generation ethanol. So these are all feedstocks which are, you know, available for technology, technologies which are feed agnostic. This particular technology is designed for bamboo because it has a separate processing steps.

Bamboo being, you know, the nature of bamboo being slightly different than, you know, the straw. So the lignin content, the cellulosic content is quite unique in that. And this process deploys a solvent, which is again in variance to the typical enzymatic hydrolysis processes which are there in technology.

And therefore, it finds value in making byproducts like acetic acid and furfural. So that way, this, in fact, was brought up from a technology readiness level, which was very low. So it's one thing to repeat a technology which has been commercialised.

That's the easy part. It could be complex. It could be extremely like a steam cracker or a dual feed cracker, which is very complex.

But you've done it before. World has done it before. And there are set equipment, set suppliers, set systems.

Not much, except you need to kind of put it together. But in this particular case, there was nothing on ground. It's absolutely a blank slate.

And you cannot fail because it is a sizable investment. So I think that itself is, you know, proving the fact that on the client end, there was huge support from maybe RPL, NRL, as well as EIL teams. They work together to put this marvel together, which is totally unique in terms of the context where we are talking today.

Moving from the conventional energy space, the fossil space, slowly by and by transitioning to the green fuels.

And I'm going to come back to this in a moment. You know, but when you look at the entire energy spectrum at one level, let's say there are data centres today who are being set up. The companies that are investing in data centres are also investing in energy companies or setting up energy plants, which was completely unknown or unheard of even a few years ago.

So there are large gigawatt capacity because they have to feed those data centres. So that's a new requirement. An extension of that is obviously investments in nuclear power.

And that is something that you're also involved in with small, small modular reactor. So when you look at the energy, the energy spectrum, it's very difficult to make out what is going in where and what is coming out, because everything inside is being changed around, including the bamboo example that you gave. So how do you see this world?

Yeah, so it's it's a complex world, but I think everybody attempts to make it simple. For example, let's say today the Delhi metro is run by power generated in Madhya Pradesh. So it is complex.

And we were looking at a project of making green ammonia in Odissa with power generated in Rajasthan. So there are this kind of synergies. Yet there are challenges how to put together these elements of, you know, in the game of things.

So you're right. Data centres are a big thing. And especially data centres with renewable power, with a lower carbon footprint, will definitely need huge power capacity for computation needs and data storage, etc.

That is one of the big sectors which is likely to see and we have heard so many announcements. I don't want to name them or how they will pan out and, you know, play out will be seen, but it's a huge opportunity for making capital investments and for us to do project execution as well. So we are in the finishing stages of one data centre, which is a 10 megawatt four data centres at one location.

We've done before some data centres for SBI, for state government of Rajasthan, for UADI here in Delhi. So that experience of creating the framework of the data centre, making it ready for certification for tier four uptime. I think these are the experiences which we as a company bring on the table and the end customer needs, you know, companies who have that prior experience so that their work gets executed smoothly in a kind of efficient and affordable manner as well.

I'm going to come to nuclear in a moment, but you talked about customers, right? I mean, even the nature of customer. I mean, one day, let's say you were dealing with a oil and gas conglomerate in Nigeria or for that matter, in India.

But tomorrow you could be dealing with a social platform like a Meta or someone who's because they're investing in so much. And you two are looking at urban infrastructure and others. So how does that play on your own as a company?

I mean, how does that play in terms of, you know, because it calls for a different frequency because you're not, you know, dealing with maybe, you know, a new age tech organisation is quite different from dealing with a traditional petrochemical or oil and gas company. True, true.

You're so right. Today, we have clients from across the world and across sectors. And you're very right.

The both the expectations, the working style, the procurement processes, the work culture is very, very different. In fact, at times we are challenged by adopting to that work culture. And many times clients also look for that flexibility.

They look for agility and they look for many other responsiveness, communication. These are a lot of skills which especially international clients and especially marquee clients, if you talk of Meta and clients like those, they would look expect from a consultant. So we have different teams, like, for example, the teams which work in Abu Dhabi are very well orientated to the needs of that region.

They're very familiar with the processes, the protocols, the standards and how to even converse, how to even communicate, how to even give documentation. So they are trained in that manner. Similarly, let's say we are looking at data centre when we work for SBI or we work for state.

Let's tell you, let me tell you the one that we are doing now, although it's a client of the central, you know, the government sector, but they're very demanding. It's not that and they're very knowledgeable as yet. So that's another point that clients today are very knowledgeable, sometimes more knowledgeable than us.

And that creates, poses a challenge for us, also an opportunity to build up that skill set to match, you know, their wavelength or give what they expect of us. Likewise, if you see some of the private sector clients, there are some private sector clients who work with a very work breakdown approach. They would like to be controlling every little bits and pieces of it because they need good cost control.

They need, you know, they don't have the bandwidth and rightfully so. They're very efficiently run with a smaller team and they're very conscious of the fact that we should be. So we do work with them.

Then you have also some clients who look at, who don't look at the cost, let us say, of the whole project in somebody who looks at a macro level, somebody who can look at a micro level. So you need to go down to the detail because the devil also lies there. So those are the things which are very different across clients.

And it takes time for the company and the teams to understand that often we are able to fulfil the client's expectations right away. Often we need to recalibrate ourselves, retune ourselves. Sometimes we get feedbacks which we need to, you know, reinvent ourselves and kind of reposition our work style also.

But the good part is that we are there to listen. We are there to take feedbacks and also take corrective actions. The teams are excellent.

The teams are very energetic. We have a low average age. We have youngsters and experienced people who work hand in hand to kind of, and they're very proud of the fact that they belong to a company which has built the energy infrastructure all over the globe for 60 years.

I think they carry that pride on their shoulders and that keeps them going with the ambition and the desire to do better and better.

So let me come to small modular reactors and what's happening in that in that area? What is EIL bringing to the table?

And do you see that whole space taking off?

So we have been attempting to re-enter the nuclear sector. Decades ago, we worked for the heavy water board. We built up their ManuGuru facilities.

Later on, we also supported IGKAR in some liquid sodium technology. We also did the balance of plant for Kodambkulam train one and two and some other projects here and there. Also nuclear fuel complex at Kota for enriching uranium.

So we have been there in the sector for the last few years. We have been attempting to enter the space which will open up post the nuclear liability bill going through, particularly in small modular reactors for the private sector and the public sector. And we have been speaking to the private sector.

Some of the private sector companies who are there in the public domain, we are in touch with them to engage with them. And some of them are also keen to take us on board to do, you know, the seismic and geographical studies to make sure that area is safe to put up a nuclear facility. So this continued attempt and attempt to collaborate to bring on the table the value proposition has actually resulted us in getting the, you know, the trust and faith of NPCIL in them awarding us two modular reactors.

One is a light water reactor, one is a pressurised heavy water reactor, again same to 20 megawatt kind of scale to 20 to 300 megawatt. And we are working on both of them. One is a conceptual design, one is a checking of an existing design such that they can be transformed into an offering for the sector.

And it is very exciting for us. It is also extremely, you know, transformative in the manner that it will take us to a platform where we are having that ability to do conceptual work in the core facility. So many of this, the work that we have done is out of the core nuclear, you know, island.

And this will help us go in there and look at offering our expertise there itself. So not only will it expand our portfolio, it will also make us part of the growth journey. And that's what we want.

EIL has always been there as and when the industry has developed, whether the refinery industry developed, then the petrochemical or offshore or the green technologies or data centres or buildings or wherever you go. So we want to be there when the actual investments happen so that we are better positioned than many other, you know, similar companies. Plus, also, let us keep in mind that nuclear is a strategic sector and a very critical sector which needs a high level of safety and reliability.

And who other than us would be, should be the natural partners of, you know, clients who would like to make that investment.

You mentioned Kudankulam, so a lot of that would be 20-25 years ago. I mean, I'm just wondering how many people who worked on nuclear in EIL are still around?

So that is about 2015-2016. So about 10-12 years ago. So we have teams.

We have some youngsters who have now become the middle level leaders and they are very much there. They, in fact, are very familiar with the teams on the other side as well. So the teams know each other.

That brings, you know, comfort as well as confidence. So we have talent. We have talent and we always intake more talent.

So we have the experience. We have the talent. We have the will.

So we hope to make huge inroads when the sector opens.

So let me come back to the bamboo part and not the bamboo part so much when you talked about the feedstock agnostic technology. Yes. So what else could we be using if we want to do ethanol?

I'm not saying only ethanol, but let's say even as we try and solve or sort of fill in the many energy blanks.

Right. So as we move forward, we have already got 20 percent blending of ethanol and gasoline. And as we move forward, either we get the flex engines, you know, wherein the sectoral, cross-sectoral kind of collaboration is required from the automotive sector as well as from the consumer.

They should also have the comfort to get that, you know, 100 percent ethanol. And they are already, I don't know the number, the many pumps which are also selling 100 percent ethanol. So it's a market driven, customer centric, product centric and, you know, those kind of factors.

But the target to get a blending of sustainable aviation fuel in jet fuel, when we're looking at 1 percent in 2027 and 2 percent in 2028, and we need to meet the regulatory framework, of course, in times to come, being the hub of aviation today as we speak. And so many airlines which are fuelling in the country, we will need to build up that capacity. And why I'm saying this, because ethanol becomes one of the feedstocks for taking A to J, alcohol to jet.

And that's one of the pathways to creating a sustainable pool of jet fuel. So going back to the feedstocks of ethanol, where you would limit the feedstocks for the second generation ethanol, again, second generation ethanol has its own challenges. It is having a price point which needs, which will find it difficult to have multiplicity of investments.

Also, the seasonality of the feedstocks, the price of the feedstocks and the ecosystem, the whole supply chain of feedstocks would be challenged. So the industry is looking at other feedstocks like spoiled grains, dented corn and feedstocks which are not good for, which don't conflict with the, you know, the dialogue about fuel and food and fuel. So those non-conflicting feedstocks, if they can be converted to alcohol, which have more sugar content than the other feedstocks, which are more lignin like straws, etc., I think those pathways are going to take a prominent position in the future to make way for creating a pool of, you know, SAF, which would help in keeping the hegemony of India as, you know, the hub of the airlines, which is going to be huge in times to come. There's fastest growing fuel as well as creating, you know, a decarbonised fuel system, also use of food grains. We have with surplus of food grains.

God has not been kind in giving us as much of the, you know, the like the Middle East, the oil and gas maybe, but we have food grains which we export in plenty, wherein we are surplus in several of them. So some kind of balance wherein we bridge, we overcome the nuances of, you know, kind of keeping the food safety in place, food security in place, I would say, well, where and also meet the second element of sustainable fuels. I think those kind of that kind of ecosystem will be in place in times to come.

Right. And it's interesting because what you're saying is that when we think about sustainable fuels or ethanol injection into fuel, we shouldn't be only thinking about cars and bikes. We should be seeing about aircraft.

Yes.

Which is not what normally comes to mind.

Yes. Yes, definitely.

So, OK, so if, you know, if you were to look at strategically, so as a country, we were investing heavily in renewable, which we continue to, but we're also meeting a lot of targets earlier than perhaps what we thought. So that's good. On the other side.

For geopolitical reasons, among other things, we are facing pressure, let's say, on the fossil fuel side. And I can see that or I can sense that there's a lot of pressure now to amp up our fossil fuel once again.

Yes.

How is that playing out for you?

So for us, I think all fuels are good. As many, the better. So we are there in green hydrogen.

We are doing, we are working in SAP with the 2G ethanol on the sustainable fuel. We are, we know the core, you know, space as well. But what we see going forward is we see a huge growth in the demand.

So it is only seasonal. To assume that this low seasonal growth is going to be sustainable may not be true. We are a growing economy and you've seen the numbers as, you know, every quarter results surprise you.

They, even if you see the real GDP or, you know, it is, you can feel the vibrancy of the economy as you move in the country, you know, and that is evident in the investments, the projects that you see all over. It is actually there and you travel in many other countries, you won't find that. And I think that is something which is going to continue.

So the growth in the energy demand is going to continue. Coupled with that will also be both our own INDCs, our own intrinsic commitment to the COP as well as ourselves to decarbonise will remain. So we need to have a balance of both the fossil fuels as well as the green fuels.

And as an organisation, EIL has been able to position itself very well on both domestic and international front on both. Today, we are also looking at a SAF project in Indonesia because we are doing a SAF project here. And we are talking to others as well, looking at, you know, green projects internationally because now that we have the, so what we have been doing all our life as an organisation is we build our core in India because we have more leverage, we have more dialogue, more easy access, more acceptability, price point competitiveness and so on and so forth.

We build that capability here, then we start looking at opportunities internationally. So we've got a breakthrough very recently of a SAF project in Indonesia, which is a testimony of the fact that we did one second generation ethanol here. We've done, we're doing a SAF project in Mangalore for MRPL and now we've got this project.

So this is how I see there is huge opportunity, both domestically and internationally. In fact, there is so much opportunity that delivery becomes a challenge. Just in SAF?

No, no. In general, in overall, that delivery becomes a challenge. You know, how to keep up your capacity and delivery to meet the, you know, the commitments that we have made as a company to deliver these projects.

So we need to upscale our people. We need to expand the resources. We need to get more talent in both at entry level and lateral level.

We need to keep our people more engaged. We have to bring in systems and processes in the organisation which are bringing in a leanness to both the operational aspects. We have to bring in empowerment, which we've done already, empowered the people to take more decisions, both in qualitative and quantitative terms.

So these are all the need to rebuild, to strengthen the organisation from within when we go outside and, you know, commit ourselves to putting projects together.

And I'm going to come to the India Energy Week point in a minute or two. But a couple of questions before that. One is to do with people and the other is to do with Nigeria, which is obviously a giant country in terms of oil or oil and gas.

And tell us about what you encountered there and what is it that we could pick up? I mean, you know, there's a lot of talk nowadays, for example, of South-South collaboration. And you're obviously implementing a very large project there, bigger than anything in India, at least in the refinery space.

So what is it that we can take away from some of these countries and some of these projects that we're working on?

I think the since that the client is a completely international private sector client, there is the desire to complete the project, to get it up and running, have a fast COD. It's watched all over the world. So that puts pressure on both the client as well as us to deliver.

That project scale is tremendous. One thing which strikes us different, which I have not been able to put together in the system in the country, is a lot of use of automation in terms of construction. So because of the challenges of the region, the non-availability of materials, manpower, the skill set machines in Nigeria, there was all the contractors who came there, largely from India, brought in automatic machines, whether it is for welding, for lifting, a lot of automation.

That kind of automation also brings in quality. It brings in a neatness in the product, which is unique. Something similar we are seeing in Mongolia.

We are implementing the largest LOC project in Mongolia. Again, it's an Indian contractor. But the finishing of the work has a different quality.

I think that's one thing which we are trying our best to adopt for our contractors here. Second element, especially in Mongolia, is safety. The angle of safety, even one incident, can be very serious to both the reputation of the owner, us, as well as the contractor.

So the element of safety, consciousness of safety, the desire for safety, so both the quality and safety aspects, similar things in ADNOC also. When we talk to the ADNOC team, I think these are the two learnings which we can and we must bring in into the country. Safety, we are still conscious in the country, but the quality, which could have a little element of cost, you know, because if you bring automation, because you don't have workers there, you need to have automation.

Here you have the workforce, so you bring in less automation, but then you compromise on time and quality. I think this kind of shift would help all three elements. It will help us as consultants, EPCM or PMC.

It will help the contractor finish their work faster. It will also help the owner achieve their completion. I think this is one learning which has to be put up in the ecosystem of the implementation of the oil and gas projects.

The third element which we had there is the constructability that we could experience, the experience that we got in construction. The largest diameter crude column, how we lifted it, how we placed it, the largest diameter RFCC reactor regenerated in diameter, in weight, in the world. So those are something bigger than any of the refineries.

So that experience is the icing on the cake for us, you know, because that is needing a lot of skill, a lot of supervision. That is unique. And that's why we not only train those people, but all the teams who are there bring back that learning into the company as well.

Right. So let me ask you about India Energy Week. So a lot of all of what you've talked about is what you want to showcase.

So people see it and then they obviously come and do business with you and younger people find this interesting and they come and work for you as well. So what are you hoping to showcase?

So the times of today needs that the talent and the talent that we draw in is excited enough to join us on that front. Secondly, on the customer front, we need to showcase the multifarious expertise that we bring on the table and the ability to stitch together not just the less commercially proven technologies, but also complex mega projects, whether it is in India or international. I think that kind of uniqueness, that kind of diverse talent which is available in one organisation, it is extremely rare to find.

So when we bring on the table the concept to commissioning, kind of end to end services under one roof to customer, we want to showcase that in terms of and showcase that in terms of executed projects, which are mega scale, both domestic and international. I think that kind of message and that kind of value proposition we want to bring across to to our customers and to our viewers and attendees in India Energy Week. We also want to, on the second element, also bring on to the table in India Energy Week that we are a company which is always transforming.

We are a company which is forward looking, a company which not only rests on the laurels of the past, but also looks at avenues for future and is willing to position itself, nurture talent, bring in new, fearless in implementing new technologies. I think that kind of confidence that we have, we want to showcase that even if it's the first of its kind, whereas it's the first of a large acrylic plant in the country, whether it is the first of an LPG cavern, which we commissioned in Mangalore, whether it's the first bamboo refinery, first sustainable evasion fuel and first strategic reserve of crude that we built in years ago in in Vizag or the first giant columns in Nigeria or the mega 26 percent petrochemical intensity in Rajasthan. So we've done all that and we have the ability to not only that, but much more. I think that kind of spirit, that kind of confidence, that's what we want to showcase in India Energy Week.

And what do you want to take away?

So we want to take away a lot of client network with us because we need to build on. We have been steadily building on newer clients and we want to keep our customers who are traditionally our customers with us. We want to retain them so that they come back to us for work.

That's something which keeps us going in terms of our repeat delivery to customers. So we want to take away that the goodwill and the connects that we get, not just from our customers, but all stakeholders, because India Energy Week is also about our other stakeholders. We have a Make in India pavilion wherein we nurture the manufacturing industry of the country.

Today, we are more than 96 percent self-sufficient in refinery sector, about 82 percent in petrochemical. And it's largely because of the efforts of Engineers India over the years, decades of service we have done to the nation to build in the manufacturing sector. So these are all our stakeholders.

So they also bring in new products. They bring in new, let's say, pumps, compressors, instrumentation, electrical systems. It's a good platform for them to showcase that and for us to pick those newer technologies into our own specifications.

In addition, it is a platform to collaborate on international front. Every India Energy Week, we have built in some conversations with the world majors in terms of some collaborative effort, which is one of its kind. And being in India and India-centric, it also not only exposes them to, you know, the Indian companies, it also brings in the element that we are there to expand and grow.

There are a lot of investments going to happen. It's an exciting place to be and an aspiration to kind of find each of us, you know, finding some value proposition at the end of the day. So it's a very, very exciting place to be.

Last question. So the last time I asked you about passing out of IIT and then making a choice of one staying back, working in an engineering space with government and so on. When you look at young people today, they're looking at multiple choices and working in manufacturing, working in, let's say, oil and gas is not necessarily the first one.

What would you tell someone or your younger self if in terms of if they are assessing these opportunities, blockchain versus, you know, energy column in a refinery, why and what would you tell them and why should they do what you think they should do?

Again, it's a very personal choice, but I would say that if anybody wants to continue in engineering and keep engineering as a base, it is a very good, you know, the first few years of one's career is there to learn and that learning can happen when you involve yourself with the nuts and bolts of your profession. So the blockchain or any other thing can sit on top of it, you know. So if one wants to continue in an engineering profession and not take finance and not take marketing and not take something else, it would always be good to build one's base for the first few formative years of your career.

You have formative of your life, formative four or five years of your career in a core engineering company or a core company wherein you learn the nuances of everything, because that gives you the confidence and the strength to apply over and above, you know, on top of it, anything you want after five, six years. Not that people might like to spend, if you like it, you love it. You can spend 40 years, why not 50 years or 60 years on the same subject?

But I think the first few years are very important to build a base. My message would be to take a step back, no harm in investing the first few years in especially a company like the oil and gas sector, whether you have a private sector or public sector. The field is very vast.

The exposure is unique. And I would say in a public sector, the exposure is much better than the private sector. The pay comparisons are similar.

It's not that you're losing out on money. They're almost the same. You get more benefits in the public sector if you want to actually go and evaluate on that front as well.

You have nothing to lose per se in terms of value, but the exposure you get is far more important, far more enriching, far more valuable for a long term career growth. And every company is not the same company as it was some few years ago. Every company has a lot of opportunities.

There is a lot of talent. There's a lot of interaction from the top level or even the head level or the ED level to the people. And I have seen in our company a lot of new youngsters that we keep meeting.

They're very excited and we give them a lot of other opportunities like we have multifunctional teams doing some taking up the project on their own. They do their own, you know, improvement systems. So keep them engaged.

They have a lot of, you know, opportunities to take up some, participate in different award schemes, different exciting hackathons and stuff like that. So there is a lot of engagement from the company side also to the youngsters. So we are there to offer that to the youngsters.

Lufthansa, a prominent global airline, marks its 100th anniversary, celebrating a century defined by innovation and leadership in the aviation industry. Established in 1926 as Deutsche Luft Hansa AG through the consolidation of several regional carriers, the airline quickly emerged as a pioneer in international air travel. Over the decades, Lufthansa has played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of commercial aviation both within Germany and on the global stage.

A Legacy of Innovation and Resilience

From its inception, Lufthansa set new standards by expanding international routes and adopting cutting-edge technologies. The airline faced considerable challenges following World War II, including the destruction of much of its fleet. Nevertheless, Lufthansa’s resurgence was marked by a determined focus on modernization, exemplified by the introduction of the Airbus A300. This aircraft brought enhanced efficiency and passenger comfort, reinforcing the airline’s commitment to innovation. Throughout its history, Lufthansa has maintained this forward-looking approach, continuously evolving to meet the demands of a dynamic industry.

Advancing Technology and Sustainability Initiatives

Looking to the future, Lufthansa remains at the forefront of technological progress and environmental responsibility. The airline has invested in advanced aircraft such as the Airbus A350 and is actively pursuing ambitious sustainability goals, including achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2050. Efforts to reduce environmental impact encompass the development of biofuels and comprehensive fleet upgrades aimed at improving fuel efficiency.

A significant component of this strategy involves the planned retrofit of 134 Airbus A320 aircraft to optimize flight paths, with work scheduled to commence in 2026. While this initiative is viewed by some investors as a positive step toward greater sustainability and operational efficiency, it also presents substantial technical and financial challenges. The high costs associated with retrofitting and the aggressive timeline have elicited mixed reactions from the market, with concerns raised about the potential financial strain. This move may prompt competitors to accelerate their own sustainability programs or emphasize their technological advancements, potentially intensifying competition within the sector.

Navigating a Complex Industry Landscape

Lufthansa’s centennial arrives amid a period of heightened competition and economic uncertainty in the airline industry. Analysts anticipate increased class segmentation and evolving consumer preferences by 2026, factors that will require Lufthansa to carefully manage its strategic positioning. Recent leadership changes at subsidiaries Eurowings and SunExpress have attracted attention, with industry observers closely monitoring these developments for indications of stability and future direction within the Lufthansa Group.

Sustained Commitment to Passenger Experience

Throughout its evolution, Lufthansa has consistently prioritized customer service excellence. The airline’s investments in premium cabins—including First Class, Business Class, and Premium Economy—alongside exclusive lounges at major hubs such as Frankfurt and Munich, underscore its dedication to passenger comfort. Digital innovations further enhance the travel experience, featuring a comprehensive mobile application that facilitates seamless check-in, personalized services, and advanced in-flight entertainment options.

“This partnership with the GFI is a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK,” said Dr. Amy Ruddock, Director, Willis Sustainable Fuels.","Willis Sustainable Fuels UK Limited, a subsidiary of Willis Lease Finance Corporation and the Green Finance Institute, an independent advisor to governments and investors, have announced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Project Accelerator to bring WSF’s pioneering SAF project at Wilton International in Teesside to Final Investment Decision (FID) and establish a replicable blueprint for financing new homegrown transition projects.

Since the start of 2025, the UK’s SAF mandate requires increasing levels of SAF in the UK’s jet fuel supply to reach 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.[1] Under the mandate, the economic, energy-security and innovation benefits of expanding domestic SAF production are compelling. This policy stability provides a strong, long-term demand signal to accelerate SAF growth, but the challenge remains in reaching bankability.

WSF’s Teesside project is one of the UK’s most advanced second-generation SAF projects, using existing, proven technology to make SAF from waste. Targeting 14,000 tonnes of production per year, the project supports national energy security, by reducing reliance on imported fuels and anchors new green-industry jobs in the Northeast, by converting mainly UK biomethane into next-generation jet fuel. This project has been funded £7.6 million through two rounds of the UK Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund.

Before committing capital to transactions in this nascent sector, financiers need to address risks including technology performance, feedstock, and price/revenue certainty. While the UK mandate provides strong long-term demand certainty, developers need to assemble a complex mix of public and private de-risking tools to meet these requirements.

With a track record of mobilising £77 billion in committed capital to drive the transition and as a key adviser in shaping the UK’s SAF mandate, GFI’s SAF programme will focus on helping leading projects reach FID in 2026. The “accelerator” platform is designed to remove financing barriers and develop solutions that attract private sector investment into pioneering projects.

Key objectives of the accelerator include:

Developing innovative financing and de-risking strategies for SAF infrastructure.

Identifying regulatory and financial gaps that, if addressed, could enable advanced SAF projects to reach FID and deliver volumes aligned with the UK SAF Mandate.

Convening private- and public-sector market participants to develop solutions that address bankability gaps.

Establishing a replicable model for turning policy ambition into built, investable clean-energy infrastructure as a number of UK projects seek to reach FID in the coming year.

“This partnership with the GFI is a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK,” said Dr. Amy Ruddock, Director, Willis Sustainable Fuels. “Together, we aim to create a blueprint for financing solutions that will accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.”

“Our collaboration with WSF exemplifies how strategic partnerships across the value chain can unlock investment for innovative technologies,” said Dr. Rhian-Mari Thomas, CEO at GFI. “By launching this accelerator approach, we aim to scale SAF production to support the UK’s ambitions for a homegrown SAF industry.”

Both organisations will also collaborate on communicating best practice and lessons learned from this process to raise visibility for SAF financing solutions within the UK’s transition finance ecosystem.",https://ethicalmarketingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-twitter-logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 21:56:37.190230

The Asian continent has been identified as a major driver in the biofuel production sector as several nations aim to enter the sector for the first time or expand existing operations to meet an increase in demand from the international market. Now, a leading Malaysian energy company has outlined its plans to pivot towards the sector in 2026, marking a shift in the conventional energy market.

Indonesia plans a gradual shift to biodiesel production in 2026

Several industry experts have noted the role that Asia will play in diversifying the energy market in 2026, with Indonesia planning to implement a gradual shift to biodiesel production this year.

Indonesia’s government is planning a concept to produce biodiesel up to B100 as part of its efforts to diversify its biofuel production sector. At the moment, biofuel diesel is required to consist of 35 percent fatty acid methyl esters from palm oil and 65 percent diesel fuel under the government’s directive. However, the Indonesian officials have plans to gradually increase that number over time.

“We are preparing concepts up to B100, but this will be done gradually. We will report the developments in due time.” – Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia

Indonesia’s government is preparing for a surge in biofuel usage in 2026 and beyond

The government has noted its intention to construct various supporting infrastructures, including ports, shipping, and logistics, to ensure a smooth, gradual roll-out of the new mandated percentages of bio-feedstock. Industry experts and analysts all point to the Asia continent playing an integral role in the energy transition to the biofuel sector.

Malaysia is planning to boost bio-feedstock production in the new year

Malaysia is following the trend that has emerged in Indonesia to develop a more welcoming environment for bio-feedstock production this year, as the government has noted the opportunity to become a key player in the global shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Cathay Pacific, a global leader in sustainability projects, has committed to pivoting its focus to developing the bio-feedstock sector in the nation. Several industry analysts have noted the important role that Asia will play in diversifying the energy market in the new year, such as International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh.

“All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels. It’s not just for air transport, it’s also for road transport. When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there. So, there’s an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil, and create a positive outcome for the environment as well. – International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh

Reshaping the global energy market to expand alternative energy development options will be key in the coming years, as the slow phasing out of oil and gas production enters a new era.

Despite the clear promotion of biofuels in Asia, the conventional upstream sector is still dominating the sector

Asia’s potential in the biofuel industry aside, the conventional upstream energy sector will continue to play a vital role in meeting the expected increase in energy demand that has been reported across several regions of the world. With PETRONAS reaching a major development step in South America recently, the traditional oil and gas sector is not going anywhere anytime soon. Asia will no doubt become a leader in the biofuel sector in 2026, but can the region continue on its path to diversify its energy sector beyond 2026?",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_647886398_XL-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 17:12:21.432122

Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month, according to Yahoo Finance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop.

The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next years crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.

Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by the current President's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the worlds largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trumps massive budget bill take effect later this year.

Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.

But farmers say the aid wont solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.

Kentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is ""a Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.""

The President of the National Corn Growers Association Jed Bower also urged the Trump administration to focus on cultivating additional uses for their crops. Farmers will benefit from having more buyers whether it is for ethanol and animal feed at home or for international markets.

""Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,"" Bower said. ""While this financial assistance is helpful and welcomed, we urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.""",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/blog/insights/soybean-farmers-1033756.webp,N,,2026-01-03 06:13:02.664711

A Bright Future for United Airlines and Azul’s Partnership As United Airlines has been expanding its interest in Azul, these airlines are expected to take advantage of their bolstered partnership as they move to succeed in the future.","United Airlines has made substantial progress in enhancing its positioning strategy in the Brazilian air transport sector by acquiring an increased stake of nearly 8% in Azul Linhas Aéreas, thereby more than doubling its present stake of 2.02% in the company. This has been made possible through Azul’s Chapter 11 restructuring, which will enable United Airlines to inject an initial investment of US$100 million into Azul, thereby entrenching their partnership and presenting Azul with more opportunities for co-operation on the continent. CADE, Brazil’s competition authority, cleared the deal, which will enable United Airlines to increase its economic interest in Azul.

This development is likely to have a number of benefits to both of them, with United Airlines acquiring more presence in Brazil, which is considered to be one of the most prominent tourist as well as business centers in South America. However, since Azul is undergoing processes aimed at restructuring, United Airlines’ additional stake in the company helps it grow in Brazil and Latin America.

Leveraging Strategic Partnerships for Tourism and Connectivity Growth

The expanded partnership between United Airlines and Azul is set to fuel tourism growth between Brazil and the United States, providing travelers with more direct routes and codeshare flights. United Airlines has already been collaborating with Azul for years, but this increase in stake strengthens their collaborative efforts, ensuring a seamless travel experience for passengers traveling between the two countries.

This partnership is expected to boost inbound tourism to Brazil, with United Airlines continuing to connect passengers from key US markets to Brazilian cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte. Meanwhile, Azul’s vast domestic network provides United with an opportunity to tap into Brazil’s regional markets, increasing the number of connections and providing more options for travelers seeking to explore Brazil and South America.

As both airlines expand their codeshare agreements and joint services, tourists and business travelers will benefit from increased connectivity, making Brazil more accessible for American travelers and encouraging cross-border tourism.

Supporting Azul’s Restructuring and Future Expansion

The investment by United Airlines in Azul’s Chapter 11 restructuring highlights the importance of strategic collaboration during times of financial restructuring. As Azul works to reduce debt, strengthen its liquidity, and increase its fleet size, the involvement of United Airlines will provide valuable support and expertise to help the airline recover and grow in the competitive aviation market.

With United’s commitment to the partnership and financial backing, Azul is expected to continue its expansion in the coming years. The airline plans to increase its fleet and network capacity, eventually launching international operations to new destinations, and strengthening its position as a leading carrier in Brazil and the South American aviation market.

Expanding Regional Connectivity and Growth in Latin America

Looking ahead, United Airlines and Azul are likely to expand their influence in the region. As regional connectivity grows and demand for air travel increases in South America, the partnership will likely lead to more direct routes and expanded services, enhancing both domestic and international travel options for tourists and business travelers.

With United Airlines already having a strong presence in Latin America, this partnership will make it easier for US passengers to connect to Brazilian destinations, and vice versa. The increased accessibility to key South American hubs, combined with the expanded network, will contribute to the future growth of the tourism sector and the aviation industry in both Brazil and the United States.

Moreover, as Latin American tourism continues to rise, the collaboration between United Airlines and Azul will ensure that both airlines remain competitive and well-positioned to meet the increasing demand for international and domestic flights in the region. This will also boost tourism revenue, particularly in Brazil, which has already seen growing interest from tourists around the world.

A Growing Focus on Sustainable Aviation Practices

As both airlines continue to expand, they will likely place a growing emphasis on sustainability and environmentally responsible aviation practices. The aviation industry is increasingly moving towards eco-friendly solutions, including fuel-efficient aircraft, carbon offset programs, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

United Airlines, which has made sustainability a core component of its operations, will likely collaborate with Azul to incorporate more eco-friendly practices into their operations, helping both airlines contribute to global sustainability goals. This shift towards green aviation is expected to become a key growth factor in Latin America and global aviation, positioning United Airlines and Azul as leaders in sustainable travel.

A Bright Future for United Airlines and Azul’s Partnership

As United Airlines has been expanding its interest in Azul, these airlines are expected to take advantage of their bolstered partnership as they move to succeed in the future. Increased connectivity between Brazil and the United States, governments’ backing to restructure Azul, and future aircraft additions are expected to boost tourism between these two areas.

This strategic partnership is a testament to the increasing need for the collaborations of airlines globally. This is especially because it contributes to the economic development of the countries as well as the development of tourism. The future potential for both United Airlines and Azul is great, as they continue to play a crucial role in the Latin American aviation market.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/United-Airlines-Expands-Stake-in-Azul-to-Eight-Percent.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 15:12:15.382515

Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming so many areas of our lives, and aerospace is no exception. As the sector faces some significant challenges from increasing passenger demand, new environmental imperatives, and the addition of new airspace actors – such as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) – we will see more and more AI driving advancements in safety, efficiency and sustainability.

The question, however, is no longer whether AI will transform aviation, but how it can be applied responsibly, especially as aerospace innovation accelerates at a pace and scale few sectors can match.

Applying AI to aerospace

Modern airspace is a high-stakes puzzle, with thousands of flights criss-crossing the globe daily and traditional air traffic management (ATM) systems currently straining under the load. AI offers critical solutions by enabling dynamic, real-time air traffic flow management. AI-driven algorithms optimise flight paths and sequencing, reducing delays and maximising airspace utilisation. These systems can also enhance resilience, supporting controllers and pilots with automated decision tools during disruptions, thereby improving safety margins.

Predictive maintenance is another significant area of advancement. Imagine knowing if a component will fail before it does. By analysing the multitude of sensor data from an aircraft system, predictive maintenance forecasts wear and tear, enabling airlines to act before problems ground their fleets. This approach reduces unscheduled downtime and operational costs and could be especially useful in areas where aircraft usage doesn’t follow a repeatable pattern – such as in military aircraft.

Aviation operations generate and require vast amounts of data, from weather pattern monitoring and flight plans to fuel usage and emission measurements. AI excels at processing this sort of information, transforming it into usable insights for both airlines and airports. Real-time weather integration enables dynamic rerouting around adverse conditions, enhancing passenger comfort and safety, as well as aircraft longevity. Predictive models can help anticipate congestion in airspace and airports, allowing for proactive traffic flow management that minimises delays and emissions.

Furthermore, AI-driven route optimisation also improves fuel efficiency by minimising unnecessary deviations and optimising flight profiles, supporting the industry’s sustainability goals. Enhanced collaboration and data sharing between airlines, airports, and network managers – facilitated by AI – creates greater shared situational awareness for all airspace users.

The influence of AI extends to emerging domains such as advanced air mobility (AAM) and urban air mobility (UAM). The integration of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and autonomous drones into existing airspace presents significant challenges across many areas of society. AI-enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) systems could be essential for safely and efficiently managing large volumes of low-altitude operations.

Navigating the headwinds

However, it’s not all plain sailing, and increased automation certainly introduces challenges for the human-machine interface. Operators must maintain situational awareness and be prepared to intervene, much like cars with autopilot modes on the road. Regulatory frameworks still have some way to go to address certification and safety assurance for autonomous systems, ensuring oversight and accountability remain robust, without stifling this innovation.

As AI capabilities grow, the risk of over-reliance on machine outputs becomes more pronounced. Effective training on human-machine teaming is essential to ensure proper use and to build resilience in a potential scenario where automation fails. Crews must be able to manage unexpected behaviours and exercise manual control to ensure safe outcomes in any situation. Human factors and training will remain vital to air operations, with AI augmenting, not replacing, human expertise. In a similar light, there is a need to determine and define accountability in automated air operations, ensuring there is legal liability and accountability.

The cybersecurity of automated air platforms is paramount. The risk of a hostile takeover, either physically or digitally, of an automated aircraft should never be underestimated, similar to that of traditional surface vehicles. At perhaps a less mortal threat level, dataset poisoning or algorithmic sabotage could also play a role in future commercial competition or hostile action.

AI will prove to be a powerful enabler in civil aerospace, offering significant gains in efficiency, safety, and sustainability. This won’t be a simple or rapid transition and will rely on cooperation and collaboration throughout complex supply chains, air operation environments and jurisdictions. By embracing AI thoughtfully, the aerospace industry can achieve a future that is efficient, safe, equitable, and sustainable.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1526986072.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:12:09.360967

The research house said that while the European Union and the United States have put in place mandatory measures to boost SAF use, Malaysia’s current blending targets remain voluntary and non-binding. This could leave the country in a position where it produces SAF for export without creating enough demand from its own airlines.

BIMB Securities pointed out that Malaysia’s policies lack clear requirements and firm timelines, which could delay adoption by domestic carriers and reduce the fuel’s competitiveness.

SAF, made by blending palm oil or used cooking oil with conventional jet fuel, is regarded by the aviation industry as one of the main ways to reduce carbon emissions from flying.

In the European Union, airlines must ensure that at least 2% of fuel used on departing flights is SAF from 2025, with the share set to rise to 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050. In the United States, producers are offered tax incentives if they meet certain conditions.

Malaysia has also acknowledged the importance of SAF and has set a target to produce up to one million tonnes by 2027.

However, BIMB Securities said the biggest hurdle remains the high cost of SAF, which is estimated to be around three times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Without subsidies, tax breaks or mandatory blending rules, airlines have little incentive to adopt it on a voluntary basis.

The research firm added that because airlines operate on thin margins, the price gap between SAF and conventional fuel has limited uptake, making stronger policy support necessary to encourage wider use.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-Bioenergy.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:12:16.917280

Australia has now joined this shift, with the federal government announcing a major funding plan to support domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels, following long-standing demands from the farming sector, reports Energies Media.

Under a new Clean Fuels Program, the government will invest AU$1.1 billion (around $732 million) in the biofuel sector over the next 10 years. The move marks a change in direction for Australia, which has historically relied on oil and gas exports, as more countries focus on cleaner fuel sources.

The government plans to begin construction of Australia’s first large-scale biofuel refinery in 2026. Funding under the decade-long program will be used to draw private investment into biofuels and related industries, with the aim of turning Australia into a key player in global biofuel production.

Agriculture is expected to be central to the strategy. Australia is a major producer of crops such as canola, sugarcane and sorghum, which are widely used in biofuel production worldwide. At present, most of these crops are exported, while the country imports much of its fuel.

For years, farmers have urged the government to invest in biofuels, arguing that Australia has both the land and resources to build a strong domestic industry. The new investment is being seen as a response to those calls and a step towards creating new markets for agricultural output.

In a government statement, officials said Australia’s advanced farming methods and access to renewable energy give it a strong advantage in producing cleaner fuels needed by aviation, shipping and heavy transport as countries work to cut emissions.

The government also said the biofuel push would complement growth in renewable energy and help build new industries.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the funding represents an early commitment to developing a new sector and ensuring Australia benefits economically from the global shift towards lower-emission energy.

As the global airfreight industry steps into 2026, the latest projections from IATA suggest a year defined by growth, sustainability, and recalibration. Airlines are expected to carry 71.6 million tonnes of cargo.

This bullish outlook comes on the back of a record-setting October 2025, when global air cargo demand rose 4.1 percent year-on-year, according to IATA. It marked the eighth consecutive month of growth, driven by strong intra-Asia, Middle East–Europe, and Europe–Asia lanes — even as the Asia–North America corridor remained under pressure due to U.S. tariff impacts.

At the regional level, African airlines posted the highest year-on-year growth at 16.6 percent, followed by Asia-Pacific at 8.3 percent and the Middle East at 5.7 percent. European carriers grew a stable 4.3 percent, while North America and Latin America both declined by 2.7 percent, reflecting ongoing trade route realignments.

“October’s performance shows how air cargo is enabling global supply chains to reconfigure in real time,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “That’s crucial as we enter the Q4 peak season and prepare for a more fragmented demand environment in 2026.”

Indeed, fragmentation is one of the watchwords for the year ahead. Demand remains uneven across geographies, while cost pressures persist. Fuel prices rose 2.5 percent in October despite falling crude, and the global manufacturing PMI hovers just above the growth threshold. Export order sentiment, meanwhile, remains cautious.

Yet airlines are not standing still. IATA’s 2026 goals include $4.5 billion in SAF investment, $1.7 billion in climate financing, and continued improvement in operational metrics — like targeting an 83.8 percent seat occupancy rate and flying 5.2 billion passengers.

OPINION

By David Sempala

In the bustling terminals of Entebbe International Airport, frustration has become as common as departure announcements. Uganda Airlines, the nation's revived flag carrier, has been plagued by a series of setbacks that epitomise the broader struggles of African aviation. Just this month, passengers bound for Dubai and other destinations found themselves stranded for days due to technical faults, with planes grounded in Lagos and London. Reports of poor communication, lack of accommodations, and even police intervention in Dubai to secure meals for affected travellers have sparked public outrage.

The airline, already haemorrhaging losses, nearly 300 billion Ugandan shillings (about $80 million) in 2024 alone, faces accusations of mismanagement, including an unqualified CEO earning a salary ten times that of her counterpart at profitable Ethiopian Airlines. These incidents aren't isolated; they reflect a continent-wide crisis where national carriers buckle under operational constraints, rising costs, and fierce competition from well-capitalised global players.

Africa's aviation sector, despite leading global growth in passenger numbers post-pandemic, remains hamstrung by structural barriers. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects African airlines will eke out a meagre $0.2 billion in profits for 2025, translating to a slim 1.1% net margin, far below the global average. Challenges abound: fragmented markets and policies hinder seamless operations, while high fuel costs, excessive taxes, and blocked funds (where governments restrict repatriation of airline revenues) erode viability. Safety concerns persist, with Africa's accident rate at 1.1 per million flights in 2025, underscoring inadequate infrastructure and regulatory gaps.

Geopolitical tensions, from conflicts rerouting flights to security risks in volatile regions, compound these issues. Meanwhile, intra-African connectivity lags: only 20% of air travel on the continent stays within Africa, forcing passengers to endure costly detours via Europe or the Middle East.

Uganda Airlines' woes mirror those of peers like Kenya Airways, which has grappled with debt and required bailouts despite partnerships with KLM. As the attached post notes, these carriers face operational constraints, fleet underutilization, and the harsh realities of competing against entrenched regional giants. Yet, the post also highlights a path forward: strategic private partnerships and governance reforms. But why stop at national fixes? Africa's aviation needs a bolder vision, a joint Pan-African airline where countries hold shares, pooling resources for collective strength.

Imagine a carrier modelled on the African Union's aspirations, with equity distributed among member states based on population, GDP, or aviation needs. This ""Air Africa"" could leverage economies of scale to negotiate better fuel deals, aircraft leases, and maintenance contracts, slashing costs that currently cripple smaller operators. Shared fleets would optimise utilisation, addressing issues like Uganda's limited wide-body aircraft that led to recent disruptions. By focusing on unserved routes, it could boost intra-continental travel, plugging gaps in the network and fostering trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Tourism would flourish with affordable, direct flights between Lagos and Johannesburg, or Nairobi and Dakar, unlocking economic growth estimated at billions in added GDP. The benefits extend beyond economics. A Pan-African airline would embody unity, much like the defunct Air Afrique, which connected West African nations in the 1960s-2000s before succumbing to mismanagement.

Lessons from that era, ensuring transparent governance and avoiding political interference, could guide success. Shareholder countries would enforce accountability through a multinational board, blending public oversight with private expertise. Sustainability gains traction too: collective bargaining for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could overcome current barriers like high costs and regulatory voids, positioning Africa as a green aviation leader.

Critics might argue that fragmentation makes such a venture improbable, citing past alliances' failures. Yet, recent moves—like Kenya Airways' partnerships reshaping alliances—show momentum. With the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) aiming for liberalisation, a joint airline could accelerate implementation, reducing protectionism that shields inefficient carriers.

National pride, as Uganda wants to be, can't sustain an airline alone. But smart, continent-wide partnerships can. By uniting as shareholders, African nations could transform aviation from a perennial loss-maker into an engine of integration and prosperity. For Uganda Airlines and its counterparts, this could be the lifeline: not revival in isolation, but rebirth through solidarity. The skies await Africa's collective ascent.

The order book of EnviTec Biogas AG shows three new contract signings with first-time customers in Germany. All newly secured projects involve gas upgrading plants that will be manufactured at EnviTec’s Saerbeck site over the coming months. With the project in Biburg, Lower Bavaria, EnviTec Biogas is establishing a presence in the Bavarian market for the first time, following the construction of 112 plants across Germany. “The customer already operates a gas upgrading plant using water scrubbing technology, which will be decommissioned once our EnviThan upgrading plant has been installed,” explains EnviTec Biogas Area Sales Manager DACH, Christian Eilert.

“Nearly two years passed between our first contact at the Biogas Convention & Trade Fair in Nuremberg in 2023 and the signing of the contract – two years marked by political uncertainties, constantly changing market conditions and lengthy permitting procedures,” reports customer Benedikt Bachmeier of Bioenergie Biburg. The initial grid feed-in date for the 1,000 Nm³/h biomethane plant has already been set: from July 2026, the plant is expected to begin injecting into the local network. “A key advantage of this project is that we are also supplying the booster compressor required to achieve the necessary grid pressure. This allowed us to significantly accelerate the overall grid injection process,” Eilert adds.

In addition to the time savings and low power consumption of the EnviThan plant, the customer was particularly impressed by EnviTec’s customised design approach. “Given the structural constraints of the existing biogas plant, space on site is limited. However, our flexible container-based construction enables us to accommodate the conditions effectively,” says Eilert. The EnviTec team is also responding flexibly to the site conditions of its second new customer, Hamme Energie GmbH & Co. KG, located in Osterholz-Scharmbeck near Bremen. “Here too, we are constructing a gas upgrading plant as an extension to the existing biogas plant,” Eilert continues.

The EnviThan system is already under construction in Saerbeck, with delivery scheduled for March 2026. The 137 Nm³/h EnviThan plant can be upgraded onsite to 232 Nm³/h of biomethane by simply adding membranes. The biomethane produced will be fed into the network of Osterholzer Stadtwerke. The plant is supplied with dairy cattle slurry, cattle manure and silage maize from the company’s own farming operations.

The third contract was signed in Reichardtswerben in Saxony-Anhalt. The plant, being built for a Dutch operator of a large dairy farming enterprise, can be expanded from 200 Nm³/h biomethane in its initial configuration to 400 Nm³/h. Once completed, it is intended to inject into the Ontras network to supply the fuel market. “For this project as well, we have already ordered all components and can begin production as soon as the container arrives,” says Eilert. Production capacity at EnviTec Biogas’ manufacturing facilities in Saerbeck, North Rhine-Westphalia, is currently running at a high level.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Envitec_Logo_830d4047ff.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:12:21.845354

Furthermore, this event fits into a broader global trend of agricultural protectionism and the ""greening"" of farm policy.
Summary and Investor Takeaways The current state of U.S. agricultural policy is a study in the limitations of emergency intervention.
Equipment Rebound Timing: Monitor the September Farm Bill deadline; a long-term bill could be the ""buy"" signal for Deere and CNH Industrial.","As the 2026 calendar year begins, the United States agricultural sector finds itself at a critical policy crossroads. On one hand, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has just finalized the enrollment for its $12 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) program, a massive infusion of ad-hoc cash designed to keep producers afloat through February 2026. On the other hand, a growing chorus of commodity leaders and farm advocacy groups is signaling that they have reached a breaking point with ""mailbox farming,"" demanding that Washington move away from emergency bailouts in favor of permanent, structural reforms to the nation’s agricultural safety net.

The immediate implications are stark: while the FBA payments will provide a necessary liquidity injection for corn, soybean, and cotton farmers facing compressed margins, the reliance on such measures underscores the failure of Congress to pass a comprehensive, five-year Farm Bill. With the 2018 Farm Bill now extended through September 2026 following a year of intense legislative gridlock, the agricultural industry is entering a high-stakes period where the very definition of federal support is being contested. Farmers are increasingly calling for higher reference prices and trade stability rather than the unpredictable, politically charged relief packages that have characterized the last several years.

The Push for Permanent Policy Over Temporary Relief

The current friction stems from the December 2025 announcement of the FBA program, which allocated $11 billion for row crops and $1 billion for specialty crops and sugar. The program was necessitated by a ""perfect storm"" of high input costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and trade disruptions that saw the farm income safety net fail to trigger adequately under existing 2018 rules. According to USDA data, the payment rates for the 2026 distribution are significant: rice producers are set to receive $132.89 per acre, while cotton and corn farmers will see $117.35 and $44.36 per acre, respectively. While these funds are a lifeline, commodity leaders argue they are a symptom of a broken system.

The timeline leading to this moment is defined by the expiration of the original Farm Bill in late 2024 and a subsequent series of short-term extensions. Throughout 2025, House Agriculture Chairman G.T. Thompson attempted to advance a ""Farm Bill 2.0,"" which sought to increase commodity reference prices by as much as 21% to account for inflation. However, these efforts were derailed by a significant government shutdown in late 2025 and a fractured political coalition between urban nutrition advocates and rural farm interests. The result was the current extension, which leaves farmers operating under outdated price floors while the USDA scrambles to fill the gap with ad-hoc programs like the FBA.

Key stakeholders, including the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and the National Farmers Union (NFU), have shifted their rhetoric from gratitude to demand. AFBF President Zippy Duvall recently noted that while aid ""bridges the gap,"" the industry cannot thrive on a ""patchwork of emergency checks."" The NFU has gone further, launching a ""Fairness for Farmers"" campaign that targets the structural roots of the problem, including corporate consolidation in the seed and fertilizer sectors and the lack of mandatory country-of-origin labeling, which they argue suppresses the ""bottom line"" more than any subsidy can fix.

Corporate Impact: From Machinery Slumps to Seed Spin-offs

The policy vacuum and the shift toward ad-hoc aid have sent ripples through the public markets, particularly affecting companies tied to farmer capital expenditures. Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has been a primary casualty of the uncertainty; the machinery giant reported a nearly 15% decline in large agricultural equipment sales in late 2025. With farmers hesitant to invest in new fleets without a long-term Farm Bill in place, Deere has guided for 2026 to be the ""bottom of the cycle,"" though a successful transition to structural support could trigger a massive replacement cycle in 2027. Similarly, CNH Industrial (NYSE: CNHI) has been forced to implement production cuts and manage bloated inventories as the ""wait-and-see"" approach among producers persists.

In the seeds and chemicals space, Corteva (NYSE: CTVA) is navigating a radical transformation in response to these market pressures. The company recently announced a massive corporate split to be completed by late 2026, dividing into a seed-focused entity (""SpinCo"") and a crop protection-focused ""New Corteva."" This move is seen by analysts as a defensive play against increased federal scrutiny of input pricing and a way to insulate its high-margin Pioneer seed brand from the volatility of the broader chemical market. Meanwhile, Bayer (OTC: BAYRY) continues to face pressure as the calls for structural reform often include heightened anti-trust oversight of the ""Big Three"" seed providers.

The processing and grain handling sector is also feeling the heat. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) and Bunge Global (NYSE: BG) have both seen earnings volatility as ""crush margins"" collapsed in late 2025. For ADM, the delay in clarifying biofuel tax credits—specifically the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit—has stalled investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure. If the 2026 policy shift includes the ""biofuel pivot"" that farm groups are lobbying for, ADM and Bunge could see a significant rebound in demand for corn and soybean oil, transforming their outlook from stagnant to high-growth.

Broader Significance and Historical Context

The current demand for structural reform is not just about money; it is a battle over the future of the American ""family farm"" model versus increasing industrialization. Historically, the U.S. has used ad-hoc aid during times of extreme crisis, such as the 1980s farm crisis or the trade wars of 2018-2019. However, the fact that these ""emergency"" payments have become a near-annual occurrence suggests that the 2018 Farm Bill's safety net—designed for a lower-inflation, more stable trade era—is fundamentally obsolete. This trend mirrors the ""permanent emergency"" state seen in other sectors, but in agriculture, it risks decoupling farm income from market signals entirely.

Furthermore, this event fits into a broader global trend of agricultural protectionism and the ""greening"" of farm policy. The push for structural changes in 2026 is heavily intertwined with the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Farm groups are essentially asking for a trade: they will accept more stringent environmental standards if the government provides a permanent, predictable market for biofuels through tax credits and infrastructure support. This would represent a historic shift in U.S. policy, moving from a ""price support"" model to a ""demand creation"" model.

The regulatory implications are also profound. The National Farmers Union’s focus on consolidation suggests that the next Farm Bill may include ""Competition Titles"" for the first time in decades. This could lead to increased oversight by the Department of Justice and the USDA into the pricing power of companies like CF Industries (NYSE: CF) in the fertilizer market or Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) in meatpacking. If structural reform includes anti-trust measures, the valuation premiums currently enjoyed by dominant agricultural players could be at risk.

The 2026 Outlook: Strategic Pivots and Scenarios

Looking ahead to the remainder of 2026, the primary focus for the market will be the September 30 expiration of the current Farm Bill extension. In the short term, the distribution of the $12 billion FBA payments in February will likely provide a temporary boost to the share prices of agricultural retailers and equipment dealers as farmers use the cash to settle debts and make essential purchases. However, for a sustained market recovery, investors will need to see a ""Grand Bargain"" in Washington that reconciles the 21% reference price hike with the budget constraints of the 2025 reconciliation act.

A potential strategic pivot for the industry involves the ""45Z"" tax credit. If the administration provides a clear, long-term framework for carbon-intensity scoring by mid-2026, it could unlock billions in private investment. This would benefit companies like Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR), which is heavily invested in renewable diesel. Conversely, if the policy remains mired in ad-hoc cycles, we may see further consolidation as smaller family farms are forced to sell to larger corporate entities that have the balance sheets to weather the uncertainty.

The most likely scenario for the second half of 2026 is a ""Farm Bill 2.0"" that prioritizes crop insurance and biofuel demand over direct commodity payments. This would be a win for the insurance sector and biofuel processors but might leave traditional row-crop farmers in a tighter margin environment if trade relations with major importers like China do not improve.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The current state of U.S. agricultural policy is a study in the limitations of emergency intervention. While the USDA's $12 billion FBA program provides a necessary buffer, the loud calls for structural reform from groups like the AFBF and NFU indicate that the industry is ready for a fundamental shift. The transition from ""mailbox farming"" to a market-driven, biofuel-integrated safety net is the primary objective for 2026.

For investors, the key takeaways are:

Watch the 45Z Credit: The clarification of biofuel tax credits will be a bigger catalyst for ADM and Bunge than any direct USDA payment.

Equipment Rebound Timing: Monitor the September Farm Bill deadline; a long-term bill could be the ""buy"" signal for Deere and CNH Industrial.

Input Scrutiny: Be cautious of companies with high market concentration in seeds and chemicals, as ""Fairness for Farmers"" initiatives may lead to regulatory headwinds.

As the February 28 payment deadline approaches, the market will be watching to see if this is the last of the ""great bailouts"" or if the U.S. is destined to remain in a cycle of ad-hoc agricultural management. The next nine months will decide whether the American farm economy enters a new era of structural stability or continues to lean on the crutch of emergency aid.

In this plant, used cooking oil will collected and co-processed in the full conversion hydrocracker unit of the existing refinery to create fuel for aircraft.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced that Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has launched a demonstration plant at its Visakhapatnam Refinery. The plant will produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil (UCO) sourced from homes, hotels, and restaurants. This UCO will be co-processed in the existing refinery's full conversion hydrocracker unit to create fuel for aircraft.

The Indian government has described this initiative as essential for reducing carbon emissions from the aviation industry and advancing the concept of waste-to-wealth. Globally, there is a growing effort to make aviation turbine fuel (ATF) more environmentally friendly.

According to a report from Jagran.com, SAF has up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel and can be used in current aircraft engines without modification. HPCL's roadmap indicates that, once international certification is received, the Visakhapatnam refinery will produce around 10,000 tonnes of SAF annually starting in January 2027. This production will play a significant role in helping India meet its SAF blending targets.

¿Hasta dónde llegará el largo radio de pasillo único?","Aviación Digital, Sp.- Durante décadas, la aviación comercial asumió que el largo radio era territorio casi exclusivo de los aviones de fuselaje ancho, desde los pioneros Boeing 747 hasta los actuales A350 o 787. Hoy, la llegada del Airbus A321XLR a aerolíneas como Iberia plantea un cambio de paradigma: ¿hasta qué punto un avión de pasillo único puede capturar parte significativa del mercado transatlántico manteniendo estándares de confort, seguridad y sostenibilidad propios del segmento widebody?

La incorporación del séptimo A321XLR de Iberia, matrícula EC-ORE, a pocas horas de cerrar 2025, convierte a este modelo en un pilar estructural de la red de largo radio de la compañía con base en Madrid-Barajas, mientras la octava unidad ya figura en el plan de flota para 2026. Esta apuesta no solo es un movimiento de capacidad: implica decisiones estratégicas sobre diseño de red, cumplimiento regulatorio, gestión del riesgo y posicionamiento competitivo a medio plazo.grupo.

Plataforma A321XLR: capacidades técnicas y certificación

El Airbus A321XLR es la variante de mayor alcance de la familia A320neo, diseñada para vuelos de hasta unas 11 horas y un radio aproximado de 4.700 millas náuticas, lo que permite unir pares de ciudades como Madrid–Boston o Roma–Nueva York con un solo pasillo. La aeronave incorpora un Rear Centre Tank (RCT) integrado estructuralmente en el fuselaje, así como mejoras en peso máximo al despegue y sistemas que permiten operar con prestaciones comparables a algunos widebody en rutas “thin” de largo radio (Rutas de largo radio con baja demanda).

Desde el punto de vista regulatorio, el A321XLR ha superado un proceso de certificación especialmente exigente con EASA, centrado en la resistencia al fuego y la integridad estructural del RCT (el tanque central de combustible), así como en las prestaciones de evacuación en escenarios post-impacto.

Motores y eficiencia: palanca de sostenibilidad y costes

El A321XLR puede equiparse con motores Pratt & Whitney GTF o CFM LEAP-1A, ambos diseñados para lograr reducciones de consumo de combustible y emisiones de CO₂ en el entorno del 15–20% respecto a la generación anterior de narrowbodies. Estas mejoras se apoyan en tecnologías como el fan engranado en el caso del GTF, o el uso de materiales avanzados y combustión optimizada en el LEAP, con un impacto adicional en ruido exterior e interior, un factor clave en aeropuertos hub con restricciones operativas.

Para operadores como Iberia, la combinación de un fuselaje de pasillo único con motores de alta eficiencia permite abordar varias prioridades simultáneas: reducción de costes por asiento (un 30% por asiento frente a competidores de la generación anterior), cumplimiento de objetivos de sostenibilidad y compatibilidad con mezclas crecientes de Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) que la UE impulsará en el marco de iniciativas como ReFuelEU. En términos estratégicos, esta configuración encaja con el discurso corporativo de modernización de flota y alineamiento con los compromisos de descarbonización sectorial a 2030 y 2050.

La apuesta de Iberia: siete A321XLR hoy, ocho en 2026

Iberia fue en noviembre de 2024 la primera aerolínea del mundo en operar el Airbus A321XLR, adelantándose a competidores europeos y americanos en la explotación comercial de este tipo de aeronave en rutas de largo radio. A cierre de 2025, la compañía suma ya siete unidades en servicio, con la octava prevista para 2026, cumpliendo el pedido inicial de ocho aviones destinado a reforzar su red intercontinental desde Madrid.

Esta flota A321XLR se integra en un mix que incluye A350 y A330, permitiendo a la aerolínea ajustar la capacidad al comportamiento real de cada mercado: el narrowbody se asigna a rutas “thin” o emergentes, así como a incrementos de frecuencia, mientras que los widebody se reservan para destinos de mayor densidad o para vuelos con fuerte componente de carga. La declaración de la propia Iberia sobre que el A321XLR “ha transformado su estrategia de largo radio” subraya que ya no se trata de un experimento marginal, sino de una pieza central en la arquitectura de red y de ingresos.

Cabina, experiencia de pasajero y percepción del “single aisle” en largo radio

La flota A321XLR de Iberia incorpora la cabina Airspace, con compartimentos superiores de mayor capacidad, iluminación LED configurable y mejoras en la sensación espacial, criterios esenciales para mitigar la percepción de confinamiento en vuelos de 7–9 horas con un solo pasillo. La aerolínea destaca que el estándar de producto —business con asientos cama, IFE de última generación y conectividad— se alinea con el nivel de sus A330 y A350, buscando neutralizar la posible reticencia del segmento corporativo a volar largo radio en narrowbody.

Para el pasajero profesional, el debate no es solo de comodidad, sino también de robustez operativa: un avión más pequeño puede ofrecer más opciones de horario y una menor probabilidad de cancelación por baja ocupación, aunque la capacidad de “reacomodo” en caso de incidencias sea menor que con un widebody. El reto para Iberia y el resto de operadores que adopten este modelo será gestionar la percepción de seguridad, confort y fiabilidad, explicando con transparencia las ventajas técnicas y operativas del A321XLR frente a los esquemas tradicionales de flota.

Cabe mencionar que, en otros tiempos, las aerolíneas invitaban a medios especializados a experimentar estos vuelos inaugurales de primera mano, permitiendo a periodistas y expertos del sector evaluar directamente la cabina, el producto y la operativa real para transmitir una valoración objetiva a sus lectores. Esa práctica, aparentemente en desuso, habría permitido contrastar sobre el terreno las promesas comerciales con la experiencia tangible del pasajero en un A321XLR operando a máximo radio. Quizás, en la era de los comunicados de prensa y las especificaciones técnicas, se considere que la experiencia directa del periodismo especializado ya no aporta valor al debate público sobre la evolución de la aviación comercial…que equivocación.

Regulación, ETOPS y gestión del riesgo en monocobertura oceánica

La operación de un A321XLR en rutas transoceánicas exige capacidades ETOPS/EDTO avanzadas y una coordinación estrecha con autoridades como EASA y AESA en materia de certificación, mantenimiento, formación de tripulaciones y planes de contingencia. La presencia del RCT y la mayor dependencia de la integridad de un fuselaje single aisle en escenarios de despresurización, fuego o amerizaje plantean requisitos específicos en cuanto a diseño, pruebas de resistencia al fuego y protocolos de evacuación.

Además, el entorno regulatorio europeo avanza hacia una supervisión más granular del rendimiento en seguridad, con énfasis en indicadores de confiabilidad de motores, sistemas de combustible y datos de vuelo, en línea con los principios de los Safety Management Systems (SMS) y la monitorización de riesgos emergentes en aeronaves de nueva generación. Para Iberia, esto implica integrar en su sistema de gestión de seguridad la experiencia operativa acumulada con los primeros A321XLR, alimentando bucles de mejora continua que den confianza tanto a reguladores como a la comunidad profesional.

Implicaciones económicas: coste por asiento, yields y estrategia de flota

Desde un punto de vista económico, el principal atractivo del A321XLR reside en un coste por asiento sensiblemente inferior al de muchos widebody modernos, combinado con un coste por vuelo cercano a la mitad en determinadas configuraciones, según datos de Airbus. Esta combinación permite operar rutas de baja o media densidad que serían marginales o directamente deficitarias con aviones de fuselaje ancho, así como probar nuevos mercados con un riesgo financiero mucho menor.

La apuesta de Iberia se inserta en un plan de inversión a 2030 que contempla incrementar su flota de largo radio de 45 a aproximadamente 70 aeronaves, con una mezcla más balanceada entre A350, A330 y A321XLR. En términos de ingresos, la estrategia apunta a reforzar el hub de Madrid como plataforma de conexión Europa–América con mayor granularidad de destinos y horarios, lo que puede elevar los yields mediante oferta de productos de alto valor (business/ premium economy) sin asumir el riesgo estructural de un exceso de plazas en rutas volátiles.

Contexto competitivo: ¿redefinición del papel del widebody?

La consolidación del A321XLR en Iberia y otras aerolíneas plantea un cambio en el reparto de roles entre narrowbody y widebody a escala global. Los aviones de pasillo ancho seguirán siendo indispensables en rutas de altísima densidad, vuelos con fuerte componente de carga y operaciones ultra-long-range, pero el espacio de mercado “intermedio” se estrecha conforme los narrowbodies ganan alcance y prestaciones.

Para fabricantes, reguladores y operadores, este desplazamiento de la frontera tecnológica obliga a revisar hipótesis sobre amortización de flota, inversión en infraestructura aeroportuaria y diseño de programas de fidelización centrados en la experiencia de cabina más que en la “escala” del avión.

La experiencia de Iberia como primer operador global del A321XLR ofrece un laboratorio a cielo abierto para evaluar cómo evolucionan factores como satisfacción del pasajero, fiabilidad técnica, costes de mantenimiento y resiliencia ante disrupciones en una flota de largo radio crecientemente híbrida.

¿Hasta dónde llegará el largo radio de pasillo único?

La incorporación del séptimo Airbus A321XLR a la flota de Iberia no es un simple hito numérico, sino la consolidación de un modelo operativo que combina eficiencia, flexibilidad y ambición de red en un momento de fuerte presión regulatoria y climática sobre la aviación. Para la comunidad aeronáutica, el caso Iberia obliga a repensar la separación clásica entre narrowbody y widebody, y a revisar los criterios con los que se evalúan inversiones en flota, diseño de rutas, políticas de sostenibilidad y marcos regulatorios asociados al largo radio.

La cuestión que queda abierta para aerolíneas, fabricantes, reguladores y proveedores de servicios es nítida: si el A321XLR se puede consolidar como estándar para rutas transatlánticas de densidad media, ¿qué papel deberán jugar los widebody en la próxima década, y cómo deberán adaptarse los modelos de negocio —especialmente en hubs como Madrid— para capturar el valor de este cambio sin comprometer seguridad, resiliencia y competitividad en un entorno cada vez más exigente ?",https://aviaciondigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/A321XLR-Iberia.webp,N,,2026-01-02 02:56:36.890887

China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Limited (CALC) has finalized a firm order for 30 additional Airbus A320neo Family aircraft, underscoring its confidence in the ongoing recovery of the global aviation sector. The agreement, concluded on December 30, 2025, is valued in the billions and reinforces CALC’s position as a leading global aircraft lessor. This move also highlights the increasing demand within the industry for fuel-efficient, narrow-body jets that meet evolving operational and environmental requirements.

This latest acquisition represents CALC’s fifth direct purchase from Airbus since their partnership began in 2012. With these new aircraft, CALC’s total Airbus order book rises to 282, including 203 from the A320neo Family. The decision aligns with airlines’ growing preference for modern, eco-conscious fleets designed to comply with tightening environmental regulations worldwide.

Strategic Considerations and Market Context

Mike Poon, Executive Director and CEO of CALC, emphasized the strategic importance of the order, stating, “Our enduring partnership with Airbus has been central to CALC’s growth. This order reflects our commitment to providing airline customers with high-value, modern aircraft solutions that align with a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

The Airbus A320neo is widely regarded as the benchmark for narrow-body jets due to its superior fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and operational versatility. The aircraft delivers at least 20% fuel savings and significant reductions in CO2 emissions compared to previous generations. Its cabin, the widest among single-aisle aircraft, offers enhanced comfort for short- and medium-haul travelers. Furthermore, CALC’s agreement includes conversion rights, allowing flexibility to switch between the standard A320neo and the larger, longer-range A321neo to meet diverse client requirements.

A notable feature of the A320neo is its compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Currently capable of operating with a 50% SAF blend, Airbus aims to achieve 100% SAF capability by 2030. As environmental regulations become more stringent across Europe and Asia, CALC’s investment in the A320neo family represents a proactive effort to future-proof its portfolio against carbon taxes and rising passenger expectations for greener travel.

Challenges and Competitive Environment

Despite the positive outlook, CALC’s expansion faces potential challenges. Global supply chain disruptions and manufacturing constraints could delay aircraft deliveries. Additionally, competition remains intense, particularly from Boeing. While Boeing’s 737 MAX continues to encounter regulatory scrutiny, giving Airbus a competitive advantage in the Chinese market, the broader competitive landscape remains dynamic and uncertain.

This order coincides with similar fleet expansion initiatives by CALC’s rivals. Chinese carriers such as Spring Airlines and Juneyao Air have recently placed their own orders for A320neo aircraft, potentially accelerating their growth plans. This intensifying competition may influence market dynamics and prompt further strategic responses across the sector.

Implications for the Market

CALC’s latest order is expected to bolster investor confidence in its growth strategy and strengthen Airbus’s foothold in China, especially as Boeing seeks to regain market share. As the aviation industry moves into 2026, CALC’s commitment to sustainable and efficient aircraft underscores a broader industry shift toward eco-conscious, future-ready fleets, setting a precedent for the next phase of global aviation.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/a6d0501dc5a8454c9cd655dc6d9ee613.avif,N,,2026-01-02 00:56:51.401067

Vietnam is updating its Special Consumption Tax Law, which indirectly includes environmental objectives, though a dedicated carbon tax has not been formally set yet.","Southeast Asia is set to implement a series of green taxes and environmental levies starting from 2026, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and promote a more sustainable future. These environmental tax policies are designed to tackle the region’s carbon footprint while encouraging greener business practices, transportation, and energy production. The most prominent changes will occur in Singapore and Malaysia, with other Southeast Asian countries actively working on similar initiatives. Here’s a detailed look at the green taxes being introduced in Southeast Asia from 2026 onwards.

1) Singapore — Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy

In a groundbreaking move, Singapore will become the first country to implement a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy, also known as the green flight tax, aimed at promoting sustainable aviation. Starting April 2026, airlines departing from Singapore will be required to pay a levy that supports the use of sustainable aviation fuel, a key component in reducing carbon emissions from air travel.

Who pays: All passengers flying from Singapore will contribute to this levy, which will be added to the cost of their tickets.

Rates: The SAF Levy will vary depending on the flight’s destination and cabin class. For short-haul flights within Southeast Asia, the levy will be approximately S$1 for economy class passengers and S$4 for premium class. For long-haul flights, the levy can rise up to S$41.60. This charge is expected to grow over time as more sustainable fuel is blended into the aviation industry.

Key point: This green flight tax is a significant step in Singapore’s effort to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. It aligns with the country’s broader climate goals to decarbonize industries and foster sustainability in aviation.

2) Singapore — Increased Carbon Tax

Alongside the SAF Levy, Singapore is also raising its carbon tax to further incentivize emissions reductions in the industrial sector. Currently, Singapore applies a carbon tax of S$25 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e), but this will increase to S$45 per tonne starting in 2026. This adjustment is part of the country’s phased approach to ensure it meets its climate action targets and contributes to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Who pays: This tax primarily affects industrial facilities and businesses that emit more than a specified threshold of greenhouse gases, including energy producers and manufacturing companies.

Purpose: The goal is to reduce industrial carbon emissions and encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and renewable energy sources.

Key point: The carbon tax increase is one of Singapore’s most direct methods of combating climate change and making carbon-intensive industries more sustainable in the long run. It is expected to boost innovation in the green energy sector and force businesses to consider greener alternatives.

3) Malaysia — National Carbon Tax

Malaysia has announced its own carbon pricing system, which is set to be introduced in 2026. As part of its 2026 Budget, the Malaysian government plans to implement a national carbon tax, targeting high-emission sectors such as energy, cement production, and steel manufacturing. This tax is designed to help Malaysia transition towards a low-carbon economy and support the country’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.

Who pays: The tax will apply to high-emitting industries that exceed a set carbon threshold. These include energy producers, manufacturers, and other large-scale industrial operations.

Purpose: The carbon tax will help price carbon emissions and encourage businesses to adopt cleaner, more energy-efficient technologies, supporting Malaysia’s goal to reduce its overall carbon footprint.

Key point: This move marks Malaysia’s first major carbon pricing initiative, reflecting a regional shift towards sustainable practices and the recognition of carbon pricing as a tool for climate change mitigation. It will gradually push industries toward embracing renewable energy and low-carbon technologies.

Other Southeast Asian Countries’ Green Tax Initiatives

While Singapore and Malaysia are leading the charge, other Southeast Asian countries are in the process of exploring or implementing similar green tax policies. For example:

Thailand has a Climate Change Bill that includes provisions for carbon pricing, though the tax rates and implementation timeline remain unclear as of 2026.

Vietnam is updating its Special Consumption Tax Law, which indirectly includes environmental objectives, though a dedicated carbon tax has not been formally set yet.

Indonesia and other nations in the region are still developing frameworks for carbon pricing and green taxes, with many initiatives expected to roll out in the coming years.

Conclusion: Southeast Asia’s Push for Sustainability

Starting in 2026, Southeast Asia will see a surge in green taxes and carbon pricing mechanisms as part of a larger push toward sustainability. These environmental taxes, which include the SAF Levy in Singapore, carbon tax increases in both Singapore and Malaysia, and other similar initiatives, aim to reduce carbon emissions, promote cleaner industries, and make the region more resilient to climate change.

For travelers, businesses, and industries, these green taxes will lead to increased costs but also offer opportunities for innovation and greener practices. With Singapore and Malaysia taking the lead, Southeast Asia is poised to become a key player in the global green economy, providing a model for other countries in the region to follow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-design-800x600-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 00:56:58.975157

As the aviation industry enters 2026, this multi-billion dollar commitment reinforces CALC’s position as a premier global lessor and underscores the relentless demand for fuel-efficient, narrow-body jets.

The start of 2026 has brought a clear message from the world of aircraft leasing: the future is narrow-body and eco-conscious. The recent deal between Hong Kong-listed CALC and Airbus is more than just a purchase; it is a strategic maneuver to satisfy an “insatiable” demand from airlines worldwide for the A320neo—the “workhorse” of modern skies.

This latest agreement marks CALC’s fifth direct order with Airbus since their partnership took flight in 2012. With these 30 new units, CALC’s total order book with the European planemaker rises to 282 aircraft, of which an impressive 203 belong to the A320neo Family.

The “Why” Behind the Buy

According to Mike Poon, Executive Director and CEO of CALC, the decision was driven by a shared vision for innovation. “Our enduring partnership with Airbus has been central to CALC’s growth,” Poon noted. “This order reflects our commitment to providing our airline customers with high-value, modern aircraft solutions that align with a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

For lessors like CALC, the A320neo is the “gold standard” for several human and economic reasons:

Efficiency for Airlines: The A320neo (New Engine Option) delivers at least 20% fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared to previous generations.

Comfort for Passengers: Featuring the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky, these jets provide a sense of space that is often lacking in short-to-medium haul travel.

Versatility: The order includes conversion rights, allowing CALC to switch between the standard A320neo and the larger, longer-range A321neo depending on what their airline clients—ranging from Air China to Uzbekistan Airways—need most.

Sustainability: The 2026 Flight Path

A key highlight of the announcement is the aircraft’s compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Currently, the A320neo can operate with a 50% SAF blend, and Airbus is aggressively targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030.

As environmental regulations tighten across Europe and Asia in 2026, having a “future-ready” fleet is no longer a luxury for leasing companies—it is a survival requirement. By investing in the “neo” family, CALC is essentially future-proofing its portfolio against carbon taxes and changing passenger expectations regarding “green” travel.

Market Impact: A Boost for Airbus in China

This deal is part of a larger trend of Airbus dominating the Chinese market as we move into 2026. While competitor Boeing continues to navigate its own recovery path, Airbus has secured several major year-end deals, including disclosed plans from Spring Airlines and Juneyao Airlines to acquire a combined 55 aircraft.

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales, emphasized that CALC’s “deep understanding of the market” serves as a solid endorsement of the A320neo’s reliability. For travelers, this means that in the coming decade, you are increasingly likely to find yourself on a modern, quieter, and more efficient Airbus jet regardless of which airline you book.

This combination of factors makes 2026 poised to be a banner year for global tourism, creating more opportunities for travelers and businesses alike.","As 2026 approaches, the global tourism industry is set to thrive, with air travel playing a critical role in this upward trajectory. Airlines, under the latest forecasts by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expecting to carry a record 5.2 billion passengers, underscoring a remarkable demand for international and domestic travel. This surge in air traffic is seen as a key driver for global tourism, enhancing connectivity, creating new economic opportunities, and facilitating a positive impact on tourism revenues worldwide.

Governments and tourism authorities are already capitalizing on these optimistic projections. Officials from tourism boards across the world recognize the close relationship between air travel demand and tourism growth, noting that the increase in flights opens doors for greater access to attractions, cultural experiences, and regional economic growth. Whether it’s the bustling cities of Europe, the beaches of Southeast Asia, or the wilderness of Africa, this projected rise in air travel will be the backbone for expanding tourism flows in key regions.

Airline Profits and Tourism Infrastructure

Airlines are also expected to report strong financial performances, with IATA projecting a global airline profit of $41 billion in 2026. This steady profitability is expected to be felt in the tourism sector, with airlines able to reinvest in expanding their networks, enhancing customer service, and improving overall travel experiences. From new routes to more frequent flights, these investments support the growth of tourism hubs, providing easier access to popular destinations as well as previously less-explored locales.

In many countries, this stability in the aviation sector is seen as a positive catalyst for job creation, infrastructure development, and community growth. Airports and local tourism boards have already begun working on expanding their facilities and services to accommodate the increasing number of passengers. This includes upgrades to airports, improved ground transportation networks, and more efficient visa processing systems—efforts that make travel smoother and more enjoyable for both tourists and residents.

Expanding Global Connectivity and Regional Tourism Growth

The forecasted 5.2 billion passengers in 2026 not only signals growth for major tourist destinations but also points to an opportunity for emerging regions to boost their share of global tourism. Asia, Africa, and parts of Latin America are projected to see substantial increases in air traffic. Countries in these regions are tapping into this surge by improving their tourism offerings, with government initiatives to promote cultural exchange, sustainable tourism, and eco-friendly travel options.

For example, Southeast Asia’s rise as a leading global tourist destination is being supported by an expanding airline network that offers more direct flights between major global cities and Southeast Asian hubs. This increased connectivity is expected to drive tourism to countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which are already seeing a steady influx of international visitors.

Sustainability and Future Tourism Development

As airlines increase their operations, the issue of sustainability continues to be a significant consideration. Many governments and tourism bodies have incorporated green tourism practices into their strategies, aligning air travel growth with efforts to reduce carbon emissions. With the rise of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green airport initiatives, tourism can continue to flourish without compromising environmental goals.

Tourism boards are also actively marketing destinations that emphasize environmental conservation, such as national parks and nature reserves, providing travellers with sustainable options. This growing trend among travellers to choose eco-friendly destinations further supports the shift toward green tourism, helping to balance the economic benefits of air travel with the need to protect natural resources.

Regional Prosperity and Job Creation

Tourism, fueled by increased air travel, is also a vital engine for job creation. The IATA’s forecast suggests that airlines’ growth will directly impact jobs within the tourism sector, from hotel employees and tour guides to local artisans and hospitality staff. This is especially true for developing countries, where tourism serves as a key driver of local economies. As more tourists arrive, more job opportunities open up, contributing to the broader economic development of these regions.

Increased air traffic benefits not only tourism-heavy destinations but also smaller towns and rural areas looking to attract visitors. By enhancing regional connectivity, airlines are opening up new possibilities for tourism-focused businesses outside traditional tourist hotspots, enabling lesser-known areas to tap into the benefits of the global travel boom.

A Bright Future for Travel and Tourism in 2026

As 2026 approaches, the global tourism industry stands on the cusp of a prosperous year. With airlines forecasting record passenger numbers and stable profitability, destinations around the world are set to benefit from this surge in travel. Governments, tourism bodies, and the private sector are ready to capitalize on the increased air travel, making strategic investments in tourism infrastructure, sustainability initiatives, and marketing efforts.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it’s the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a US renewable fuel standard in part to decrease dependence on foreign oil. In 2021, president Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of three billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for US corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

Biofuels also can be made from animal fats, algae, waste cooking oils or agricultural waste such as wood chips and straw. While the US Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope is a fait accompli.

In the last year, US production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House, the Trump administration just unfroze a US$1.67 billion Biden-era loan for biofuel processing plants.

The downside of making jet biofuel from corn or soybean production is that it will likely fuel significant land transformation, according to several expert analyses, including one by Braden Limb, a research scientist at Colorado State University. According to his study, about 50 per cent more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet the 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we have converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb. And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment-and people such as Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a US$400 million paid US pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybees populations already face a number of stressors-disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: only a year ago US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, according to an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to to corn.

“What I fear is that we are not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

But as demand for air travel soars, so does aviation’s climate impact. According to the International Air Travel Association, air traffic rose more than 10 per cent between 2023 and 2024, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation contributes roughly 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions but is responsible for at least 3.5 per cent of human-caused climate change.

Airlines have been exploring the few options available to lower emissions, including SAF. The industry has committed to biofuel use and the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would require significant biofuel inputs. Researchers such as Limb point to crops other than corn or soybeans, like sorghum and miscanthus, that can be used for biofuel but aren’t as damaging to ecosystems.

“All of our optimisation work,” Limb said, “says corn and soybeans are not the answer.”

There are forces at work that may yet forestall the mass repurposing of grasslands for biofuel. In 2022, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, created by Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, crafted more incentives for domestic production and sale of low-carbon transportation fuels. But the Republican tax and spending bill passed this summer, while extending the credit, decreased the US$1.75 per gallon credit for SAF to US$1. Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clear-cutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers.”

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialised equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF-including virgin vegetable oils-are typically more expensive than other biofuels. “Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies continue to express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in petrol blends used in land transportation, organisations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

Another driver of aviation biofuel is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), an initiative that aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions from international flights. Corsia is a three-phase international agreement-the first two phases were voluntary, but beginning in 2027, Corsia becomes mandatory for most of international aviation, with some exceptions. Under the agreement, airlines must measure, report, verify and offset emissions that exceed the 2019 baseline.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places such as North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.

Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels”, said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the US biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that the US exported almost two billion gallons of corn ethanol last year. “If US exports decline,” he said, “then we will need to find ways to increase domestic consumption-increasing land use change pressure”.

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources-used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes-could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear, widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market, you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

Back in North Dakota, Klett said beekeeping families such as hers and the Millers remain worried about what comes after that uncertainty lifts. “Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right”.

With billions of dollars in new processing infrastructure already in place, industry leaders say the future of domestic energy may be growing in America’s fields.

The shift is being driven by a massive increase in production capacity, Paul Winters, Director of Public Affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, tells Mid-West Farm Report. While renewable diesel sat at just half a billion gallons in 2020, that capacity has surged to 6 billion gallons today.

“This year, sustainable aviation fuel technology came to fruition,” Winters notes. “There are a couple of plants in the United States that have ramped up significantly from essentially zero up to a few hundred million gallons.”

Despite the technological success, the industry remains in a holding pattern regarding federal regulation. While the inclusion of SAF in the 45Z clean tax credit was a major legislative victory, producers are still waiting for the U.S. Treasury and EPA to finalize the rules. Winters views this “policy stability” as the final bridge to making SAF economically competitive with traditional petroleum.

Beyond the environmental benefits, the growth of SAF represents a vital stabilizing force for farmers facing international market volatility. By keeping more soybeans at home for processing, the industry adds value to every bushel harvested.

“Biodiesel and renewable diesel represent 10 percent of the value of every single bushel of soybeans grown in the United States,” Winters says. “There’s room for growth there.”

Highlights include:

Airlines are expected to achieve a combined total net profit of $41 billion in 2026 (up from $39.5 billion in 2025). While this would set a new record, the net profit margin is expected to be unchanged from 2025 at 3.9%. Net profit per passenger transported is expected to be $7.90 (below the 2023 high of $8.50, and unchanged from 2025).

Operating profit in 2026 is expected to be $72.8 billion (up from $67.0 billion in 2025) for a net operating margin of 6.9% (improved on the 6.6% expected for 2025).

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to be 6.8% (unchanged from 2025). Despite deleveraging and improved operating profitability, ROIC is expected to remain below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated to be 8.2% in 2026.

Total industry revenues are expected to reach $1.053 trillion in 2026 (up 4.5% on the $1.008 trillion expected revenues in 2025).

Load factors are forecast to continue to set record highs with airlines expected to fill 83.8% of all seats over the year 2026.

Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion in 2026 (up 4.4% on 2025).

Cargo volumes are expected to reach 71.6 million tonnes in 2026 (up 2.4% on 2025).

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9% net margin and a $41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds that the industry faces—rising costs from bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, geopolitical conflict, sluggish global trade, and growing regulatory burdens among them. Airlines have successfully built shock-absorbing resilience into their businesses that is delivering stable profitability,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

While strong performance of airlines in the face of a changing and challenging operating environment is impressive, the fact that the airline industry collectively does not generate earnings that cover its cost of capital remains an issue to be resolved.

“Industry-level margins are still a pittance considering the value that airlines create by connecting people and economies. They stand at the core of a value chain that underpins nearly 4% of the global economy and supports 87 million jobs. Yet Apple will earn more selling an iPhone cover than the $7.90 airlines will make transporting the average passenger. And even within the air transport value chain, airline margins are totally out of balance, particularly when compared to margins of engine and avionics manufacturers and many of our service suppliers. Imagine the additional power that airlines could bring to economies if we could re-balance value chain profitability, reduce regulatory and tax burdens, and alleviate infrastructure inefficiencies,” said Walsh.

Air cargo’s performance is of particular interest as it has defied many predictions of gloom to hold its own amid rapidly changing trading conditions. “The resilience in air cargo has been particularly impressive. As trade flows adapt to a protectionist US tariff regime, air cargo has been the hero of global trade buoyed in part by robust e-commerce and semiconductor shipments to support the boom in AI investments. Notably, air cargo enabled front-loading to deliver products ahead of tariff deadlines, and it flexibly accommodated demand surges as tariffed goods normally destined for the US found new markets. The critical role of air cargo is front and center as the global economy adjusts to new realities,” said Walsh.

Outlook Drivers

Overall revenues are expected to grow by 4.5% to $1.053 trillion. This is expected to outpace operating expense growth of 4.2% to $981 billion, leading to a $1.5 billion improvement in industry-wide net profitability in 2026.

Macro-economic factors impacting airlines are mixed for 2026. On the positive side, GDP growth is expected to be largely stable at 3.1% and inflation is expected to ease slightly to 3.7%. World trade growth is, however, expected to be anemic at 0.5%.

Revenue

Passenger ticket revenues are expected to reach $751 billion in 2026 (+4.8% on $716 billion in 2025). This growth will be primarily driven by a 4.9% expansion of industry-wide revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) expected in 2026. Yields are expected to remain relatively flat while the passenger load factor is expected to set a new record at 83.8% as new aircraft remain in short supply.

Ancillary and other revenues are projected to rise by 5.5%, reaching $145 billion. Ancillary services now account for nearly 14% of total revenue, up from 12-13% pre-pandemic.

Cargo revenue is forecast to reach $158 billion in 2026 (+2.1% on $155 billion in 2025). This moderate expansion is driven by continued growth in cargo, particularly in time-sensitive shipments and e-commerce volumes (+2.6% growth in cargo tonne kilometers or CTK in 2026, slowing from +3.1% growth in 2025). Coupling these factors with tightening capacity, cargo yields are expected to remain stable (-0.5% on 2025) and elevated (approximately 30% above pre-pandemic levels), despite a broader slowdown in global trade.

Costs

Overall, the 2026 cost outlook points to a more balanced environment. Fuel relief is offset by rising non-fuel pressures, but the broader slowdown in inflation is helping to stabilize the cost base.

Fuel costs are expected to decline slightly to $252 billion in 2026 (-0.3% from $253 billion in 2025). The consensus forecast is for crude oil prices to decline to $62/barrel Brent (-11.0% on $70/barrel in 2025). Jet fuel prices are only expected to decline by 2.4% from $90/barrel in 2025 to $88/barrel in 2026 as the crack spread widens. The expiration of higher-cost hedges from 2025 should allow airlines to realize lower average prices that are closer to market levels. Fuel is set to account for 25.7% of total operating expenses, down from 26.8% in 2025.

Fuel efficiency gains are expected to be just 1.0% as supply chain issues continue to hamper fleet renewal and push the average aircraft age to over 15 years, the highest ever. Factoring in industry growth, fuel consumption is expected to increase to 106 billion gallons in 2026 (+2.7% on 103 billion gallons in 2025).

The cost of compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is expected to grow to $1.7 billion for 2026 (up from $1.3 billion for 2025).

The incremental cost of airline purchases of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach $4.5 billion in 2026, with the expectation of 2.4 million tonnes of SAF being available (0.8% of total fuel consumption).

Non-fuel costs are forecast to be $729 billion (+5.8% on $689 billion in 2025). Labor costs are now the largest cost component (28%) as wage growth continues to outpace inflation amid very tight labor market conditions. Despite strong hiring, the airline industry has struggled to restore employment productivity to 2019 levels, as rapid workforce growth has outpaced gains in output per employee amid ongoing operational and training challenges.

Maintenance costs are climbing due to the aging fleet and supply chain disruptions that affect the availability of parts. Lease rates have reached record highs, pushing up ownership costs. Airport and en-route charges continue to rise as well.

A weaker US dollar is expected to benefit non-USD-based airlines’ profitability and margins by reducing US dollar-denominated costs such as fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance. IATA estimates that 55–60% of global airline costs are denominated in USD, compared to 50–55% on the revenue side. Based on this, a 1% weakening of the USD against global currencies may lift global airline profits by 1% and improve operating margins by around 0.05 ppt.

Risks, Constraints, and Opportunities

Supply chain challenges continue to constrain airlines’ ability to meet consumer demand for air transport. While some improvements are expected in 2026, the backlog in aircraft orders is expected to continue to grow. High load factors and yield stability are partially attributable to supply chain issues. However, the growth-constraining impact of supply chain challenges remains a drag on airline profitability. Even as aircraft deliveries are projected to increase significantly in 2026, the pace of new orders is outstripping production, causing the backlog to reach new highs and signaling that supply constraints, and their financial impact, will persist well beyond the near term.

The regulatory cost burden on airlines is significant. While significant deregulation is being pursued in the US, European regulators have yet to act on the recommendations of the Draghi report to make significant improvements in competitiveness by easing regulatory burdens. A case in point is the attempt to reform the European regulation on passenger rights (EU261), which has been watered down in ambition and convoluted with proposals to essentially make cabin baggage a passenger right irrespective of an airline’s business model or customer need.

Infrastructure constraints are not expected to ease significantly in 2026. However, US plans to renew its air traffic management system in the coming years would be a major improvement. While regulators have reaffirmed International Civil Aviation Organization principles for infrastructure charges, most have failed to use the principles to realize cost efficiencies. A case in point is London’s Heathrow Airport where the potential cost of expansion plans could render the airport uncompetitive without significant reforms.

Conflict continues to hamper airlines with significant costs. Airspace closures, GNSS interference, and re-routing for both political and safety reasons are constraining operations and reducing efficiencies.

Regional Roundup

Africa

Low GDP per capita across much of the continent limits discretionary spending, making air travel highly price sensitive and restricting its growth potential. Demand is further constrained by visa restrictions, restrictive bilateral agreements, and high passenger charges.

Moreover, African carriers face the highest unit costs globally, with average cost per ATK near 140 US cents, almost double the industry average. Among the many factors contributing to the high cost of operations in Africa are high fuel costs, fragmented markets, older fleets, and average corporate tax rates of 28% (the highest among all regions).

Until these constraints ease, Africa’s airline industry will operate with thin margins and limited resilience, even as traffic expands faster than the global average.

Asia Pacific

Passenger demand remains robust, with China and India leading regional expansion, driven by rising tourism activity and the growing middle classes. Easing visa requirements for Chinese group tours to South Korea and for visitors to China are expected to stimulate short-term inbound demand, particularly during peak holiday periods.

Overcapacity remains a challenge amid a slower recovery in international traffic putting pressure on yields. Deflationary pressures are also driving yields lower in China. Nevertheless, Asia Pacific remains the largest contributor to global traffic growth, with load factors projected to reach 84.4% in 2026, an all-time high for the region.

While Chinese exports to the US have declined, substitution effects have helped offset the impact of trade tensions, as Chinese goods have found alternative markets.

Europe

Europe is projected to deliver the strongest financial performance in absolute terms among all regions. European airlines show disciplined capacity management and strong load factors. Low-cost carriers are performing particularly well, expanding at double-digit rates and outperforming full-service carriers on net profit margin, fueled by strong intra-European traffic and leisure market. Traffic growth is moderating as the market matures and amid tepid economic conditions in the Euro zone where GDP growth lags the global average.

On the cost side, the strength of the Euro has provided a partial offset to inflationary pressures, particularly in fuel and leasing expenses, helping carriers maintain margins despite volatility in input costs.

The regulatory cost burden is increasing with the ReFuelEU initiative requiring a 2% SAF blend at EU airports from 2025. This coincides with mounting operational headwinds: labor unrest, drone disruptions, and persistent air traffic control bottlenecks.

Latin America

Traffic growth remains robust driven by economic stability and enhanced intra-regional connectivity. Demand between the Americas has softened, though this has been offset by increased regional flows and a solid transatlantic performance, highlighting the adaptability of carriers in the face of shifting travel patterns.

Operating profitability is anticipated to rebound again in 2026, benefiting from the gradual strengthening of the region’s fundamentals. However, currency fluctuations remain a critical headwind. Although 2025 saw temporary relief with local currencies appreciating, volatility is expected to continue to challenge cost management and profitability.

With several major carriers in the region realizing the benefits of Chapter 11 restructuring, the region’s environment has shifted from crisis-driven survival to cautious, efficiency-focused rebuilding.

Middle East

The Middle East is the strongest region in terms of net profit margin and profit per passenger. This performance attests to the difference a positive regulatory operating environment can make, and to the region’s strategic position as a global connecting hub.

Passenger demand continues to be robust, driven by long-haul traffic and the expansion of hub carriers. Governments and airlines are doubling down on infrastructure investments to secure long-term growth. While geopolitical tensions remain a feature of the regional landscape, they are not expected to negatively impact growth, particularly as efforts to secure lasting peace continue.

Middle Eastern carriers are mitigating aircraft delivery delays through retrofit programs and fleet life extensions, though capacity growth will remain constrained in the near term.

North America

North American profitability remains stable, but the region ceded its most profitable ranking to Europe in 2025.

The United States suffered stagnating overall growth and a domestic market contraction in the face of policy uncertainty around tariffs, tighter immigration enforcement dampening both inbound and domestic travel, and a lengthy government shutdown. Capacity constraints, pilot shortages, engine reliability issues, and rising labor costs continue to restrict expansion.

Despite these hurdles, airlines managed to protect margins in 2025, supported by stable yields and lower fuel prices. Performance, however, varies by business model. Low-cost carriers are under pressure, heavily exposed to the shrinking US domestic segment, growing passenger preferences for premium services, and facing the disadvantages of single-type fleets amid supply chain disruptions.

Looking ahead, 2026 is expected to see some easing of these challenges and the opportunity for a gradual increase in demand.

Travelers’ Viewpoint

Air travel continues to deliver exceptional value to consumers. Average real return air fares in 2025 US dollars were 34.7% cheaper compared to 2015. And passengers are expected to benefit from efficiency gains and competitive forces that will likely see 2026 average return air fares at 36.8% below 2015 level.

An IATA public opinion poll conducted in October-November 2025 (14 countries, 6,500 respondents who have taken at least one trip in the last year) revealed that 97% of travelers expressed satisfaction with their last travel experience. Moreover, 88% agreed that air travel makes their lives better, 78% agreed that air travel is good value for money, and 87% said they cared about their ability to fly in future.

Passengers are counting on a safe, sustainable, efficient, and profitable airline industry. The IATA public opinion polling demonstrated the important role that travelers see the airline industry playing:

90% agreed that air connectivity is critical to the economy

88% said that air travel has a positive impact on societies, and

82% said that the global air transport network is a key contributor to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

83% care about the success of the aviation industry

The air transport industry is committed to its goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Travelers are expressing high levels of confidence in this endeavor with 79% agreeing that the industry is demonstrating commitment to work together to achieve its ambitious goal, 77% agreeing that aviation leaders are taking the climate challenge seriously.",https://www.4hoteliers.com/ogm/4Hoteliers_Logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 20:57:44.978024

If ministers cut the rot he predicts a brighter future where green tech delivers energy independence, economic growth and lower family bills.","ENERGY bills could finally tumble if Britain cuts “bonkers” red tape costing customer a fortune, the boss of Octopus has claimed.

Greg Jackson — founder of the energy technology company — says families are being “played” by a system riddled with waste.

That includes £100million spent on a bat tunnel for the HS2 rail route and £700million on “fish disco” protection measures at Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset.

In a rallying cry for common sense in 2026, the tycoon insists the path to lower inflation and cheaper power rests in stripping away over-regulation and bureaucracy.

He warned: “We desperately need energy bills to fall.

“This will only happen if the Government gets tough on big companies gaming the system.

“It means ending bonkers stuff like paying wind farms over £1billion to turn off on windy days.”

But, despite that waste, he insists the world is moving away from oil and gas towards green energy technology.

The Octopus Energy chief explained: “Firstly, they’re becoming more affordable. Just three years ago, gas prices sent bills sky high and trashed our economy.

“As long as we’re hooked on them, we’re at the mercy of dictators and foreign governments.

“More from the North Sea may help — but it’s a drop in the ocean and won’t save us from these forces.

“Secondly, electric technologies just keep getting better. The cost of solar, batteries and electric cars is plummeting. When you buy gas from Qatar it’s gone the moment you burn it. Solar panels generate power for decades.”

Mr Jackson also called for a return to old-fashioned customer service in this age of AI.

He urged firms to start answering the phone instead of hiding behind “crappy systems and computers that say no”.

That — and slashing costs added to bills to fund infrastructure “we don’t need” — is the only way to get the economy moving again.

If ministers cut the rot he predicts a brighter future where green tech delivers energy independence, economic growth and lower family bills.

A future of fakeaways

SHOPPERS are mixing budget basics with posh treats to beat the cost-of-living crunch.

Sainsbury’s CEO Simon Roberts reckons 2026 will be the year of the “fakeaway” — as families ditch pricy restaurants for premium meals at home.

He said: “Dining out has become more expensive so our premium ranges are really popular. More customers will choose restaurant quality food at home.”

He said the big weekly shop is back in fashion as people flock back to work.

And he vowed to back British farmers and use hi-tech loyalty apps to give ­customers the “tailored experiences” they will crave this year.

Bank on Cups

They don’t sell celluloid — they sell star power. If you have an established icon like Clara Bow, you sell It: allure, magnetism, and the special sparkle that turns a performer into a phenomenon. If you have a rising force like Ann Sheridan, you sell Oomph: that impossible-to-bottle mystique and sex appeal that storms the box office before the critics even learn her name.

It and Oomph. That’s the formula.

For renewable fuels, that moment arrives in 2026. The gallons of green liquid? Not the star anymore. The real value lies in the attributes — the verified, tradeable, financeable proof of carbon benefit.

Like:

• Energy Attribute Certificates (RECs, Guarantees of Origin)

• Zero-Emission Credits (rewarding firm, carbon-free generation)

• Low-Carbon Fuel Synthesis Attributes (SAFc and friends)

And when you look at eSAF, the ultimate Oomph emerges: small modular nuclear reactors paired with hydrogen and fuel synthesis — precision-engineered to electrify Wall Street. And this isn’t theory — the deals are already in the news.

The It Girl: Aemetis Biogas

If “It” is that intangible quality that takes something merely promising and makes it irresistible, Aemetis has it in spades.

Their subsidiary Aemetis Biogas LLC has just received funds from the sale of $17 million of federal clean energy tax credits — including Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits and Section 48 Investment Tax Credits. This wasn’t a paper shuffle — it delivered $15 million in net cash into the business, after transaction costs. Breakdown:

~$12M from Section 48 ITC tied to constructing a dairy digester that’s already producing biogas

~$5M from Section 45Z PTC tied to renewable natural gas production during 2025

And that’s just the first act. Aemetis expects:

Significantly higher 45Z credit values as volumes scale and guidance strengthens

An additional $10.5 million Section 45C credit in 2026 (already IRS + DOE approved)

That is It Factor economics: proven molecules + proven metadata = proven money. This isn’t Hollywood hype. It’s recurring cash flow with receipts.

The Oomph Girl: XCF Global

If oomph is the quality that makes investors reach for their checkbook before the set is even built — XCF Global has it. They’ve announced a sweeping non-binding MOU with IP3, Southern Energy Renewables, and DevvStream to explore an integrated model for:

SMR nuclear power

Electro-sustainable aviation fuel

Tokenized, verifiable environmental attributes

This is how high-value compliance markets get fed — continuously, reliably, and at industrial scale. The collaboration envisions:

SMR-generated electricity powering both electrolysis + fuel synthesis

Excess zero-carbon power supporting booming AI/data-center customers

Digital MRV + provenance tracking ensuring every claim checks out

“Book-and-claim” SAF structures enabling climate benefits to fly globally even before fuel does

This isn’t yesterday’s offset story. This is data-driven decarbonization that Wall Street can underwrite. And they’re doing it with a narrative investors already adore: nuclear = energy security + industry revival + jobs + big-ticket growth. Nothing has more Oomph right now.

They Said It

“This tax credit sale represents an important step in monetizing federal clean fuel transferable tax incentives and establishing a new recurring source of cash flow,” said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “This is our first sale of a Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit from dairy RNG, and we expect additional Section 45Z transactions in 2026 and future years from ongoing renewable natural gas production, along with additional Section 48 transactions from ongoing digester construction. With the completion of $95 million of ITC transactions and today’s first Section 45Z sale, we are executing our tax credit monetization strategy. We expect federal 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits to be a rapidly growing source of operating cash flow to support the expansion of production and new job creation.”

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented: “This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels. Firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration allows us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream, commented:“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels. We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy, added: “This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first. As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

Oomph Wins the Audition. Persistence Wins the Franchise.

Look — right now, the financial markets care less about feasible and more about financeable. Investors want:

bankable revenue streams

compliance premiums

physical + digital verification

infrastructure that already exists or can be reused

Which is why Aemetis’ bolt-on model might be the most powerful story of all: Oomph gets you noticed. Persistence gets you greenlit.

Nuclear may be the red-hot starlet of the energy world — stealing headlines and dazzling regulators — but the projects that endure are the ones already delivering today.

Fiji Airways has issued a travel alert for two of its routes in the region, warning customers of the possibility of disruption owing to fuel shortages at the airports of destinations in these islands. The air operator, however, has confirmed the operation of flights on the routes Funafuti and Nadi-Vava’u, but there will be constraints owing to fuel shortages at the airports involved.

The flights to Funafuti will operate under restrictions until January 15, 2026, according to the airline, as the plane will have to take more contingency fuel from Fiji. The impact of the additional weight of the fuel will result in the plane carrying reduced capacity, and the flights will not operate at their normal capacity. This will result in the possibility of carrying out passenger and cargo offloads to enhance the weight and balance of the plane. The same will be the scenario for the flights operating on the Nadi-Vava’u route, as there will be a scarcity of fuel until January 9, 2026.

Impact on Passengers and Luggage

Fiji Airways has advised that due to weight limitations, both passengers and their checked baggage may be offloaded from flights where necessary. Affected passengers and luggage will be accommodated on the next available service, subject to operational availability.

To manage the situation, passengers are being urged to carry essential items and overnight necessities in their hand luggage, ensuring that it falls within standard carry-on rules. This recommendation is designed to minimize inconvenience and ensure passengers have what they need during their travels.

Airline’s Efforts to Address the Fuel Shortage

Fiji Airways has emphasized that the fuel shortage is temporary, with fuel supplies expected to be restored by mid-January for Funafuti and by January 9, 2026 for Nadi–Vava’u. While these disruptions are inconvenient, the airline is working to ensure that passengers can continue their journeys with minimal delays.

Future Travel Impacts: Long-Term Effects on Regional Operations

While the current disruptions will be short-term, Fiji Airways’s ongoing adjustments to its fuel strategy and capacity planning are likely to have longer-term impacts on the airline’s regional operations. The airline’s reliance on contingency fuel from Fiji and the limited weight capacity of aircraft can affect flight schedules, especially on high-demand routes like Funafuti and Nadi–Vava’u. As the airline prepares for an increase in international travel demand, particularly for leisure tourism in the Pacific region, these fuel-related disruptions may prompt future improvements to regional flight scheduling and fuel distribution strategies to ensure consistent service delivery.

Fiji Airways’ efforts to return to normal flight operations after fuel supplies are restored will likely provide valuable insights into regional aviation dynamics and how to better manage fuel-related challenges in the future. As international tourism rebounds across the Pacific, maintaining efficient, sustainable flight operations will be critical for the airline to meet growing demand, especially from international travelers seeking tropical destinations.

Future Focus: Improving Sustainability and Regional Connectivity

Looking toward the future, Fiji Airways is likely to focus on further optimizing fuel management and enhancing regional connectivity. This may include exploring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) options and innovative fuel solutions that could prevent similar issues in the long term. With a growing number of tourists heading to Pacific island nations, it will be essential for Fiji Airways to ensure reliable service while reducing its environmental impact.

Additionally, expanding partnerships with local airports and governments to streamline fuel supply chains and increase airlift capacity in remote destinations like Funafuti and Nadi–Vava’u will be key to minimizing operational challenges in the coming years. This will also support tourism growth by making travel to these regions more accessible and efficient.

Managing Short-Term Disruptions for Long-Term Growth

The recent fuel shortages and associated flight restrictions within the Funafuti and Nadi – Vava’u routes are only temporary; however, they underscore the value of long-term planning in terms of fuel management and Pacific connectivity strategies for Fiji Airways.

Emirates strengthened its standing in 2025 as the world's largest international airline, carrying 55.6 million passengers across almost 180,580 flights and reinforcing Dubai's role as a central hub for long-haul air travel. The carrier said the scale of its operations during the year equated to circling the Earth more than 29,000 times, underlining the breadth of its global network at a time when international aviation demand continued to normalise after years of disruption.

The airline also placed orders for 73 new aircraft, signalling confidence in sustained long-term growth and in the resilience of global travel demand. Fleet expansion remains a central pillar of Emirates' strategy, aimed at maintaining capacity on high-traffic routes while opening or strengthening links to emerging markets across Asia, Africa and the Americas. Industry analysts view the order book as one of the most closely watched indicators of the carrier's outlook, given its dependence on wide-body aircraft and ultra-long-haul connectivity.

The airline's expanding global footprint in 2025 was framed by a milestone anniversary, with Emirates marking four decades since the launch of its operations in October. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the year reflected a“clear vision for shaping the future of travel through sustained excellence”, pointing to operational consistency, service standards and network breadth as defining features of its performance.

Passenger numbers remained below pre-pandemic peaks on certain routes due to aircraft delivery delays affecting the wider aviation sector, yet load factors were described by industry data providers as robust across most regions. Demand on Europe-Asia and Middle East-Americas corridors continued to anchor traffic flows, while routes to South Asia and parts of Africa saw steady growth, driven by both leisure and labour mobility.

Operationally, Emirates' near-180,000 flights highlighted the scale at which the airline manages complex scheduling and logistics. Aviation specialists note that maintaining punctuality and service quality across such volumes requires heavy investment in crew training, digital systems and ground operations. Emirates has increasingly leaned on data-driven planning to optimise turnaround times at Dubai International Airport, one of the world's busiest for international passengers.

The aircraft order announced during the year included a mix of next-generation wide-body jets intended to replace older models and support future expansion. These aircraft are expected to deliver improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions per seat, a key consideration as regulators and investors place greater scrutiny on aviation's environmental footprint. While long-haul flying remains carbon-intensive, Emirates has signalled incremental steps towards sustainability, including operational efficiencies and participation in sustainable aviation fuel initiatives, though large-scale adoption remains constrained by supply and cost.

Competition among global network carriers intensified during 2025, with rivals in Europe, North America and Asia restoring capacity and adding frequencies on overlapping routes. Despite this, Emirates retained its edge in international passenger volumes, largely due to its hub-and-spoke model centred on Dubai, which allows the airline to aggregate demand from multiple regions and deploy high-capacity aircraft efficiently. Analysts say this structure continues to give Emirates flexibility that point-to-point operators struggle to replicate on intercontinental routes.

The airline's performance also had broader implications for Dubai's economy. Aviation remains a cornerstone of the emirate's tourism, trade and services sectors, supporting thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. Passenger throughput through Dubai International Airport feeds into hospitality, retail and logistics, reinforcing the city's positioning as a global crossroads. Government data have consistently linked airline capacity growth with higher visitor numbers and stronger non-oil economic activity.

Conclusion With the Mi-34M1 entering flight tests, Russia is reasserting itself in the light helicopter segment.","At a time when sanctions and supply chain restrictions are reshaping the global aerospace industry, Russia is pushing forward with a clear message: domestic aviation is not slowing down.

Rostec’s “Russian Helicopters” holding has officially begun flight tests of the Mi-34M1, a modern light single-engine multipurpose helicopter designed entirely around Russian-made technologies. The maiden flight marks an important milestone in restoring a segment long dominated by foreign light helicopters.

Mi-34M1 Enters Flight Testing Phase

The Mi-34M1 completed its first test flight lasting around ten minutes, during which engineers evaluated the helicopter’s stability, controllability, and structural loads. The aircraft performed standard horizontal flight maneuvers and turns, allowing specialists to assess how key systems behave under real aerodynamic stress.

According to Rostec, the helicopter demonstrated predictable handling and strong maneuverability—two qualities essential for training, monitoring, and civilian operations. The test campaign confirms that the Mi-34M1 is progressing steadily toward certification.

Powered by the New VK-650V Engine

At the heart of the Mi-34M1 is the VK-650V turboshaft engine, developed by the United Engine Corporation under Rostec. This engine represents a major achievement, as it is the first Russian-designed powerplant for light helicopters in the up-to-four-ton takeoff weight category.

Delivering 650 horsepower at takeoff, the VK-650V is built around a modular architecture that simplifies maintenance and extends service life. It is also equipped with a digital full-authority engine control (FADEC) system, improving fuel efficiency, reliability, and pilot workload management—especially important for training and private aviation.

Key Specifications (Preliminary)

While certification testing is still underway, the Mi-34M1 is expected to feature the following performance characteristics:

Engine: VK-650V turboshaft (650 hp)

Maximum speed: ~240 km/h

Cruise speed: ~210 km/h

Operational range: ~500 km

Payload capacity: ~600 kg (internal and external combined)

Crew: 1–2 pilots

Passenger capacity: Up to 3–4 passengers

Takeoff weight class: Up to 4 tons

These parameters place the Mi-34M1 firmly in the same operational category as popular Western light helicopters, while offering lower dependency on foreign components.

Designed for Versatility and Ease of Operation

Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov emphasized that the Mi-34M1 was developed with simplicity and versatility in mind. The helicopter is highly maneuverable, easy to fly, and economical to maintain—qualities that make it suitable for a wide range of missions.

Primary roles include:

Passenger and private transport

Aerial monitoring and patrol missions

Flight training and pilot instruction

Aviation sports and aerobatic flying

Its straightforward maintenance philosophy also makes it attractive for regional operators, flying clubs, and private owners.

Replacing Foreign Light Helicopters

One of the Mi-34M1’s most strategic roles is filling a market niche previously dominated by foreign light helicopters. Due to rising operating costs, spare parts shortages, and unofficial maintenance practices, many imported helicopters have become expensive and difficult to support.

The Mi-34M1 offers a domestically supported alternative, with local manufacturing, certified maintenance chains, and predictable operating costs—an increasingly important factor for Russian civil aviation.Mi-34M1 proves that modern, competitive aircraft can be developed using entirely domestic technologies, from engines to onboard avionics.

Conclusion

With the Mi-34M1 entering flight tests, Russia is reasserting itself in the light helicopter segment. Combining modern onboard systems, the new VK-650V engine, and a focus on ease of operation, the helicopter is positioned as a practical, homegrown solution for civilian aviation, training, and private use.

As testing continues, the Mi-34M1 could soon become a familiar sight in Russian skies—quietly replacing foreign machines with a domestically built alternative.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-01-114126.png?resize=554%2C305&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-01 18:12:15.922361

Final Assessment for the 2026 Investor As we move into 2026, Delta Air Lines stands as a testament to the power of disciplined financial management and brand positioning.","As the global financial markets ring in 2026, a stark divergence has emerged between the high-flying valuations of the broader indices and the grounded, cash-generating reality of the industrial sector. With the S&P 500 trading at a historically steep forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23x, driven by a multi-year surge in technology and artificial intelligence, investors are increasingly scouring the market for ""quality value""—companies with fortress balance sheets, dominant market positions, and valuations that have yet to catch up to their fundamental earnings power.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has emerged at the forefront of this search. While the broader market appears priced for perfection, Delta enters 2026 trading at a modest 9.5x forward earnings, despite coming off a fiscal 2025 that saw record-breaking revenue and a massive reduction in long-term debt. This valuation gap represents one of the most significant opportunities in the large-cap space, positioning the Atlanta-based carrier as a top pick for value-oriented portfolios in the coming year.

The Crusade Against Debt and the Premium Pivot

The story of Delta’s ascent to a top value pick for 2026 began in earnest during its ""crusade against debt"" throughout 2024 and 2025. Following the turbulence of the early 2020s, Delta’s management team, led by CEO Ed Bastian, executed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that prioritized balance sheet repair over aggressive capacity expansion. By the end of 2025, Delta successfully slashed its adjusted net debt from over $21 billion to approximately $15.3 billion, reclaiming its investment-grade status across all major credit agencies. This deleveraging has not only lowered interest expenses but has also cleared the runway for increased shareholder returns in 2026.

Central to this financial transformation has been Delta’s strategic pivot toward ""premiumization."" Throughout 2025, the airline saw a structural shift in consumer behavior, where high-income travelers increasingly opted for premium cabins, including Delta One and Premium Select. This shift was underscored by the record-breaking performance of Delta’s partnership with American Express (NYSE: AXP), which generated over $7 billion in high-margin remuneration in 2025 alone. By focusing on the high-end consumer, Delta has successfully insulated itself from the price wars that have traditionally plagued the lower-cost segments of the industry.

Winners and Losers in the New Aviation Landscape

In the competitive landscape of early 2026, Delta’s ""premium-first"" strategy has created a widening moat between it and its peers. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL) has remained a formidable competitor, also benefiting from international expansion and premium demand, but it continues to carry a heavier debt load than Delta. Meanwhile, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) has struggled to achieve the same level of margin expansion, as it grapples with higher operational complexities and a slower path to deleveraging.

The real losers in this environment have been the traditional low-cost carriers. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), long the darling of the budget sector, spent much of 2025 undergoing a radical transformation—including the introduction of assigned seating and premium cabin options—in a desperate bid to capture the high-yield travelers that Delta has already secured. As fuel prices and labor costs remained elevated through 2025, the thin margins of the ""no-frills"" model became increasingly unsustainable, forcing a consolidation of the market that has ultimately benefited Delta’s pricing power.

Resilience Amidst Industry Constraints

The wider significance of Delta’s current position lies in its ability to thrive despite persistent industry-wide supply constraints. As of January 1, 2026, the aviation industry continues to be hamstrung by aircraft delivery delays from both Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus (OTC:EADSY). While these delays have limited the industry’s ability to add new seats, they have inadvertently acted as a floor for ticket prices. Delta’s older but well-maintained fleet and its superior operational reliability have allowed it to maintain record load factors—projected at 84% for 2026—while competitors struggle with grounded planes and maintenance backlogs.

Furthermore, a significant tailwind for the airline sector in 2026 is the cooling of global energy prices. Brent crude is forecast to average $58 per barrel this year, down from $66 in 2025. For an airline of Delta’s scale, this reduction in its largest variable cost represents a massive boost to the bottom line. When combined with the ""premiumization"" trend, Delta is entering 2026 with a rare combination of falling costs and rising yields, a scenario that historically precedes significant stock price appreciation.

The Road Ahead: Buybacks and Dividends

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, the market is anticipating a strategic pivot in Delta’s capital allocation. With the debt-to-EBITDAR ratio now sitting comfortably at 2.0x, analysts expect the company to transition from debt repayment to aggressive shareholder returns. Short-term possibilities include a significant hike in the quarterly dividend and the potential announcement of a multi-billion dollar share buyback program, which would be the first major repurchase since the pre-pandemic era.

However, challenges remain. The industry must still navigate a complex regulatory environment and the ongoing pressure to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Delta’s ability to integrate these environmental costs without eroding its 11.5% operating margin will be a key metric for investors to watch. Additionally, while the ""K-shaped"" economy has favored Delta’s premium focus, any broader slowdown in high-end consumer spending could test the resilience of its 2026 earnings guidance.

Final Assessment for the 2026 Investor

As we move into 2026, Delta Air Lines stands as a testament to the power of disciplined financial management and brand positioning. In a market where many stocks are trading at valuations that assume decades of uninterrupted growth, Delta offers a ""margin of safety"" that is increasingly rare. With a consensus analyst price target of $82—representing a nearly 20% upside from current levels—the stock is priced as a cyclical airline but is performing like a high-quality industrial powerhouse.

For investors, the key takeaways are clear: Delta has fixed its balance sheet, captured the most profitable segment of the travel market, and is now poised to benefit from lower fuel costs and restricted supply. While the tech sector may continue to capture headlines, the real value in 2026 is likely to be found in the blue skies of the aviation sector. Investors should keep a close eye on quarterly earnings reports for confirmation of the promised buybacks, which could serve as the final catalyst to close the valuation gap between Delta and the broader market.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive was announced by Prime Minister Carney on September 5, 2025, and today marks the shift from policy intent to delivery.

“Canadian producers have been operating at a competitive disadvantage since the introduction of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act and the Clean Fuel Production Credit, which significantly lowered U.S. production costs and reshaped North American capital flows.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive supports Canadian jobs, Canadian feedstocks, and Canadian fuel supply, helping keep clean fuel investment and production anchored in Canada amid ongoing trade and policy uncertainty. Biofuels are an immediately deployable solution that reduces emissions while supporting rural economies, well-paying jobs, domestic feedstocks like canola, and greater energy security.

“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association represents producers of biodiesel, ethanol, renewable diesel, renewable gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel, which are blended into the transportation fuels Canadians rely on every day.

“While the Biofuels Production Incentive is a positive short-term measure for 2026 and 2027, it does not fully close the gap with U.S. production subsidies. Long-term competitiveness will require complementary, structural measures that provide certainty for investment in Canadian renewable fuel production and feedstock supply chains.

“The federal–provincial–territorial table on low-carbon fuels is already established, and it is the next critical step to align long-term policies that keep Canadian biofuel production stable, thriving, and anchored in Canada, rather than leaving Canada’s supply and competitiveness exposed to foreign policy decisions.

“Provinces have a central role to play in ensuring Canada remains attractive for capital investments in biofuel production, feedstock processing, and renewable fuel infrastructure, while ensuring that farmers and rural communities capture the long-term jobs, revenues, and value-added benefits these supply chains generate.

“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association encourages provinces and territories to engage actively at the federal-provincial-territorial table to deliver durable, long-term investment-ready solutions. Coordinated policy action will protect existing facilities, attract new capital, and keep biofuel investment and production in Canada.

“Today’s implementation is important groundwork, and the focus now must be on durable policy frameworks that allow the sector to grow.”

Winners and Losers in the Low-Cost Era In this environment, the clear winners are the ""low-cost leaders"" who can remain profitable even at depressed price levels.
Summary and Investor Takeaways The global commodity market of 2026 is defined by a fierce battle for dominance in a low-margin world.","As the world rings in 2026, the global commodity markets are locked in a baffling contradiction. Despite a four-year downward trend that has pushed the broad commodity index to six-year lows, production levels for everything from crude oil to battery metals are reaching historic highs. This ""Production Paradox"" is reshaping the global economy, as major producers choose to defend market share and leverage low-cost efficiencies rather than curb supply to support prices.

The immediate implications are a boon for consumers and manufacturers, who are enjoying the lowest input costs since the pre-pandemic era. However, for the commodity giants and the nations that depend on them, the environment has become a brutal ""survival of the fittest."" With Brent crude hovering near $60 per barrel and agricultural surpluses mounting, the market is bracing for a year where volume is the only shield against vanishing margins.

The Race to the Bottom: A Timeline of the 2026 Glut

The current state of oversupply did not happen overnight. It is the culmination of a multi-year investment cycle that began in 2022 and 2023, when record-high prices incentivized massive capital expenditures in new extraction technologies and expanded acreage. By late 2024, these projects began coming online just as global demand—particularly from a slowing Chinese industrial sector—started to cool. Throughout 2025, the World Bank and IMF recorded a 7% annual decline in commodity prices, a trend that is forecasted to repeat in 2026.

Key players in this drama include the OPEC+ alliance, which has struggled to maintain production discipline in the face of surging output from non-member nations. The United States and Guyana have emerged as the primary disruptors in the energy sector, with the U.S. Permian Basin reaching unprecedented efficiency levels. Meanwhile, in the metals sector, Indonesia and China have aggressively expanded nickel and lithium processing capacities, deliberately maintaining high output to crash prices and drive higher-cost Western competitors out of the market. This ""Strategic Market Share Defense"" has left the market in a state of bearish stability, where supply remains stubbornly high despite the lack of a price floor.

Winners and Losers in the Low-Cost Era

In this environment, the clear winners are the ""low-cost leaders"" who can remain profitable even at depressed price levels. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) stands at the forefront of this group. By leveraging its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and its advantaged assets in Guyana, ExxonMobil has lowered its breakeven costs to near $30 per barrel. While other energy firms are slashing dividends, ExxonMobil is entering 2026 with a plan to return $20 billion to shareholders, proving that in a low-price world, scale and efficiency are the ultimate competitive advantages.

Conversely, companies like Albemarle (NYSE: ALB) are in a defensive crouch. As the global leader in lithium, Albemarle has been forced to slash its capital expenditure by 65% over the last two years to preserve cash. While they remain a ""strategic survivor"" due to their high-quality assets in Nevada and Australia, the current glut has forced them to move away from fixed-price contracts to dynamic pricing models, hoping to capture any sudden 2026 rebounds. In the agricultural space, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) is navigating thin margins by pivoting toward the ""Bioeconomy."" ADM is restructuring to exit low-margin animal nutrition segments and focusing on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks, a move intended to create value-added premiums over traditional, oversupplied grain trading.

The Wider Significance: Geopolitics and the ""Dark Fleet""

The 2026 commodity landscape is not just about supply and demand; it is a mirror of a fragmenting geopolitical order. The persistence of high production is increasingly seen as a tool of economic warfare. By keeping prices low, dominant producers like Indonesia (in nickel) and the U.S. (in oil) are effectively ""starving"" competitors who lack the same subsidies or geological advantages. This trend fits into a broader movement toward ""re-globalization,"" where supply chains are being rerouted to avoid tariff volatility and geopolitical chokepoints.

Furthermore, the rise of the ""Dark Fleet""—a shadow network of tankers carrying sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran—continues to distort market signals. These ""ghost supplies"" keep global inventories higher than official data suggests, complicating the efforts of regulators and central banks to manage inflation. Additionally, the maritime world is bracing for a permanent shift in logistics. With the Suez Canal and Red Sea remaining high-risk zones due to regional instability, shippers are now budgeting for the Cape of Good Hope route as a standard, adding significant lead times and costs that offset some of the benefits of lower commodity prices.

The 2026 Outlook: Shocks on the Horizon

Looking ahead, the primary risk to this era of abundance is a sudden, climate-driven supply shock. Predictive models for 2026 suggest a strong La Niña phase, which historically disrupts harvests in the U.S. Midwest and Brazil while causing flooding in Australian mines. While the market is currently oversupplied, a simultaneous failure in major agricultural and mining hubs could lead to ""localized scarcity"" and violent price spikes, catching over-leveraged buyers off guard.

In the short term, companies will likely continue their strategic pivots. We expect to see more ""green steel"" initiatives from miners like Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), which is preparing to ship the first major commercial volumes from its Simandou project in Guinea this year. This high-grade iron ore is essential for low-carbon manufacturing, representing a shift from volume-based growth to ""purity-based"" growth. The challenge for 2026 will be managing the transition from a period of glut to a future where supply is increasingly dictated by carbon footprints and geopolitical alignment.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The global commodity market of 2026 is defined by a fierce battle for dominance in a low-margin world. The ""Production Paradox"" has created a landscape where the strongest players are doubling down on output to squeeze out the weak. For investors, the key takeaway is that ""low-cost"" is no longer just a buzzword; it is a prerequisite for survival. The era of high-beta commodity plays is over, replaced by a focus on operational excellence and balance sheet strength.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by extreme sensitivity to supply chain disruptions and climate events. Investors should watch for the impact of La Niña on grain prices and any further escalation in trade tariffs that could disrupt the flow of battery metals. While the headline prices remain low, the underlying volatility remains high, making 2026 a year for cautious, quality-focused investing in the resource sector.

SAF là sản phẩm được nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất của BSR phối trộn từ cấu tử bền vững (SBC/Neat SAF) và Jet A-1, phát triển trên cơ sở tiêu chuẩn xăng máy bay Jet A-1 theo tiêu chuẩn kỹ thuật cho nhiên liệu tuabine hàng không chứa hydrocarbon tổng hợp (tiêu chuẩn ASTM D-7566), đảm bảo chất lượng cho động cơ turbine hàng không.

Đây cũng là sản phẩm nằm trong danh mục sản phẩm chủ lực của Petrovietnam và khẳng định quyết tâm của Petrovietnam trong triển khai Nghị quyết số 57-NQ/TW ngày 22/12/2024 của Bộ Chính trị “về đột phá phát triển khoa học, công nghệ, đổi mới sáng tạo và chuyển đổi số quốc gia”. BSR tự hào là một trong những đơn vị tiên phong triển khai thương mại hóa SAF, hướng tới cung cấp giải pháp năng lượng sạch cho các hãng hàng không trong nước và quốc tế, -ông Nguyễn Việt Thắng nhấn mạnh.

Theo ông Hoàng Thanh Sơn - Trưởng ban Nghiên cứu Phát triển BSR, sản phẩm SAF của BSR đã được tổ chức SGS Germany GmbH (Đức) cấp 2 chứng nhận quan trọng gồm ISCC CORSIA và ISCC EU, xác nhận đạt tiêu chuẩn quốc tế trong phối trộn, sản xuất, lưu trữ và thương mại sản phẩm SAF. Việc sở hữu chứng nhận ISCC giúp BSR đủ điều kiện xuất khẩu sản phẩm SAF ra thị trường quốc tế, đặc biệt là thị trường EU - nơi có các quy định nghiêm ngặt nhất về phát thải và năng lượng tái tạo. Chứng nhận cũng là minh chứng cho nỗ lực của BSR trong việc đáp ứng các tiêu chuẩn sản xuất xanh, bền vững và có trách nhiệm với môi trường, là lợi thế để công ty mở rộng hợp tác và ký kết hợp đồng thương mại với các đối tác yêu cầu cao về tính bền vững. Ngoài ra, sản phẩm SAF cũng được BSR hoàn thiện đầy đủ tài liệu kỹ thuật, quy trình sản xuất, pha chế nội bộ và tiêu chuẩn cơ sở TCCS 23:2024-BSR. BSR đã phối hợp chặt chẽ với Công ty TNHH MTV Nhiên liệu Hàng không Việt Nam (Skypec), các hãng hàng không và đơn vị vận chuyển để thiết lập chuỗi cung ứng SAF khép kín đầu tiên tại Việt Nam, từ nhập khẩu nguyên liệu, phối trộn, kiểm soát chất lượng đến cung ứng cho các công ty nhiên liệu hàng không và cấp phát cho các chuyến bay nội địa, quốc tế. Theo kế hoạch, BSR sẽ triển khai sản xuất các lô SAF quy mô lớn hơn và tiến tới thương mại hóa trong thời gian tới, ông Hoàng Thanh Sơn cho biết.

Theo ông Cao Tuấn Sĩ, Giám đốc nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất, nhiên liệu SAF đã được Vietnam Airlines bay thử 1 chuyến Đà Nẵng ra Hà Nội thành công. Hiện BSR đang phối hợp với các bên, tập trung nghiên cứu để hạ giá thành sản phẩm.

Cùng với triển khai sản phẩm nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, BSR cũng sẽ xuất bán sản phẩm xăng sinh học E10RON95 vào ngày 1/6/2026 tới đây. Để đảm bảo nguyên liệu cồn sinh học ethanol cho pha chế xăng sinh học E10RON95 theo quy định với nhu cầu dự kiến khoảng 300 nghìn m3/tháng, BSR sẽ tăng cường mua cồn Ethanol từ các nhà máy sản xuất cồn sinh học trong nước, nhất là từ các nhà máy trong hệ thống của Công ty Cổ phần Đồng Xanh, ngoài ra sẽ nhập khẩu nếu thiếu.

Ngoài ra, sản phẩm E10RON95 của BSR sẽ được phối trộn thêm các phụ gia để chống phân tách lớp, đảm bảo chất lượng sản phẩm theo Quy chuẩn Việt Nam (QCVN). Hiện BSR cũng đang phối hợp với các bên để sớm khởi động lại Nhà máy nhiên liệu sinh học Dung Quất, nhằm chủ động một phần nguồn nguyên liệu tại chỗ cồn Ethanol phục vụ pha chế xăng E10RON95.

*Chuyển đổi số để nâng cao sức cạnh tranh Cùng với chuyển đổi xanh, BSR đang đẩy mạnh triển khai chuyển đổi số, lấy trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) và mô hình nhà máy thông minh làm hạt nhân để nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh và phát triển bền vững. Theo đại diện BSR, việc tiến tới mô hình nhà máy thông minh tại BSR không chỉ là xu hướng mà còn là nhu cầu cấp bách để thực hiện quản trị biến động, từ đó giúp phản ứng nhanh với sự thay đổi của giá dầu thô, sản phẩm và nhu cầu thị trường. Bên cạnh đó, việc tiến tới nhà máy thông minh còn giúp BSR tối ưu hóa vận hành ở công suất cao, đa dạng hóa các loại dầu thô mới đầu vào và giảm tiêu thụ năng lượng, giảm phát thải. Ngoài ra, việc số hóa này còn giúp giải quyết vấn đề già hóa máy móc và nhân sự bằng cách số hóa tri thức, hỗ trợ ra quyết định nhanh chóng và chính xác cũng như giúp ngăn ngừa các sự cố dừng máy ngoài kế hoạch và đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn thiết bị. Để hiện thực hóa mục tiêu chuyển đổi số, BSR đã thành lập Ban Chỉ đạo Chuyển đổi số, phê duyệt Chiến lược phát triển khoa học công nghệ đến năm 2030 và thành lập phòng Chuyển đổi số chuyên trách. Công ty đã triển khai kết nối dữ liệu giữa hệ thống vận hành (OT) và công nghệ thông tin (IT), tạo ra nguồn dữ liệu duy nhất, chuẩn hóa và bảo mật. Đây chính là ""nhiên liệu"" đầu vào cho các ứng dụng AI. Theo ông Cao Tuấn Sĩ, BSR đã ứng dụng các công cụ như PI Vision và Power BI để theo dõi tổng thể nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất, cảnh báo sớm các bất thường và quản trị các công tác bảo dưỡng, chống ăn mòn theo thời gian thực. Nhờ quản trị số, BSR đã duy trì vận hành các phân xưởng ở công suất cao (CDU 118%, RFCC 110%), góp phần tăng doanh thu thêm khoảng 1.540 tỷ đồng. Trong giai đoạn tới, BSR tập trung vào các bài toán AI chuyên sâu để chuyển từ vận hành phản ứng sang quản lý chủ động: Sử dụng AI/ Machine Learning (học máy) để dự báo hỏng hóc cho các thiết bị quan trọng và ăn mòn đỉnh tháp; ứng dụng mô hình Bản sao số (digital Twin) cho các phân xưởng quan trọng nhằm tối ưu hóa vận hành và tiến tới mô hình số hóa toàn diện nhà máy. BSR cũng đặt mục tiêu hình thành trung tâm vận hành số hợp nhất (UDOC) trên cơ sở tích hợp dữ liệu từ sản xuất đến quản trị doanh nghiệp (tài chính, nhân sự, chuỗi cung ứng) trên một nền tảng duy nhất, từ đó giúp lãnh đạo ra quyết định dựa trên phân tích dữ liệu chuyên sâu. Với phương châm ""dữ liệu là nền tảng, AI là công cụ, và quản trị hiệu quả là mục tiêu cuối cùng"", BSR đang từng bước hình thành hệ sinh thái quản trị thông minh, sẵn sàng cho các mục tiêu phát triển bền vững và hội nhập quốc tế, đại diện BSR cho biết. Năm 2025, BSR đã vận hành nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất an toàn, ổn định với công suất bình quân quy đổi lên tới 120%. Công ty cũng tận dụng hiệu quả “cửa sổ cơ hội” khi giá dầu thô giảm trong khi giá sản phẩm không giảm tương ứng, thậm chí có thời điểm đi ngược chiều, qua đó tối ưu hóa biên lợi nhuận. Đặc biệt, BSR chủ động điều hành sản xuất và tiêu thụ bám sát các kịch bản sản xuất kinh doanh được xây dựng và cập nhật thường xuyên theo diễn biến giá dầu và crack spread, từ đó linh hoạt điều chỉnh công suất, gia tăng tồn kho chiến lược và đẩy mạnh tiêu thụ khi thị trường thuận lợi. Nhờ vậy, BSR ước đạt sản lượng 7.907.293 tấn, tương đương 108% kế hoạch quản trị; doanh thu đạt 142.800 tỷ đồng; lợi nhuận trước thuế đạt 4.700 tỷ đồng; nộp ngân sách nhà nước 14.300 tỷ đồng. Những con số này tiếp tục khẳng định vai trò then chốt của BSR trong phát triển kinh tế địa phương cũng như đóng góp vào an ninh năng lượng quốc gia. Với kết quả sản xuất kinh doanh vượt trội, năm 2025, BSR được Petrovietnam vinh danh là đơn vị hoàn thành toàn diện kế hoạch quản trị, đồng thời lọt Top 7 thương hiệu lớn nhất thị trường niêm yết theo bình chọn của Forbes Việt Nam. Đây là sự ghi nhận xứng đáng cho chiến lược vận hành hiệu quả, tư duy quản trị linh hoạt và năng lực cạnh tranh ngày càng được nâng cao của doanh nghiệp.

The recognition underlines the depth of regional cooperation at a time when the island nation faced one of its deadliest climate disasters in recent years.

Recognition by Sri Lanka Navy

The Sri Lanka Navy honoured eight foreign naval vessels, including two from India, for providing immediate assistance after Cyclone Ditwah struck in late November. Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya personally conveyed gratitude to diplomatic representatives of the assisting countries. The cyclone triggered widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse, overwhelming national disaster-response systems.

Role of Indian Naval Assets

Indian Navy ships INS Vikrant and INS Udayagiri were among the first foreign vessels to respond. Both ships were initially in Sri Lankan waters to participate in the International Fleet Review 2025 marking the navy’s 75th anniversary. Following the cyclone’s landfall on November 27, these vessels were swiftly redeployed for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.

Operation Sagar Bandhu and Relief Scale

India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu on the very day Cyclone Ditwah made landfall. The mission delivered more than 1,100 tonnes of relief material, including food rations, tents, tarpaulins, clothing, hygiene kits, and water purification equipment. Around 14.5 tonnes of medicines and medical equipment were supplied, along with an additional 60 tonnes of logistical support material. Helicopters deployed from INS Vikrant played a key role in aerial rescue and supply drops.

Beberapa waktu belakangan, penulis kerap bepergian ke berbagai destinasi wisata di Indonesia, sebuah kebiasaan yang menjadi titik balik reflektif mendalam. Sebagai traveler yang sejak kecil menjelajahi dunia, penulis dulu jarang nikmati keindahan negeri sendiri.

Belakangan apresiasi terhadap Indonesia tumbuh pesat. Siapa sangka, wisata lokal menghasilkan emisi karbon lebih rendah, mendukung masyarakat setempat, sekaligus memacu produk domestik bruto (PDB) nasional.

Pengalaman bepergian ini bukan sekadar liburan, melainkan mata air awal penulisan ini dalam membedah paradoks pariwisata kita: wisata bisa jadi pilar ketiga keberlanjutan, ekonomi, sosial, lingkungan, jika dikelola benar.

Wisata meningkatkan PDB, tapi dampak lingkungannya merusak. Destinasi seperti Bali dan Labuan Bajo (Nusa Tenggara Timur) yang diwarnai overtourism mengalami erosi pantai, kerusakan terumbu karang, dan sumber daya alam menipis. Penulis yakin implementasi kebijakan wisata lokal yang tepat bisa memacu ekonomi sekaligus menjaga lingkungan dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan sosial.

Praktik baik sudah ada. Stasiun pengisian ulang botol air minum telah tersedia di Bandara Internasional Soekarno-Hatta Tangerang dan Bandara Internasional I Gusti Ngurah Rai Badung. Hal tersebut mendukung reuse daripada plastik sekali pakai.

Penulis menyarankan agar praktik tersebut diperluas ke stasiun kereta, terminal bus, dan pelabuhan. Selama bepergian dua bulan terakhir, penulis menginap di resor yang mana ada penanaman sayur dan buah sendiri, mengurangi emisi GHG transportasi.

Sheraton Belitung Resort misalnya memperoleh Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) dari PLN pada Mei 2024. Mereka merupakan resor pertama Bangka Belitung di mana sebagian besar energinya berasal dari sumber terbarukan. Mereka menggunakan pasir berpori penyerap air hujan untuk lantai, sebuah langkah yang berkontribusi mengurangi kebutuhan pembersih kimia.

Selain itu, Dialoog Banyuwangi telah menerapkan inisiatif farm-to-table melalui kebun organiknya sendiri, di mana sayur dan rempah segar langsung dipanen untuk restoran. Langkah tersebut mengurangi jejak karbon transportasi makanan dan mendukung pertanian lokal berkelanjutan.

Sayangnya implementasi masih minim. Hanya segelintir resor yang menerapkan langkah tersebut. Stasiun refill belum merata. Pemerintah wajib mendorong resor dan Airbnb memisahkan sampah tamu, beri insentif pajak bagi yang membangun desain bersertifikat berkelanjutan serta transisi ke energi terbarukan.

Pemerintah juga wajib mewajibkan analisis siklus hidup (life-cycle analysis) pada operasional mereka untuk meminimalkan limbah dan emisi. Selain itu, kolaborasi dengan agen travel bagikan ""sustainable travel kit"" seperti reusable cotton pads, gelas tahan lama, kurangi plastik sekali pakai dan sikat gigi disposable.

Luncurkan program ""Refill Cup Favoritmu"" diskon minuman bagi wisatawan yang membawa gelas sendiri di setiap stasiun transportasi umum. Pemerintah juga harus mewajibkan industri hotel dan Airbnb merilis laporan dampak transparan setiap tahun.

Pemerintah jangan melewatkan momentum emas ini! Kebijakan tegas wisata berkelanjutan bukan beban, melainkan investasi cerdas memacu PDB, menciptakan lapangan kerja lokal, dan menjaga warisan alam untuk generasi mendatang.

Penulis memiliki keyakinan penuh kalau Indonesia bisa menjadi destinasi wisata hijau dunia jika bergerak dari sekarang. Pembaca CNBC Indonesia, saatnya mendukung revolusi ini!

A ideia de desenvolvimento com foco na sustentabilidade — economia limpa (de baixo carbono), produção responsável e consumo consciente dos recursos — vem sendo utilizada como promotora de um novo projeto de sociedade, mais eficiente e responsável, capaz de garantir, no presente e no futuro, as mesmas chances de crescimento, porém dentro de novas oportunidades de exploração econômica, sem comprometer a manutenção dos serviços prestados pela natureza. Exatamente o que estamos prestes a vivenciar por aqui.

O Rio Grande do Sul vem experimentando eventos climáticos extremos de toda ordem, desde secas recorrentes até chuvas volumosas, seguidas de granizo e ventos intensos. Um cenário assustador, de prejuízos e perdas incalculáveis, que somente poderá ser revertido a partir de um novo modelo de desenvolvimento econômico, verde e sustentável.

Na Zona Sul, projetam-se iniciativas que devem mudar nossa realidade econômica a partir do próximo ano: investimentos bilionários em logística, energia e indústria, especialmente na indústria naval e em atividades relacionadas à cadeia produtiva do agronegócio. São iniciativas que nos conectam diretamente à corrida global pela descarbonização das atividades econômicas.

A conversão da Refinaria Riograndense, em Rio Grande, na primeira biorrefinaria do país é o melhor exemplo dessa mudança. Trata-se de um investimento de US$ 1 bilhão, com impacto direto na cadeia produtiva de grãos oleaginosos. Um projeto inovador que abre novas oportunidades no campo, seja pela necessidade de adoção de práticas mais sustentáveis de manejo e conservação do solo e da água — impulsionadas pelas exigências de certificação e de acesso ao mercado internacional —, seja pela qualificação da cadeia de insumos, dos serviços, da rede de cerealistas e das esmagadoras de grãos, responsáveis pela produção de óleos estabilizados destinados à fabricação de combustíveis verdes: gasolina, diesel, solventes, gás e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel — combustível sustentável de aviação), considerado o mais valioso dos combustíveis e a principal medida de descarbonização do setor aéreo para a redução de emissões e o combate às mudanças climáticas.

Outra grande oportunidade que se avizinha é a geração eólica offshore — energia gerada pelo vento no oceano —, que deverá nos apresentar uma oferta de energia nunca vista, muito além da nossa demanda atual. Esse cenário certamente atrairá novos investimentos para a região: indústrias e novas cadeias de negócios que ainda irão nos descobrir a partir da oferta abundante de energia e da posição logística estratégica, com conexões com o interior do país e com o mundo. Uma perspectiva que, aos poucos, vem sendo confirmada pelos investimentos já anunciados e por outros que devem chegar em breve.

A partir da geração offshore, será possível avançar na produção de hidrogênio verde, incluindo o desenvolvimento da indústria do oxigênio. Com hidrogênio disponível, limpo e em abundância, o céu é o limite: abrem-se oportunidades para a produção de fertilizantes verdes, essenciais na cadeia de insumos de baixo carbono para a produção de combustíveis verdes. E, já que ao final do esmagamento de grãos oleaginosos o que sobra é uma grande quantidade de resíduos (farelo de alto poder proteico e sustentável), estes servem de base para dietas humanas (livres de proteína animal) ou para a produção de ração destinada ao gado confinado.

A pecuária gaúcha, que sempre esteve em destaque no cenário nacional, pode estar próxima de viver uma nova realidade, juntamente com outras fontes de proteína animal, como frango e suínos, ainda pouco desenvolvidas na região: uma vantagem estratégica de reposicionamento no mercado como carne verde, produzida em sistemas de baixa emissão de gases de efeito estufa (GEE), com maior valor agregado e voltada a um público consumidor exigente, especialmente o mercado internacional futuro.

Por outro lado, não será preciso esperar tanto, pois já existe um forte interesse em investir aqui, certamente guiado pela nossa vantagem logística e pelo potencial de geração de energia: o investimento do grupo espanhol Cobra Brasil, de cerca de R$ 6 bilhões, em uma unidade de geração termelétrica, que deverá consumir 5,5 milhões de metros cúbicos de gás natural por dia e gerar 1.200 megawatts de energia. O gás natural, apesar de ser uma fonte fóssil, é menos poluente e essencial como combustível de transição, atuando como ponte para fontes mais limpas e sustentáveis; o investimento de R$ 1,5 bilhão da joint venture entre CMPC Celulose e Neltume Ports para a implantação de um novo terminal portuário. O projeto prevê a construção de dois berços de atracação para navios, dois berços para barcaças e um armazém com capacidade para armazenar 190 mil toneladas de celulose; o investimento de R$ 110 milhões anunciado pela Fontes Verdes, empresa paulista que atua há 15 anos no mercado de hidrogênio e amônia verdes, que avalia o início de suas operações no segundo semestre de 2026; o anúncio do Governo Federal da construção de cinco navios gaseiros no Estaleiro Rio Grande e da passagem seca para São José do Norte…

Um ano que promete ser marcado por boas notícias e novidades, como a produção de etanol de arroz, possivelmente a única alternativa capaz de oferecer a esse tradicional e importante ativo agrícola uma nova rota de utilização, agregando valor, propósito e sustentabilidade à cadeia de negócios.

Vamos trabalhar muito. Feliz Ano Novo!",https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/static/images/share.jpg?w=1200&h=675&a=c&version=1575255600,N,,2026-01-01 08:13:05.942863

The facility turns waste fats, including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil, into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.
Its plants in Louisiana and Texas produce about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel annually, with production of aviation fuel starting in December 2024.
Backman-Flamerich said current aviation fuel made from waste relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding concerns about growing crops specifically for fuel.
The growing link between poultry production, waste processing and aviation shows how byproducts from one industry can become valuable inputs for another, reducing waste while supporting emission cuts.","United Airlines is turning to waste fats from poultry production as part of its efforts to meet long-term climate goals, with sustainable aviation fuel playing a growing role in its plans to cut emissions, reports WattPoultry.

The airline aims to reduce carbon pollution per passenger seat by 50 per cent by 2035 compared with 2019 levels and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Sustainable aviation fuel is expected to deliver a significant share of these reductions, accounting for about 17 per cent of the airline’s path to net zero through fuels already in use.

Speaking at the US Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs annual meeting, held alongside the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit, United’s senior manager for environmental sustainability, Ryan Backman-Flamerich, said most of the company’s emissions come directly from burning jet fuel. He noted that fuel use from aircraft engines makes up about 98 per cent of the airline’s total emissions.

Aviation currently produces about 3 per cent of global emissions, but that share is expected to rise as other sectors cut pollution more quickly. Backman-Flamerich said that while industries such as power generation are reducing emissions, aviation must move faster or risk becoming a larger part of the global problem even if its own emissions fall.

A key part of United’s strategy involves working with Darling Ingredients, a company that processes animal byproducts and operates Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture with Valero. The facility turns waste fats, including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil, into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

Darling Ingredients’ director of sustainability, Ethan Carter, said the company processes nearly 1.5 million tonnes of low-emission raw materials each year for biofuel production. Its plants in Louisiana and Texas produce about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel annually, with production of aviation fuel starting in December 2024.

Carter said the process ensures that animal byproducts are fully used, helping the poultry and food industries reduce waste while supporting cleaner fuel production. He added that most of the fats collected in North America, including poultry fat, are sent to Diamond Green Diesel for conversion into renewable fuels.

He acknowledged that poultry fat can be more difficult to process due to higher levels of impurities, meaning it cannot be used on its own. However, he said it can still be blended and successfully processed at the facility.

Backman-Flamerich said current aviation fuel made from waste relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding concerns about growing crops specifically for fuel. He added that the industry is still far from reaching the limits of this fuel technology, leaving room for further growth.

Carter said closer links across the supply chain allow companies to expand production and help customers meet their climate targets.

The growing link between poultry production, waste processing and aviation shows how byproducts from one industry can become valuable inputs for another, reducing waste while supporting emission cuts. Backman-Flamerich said progress depends on cooperation across the entire aviation supply chain, including fuel producers and agricultural partners.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2026-01-01 05:11:43.044172

The test, conducted on December 30, 2025, clears the enhanced stage for induction into upcoming SSLV flight missions and strengthens India’s launch-on-demand capability.

Successful Static Firing at Sriharikota

According to “Indian Space Research Organisation”, the static ground test of the improved SS3 motor was carried out at the Solid Motor Static Test Facility of the “Satish Dhawan Space Centre”. The motor was fired for 108 seconds, with all performance parameters closely matching pre-test predictions. The SS3 stage is the uppermost solid stage of SSLV and is critical for imparting the required velocity to place satellites into orbit.

Key Design Upgrades and Payload Gain

A major enhancement in the upgraded SS3 motor is the introduction of a carbon-epoxy composite motor case, replacing the earlier configuration. This redesign has significantly reduced the inert mass of the stage, resulting in a payload gain of about 90 kg for the SSLV. The third stage alone delivers velocities of up to 4 km per second. Additional improvements have been made to the igniter and nozzle systems to enhance efficiency, robustness, and overall performance margins while retaining reliability.

Advanced Control and Monitoring Systems

During the test, the SS3 motor was instrumented with around 233 sensors to monitor pressure, thrust, temperature, vibration, and the behaviour of control electronics and actuators. Nozzle control is achieved through a fault-tolerant electro-mechanical actuation system supported by low-power control electronics. Isro stated that these upgrades collectively strengthen operational efficiency and mission assurance for future SSLV launches.

Imporatnt Facts for Exams

SSLV is a three-stage, all-solid launch vehicle designed for rapid launch readiness.

The SS3 is the uppermost stage and provides up to 4 km/s velocity.

Carbon-epoxy composite motor cases reduce inert mass and increase payload.

Boost to Indigenous Manufacturing and Capacity

The high-strength carbon filament-wound motor case was developed at the Composites Entity of the “Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre”, while casting of the solid motor was carried out at SDSC facilities. The test follows Isro’s recent expansion of solid motor production infrastructure, including new facilities at Sriharikota, a second ammonium perchlorate production line at Alwaye, and commissioning of an indigenous 10-tonne vertical mixer.

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.
Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.
Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.

However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with production rising to 2.4m tonnes.

Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.

At current price levels, the SAF premium is expected to translate into an additional $3.6bn in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

IATA said the estimated SAF output for 2025 represents a downward revision from earlier forecasts, citing a lack of policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacity.

At the same time, SAF prices exceed those of fossil-based jet fuel by around a factor of two, and by up to five times in markets where mandates apply, the association said.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that “SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry”.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” he said, adding that if the objective was to increase SAF production and support aviation decarbonisation, regulators needed to “learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work”.

Against this backdrop, IATA was sharply critical of SAF mandates introduced in the European Union and the United Kingdom, arguing that they have failed to accelerate production while significantly increasing costs for airlines.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation framework has pushed costs higher amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.

Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to the extent that airlines are paying up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, IATA said, without guaranteed supply or consistent documentation.

In the UK, the SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the financial burden.

As a result, airlines paid a cumulative premium of $2.9bn for the limited 1.9m tonnes of SAF available in 2025, according to IATA.

Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Walsh said, noting that while the European Commission’s recent Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) announcement was a step forward, it lacked a clear timeline.

Turning to the impact on airline climate commitments, IATA warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production capacity would force many carriers to review their targets.

“Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments,” Walsh said, adding that SAF was “not being produced in sufficient amounts” to enable airlines to achieve those ambitions. He said the commitments had been made in good faith but “simply cannot be delivered”.

Looking ahead, IATA cautioned against repeating the same policy mistakes as mandates for synthetic aviation fuels, or e-SAF, approach in the UK in 2028 and in the EU in 2030.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.

Without strong production incentives rather than mandates, IATA said supply would fall short of targets.

Under the current policy framework, compliance costs could rise to as much as €29bn by 2032 if targets are not met, which the association said was likely.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist said that “Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.”

She said regulators must “course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down”, adding that mandates had “done just the opposite” and that it was “outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates”.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/airplane-air-travel-aviation-aeroplane-flying.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 01:11:53.902841
